I find it enjoyable to design ship with different sizes, stack it with weapons and devices, then send it to battle.

There's a bit short coming when the game doesn't have a clear objective. Once you get more ore than your need, build the biggest ship that you wish, there no campaign or end game content aside from doing some contracts given by base station around the system. That unless you play with scenarios, mods, or someone organized servers. That's fine since this game is more of a sandbox than an open world RPG.

In term of mod, there's plenty in workshop for you to try. You can download new blocks, more game contents or other player's ship/station blueprints for your use. Although, the game kind of heavy in term of ram should you install too many mods or GPU should you have too many objects in one place.

Verified? It simply means I've made sure everything is still accurate.

There are already high-quality reviews that do a great job of discussing the solid reasons of why you should not get Space Engineers, so I'm not making one myself, but making sure my input counts. Simple as that.

I know your looking for a a idea of my opinion, as well as the state of the game. Please see the reviews of, Snow, and TJ_Taz. They might not be the best in detail, but certainly are *Hopefully* the least in potential provoking reviews that still do a good explanation.
Here's some conveniently placed links to mentioned reviews:
Snow: https://steamcommunity.com/id/kibbewater/recommended/244850/
TJ_Taz : https://steamcommunity.com/id/TJ_Taz/recommended/244850/

I'd also like to add to some reviews just a little bit:
Snow: Individually any one DLC might not be too much, but if you elect not to buy them for *insert your own reason here* - having discovered some of the more darker secrets of Keen, in my case - you miss out big time. Though if you do own the game, by my experience, eventually your hand will be forced due to the heavy limitations of zero DLC bought. (Mods will mitigate what I describe to a extent, I mean, just look at the ""hours at review time"")

Keen's current approach to the game's ongoing development is as follows:
[b][i]""Here you go, take these lite-versions of my in-engine development tools and this handful of stock/free assets that I've cobbled loosely together with some spaghetti code, and knock yourselves out. That'll be $20 - oh, and you can expect regular $5 DLCs accompanying minor 'updates' half a dozen times a year, with each containing more low-effort content alongside increasingly-annoying limits to your gameplay options if you don't pay [strike]the ransom[/strike] up. [u]You're welcome![/u]""[/i][/b]

Yhe vast majority of Space Engineers' new official blocks and block variants—i.e. its creative opportunities—remain gated behind the cost of its current and future paid DLCs. 

[h1]""Strictly cosmetic DLCs,"" my space-blistered engineer's posterior.[/h1]

The shill echo chamber claiming that these DLCs are ""optional""—meaning that their content has a strictly cosmetic impact on gameplay—have either genuinely never bothered to compare them to vanilla assets, don't actually play this game enough to have noticed the functional differences, or are just THAT level of moron. (Yeah, you know the tier I'm talking about!)

[h1]Don't support Keen's predatory monetization strategies.[/h1]


[hr][/hr]
I actually have nearly 800 hours played in this game all in all, and I'd love to be able to recommend it, but the vast majority of my time invested was pre-release - before Keen went apesh!t and ruined it by making us pay for every tiny little thing (and then started calling those ""content updates""). As it is now, once you purchase the game you then need to spend an additional ~$70 (as of 2024) or so just to avoid missing out on CURRENT critical DLC functionality (i.e. blocks) with no substitute or alternative in the base game. A year from now, there'll be more to spend. Worse even than the simple fact of core features released as paid DLC, [b]many of these functional DLC blocks are ones that the community had been requesting for years in order to address major inconveniences, absences and/or outright bugs with the original block-set[/b]; those inconveniences, bugs, missing and broken features still exist in the base game - and if you want the quality of life fixes/patches for them, Keen wants you to pay for them. Want blocks with totally different connection/conveyor points? You get to pay for those, too. There are now many, many things—practical, sensible constructs that most creative people will think of eventually—that you just cannot build without those DLC blocks. 

Beyond being a shitty way for Keen to treat a community that has overwhelmingly supported them for such a long time, it's also completely unethical. 

But wait - there's more.

[u]Some of the content currently gated behind paid DLC was once native to the original game[/u]. Under the guise of ""retiring"" blocks, or removing them for ""performance issues"" or ""more testing,"" many old blocks (most of which worked as well as anything else for years) are suddenly reappearing in DLCs - sometimes very minimally reskinned, but in many cases straight out of our old early access screenshots. [b][u]This is absolutely unacceptable![/u][/b]

IF you can get the base game AND all functional DLC for about $20 total on a steep sale, I'd say it's worth [b]considering[/b] it (especially now that SE's closest competitor, Empyrion, has been acquired/ruined by Funcom) - but keep in mind that whenever the next (significant) content patches drop, they'll ALWAYS be gated behind yet another paywall. As long as we keep paying, they'll keep doing it... so for the good of computer games everywhere, PLEASE don't encourage developers who take excessive advantage of their already-paying customer bases. Voice your concerns over their—and the industry's—recent shift toward anti-consumerism and unethical money-grubbing as a development ideology. 

Speak with your wallets, because money is the only language Keen cares about.",1626116543,1708472205,False,485,25,0.698705911636352539,0,True,False,False

You can make cool and amazing creations and stuff after that there is nothing to do. There is no real end game or challenges that you can apply to solve problems because in all reality  80 percent of creations address problems that are not there to be begin with.

Modders and scripters hold this boat together but sadly a lot of them are retiring or leaving. The developers have done nothing to address this issue besides some obscure social media posts talking about a new engine with actual water simulated. That is cool and all it does not address any of the issues of space engineers one. Even with modern hardware the game is not made to utilize it. There are a lot of performance issues still and while it was not as bad as it was 2013 its still there. Also the bugs like driving along in your rover and you hit a small bump and it sends your rover flying into sky only to land losing a bunch of shit. 

After visiting this with friends this game is just a glorified tech demo still after all these years. Even with the updates sure but at the end of the day once your done with your personal goals you realize that there is nothing but a dull and empty sandbox. Keen has had all this time and barely done much with it. In a sad sense it was to be expected like they did with Medieval Engineers. 

Actually given this studio history I am not surprised. They made a game that a lot of potential but they have wasted it. They let the community hold the fort and sat back making cosmetic DLC and barely fixing long standing issues that have plagued this game since its inception. To be expected since they abandon Medieval Engineers and still charge but have the community make the game  instead when they released dev tools. 

I would be surprised if they actually go all in for a space engineers 2 game but I high doubt given there history. Space Engineers 2 or any sequel if there is one will be one of low effort. Probably be the same dev cycle as this one. Take a every long time to fix things and add things into it. Make a lot cosmetic DLC and modders hold the fort.

The interface and workstations are unclear for refinement and assembly.
I suspect that with MANY hours, I could muck through the game's intentions and learn how to do things.
I do see the community is very helpful, and super supportive of new players.  That gave me hope!

However, even with nice people around, a game should not feel like working a second job with mandatory study hall and research time on the weekends.

This is just a sandbox style builder game with some physics.
Speaking of physics, flight controls and navigation are also not intuitive, and less than responsive.
Again, just a very sloppy game.  Not fun, hard to learn, goes no where.  
My leisure time was more like frustration.
If what you like to do in your free time is get frustrated by non-intuitive games while friendly people tell you it just takes time and cheer you on in social media?  Give this a try.

Whatever your preference, I highly recommend watching some gameplay content on Yewt Oob to see some of the cool vehicles the community has built!  It shows you the 'end game' perspective, which helped inform my decision to NOT dedicate much time into learning this game.

Do a custom game. Turn off progression unless you want to build a bunch things then grind them down just to farm up 'research'. You can't change game settings on a saved game unless it is creative mode, be aware of this. Save frequently, save so many back ups, do not try to ironman it. I built a lot without saving, 95% built my first vehicle that I fussed over for about an hour and a half, then when I left to go check something out it disappeared. There's a trash cleaning system that will do this if it is unpowered or whatever, you can change that in the admin settings, I haven't gotten around to trying it out because I just lost several hours of progress reloading my last save hoping that at least some of my admitted overly ambitious first vehicle would still be there and am sick of this.

How would I begin to describe my experience?
I'll start with a ""Well well wellllll..."" followed by :

Decent creative threshold. Has plenty of physics related content, oddities and block manipulation. 
Space travel? Oh my goodness. It took days on Xbox for me to not have anxiety and panic attacks floating in space. Hahaha, so sad.

I do have some issues I would like to bring forward, followed by some interesting ideas for new ingame content.

ISSUES :

Server lag : The monotonous building of large structures and massive ships is great except when players PC's have to communicate with servers, the information isn't always saved and bits and pieces of built structures vanish into thin air as if not built. Generally an issue when there is packet loss between player and server... You need to find a way to balance the communication... maybe decrease packet size to just binary information, orrr.... have players builds store data into packets that get sent to the server every 30 seconds to 20 minutes depending on server host options/choices.

Thrust Power : It is hard to determine exact thrust needed for leaving planetary surfaces to orbit and space. Each player should have a Calculator that is built in game that allows them to input block count, power source and weight and have the calculator display exactly which thrusters are needed for each type of use. It would be really cool to add a feature that allows players to have access to Engineering tables. Tables that allow defining timing, autonomy of thrusters and guns, shields and refills from a single spot (the way its currently displayed is just too much in such a small space).

Wolves : Great to add an NPC that is ""natural"" to earth like Planet, but they are really over powered. When you start earthside and you land near wolves, you have 0 hope of survival. the couple clips of ammo and pistol will kill 1 maybe 2 of the 5 wolves that attack you. An endless cycle of needless death.

Cave systems : They dont exist, which is strange because theyre more common in reality than the ores that exist... Kind of a bummer really.

Exploration : There is little to none. I mean that literally. The surfaces of all planets don't have anything worth exploring. There is no ancient buildings, crypts, crumbling civilizations... notta.

Escape Pods : For some strange reason they don't exist, even though in real space travel in the future escape pods will be a crucial element to survival and is on every ship in space.

Gravitational Fields and Stationary Objects : All planets and most objects with mass in space have a field of gravity. If you go to space, asteroids aren't stationary, not in the least. All things with mass attract smaller objects with smaller masses. I don't know the science behind it but its true.

Turning Asteroids into Moveable crafts : Yes this is an odd thing to point out... one that won't make much sense until you finish reading this. If an object in space is given thrust, even the tiniest amount, the object can be moved. I should be able to encase an asteroid 50% with blocks and throw thrusters onto it and move the asteroid where I want it.

Gear : For all the things that can be built, why can I not make my own gear? All the required things are already available, except for dyes...

Food : The good ole sustenance angle. YOU CAN NOT SURVIVE ANYTHING WITHOUT WATER AND FOOD.... a seriously crucial element left out of the game.

NPC's : The worst of the worst. They are over powered right away when they should be matching the players threat level and power.... They shouldnt have drone ships if I dont have one... Makes the game a little unbalanced.


Now for Ideas :

Ideas

Food
Crafting station that allows new suits to be built
Hydro dependencies for sustenance
Fire - for damage and for lighting sources and cooking
Floods
Extreme Weather Patterns or Extreme Storms
Alien life - come on you don't seriously believe humans are the only intelligence?
Warp Drives - DO NOT EXIST AND SHOULD NOT BE IN THIS GAME
Animals - not a lot just a few to bring more color, life and depth to survival

You can traverse planets and asteroids, mining wherever you go and building new ships along the way, experimenting with the technicalities of a ship (the inner workings).

Whilst I am by no means someone who has been as enthusiastic as the others from the get-go for this game and as a result haven't really necessarily played for long periods of time at once compared to others who play this, unfortunately by this point I can no longer really truly recommend this game to newcomers.

 Let me explain.

This game has been, for a surprising number of years, been on early access and has just recently within the last few years ""released"". This, in my mind is completely false as the game has multiple glaring flaws that shouldn't even exist for a released game.

First, the bugs.  Holy moly the bugs. I have multiple times, on occasion, locked myself inside a planet as a result of continuously voxel mining and end up inadvertently glitching myself through the terrain, preventing me from ever getting my stuff back (unless I want to mine the entire planet out). Pistons are often very glitchy and are at times unstable despite being probably one of the most important blocks in the game. They can cause builds to explode for little to no reason with sometimes no warning whatsoever (the only time you CAN tell is when they are behaving extremely erratic). I have also had issues with connectors causing buggy things to happen, specifically ships being rubberbanded back to them, at times even if they are seemingly miles away. Other times, with pressurizing rooms. Despite having situations where a room is fully repaired and sealed with blocks that don't have gaps as well as having sufficient oxygen in tanks as needed, vents will simply refuse to pressurize rooms with said oxygen for no apparent reason. I have tried several times to relog into a server or singleplayer world that had this issue and even tried grinding the vent block down and then replacing it yet (even putting it into a different area in the room) but it almost never worked to fix it.

These bugs have been reported to Keen through the support forums for years but every time they do get reports on the forums (which they get a lot of), they are disregarded/ignored pretty much completely and the original reports receiving replies from countless users have employees that seem to not even try to even solve the issue whatsoever as they continuously ask for information on the bug report stating they ""aren't able to reproduce the issue"" despite countless accounts from other players and multiple videos and world files clearly showing how to replicate the bugs and to this day are still left unresolved. Here is just one example: https://support.keenswh.com/spaceengineers/pc/topic/ship-rubber-bands-back-to-groundconnector

Secondly, the combat system. The combat system has been nearly nonexistent since the early access up until recently with the Warfare II update. They have for years, only have added a missile turret and gatling gun for use on ships. That's it. With the Warfare II update they added barely any more weaponry blocks than before and are nothing special (just a few minicannons and a railgun). If I recall correctly, there are less than 10 weaponry blocks to choose from unless you want to account for weapons created that abuses exploits created by the instability of pistons and other niche use cases such as using reactors as bombs. Personally speaking, if not for the modding community that has gone through so much effort to help the game blossom in its own terms, I find it highly unlikely the playerbase would be as large as it is right now. If you're able to without buying the game first, just take a look at the amount of mod support for weaponry for the game. Virtually pretty much half of the content is dedicated solely specifically for combat.

Lastly but not least, the diversity of things to do in the game. Unfortunately this is probably where the game fails the most in. The only real challenge the game presents you with when playing survival worlds/servers is landing on top of a planet, building a base and rocket through a large amount of effort and seemingly countless hours spent and then launching said rocket into space. Past this point, there is basically almost nothing to do besides mining asteroids or attempting to find a trading station to buy things (particularly zone chips for a safezone for your base) or raiding a pirate space station which are extremely hard to find. The only other raiding options are planetary installations which are more common, however severely lack in giving the player any real challenge and more often than not I have raced at them with just a hand grinder and multiple respawns, no ship needed. Past that, they don't even give much of a respectable amount of loot inside as the buildings are often quite small in size and lack much of a defense. The same can be said for pirate drones that spawn from space stations. They usually either have grinders or gatling guns to defend themselves and can spawn in packs but respawning with nothing but a grinder in hand and racing at them before they can kill you themselves is enough to defeat them if you know how to strafe enough with your jetpack. This makes arming a ship in the game basically completely pointless besides maybe killing annoying stragglers and completing escort missions from trade stations (which is probably the only actual challenge you will be getting when you launch a ship to space).  Everything interesting is few and far between and the only thing that actually saturates the whole area is asteroids. This is part of the reason why both players and ships are limited to in-game speeds below 125/ms. The only option to go any further is to use jump drives but the game forces you to go to a different planet/moon if you want to obtain the additional resources necessary to build one which doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Either that or you start on earth-likes moon and you get all of the resources needed, however it defeats the whole purpose of having other planets as an option to start on. The only real way to bypass these limitations or to just try to stay interested in the game enough to continue playing past this point is adding mods that add more content that just isn't really there to begin with such as Modular Encounters (an NPC related mod).

People often praise this game stating that things are working as intended, that waiting a bit for  monthly content that adds barely anything of notice is better than no game at all, excusing game-breaking bugs that have been ignored for years by Keen without being fixed whatsoever and defending the fact that half the content is locked behind a paywall. People often state that buying DLC for ""only a coffee cup's worth"" is fine and merely refusing to pay it means being a cheapskate but that statement simply does not hold water if said DLC adds up to cost about the same as an entirely new game.

If it's merely a sandbox game where you want to build in to your hearts content and simply nothing else, this game may be just what you want. But for those wishing for a survival experience, that of which many do indeed play, it disappointingly fails to meet expectations. 

I am almost certainly convinced that the majority of the community still playing this game are simply denying any of the flaws of this game, refusing to voice valid criticism that Keen seems so unwilling to listen to, because they are afraid of losing the possibility for the game to be actually finished from development one day when it has such an alluring and seemingly polished concept at first glance, fearing that it may end up as abandonware just like Medieval Engineers and Miner Wars 2081 did.

In short, do not buy this.",1601966916,1707720213,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have every DLC (aka we need money here are some cool block skins for 5 bucks, not really complaining I get it, SE 2 just better blow my mind). Do I like this game? Yes, and no... For the entirety of owning this game I have had a love hate relationship with it. The base game for what it is, is amazing, I personally have not found a better sandbox creative building physics game. If you like to build and problem solve it will engage you for hours however I have found that the base game lacks the engaging features it needs to keep it interesting. There are hardly any enemies and most of the time you must seek them out. The only real reason to go to space is for uranium, the planets all have the same ores to offer. There are space stations that offer random tasks to do like bringing them resources or escorting a transport etc. Other than that there's no real sense of adventure or danger. Thankfully there is a vast community of people much smarter than myself that create mods to make the game more enjoyable, although using too many or the wrong ones will significantly hinder your FPS. All things considered though, if you like space exploration and building I would highly recommend this game. 

If Keen reads this:
Your game has kept me entertained for hours, but as you read above it needs some work, and seeing comments on your updates I'm not the only one who thinks this. I stay up to date of on everything I can about SE 2, water is a great step it the right direction and the physics look like a lot of fun. I don;t know your plans but I would recommend a more engaging survival mode with more to do, fight and find. Also If it were a toggle or just part of the game I think atmospheric drag for planes and helicopters would be a hit and add a new challenge to flying in the new game.

As a side note, yes, many of these issues can be fixed with mods. However, mods have a tendency to have unintended conflicts and are sometimes not updated alongside the current version of the game. 

Positives
Building can be fun, albeit somewhat restrictive. The voxel-based game play means that building larger and larger ships becomes infeasible quickly (thanks square-cube law). Most ships you can reasonably build cap out at 200 meters in length, any longer and they begin having a significant impact on performance. You aren’t going to find any massive capital ships that are several kilometres in length.

Creative mode is a blast. There are thousands of ships on the workshop you can import, play around with, and pit against each other. I spent dozens of hours and many quiet afternoons building ships of my own and watching them fight it out against player-uploaded workshop creations.

Negatives
The survival mode falls somewhat flat. There are minimal survival mechanics. The most enjoyable part of survival is the planetary game play. Resources are limited and you need to build vehicles and bases if you eventually want to build a rocket to leave the planet. Once you venture into space, the game becomes much less interesting. Mining in space equates to flying to an asteroid, drilling, and flying back. After a few hours you resource power-creep so hard that there is very little challenge. There is also very little reason to explore the solar system, as you’ll find more resources than you could even use from visiting your first few asteroids.

Neutral Comments
Spaceship gameplay is all about inertia. There’s no magical sci-fi ship drive that makes the ship move. Your only method of propulsion is thrusters, and you will need to build thrusters on all six sides of your ship in order to move in a controllable manner.

There is a 100 meters-per-second cap on movement in-game. It makes travel waaay too slow in what’s supposed to be a space sandbox. I understand why they did it from a game development/balancing standpoint, but it still feels way too slow. I know there are mods that increase or remove the limit, but those also come with problems of their own.

Enemy AI is mostly dissapointing. Wolves & Spiders, the only hostile planetary mobs, are actually disabled by default in survival mode because for the most part, they are just not fun. Enemy ship AIs usually just fly directly at you, or try to orbit you at a distance. 

In conclusion
It’s a great space-themed Sandbox. It doesn’t have the staying power of Minecraft or Terraria, but it’s a fun experience for people who want to be, well, Space Engineers.",1613164575,1707708477,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

With that being said: I like this game to a POINT. That point is where the game forces me to Trick it into working. I loath the Small Grid/Large Grid system incompatibility. I loath the ""Sub-Grid"" ""Clang"" wonkiness. Most of the blocks are already too damn big (A small grid block takes up a 1/2 of a meter cubed, and so does a 1cm. thick plate, but has the armor integrity of a cardboard box) no matter what I build it's 3x larger than it needs to be. But even worse is to have a ""Large Grid"" component be the same size as a ""Small Grid"" but I can't put it on a Small Grid ship is asinine. i.e. I can't put ""Large Grid"" Refineries or Assemblers, or Med Bay, or etc. etc. on a ""Small Grid"" ship unless I do some wonky crap to trick them into working.

I'm changing my review to negative as I do not appreciate the size of these blocks for the integrity they provide, and can only hope that SE 2 rejects the Large/Small Grid crap and just lets us build.

Space Engineers? where do I start.. SE is the type of game I play on a religious schedule so much so that Ive bought friends the game in hopes I can draft more onto my crew.

Where does the game shine? Free build, allowing the player to build what ever the F they want is a game changer. Want to make the all spark (giant cube) fly through an atmosphere or space? you can do it! Want to make an exact replica of the death star or a x-wing? you can DO IT!

Do you like survival? The survival is basic but brutal and the game does not hold your hand at all. Want a harder challenge? try scenarios or even go for mods to make survival harder.

Do you like no limits creative? Creative is exactly what you think. Like minecraft, creative allows you to build what ever you want and in any size without the need to grind.

The game also has an economy and a in game currency (not micro-transactions) you can trade all types of materials and even sell your ships or buy pre-built ships.

Now honestly what do I give this game? with 1282.7 hours on record on the time of this reviews I give it a 8.5/10 the reason being is because the game lacks a proper end game or ""reasoning"" to continue past getting to space, even the whole purpose of using the economy system in a private world or server is pointless. Furthermore the purpose to get into PVP is also purposeless as it provides no real incentive to do so.

Honestly I will still play this game and I don't recommend this game to anyone as it gets boring, this is my opinion and thoughts. Best of luck Keen.",1480129691,1707330264,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Before Space Engineers, I used to see the sun, you know, that big bright thing in the sky. Now, my primary source of light is the soft glow of my computer screen as I meticulously engineer my way through the cold, unforgiving vacuum of space. Who needs vitamin D when you have the satisfaction of perfectly aligning your virtual space station's solar panels?

And let's talk about sleep. Remember sleep? That thing you do at night? Yeah, that's been replaced with just ""one more block"" or ""just until I fix this thruster."" My dreams are no longer about flying or showing up to work naked. Now, they're about mining asteroids and dodging space pirates. I wake up clutching my pillow, thinking it's a rare ore I've just excavated.

Social life? Oh, it's thriving... if by thriving, you mean me yelling at my computer screen because my virtual spaceship just got obliterated by a meteor. My friends used to call to ask if I wanted to hang out. Now, they just send search parties.

My diet? It's been revolutionized! Meals are now optimized for efficiency. Who has time for cooking when there's a space empire to build? I've mastered the art of one-handed snacking, leaving my other hand free to navigate through asteroid fields.

In conclusion, Space Engineers hasn't just taken over my life; it has expanded and upgraded it with premium modules. Who needs a real job when you've got a thriving economy of space credits? So, if you're thinking about getting the game, just remember: you might start by building a small spaceship, but the game ends up building a universe around you.

Singleplayer performance is bad, server performance is horrendous

Most non-DLC models are stylistically outdated, so most people on the Workshop use DLC versions of those blocks, if you spawn anything without having those DLCs - half the blueprint is empty spots

Mods are pretty much a must if you want to have any sort of quality of life features and then more mods on top of that to add any semblance of gameplay, community is incredibly split depending on the mods used and developers don't seem to have any plans to improve the situation by adding the most basic of QoL features",1578252449,1706774153,False,2,0,0.51381218433380127,2,True,False,False

The game is really fun, however trying to play online is a troublesome experience. Even the official servers have a problem where when they restart (every 6 hours) they don't say anything, and you lose all progress 30 minutes prior to the restart.

Also, don't even try building underground. It works fine, up until you and your friends re load the world and everytime it takes more and more time to load, waiting as long as 20 minutes for it to stop streaming each time

There is also a huge lack of actual things to do, and since building underground or any sizeable ship just creates server lag for anyone near it, it doesn't leave you with much to do


Me and my group of about 5 people, spent about a month and a half playing on a server for a week, and then the server just is slowly riddled with long load times, randomly losing ships, desyncing, crashing and more.

We also ended up just renting our own server, which was working great initially! However again, building underground even just a little bit creates a ton of issues, and it seems the longer the server is up, the more random bugs, player disconnects and more that happen. Essentially tricking you into investing a bunch of time into the game, only to be essentially unplayable.

Its cool for spawning big stuff in on solo and crashing stuff though. It has its place, but you end up losing literally days and days of progress from super common bugs. Games like 7 days to die you can build underground no problem, never have any of these types of issues. Space Engineers is just sort of an empty game, which seems like they left it up to the modding community to add real content to the game

The developer certainly has put some effort into things, however it still seems like an early access game. And sadly enough, the game seemed to have less game breaking issues 10 years ago, prior to adding planets",1706738423,1706738423,False,3,1,0.523809552192687988,2,True,False,False

Do I enjoy it and would I recommend it? Here the answers are yes and it depends what you like to do.

To put it into a nutshell, basically Space Engineers is Minecraft in Space, but you can actually build complex objects that can move on their own.

You start either in a small drop pod tumbling down to a planet's or moon's surface or you begin in a small ship in space.

I will be honest with you: What now awaits you is a very steep learning curve and a lot of grind until you have come far enough to improve your ways of getting and refining resources.

You try your best to acquire stone, iron, silicon and a few other minerals, out of which you can craft a handful of components, which you finally use for creating blocks. The latter come in two sizes, small and large. From these blocks you build everything you can imagine. Stations, both on planets and in space, ships, freighters, etc...

Fights are quite okay, but since it takes quite a while to whack even a small ship together, hours of work can blow up in an instant. Fortunately the game lets you choose quite nicely how you want to play it, so you can choose to build your bases quite peacefully with no or little interference.

I personally enjoy building production facilities, ships, rovers and other contraptions very much, and that is what I really recommend the game for. With the last updates came a big improvement on survival and economy, yet still there a a lot of things to complain about:

Multiplayer sometimes gets quite laggy and your movement can feel as if you are playing in a bowl of pudding, especially when the server performance is a bit under stress. 
Update 01-2024: Performance has been optimized, though can still be a bit janky if the server gets stressed, but overall way better than when I wrote this review initially

Physics get really weird, if you use a lot of rotors and pistons and the last two hours of construction can easily be blown away by the moods of almighty Clang, especially when you are still very unexperienced with the various quirks.
Update 01-2024: Clang has been tamed a lot in the meantime

Also it is quite annoying that even though armor blocks come in a lot of shapes, some particular shaped blocks are still missing, so you end up with some nasty holes or dents in your design, because the block needed for a smooth fit simply doesn't exist. 
Update 01-2024: Meanwhile a couple of new block shapes have been added, so this problem is way lesser now

However that hasn't prevented players from finding their way around and building awesome constructs (which you can also download from the workshop and add into your game).

A big surplus is that the game has a lot of mods and scripts in the workshop, so you can adapt the game pretty much to whatever you want it to be. Playing together with a couple of fellow other engineers in multiplayer is also a great experience (aside from mentioned performance issues).
Speaking of scripts, if you know C# (or willing to learn it), the game allows you to write your own scripts, be it for providing better information on what is going on with your builds, adding new ways of control or automating the sh*t out of the game (so you don't have to do the resource gathering grind any more, for example).

If you love planning and building any contraptions, this game is very much recommendable and very great. If you love to dig into a game to find out and tinker with it's possibillities, you'll find a lot of challenge here.

However, if you expect a lot of story, want to be taken by the hand and don't want to invest a lot of time into building, you probably better look somewhere else, as the game won't provide you with plenty of that.
Even though it has some survival and economy elements, the most part of the game still feels more like a big sandbox. 

That doesn't have to be necessarily bad, but that means that you have to give sense to the game by what you want to do in it.

The performance is very good. The explosions in space are cool and cinematic. Ship weapons and other stuff are dynamic, and leave other games in the genre (looking at you, Empyrion), far behind. There are factions that feel alive. I've been actively hounded by ships and it feels like in a middle of a war. Some cool vistas, graphics are nice, and ability to just land on planets is amazing.

But that alone doesn't make a good or an enjoyable game. The most fun I had was watching other factions lose ships in hilarious ways. Mining? Wasn't able to do any mining. All ships I flew were immediately attacked and shot down by a faction that apparently wasn't yet even hostile. You will get attacked, but you will not avoid getting attacked, as you see now map, no overall layout of anything. The only thing you see is space and some tagged points. That's it. Scanning for enemies? Mapping territory? I don''t even know how many planets are there in this solar system. Does the game has a galaxy? Many planets? How can I know?

How can you not implement any map or layout is beyond me. Which areas to avoid? I don't know. Where are planets? I have no idea. If my friend with whom I played didn't tell me about factions, I would have zero knowledge about the world and its layout.  Everything seemed to happen randomly. A ship appears and shoots things around me while the tutorial bot tells me that I'm hurt for the 100th time. You either treat the player like a hardcore veteran or like a newborn baby, not simultaneously. If I didn't get resources from wrecks and ships from my friend, buying for space credits, I would have exactly zero progress.

And then you have the most horrible UI I have ever seen, which was designed this way only to sell you overpriced and greedy DLCs. Yes, the only reason I am being shown 300+ blocks to pick from when moving things into my toolbar is to promote the DLC blocks which you cannot have until you buy.

But it does have a lot of systems to adapt to, and for that I recommend using the scenarios to learn. It's not perfect but it helps out. The internet has been very useful for me personally.

First of all, this game (and Medieval Engineers) is based upon a very large and complex custom engine built on Microsoft Dot.NET. While this means it will run decently well on a well-specc'd Windows box, when you start doing things like trying to run this on a Steam Deck or a Linux PC through the Proton compatibility layer, things get unstable rather quickly. I seem to remember being able to play this game with full audio capabilities (albeit with some ""crackling"" as reported by others on ProtonDB), but nowadays I don't get any audio at all. At first I thought this was because of a mod I had loaded, but it turns out, even in vanilla, no matter what version or flavor of Proton I tried, I could not get a peep out of the game. The game also runs quite hot on my Deck, and I run into fan-roaring freezes where I have to force restart the hardware on a regular basis. This is a game from 2013. For comparison, an equally resource-intensive PC game, Starcraft II, was released in roughly the same time frame, but it runs smoothly on my Deck with few issues, as do many other titles including Minecraft which can easily turn a PC into a screaming turbine if you let it. Sure, SE is doing a ton of calculations in its simulation (but then, so does KSP), Dot.NET is certainly showing its age, and it would be a gargantuan effort to port the code to a more optimal framework... but still, it's frustrating to see a 10-year-old game struggle like this.

It's not all bad news. The physics engine, lovingly dubbed ""CLANG"" by players, can be an endless source of entertainment and while it can be a source of ridiculously funny exploits (CLANG drives, anyone?), it adds quite a character to the game. The detail of the blocks, the huge mod community, and the ability to come up with your own ship, station, and contraption designs to build bigger and bigger things until your PC turns into a glowing pool of molten silicon, all make this easily one of my favorite games.

And yet, the fact that Dot.NET seems to despise Proton is concerning, because it means I would need to build or buy a fairly powerful Windows machine just to play this game. And the direction Microsoft is heading reminds me of why previous executives called Linux a ""virus"" or a ""cancer"", and I fear that will only diverge with Valve's path forward, which is more compatibility, more inclusion of systems like Linux, and down the line, likely more efficient hardware like ARM or RISC-V. It's difficult for me to imagine a scenario where SE will play well on Steam hardware going forward.

But, with the advances Valve and the Proton maintainers have made, I could be proven wrong. Maybe this freewheeling beast of a game will become yet another success story, not only running smoothly but without cooking the hardware. So I recommend Deck players hold off unless they like to tinker in Desktop mode and don't mind the instability, or if Proton has a breakthrough that significantly improves the performace of Dot.NET based games.",1411279829,1705904749,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You can do that. You want to explore the solar system while trying to survive? You can do that. You want to see what happens if you warp inside another ship? You can do that. This game is a sandbox crafting game where you can survive, go into creative more, do campaigns, and more! I recommend doing the ""Learning to Survive"" scenario first, to learn the basics, then, if you want, you can jump into the ""First Jump"" scenario, which is a fun and engaging campaign, but alas is pretty short. If you are doing survival mode, then I recommend the ""Star System"" scenario, and make sure to pick Mars (It is selected by default).

The game can be fun and immersive this is why it gets a ""YES"" recommendation.

BUT

It is also very inaccessible, you can and should play the tutorials and you can learn some of the basic stuff but the tutorial maps are also old and do not show you how to do other newer things.

Space Engineers lacks any kind of fauna or flora in planets, you have trees and endless terrain, planets are as 
 barren as the moon so unless you subscribe to the idea that ""any game is more fun with friends"" you'll be pretty much roaming empty spaces with a few robotic hostiles from time to time and nothing else.

Finally DLCs, Space Engineers has a lot of them and i'm not going to buy any of them, because buying them only encourage the devs into releasing more for the sake of ""supporting the game"" and cosmetics hardly justify any sort of money. Devs and the community will argue they are just cosmetics, that you also get vanilla ugly equivalents in the game every update but this does not dissuade the in-game menu from constantly pushing them to the front, because you know, having permanently grayed out paid items in your crafting menus is always fun.

SE is a fun game, but it is also surprisingly bare taking into account the time it's been around and  the amount of microtransactions that supposedly fund its development.

pros:
-this game is really big and you can make a lot of things with it
-a lot of mods you want it they have it
-great for mmo servers
-great dlcs

cons:
-this game is hard to learn and to customize some stuff you need to dig into the code
-in the research tree they are listing the dlc content so you will buy it like when i don't have it don't put it into the research tree
-not a great out of the box experience

Many dedicated server admins have given up because they are so frustrated as there's no support with fixing these horrible server bugs.   I would love to give this a thumbs up (and maybe I will in a year or two when it's worth playing).  I have to say, even though the game in multiplayer crashes constantly, it lags when it isn't crashing, released patches don't address anything important to stability, I still managed to log in all the time. That says a lot.   It will be a good game if the devs releasing performance/stability patches for the multiplayer side.  In the mean time,  you may want to play another game unless you don't plan on playing in multiplayer at all. If you want multiplayer, do NOT buy this game yet.  Wait until you read it's much better in that area.

Edit: 5/10/2015	I have Spent hours on this I will say its a addictive. Its worth playing with The designs you can build make it alot of fun.

Edit: 14 Dec, 2016
Dark Just now  
since i started in may 2014, this game has given me over 3000 hours of fun toil and tears, its not without its ups n down, but with patches every week, and fixes between that. its getting better by the week. so much time and effort spent by Keen just Listening to feedback from there players, it really makes a change to see this by a dev team. buy and enjoy! will give 10/10 for fun - 9/10 for playablity - 10/10 for the mods! lol


Edit 23/12/17
Just gonna say since patch 1.184/5 The game has got alot better for people in Singel player worlds and playing over LAN, however there has been a drop around Nov/dec 17 for MP
Due to this i would give this:
10/10 for fun - *5/10 for NET-MP playablity* - 9/10 for LAN playablity - 10/10 for the mods! *Thanks to all the modder that make the game enjoyable after 4300 Hours*.. without the mods i would have nothing to do.. :D

PS: note that the MP will be worked on in the next major update due by the end of 2017 early 2018.
I would still say its WELL worth the money!

Edit:Jan 2024 Game is in a Finished state and HIGHLY recommended for SP or Co-op Play, has some Cross Combatability tho requiments may still need dedi server. 7k hours. (not inc hours on console)
RECOMMENDED 10/10 Keep up the Good work Keen *Cant wait for SE2*

Absolutely fantastic space game, you'll be busy for hours, even if it's just singleplayer.
Far from a space ""simulator"", so to speak, it's definitely more focused on the engineering aspect and if you so choose, the survival aspect of travelling through deep space. Now, I consider myself a ""space game/sim connoisseur"", I've played many of the greats, KSP, this, Evochron Mercenary and Legacy,  X3 etc, so I like to think I know what makes a space game good, objectively speaking. This game has most of the features that I consider essential in a game about space and space travel. Room pressurisation, asteroid mining, plausible thrusters (not just super alien warp 9000), and a good, mostly robust physics engine. The only things it's missing, really, are good orbital mechanics, and better planets. The planets leave a lot to be desired, frankly. They have an atmosphere, they have some trees and mountains and some surface bases and ships (more with mods), but without orbital mechanics or any form of atmospheric re-entry, they do feel just like painted voxel asteroids with a cloud layer and breathability. I'm not making a dig at KSH however, they're a great dev team who take their time because they care about what they're making. Awesome customer service too, hit them up on Insta @KeenSoftwareHouse, always friendly n reply. 
Side note: I usually abhor the building mechanics of voxel based games, typically clunky and unintuitive, I also, upon purchase worried this game would be the same. It's really not. Building might take a tad longer than say, Minecraft, but you won't be left scratching your head because you can't align something or a block doesn't go where you want it. Good job KSH.

Buy this if you're looking for: A fun, spacecraft building and deep space exploration game, great on your own but better with multiple players, with semi-deep mechanics, a decent economy/trading/contracts system and a rather great building system. 

Maybe miss this one if you're looking for: A fully realistic, fleshed out space simulator or survival game. This is not and I doubt it ever will be Elite: Dangerous. I would recommend ED if it wasn't always-online, so instead I'd say go for the very similar Evochron Legacy, or even X3 if you're after a space sim. Orbiter 2016 is also good for real-world crafts. Give Space Engine a look too if you love exploring the universe like myself. 

Definitely avoid this if you're looking for: A casual arcadey space shoot-em-up, some form of RPG or in depth space combat sim. RP might not be my cup of tea, but it's definitely possible in this game, although there are little to none RPG elements such as progression, although the research tree could possibly count.

TL;DR It's fucking great and KSH deserve the money for it, frankly. I may be a tad biased towards games of the space persuasion, but even objectively from a non cosmonaut background, it's a fun game and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Just, make sure the devs don't abandon it. The slightest hint of abandonment and we crusade, alright? Lmao.",1572609106,1705429780,False,0,0,0,5,True,False,False

A TON of the basic content is locked behind paid DLC. The kind of stuff that would be included in any other base builder. I really resent how much you're advertised to while playing a paid-for game. You'll be reminded of all the features you're missing every time you choose a block to build and see that 90% of them are faded out and say ""buy our DLC"". It takes much longer to find anything because you have to wade through all of these advertisements to find the blocks you actually can build. I would expect this from a free-to-play game.

The ""survival"" mode is extremely lacking compared to any other survival game, if you come for that aspect you will be disappointed.

Be prepared to scour online forums every time something isn't working. If the shapes of blocks aren't sufficiently connecting, even if it looked like they snapped together, it will create a whole different ""grid"" and nothing will be connected. You can only fix this by building a specialized merge block to dock them back together. 

Inventory is incredibly small, which makes the game tedious until you have a small vessel for every purpose, mining, refining, manufacturing, ground transport, air transport, etc. Managing inventories is tedious also. 

Basically the game becomes fun once you've beaten the game, and have conveyors between everything and it's all automated. I would suggest it only if you want to play in creative and build stuff without worrying about resources, and even then you really have to buy some DLC for the interesting stuff.

This review is a Yes, BUT*. This means that if I had to say yes or no, I would recommend it. I have had tons of fun with trial and error building space ships, ground vehicles, weapon systems, and even entire building complexes. There are a ton of block variations, affordable DLC, community support, and so many possibilities for building the sci-fi space scene of your dreams. Playing with friends is highly recommended due to reasons listed below, but even building mining rigs to gather materials is a good time as you make and break a handful of designs before landing on ""the one"".
However, aside from the base AI ships there is not much life to the universe. Your vehicles serve no purpose other than that which you give them. They have guns in the game, but I can't say I've encountered any PvE purpose to use them. The in game economy seemed built with player-trading in mind, but that goes out the window when anything and everything can be built/harvested. 
In the future, I hope Space Engineers comes along with a Mission Board that gives transport missions which require you to build a vehicle to complete them. Maybe you only have so many in game hours to transport 200k of Iron Ore to make contract. Or bounty hunting contracts. Just some filler so the world doesn't fill so empty.

The game is buggy, the devs are doing odd things with the game, the building system is objectively hard to get used to - but the game is extremely fun. I put in the hours and now i'm genuinely enjoying playing on my own little world, expanding my frontiers having started from nothing. 

Look this game is not for everyone, but i must admit i'm happy i was introduced to it and i wanna see what else i can come up with.

For those considering buying the game, a small list of pros and cons i've encountered so far: 
Pros: 
- art direction is really cool, i love the near-future aesthetic, the weird industrial and blocky look, something you'd see on real missions, something tough and easy to manufacture. 
- vehicles are extremely fun to both build and drive, yes the speed can be limiting - (you can mod it to be higher tho don't go too crazy or physics die lmao) - but there's something so sattisfying to driving around on planets or cruising through space. 
- it can genuinely be immersive. it puts you in the shoes of some engineer out there being deployed into a barren planet to settle and expand to their heart's content, but how you achieve it and the genuine depth there is to it, it's super fun (for me). driving a truck around, hauling materials from point a to point b, crusing through space in your giant ship, checking for fuel consuption, seeing that everything is alright.. it's fun for me.
- sound design is honestly really good. some sounds can and will become annoying but i genuinely enjoy the sounds of menus and most of all ships, all the clicks and clacks, the rumble and the almost sloppy sounding ships just make it feel more real. 
- it's super moddable. there's obviously limits but all the sorta stuff you might want there's probably a mod for it.

as cons: 
- it's not so well optimised, you may need to crank the graphics way lower than your PC might be able to handle. which can make it loose a lot of what makes it so good looking. 
- it's very bugy at times, some things might fuck you up *big time* and completely break an otherwise fantastic immersion.
- DLC bloat, a lot of the great looking assets are locked behind a paywall, you can grab a selection of them while on sale but it can be a bit predatory. I personally bit the bullet, i can't live without my pretty blocks.
- steep learning curve. as much as i want to apreciate the depth and sheer expansiveness of the game and what it lets you do, i don't feel it's *as well* presented. there is a learning to survive scenario but the fact it requires a step by step guide probably tells you it's not good, if you really need it splitsie has some GREAT guides to get you started on most of the game's basic mechanics. 
- air leaks. god i hate how inconsistent the game can be with them. not much to say just do something about it keen lol.",1705349195,1705349195,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I basically hollowed out the crust of the planet where we put our base and the game runs great regardless. It has been a very cool experience in survival mode so far scavanging whatever we can to make our fortress. 

In the night we have seen Aurora Borialis in the canyons and it was green as ever. It looked like the real thing. There is just enough excitement to keep you on your toes. We set up solar panels that just barely got juiced up by the time night fell upon us. It's a good thing we thought ahead and built a battery to go with them just in the nick of time. The situation feels very real and if you don't play it smart you can die, or you could just bump into your friend and kill him because this game hates player on player clipping.  For the most part the game is pretty awesome though.

In a nutshell: Minecraft in space, but with ships, weapons, physics, and in game programing.

Should I buy? I bought it when it came out, i paid $40 i think? no regrets. I have 350+ hrs in this game, TBH if you meet the Full sys req, Buy it, you'll love it. if you meet the min sys req, like me prior to my new comp, you'll prob have fun, but it will be lag city if you dont have a good GPU. U need DX11 for planets

Multiplayer, yes there it lag. no the game is not unplayable. it depends who is hosting. Hi-Speed LAN = good times, Wi-Fi or so so internet = lag city, and the ""rubber-banding"" ppl talk about,

The community around this game is what really makes the game so special, there is a ton of mods if u get bored with stock (im not), there are codes (scripts) available on the workshop, all kinds of ships and parts lots of good stuff ranging from HUGE to practical for survival

Yes there are bugs, more than a few, but those honestly make the game *more* fun. It introduces an aspect of randomness that makes every adventure exciting. Multiplayer is fantastic. Building with friends, blowing things up, crashing space ships. The variety of things to do makes multiplayer one of the greatest things about this game. Its better with friends.

While I know they are somewhat controversial, after spending so long playing this game I am more than willing to pay out $5 or so a year to support a game I love so dearly.

This game has no actual design, it feels thrown together with the most complicated and annoying systems for the simplest of task. not only that the whole point of the game is to build but why is it that their is not direction indicators for ANYTHING. the HUD in the game has no button indicators, no compass and no indicators for what is up (WHEEL SUSPENSION). lets also not forget the fact that the tutorials were written over 6 years ago on outdated systems and so anything new you're out of luck and either have to figure it out, or go look up a 25 minute video (which is also just the in-game tutorial). i came to play a game not watch a 20 minute boring video of the dev talking at you about how to use the most basic system of the game. the world system is so very nice and the physics is great, but why is that the most basic systems are ignored and not cared for. 

The building could be great, and in fact if you want to take the time to learn how to use the system, it could be used to make the most amazing looking things in a game. The system however is ridiculous, and trying to figure out the build menu is like smashing against a brick wall, it takes forever to build anything because the menu is so clustered with nonsense and the most annoying thing, the DLC block are not able to be hidden so it makes it a chore to sort through to the block you actually need/want and causes the clutter issue to be exacerbated. you get a picture and that's it you need to hover over every block or look at a tiny little picture of the block. so if you're new or are coming back after a long time. its spending 5 minutes hovering over the blocks to find the correct one, fighting with the tool bar system for the building, THEN placing the block for all of 20 seconds before you move on to the next block.",1384227933,1704859362,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

At its heart lies an invitation to forge your destiny among the stars. The canvas is yours to paint with celestial hues, whether constructing intricate space stations that hum with life or crafting nimble spacecraft that dance through the void. Each block placed is a stroke of ambition, each creation a testament to your engineering prowess.

But it's not just about building; it's about the challenge. The realistic physics engine adds a layer of authenticity, where structural integrity matters, and the laws of gravity and inertia reign supreme. Designing your creations demands not just creativity but also thoughtful engineering finesse. Watching your carefully crafted vessel take flight (or not), obeying (or at the mercy of) the laws of physics, is a triumph that's both exhilarating and rewarding.

Survival mode, with its demand for resource management and life support systems, adds depth to the experience. From mining asteroids for precious resources to managing energy consumption, it's a testament to your resilience and adaptability in the vast emptiness of space.

The thrill amplifies in multiplayer, where collaborative efforts soar to new heights. Joining forces to conquer challenges or competing in grand engineering showdowns fosters a sense of camaraderie and friendly rivalry that fuels the community spirit.

Exploration beckons, and the universe here is your playground. Traverse diverse planets, moons, and asteroids, each offering its own set of challenges and treasures. The satisfaction of discovery and the promise of the unknown keep the adventure alive and beckoning.

Buy and play this game if you want to experience a cosmos of endless possibilities. The modding community enriches the experience, injecting new life and content into an already expansive universe. The support from the developers, the constant updates, and the sheer potential for creativity ensure that every return to Space Engineers is met with new wonders to behold.

In the end, Space Engineers isn't just a game; it's a canvas where dreams take form, where innovation thrives, and where the universe bows to your creative will. It's an odyssey that invites you to chart your course among the stars and craft your legacy in the annals of space exploration.",1704792588,1704792588,True,5,2,0.580937087535858154,0,True,False,False

The game was great for building. KSWH was, at first, brilliant. They cared, and did their best.
The game is still that great creative building game... but it has been abandoned. In 10 years of ongoing updates since release, more if you include early acces, and even with all DLC, the game still feels dead.
The recent AI update feels like a barebones tech demo at best. 

For anything other than a creative building mode, you need mods, or a server environment, which is horribly imbalanced because...

Originally, the first two DLCs were purely cosmetic. This was, at the time, declared to be intentional, designed start to finish with no multiplayer imbalance to ever come from owning the DLCs. The problem is that the rest have all had functional architecture, so called ""cosmetic"" blocks that are in fact extremely functional in PVP or server environments, giving more compact designs, sleek and more easy to hide, and more defensive due to smaller hitboxes, with less emissives or light sources to identify with in dark spaces (everywhere but dayside surface on planets.) 
Worse, they were specifically catered to that exact environment, the combat and pvp updates in particular had the worst of these blocks despite being targeted toward those groups, including defensive firing positions that fully defend the shooter. There's no way it was designed to keep balance with the non-dlc players in any form.

In addition to the lack of updates in general, when they do release ""free"" updates, they're alongside DLC and only done in attempt to get people coming back and buying.

For reference, I play PDX games. I love my DLC-adjacent updates, and in case of PDX I agree they have quite aggressive DLC policies, but their updates.. well, they actually have updates at all, and both normal and dlc-adjacent updates are extremely solid. Plus, any content owned by the host can be used by all players.

SE has no changes except for DLC-adjacent 'free' updates, and compared to the beginning, they're barely a shadow and a laugh at what the developers once were, while server environments require every individual to own each DLC to utilise them.",1704511729,1704515782,False,5,0,0.528497397899627686,0,True,False,False

Spent about 6 hours on the game and found the game non-intuitive and the tutorial system is useless.  Player tutorials are much better.

You will spend a lot of time learning which keys (alt vs ctrl vs shift + letter/number/F-key) do in order to get anything done. None of which is intuitive. This results in an unnecessarily high learning curve.  Developers desperately need to hire a Human Factors Engineer.  

Part of the problem may be focus on the part of the Developers.  Players can use xBox/PS5 type controller (no alt/ctrl/shift/f-keys).  This game may have been built for game controllers, which I don't have.  PC players may have been an afterthought.

There are minor bugs and some of keys simply don't work when they should.  This feels like a good beta.  

For those who don't mind many hours learning the system, you will be rewarded.  There is gold there.  You just have to dig harder than you should have to.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

[h2] A Stellar Engineering Playground [/h2]

[hr][/hr]

[h1] Detailed Review: [/h1]

[h2] 1. Narrative and Visuals (5/5): [/h2]
Space Engineers scratches a unique itch, standing out as the best 'space survival sandbox' available. Its design, especially for those with an eye for design and programming sense, is unmatched. A solid 10/10 recommendation.

[h2] 2. Gameplay and Unique Features (5/5): [/h2]
While entry may have a high bar, Space Engineers excels in gameplay, offering an unparalleled 'space survival sandbox.' The in-game tutorials are subpar, but after the initial learning curve, the game becomes a clockwork of creativity.

[h2] 3. Optimization Woes (5/5): [/h2]
Despite occasional oddities and friction issues, the physics engine works well, allowing for the creation of interesting structures. However, dedicated servers on personal machines may impact performance, leading to lag and physics interaction problems.

[h2] 4. Soundtrack and Audio Design (5/5): [/h2]
Space Engineers captivates players with its challenging yet enjoyable gameplay, focusing on building and overcoming unique challenges. The game's physics create a puzzle-like experience that evolves based on the player, the planet, and their friends.

[h2] 5. Bugs and Technical Issues (5/5): [/h2]
While some aspects may be broken, like the physics engine under certain conditions, the overall enjoyment of building and solving puzzles overshadows these issues. The game's survival mode may seem like a missed opportunity, but the joy lies in overcoming challenges.

[h2] 6. Replay Value and DLCs (5/5): [/h2]
Space Engineers offers an exceptional replay value, akin to Minecraft but set in space with the ability to build ships, space stations, and bases. The game's broken aspects don't diminish the overall enjoyment, especially for those who love building, solving puzzles, and automation on a large scale.

[h2] 7. Community and Modding (5/5): [/h2]
The game thrives in a multiplayer environment, encouraging collaborative building and making accomplishments more satisfying when shared with friends. Space Engineers' openness to modding enhances the overall experience.

[h2] 8. Value for Money (5/5): [/h2]
Considering the depth of content, cooperative multiplayer potential, and the satisfaction of building and exploration, Space Engineers offers excellent value for money. The game's continuous development and maintenance contribute to its lasting appeal. 

If you just want to enjoy the experience pick up the base game, but if you feel like supporting the devs pick all the DLCs as they are only decorative blocks and they do not add anything new to the game mechanics.

[h1] Personal Thoughts: [/h1]

Space Engineers resonates as an engaging space sandbox, providing endless possibilities for creativity and exploration. Despite its flaws, the attachment to self-built creations and the game's open-ended building make it a captivating experience. The lack of a conventional story might not suit everyone, but for those who relish the joy of designing and experimenting, Space Engineers is a stellar choice. Whether you're a meticulous designer or simply enjoy building and tinkering, this game offers a rich and rewarding gameplay experience.",1704209370,1704209370,True,1,0,0.496774196624755859,0,True,False,False

The Community Workshop shows me the best of creativity and concept thinking. There is never a shortage of help when it comes to trying to learn and understand how to make use of this game's extensive capabilities, enabling people to endlessly experiment and play around with what they can do.

As far as the game itself, I have yet to experience a game that allowed me to exercise my creative ideas and play around with the concept of physical limitations and careful planning when it comes to survival. This game allows me to build some of the greatest ideas I've ever come up with and see them come to fruition.

I have played other games with similar concepts behind them, and nothing to date compares even remotely to the fun I have playing Space Engineers.

But my friend urged me to continue playing and I have sense changed my mind on if the game is worth buying.

The physics engine is quite odd in many places, downright bad in some, but for the most part it does what you need it to do, and more, very well when it works. You can build a lot of interesting and fun things with the engine, but it prefers space and has some problems with friction it seems like.

Your game with run worse on a dedicated server on your own machine, im not sure how, but it will. And it is a LOT worse, not enough to chug, but enough to feel the lag and the physics interactions seem to suffer for it being on a server vs pure client.

The most enjoyable part of the game is building things and overcoming the unique challenges your builds create, its like a puzzle that can't end, and it gets harder or easier depending on you, the planet, and your friends.

The game has had no significant changes since early access. It is the worst possible waste of money. 

The game was released in a largely undeveloped state, and then Keen immediately abandoned it and announced two new games -- Medieval Engineers and Space Engineers 2, both of which it promptly forgot. 

The only new additions have been expensive DLC packs of content that has existed on the workshop for free for years.

There is nothing interesting in the game world. The multiplayer is buggy. Planets were added as an afterthought. The entire game is so poorly optimized and developed that it is more of a proof-of-concept than the quality you would expect for the price.

Both me and this game have went through a long path, and it was a bumpy one. A lot of changes were made, some for worse, but most were probably for the better. DLC's didn't turn out to be as much of an issue as everybody had expected, and they do add some neat options for people that are really invested into game, with a fair share of free updates for everybody. Gameplay is probably the best out of all space sandboxes out there. Story is nonexistent, bits of lore are mostly scattered across files and folders of the [i]Deluxe Edition[/i] DLC. Best thing about soundtrack is that you can turn it off. Ping on multinational servers is just atrocious: be it dedicated or player-hosted.

TLDR: buy if you love designing, engineering, building, space and exploration. Do [b]NOT[/b] buy if you want story, soundtrack, characters and whatever. You can do roleplaying, but I wouldn't advise it.

The game has a high learning curve and because of this, takes a lot of time to get comfortable (i.e. 100+ hours due to large variety of blocks and build potential). The time investment to learn is why most my friends quit playing. I found the built-in tutorials rather useless and went to YouTube to resolve all the issues I've encountered along with teaching myself how to use blocks to automate remedial tasks, big thank you to creator Splitsie for the tutorials & how-to videos. 
Overall, your experience with the game will vary greatly depending on what effort you put into it. Don't be afraid of adding mods to the game, they easily make the experience significantly better.

It's an open sandbox that's never added a single goal in the game that you don't create yourself, which makes the gameplay feel pointless.

The core survival gameplay consists entirely of mining to get the resources to create a ship that requires you to painstakingly weld together every part, or design a complicated welding system that feels like it's fighting the game's engine to function and has a high chance of getting obliterated by a physics bug. 

Even if you manage to sit through the tedium of making said ship, then what? There's no enemy NPC faction to fight with it, no distant stars to travel to, no variation in the same endless asteroid fields and barren planetary surfaces.

Maybe this is ideal for some people, but the lack of content alongside the endless stream of DLC makes this feel more like a corpse of a game that gets propped up to sell cosmetic DLCs",1409372727,1703025186,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

The Bad: Klang, Inventory Management, CPU on fire.
The Neutral: Servers are nice but due to performance restrictions the scale they allow for is usually too small to peek my interest.

this game is dirty, unpolished, and covered in rot. it's mineral that would require years to clean.
i'm making this response because i do really like the game as it is so unique, but every other game you could compare things to does it better.

Building, in a game about building you would expect some kind of build editor. there is not, just creative. trailmakers would be a great comparison on what you should expect with building.

Combat, it's just assault cannon and turret spam. or you could just use your grinder as that works.

Progression is actually false, it is just a limiter on what you can place in the beginning. you want to build a glass panel? place 40 other different barely related blocks first to access it.

Playerbase, they're all soft and you will usually get banned for shit talk. there are phishing links in some servers i am serious. if you don't like something about the game they will just tell you to use mods. as if there are not situations like the glue mod. i don't trust mods anymore.

Interaction. right so you're on extremely expansive maps, with a speed limit of 110ms. you are on very large planets, on servers with usually <20 players average. and you are either on a server where everyone does kos or they are so ""friendly"", you will be ganged on, up and ran off servers for making them mad or disagreeing with them in an online arguement. moderators are always power hungry like gmod & scpsl admins.

Servers go out without warning frequently, best bet is to play offline or just don't use a fragile vehicle or you will lag out and find yourself back on a planet with half your ship missing. they're super laggy, and with all these issues on servers with sometimes 16 player limits, that is unacceptable.

Developers will insult you for bringing bugs to their attention that have been in the game for years.

Build a wagon to carry your stuff, build a crane to aid construction, build a pipeline or a supply drone. and finally, learn the game play systems available, some important ones that are easy to miss or get askew are the build planner, the blueprint system, and the scripting system
The build planner is quite straight forward but easy to miss entirely if you skip the tutorials.

blueprints, DO NOT DESIGN SHIPS IN SURVIVAL, thats what creative mode is for, so that you can design ships work out the kinks, make them pretty. create a blueprint and build them from there DESIGN FIRST, CONSTRUCT SECOND engineers have been doing it for a few thousand years now, works great.

Scripting, you dont have to write them yourself but its not hard to learn and its a good life skill.

There are glimmers of fun to be dug up from the refuse pile, but at the end of the day, the game is more pain than enjoyable. Even the term ""game"" is a bit of a misnomer; it's more of a game engine somebody forgot to make a game out of.

· There are two extremes of gameplay; creative and survival mode. In creative you are just building stuff, but nothing you do matters since you're invincible and have infinite resources -- why build a mining rig when you don't need to mine, why build a spaceship when you can teleport everywhere? Survival mode on the other hand is an unholy mess of bad game design, from an irrelevant progression system to some truly torturous building mechanics.

· On that latter point, people sometimes call this game ""Minecraft in space"". It's vaguely true, but the blocks are 2 and a half times larger in every dimension (16 times the volume), too big to jump on, are plain and ugly, you have to assemble a single cobblestone block from 100 rocks and a bag of concrete, you can only carry 20 rocks at a time, and you have to stare at epileptic strobe lights for several seconds each time you assemble one. It's insanely tedious and all you can really build are rectangular rooms with nothing going on inside — unless you buy the decorative DLC blocks, then you can copy-paste the same bed, kitchen and lockers over and over again.

· Ah yes, the DLC. The game creators want you to buy the DLC. They really, really want you to buy the DLC. There are some 14 DLC packs, each containing a few cosmetic blocks so you can simulate having a toilet in your spaceship. As a reminder that you don't have these DLC packages, your build menu is full of these blocks, grayed out and taunting you every time you select something to build.

· Keen Software has some sketchy business practices. Space Engineers will repeatedly bug you to waive your privacy rights when launching it. They are responsible for Medieval Engineers, an abandoned early access game still up for sale at $10. People have noted a lack of concern for security, so if you play online this game may very well give hackers a way into your computer.

· For inexplicable reasons, the game keeps separate folders for your saves and mods depending on whether you're playing with an internet connection or not, either of which becomes inaccessible when you play under the opposite conditions.

· For all of the hours-long grind it takes to build things, it is insanely easy to destroy them in seconds. The physics bugs in this game will absolutely tear apart the thing you spent a ridiculous amount of time assembling. Multiplayer lag and desynchronization will leave you wondering why everything just exploded. Combat is a matter of who has the guns with the longest range, and the other side gets the pleasure of being torn asunder before they realize they're being shot at. The autosave feature seems designed to capture that moment right after your rover's suspension launches it kilometers in the air upside-down.

· The vanilla speed limit for any vehicle is 100 meters per second (224 mph). This can be modded up to about 500 m/s before the physics bugs take over. Contrast the SR-71 Blackbird at 983 m/s, the International Space Station at 7,660 m/s, or Voyager 1 at 17,000 m/s. For a game about space exploration, you move painfully slow. Yet the player is fitted with a jetpack which accelerates to 110 m/s with the lightest touch, often with lethal results. Ship-to-ship combat typically results in the NPC ship running away at maximum speed, and thanks to inertia, will continue drifting at maximum speed after its engines are shot out, rendering it unrecoverable. Even if not for the speed limit, overly abundant asteroids make extended flight in open space a bad idea, so you're forced to teleport from place to place using a jump drive.

· Contrary to its age and general lack of content, this game makes your GPU run hot. Spending time on a planet in particular will turn your PC into a space heater, which might be a plus in the winter, but not so much the rest of the time.

· Like most good games, Space Engineers has excellent mod support and the community has done an okay job of patching its flaws, but even with mods, it just doesn't feel complete or well-integrated. None of the mods really create an impression of being in a living universe where anything you do matters. Many mods are non-functional due to game engine changes over the years. Even finding mods that work well together is a bit of a slog.

Not to say it's completely bad. Once in a while you'll be flying through a canyon and you'll think, ""okay, this is kind of cool."" Scripting a cruise missile to follow the terrain of a planet, keeping itself aloft against the pull of gravity, can be fun. But, it's bad. For $5 or $10, sure, it's probably worth the price of admission, but not at full price, and definitely not with a full pack of DLC.",1701427304,1702451829,False,256,7,0.79915231466293335,0,True,False,False

Well here it is... SE is Epic, I've had the game since Alpha, Great concept! It has improved over times however it did have a dark period where it was almost unplayable... Keen (The developer) Pushed through! Nice work.. 

The result after many years it is now leaving early access, the Beta was nothing short of amazing and I expect this to follow suit!

The absolute worst part about this game is (multiplayer) server lag, and the lack of people playing it. 
The Idea is grand, and pretty well developed for a game that entered beta in 2016, and only recently fully released.

It does however lack any sort of drive once you get the resources you need. What I mean by that is, you can produce anything you'd like, and there's not really anyone that's going to try and take it or stop you from progressing. So it does get a tad boring sometimes.

Best way to sum up this game is Minecraft meets space. You have absolute freedom to build and do what you want, and that's something a lot of games advertise yet rarely ever truly deliver on (Talking about you Starfield)

Good thing it has mods

There isn't really anything ""fun"" to do, either.

A block build system that makes everything look the same, its hard not to end up with something that already looks like it was subscribed to in the workshop.
The blocks are varied and have multiple sizes and versions, the armor blocks come in several variants but you really have to struggle to get some of the blocks to work. Some come in half sizes but will take up a full space. Windows will make you pull out your hair in frustration as you struggle to get air tight and a nice looking build. Windows have will take up a whole block space and leave you with a spot in which you can't use due to the collusion mesh, as a matter of face, all the collusion meshes will cause you frustration. Some simply are just useless.
Sleek is not in this game nor the developers vocabulary. Simple ideas like a ramp are practically impossible that are also air tight is well impossible. Grid sizes Large and Small don't combine. The amount of mods that are available should tell you what is missing this game. Oh yeah light passing through your ship walls will drive you nuts. The AI blocks leave a lot to be desired, simple things like making a drone require patience and sheer will not to issue a gypsy curse on the developers.

Is there anything that can match this games concept? yes but not as polished as this is and those other ones tend to look like puke with lipstick on. Oh yeah expect a boring gameplay as there isn't enough npcs to fight or interact with. Spiders? big deal. Survival? Meh.. Creative? hmm no point.

There is just too many negatives and not enough stuff to do that makes it not worth it even though I will come back to it again in the future maybe but for now it comes off the system as it isn't fun anymore.

**Added**
Went back into it just cause its addictive and I forgot to add an airlock to a asteroid base that I left unfinished... couldn't let that stand.

  The 3D scaling is captivating, allowing for infinite creations and a sense of endless possibilities.

What truly sets Space Engineers apart, however, is the unwavering support from both the community and the developers at Keen.

  However, with all this in mind, I can't help but express a hope for the future. Please don't sink resources into frivolous endeavors; the world needs a Space Engineers Two. With the foundation you've built, imagine the possibilities of a sequel that pushes boundaries even further.

Update:
After 993+ hours, and a lot of thinking, I can not in good faith still recommend this game. The developers have switched to a predatory method of taking very minor tweaks, even ones that had already been made freely available through modding, and locking them behind individual DLC's, creating a paywall for anyone wanting to get the full game experience. I feel as though it goes against what I wanted with this game, and my ability to access it. Had the developers instead opted for an optional donation plan or something of the sort, I have no doubt the long time fans of this game would have helped fund something they've already sunk hundreds of hours into. This game lost its soul, the engine is still buggy as all hell, and any further development will forever be paywalled. Very sad to see it happen.",1573495080,1701395291,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its hard to describe how I feel. I love building things, but you'll spend hours building a literal Death Star and when you place the final block its all like ""why the hell did I spend four hours making this?"" and then its just a saved blueprint. 

FYI the learning curve for this game is pretty high, for making complex things that is. 537 hours in, and i'm still finding new quirks in the physics and such. That doesn't stop my contraptions from spontaneously turning into dust though.

You can build some fantastic things, but what they can actually do is massively limited. Sub-grids have AWFUL mechanics, using hinges and rotors is just so painful, all it takes is for one block to clip another and your whole ship will go spinning off into space like Team Rocket blasting off. Touch 2 grids together in a funny way and both will just disappear and your character will fall into a crater with a bunch of loose O2 bottles and ammo boxes.

Survival mode is long-winded and lame. Mining minerals is boring, processing and construction is extremely slow and boring. High learning curve.

Building is honestly like trying to service a fighter jet with Walmart tools. Deleting blocks accidentally and having your entire structure collapse is a frequent issue. The physics just do not cooperate. Complex designs are often impossible, and even simple designs fail spectacularly. 



The worlds are incredibly empty, and the NPC factions feel extremely bland. The economy system is extremely hollow. it just... went nowhere, really.



The game exists now as a bit of a DLC farm. The devs don't seem to care much about what players actually want. The game is entirely propped up by the amazing modding/workshop community, by creating workarounds and fantastic content that could've been in the game from the start. Without community content this game would be the most boring game ever, and after 537 hours its not enough anymore... This game could've done some really awesome things but has ended up uninspired, lacklustre even, falling far short of its potential.


Note: 
1. Build a tall tower and stick a rotor on top.
2. Build a long, horizontal row of light armor blocks on  the rotor. 
3. Stick a bunch of thrusters on the horizontal bar pointing in one direction, so as to make it spin in one direction.
4. put a control seat on the end of the horizontal bar
5. max out the rotor's torque and velocity, max override the thrusters, whilst in the seat.
6. this breaks the game's speed limit, and also the physics.
7. Launch out of the solar system",1507065785,1701393880,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game is hogwash.

I love it to pieces and it's one of the reasons I absolutely love creating giant mech designs, big bases and factories, but holy crap is literally NOTHING in this game functional, minus a few guns and some wheels, and even THEN those have their moments... Ever seen a gatling turret try to take down a meteor? It's pathetic.

First things first, Rotors, Pistons, Hinges and all the other additional movement options are a total scam. They rarely work half the time, and when you put in the limitations or rotor locks, the game will literally just ignore their perameters and keep going, which usually breaks what you were working on to begin with.

Not to mention the massive issue with hulls and armor (Seriously, the best armor in the game is super strange, all you need is a large tire and some heavy armor and suddenly it has 6 times the strength as normal heavy armor.) Half the time the hull won't even protect what's inside it and the machine'll get gutted anyways despite what armor you put on it, not to mention the total bitch that is repairing a small ship.

Merge blocks and connectors work as intended, so good on the devs for finding out what superglue is and how to use it.

Don't even get me started on the terror field that is Survival in this game. ""Oh? You want a way to actually get materials? Too bad lol, go out and punch a hole through the awful voxel plains to try and get a fraction of the materials that you actually need and hope your ship doesn't break from the extra weight.""

It doesn't deserve the ""labor of love"" award, it doesn't deserve your time, and as someone with 700+ hours in the game, I can firmly say that it doesn't deserve mine.",1535168203,1701219317,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

  It's been 9 years and about 380 hours at the time of writing this. Considering I've been playing this on and off since 2014, that's not a lot, but I've been around for awhile nonetheless so might as well write a review.

  Space Engineers is a single-player/multiplayer sandbox building game set in, well, space(and planets).  Space Engineers has been through a lot in the years since it was created.  Insane bugs, bad performance, poorly behaving rotors, and lag that would sometimes make PUBG cower in fear.  And through all this, it was fun.  Space Engineers has been enjoyable for years, even with the lag and bugs.  Since Update 1.187, many issues have been fixed.  Multiplayer and single-player games are much more stable, and Space Engineers has never been better.  

Pros:  

  >Very few things in this game are impossible.  You are essentially only limited by your imagination.
  > The game looks stunning.  
  > Recently the game is getting much easier to run and becoming more stable
  > The universe you occupy is quite large, with the Earth, Moon, Mars, Alien Planet, Triton, Europa, and Petram.  Each of these planets has their own environment and gravity level.
  > The modding community is huge.  There are tons of high quality mods out there with more being made all the times, that can either totally change your game or just add some tweaks.  Mods can fix almost all problems one would encounter (usually). 
  >Community is generally very friendly and there are plenty of servers to play on.  The people on the Keen Software House discord are some of the nicest people iv'e ever met.  They'll help you with any problem or questions you have.  The server community is also large.  There are countless communities for you too join and play with if you want a multiplayer experience.

Cons:
 
  >Vanilla exploration can be a little boring after a while.  Mods like Exploration Enhancement and Air Traffic can make it much better, but the vanilla exploration experience is still a bit lacking
  >Survival can be a little bland after you make it to all the planets and build all the things you want to build.  You'll still have at least 60-100 hours of gameplay in a vanilla world, but after that it slows down a bit.  Mods can help with this aswell.
  >DLCs are still hit and miss.  Not all of them are worth it and some are only really worth it for one or two blocks (Except you Decorative Pack 2, you're perfect.)
  >Bugs.  This is an inevitable problem in every game but I'm going to mention it anyways.  Space Engineers has fixed a large amount of the game breaking bugs but some still remain.  Your rover hit a tree?  Your rover goes flying.  Rotors have been known to be very buggy but still usable.  KSH has a big report page where you can report any bugs you find. 

TLDR:  Great game. Still getting updated and maintained fairly decently(ish) after 10 years.  Must buy if on sale and your like sandbox survival games.  The mods and multiplayer communities make the replay-ability very high.",1418160996,1701189665,True,1,1,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

When I first checked out this game in 2015, I was blown away by how much you can do and just how much was already possible at the time, and now, with mods, the game has been made even better by its community, from all new weapons, shields, and new blocks, to freakin' AI characters and scripts, this game has it all, and whatever you think it's missing, I promise there's a mod for that.

- Multi-grid ships falling in gravity, ruining any kind of interesting ship design
- Air-tightness sometimes not working properly, ruining our space station setup or causing behaviour like open rooms on a breathable planet being devoid of oxygen
- AI recorders not following the flight path set
- AI-controlled ships careering directly into terrain even with 'collision avoidance' on
- Programmable blocks occasionally ceasing to function
- Things controlled by timer blocks not being triggered in a consistent manner
- Not being able to enter specific times in timer blocks, instead having to rely on a slider with discrete steps

I haven't really played the scenarios (probably should though), but they seem like a decent compromise of both systems.

As someone who's never really understood why people love building stuff, I wouldn't recommend Space Engineers for those similar to me (i.e. you play games for the gameplay, story, etc. - not to build stuff).

But if you do enjoy building shit and/or love space/sci-fi, this game is perfect. I've seen several cool builds of ships from Stargate, Star Trek, Star Wars, etc. - so if you wanna make your own (or even design a custom ship) then this is the game to get.

I tried to change compatibility and the menu worked but when trying to open a different world made by me or just a scenario made by them still ""Space Engineers has stopped working"" 

I wanted to make a positive review but since this problem I will stay with this review until there is a fix.

Play this game and buy all its DLCs. IRL social lives are irrelevant once this game enters your library. 

But in all seriousness, this game is amazing. It plays relatively well most of the time, and is worth every cent, even without the DLCs. Multiplayer is a blast, and the community is really friendly for the most part. Even better, this game has an incredible modding system and modding community, so you really can't get bored.

While still lacking somewhat in mid-to-late game progression and goals, as an open-ended construction sandbox there really is nothing that comes close. A very active community of builders and modders offer loads of content to keep you inspired and fill in many of those gaps.

Ultimately you will want to be happy to set your own constructive goals, or derive motivation from multiplayer challenge. Veterans of Minecraft and other construction games will already be familiar with this almost inevitable aspect of the genre.

The initial learning curve is fairly high, but you'll be able to design drivable and flyable vehicles quite soon (once you've gathered enough material). The design possibilities are rich enough that you will find yourself continuing to improve and refine your skills over many hundreds of hours of gameplay, and you will never completely exhaust the game's creative potential. There is much more satisfaction than frustration, and again the community has a lot of help to offer.

Issues of engine performance and physics stability during development have been 95%+ dealt with, so don't be dissuaded if you read reviews with those complaints. Visually the game is swoon-worthy gorgeous, even on a low-end machine (more than 8GB RAM is strongly encouraged, though I am not unhappy with my 8GB on a very old i5 and GTX 760).

Over the years, Space Engineers has continued to astonish the world with it's amazing graphics since 2015! If you've ever wanted to explore a galaxy fighting off deadly robots and building up your ship; overcoming all sorts of engineering challenges that may follow then THIS is - THE - game for you. So many people waste away so mAnY hours on this game and yet choose not to regret it! As a (somewhat) creator for this game's modded creations community i can say that the possibilities are endless! Even on the slight chance that this game disappoints you, the mods or scripts may surely have a solution! 

The service is great imo, I've always had replies and the guides for the game help me in my time of struggle. You probably won't encounter any bugs (unless you are me) when playing this game because of how many people strive to play this game to help it's community endlessly. I seriously cannot recommend this game enough! Another topic i should get into (because it's a deal-breaker for SO many people) is the DLCs are NOT- i repeat NOT required for your gameplay. they simply add emotes, skins and scenarios exc that are completely unrelated to your engineering creativity!

My absolute favorite game.

It was the first game where I reached 1000, 2000
3000+ hours, and will probably get more soon.

It wasn‘t always fun, but that could change with mods,
playing on servers, playing with friends, building and
just making something new or exploring bugs.

[h1] One of my first paid steam games [/h1]

It was one of the first games which I bought, and also
soon after I bought my first dlc‘s for I don’t recall the date
but that was probably 2019/2020,
since then I bought / received every dlc since then upon release
and even bought the Space Engineers plushie (Nr.1193)
I discovered the game with a video of a man flying his
plane, which then explodes twice, he then flies back into the
cockpit and soon after the plane explodes, then I watched videos
from Captain-Jack or LastStandGamers, tough I never played on
either of they’re servers.

[h1] Little Device history [/h1]

It wasn’t long after I got my first PC where i bought Space Engineers.
It was an Ryzen PC with the following Specs :
[b] Ryzen 3 2200g, 8gb RAM (later 16), 1TB HDD. [/b]
It ran fine at medium settings, and could even build bigger ships in
Space with fine fps, tough after a few updates performance dropped.
This is where I got my first PC with a dedicated GPU :
[b] Intel i7-4700k, RTX 2070 super, 32gb RAM,
 M.2 boot drive and 1TB HDD [/b]
I sold that pc and soon after got my first self built pc :
[b] Ryzen 7 3700x, RTX 3060 ti, 32gb RAM, 1TB m.2 storage,
6tb surveillance HDD‘s and a lot of fans. [/b]
This is where I am currently playing SE on.
SE is a laggy game when it comes to voxels.

[h1] 100 Hours [/h1]

I wrote my first Review at 100 hours.
In that time I figured out how to play survival, craft, automate,
make drill rigs and beat the game easily.
I started a survival world with a friend and we got pretty far.
I still own this world tough we don’t play on it anymore.

[h1] 1000 Hours [/h1]

1000 Hours in is where i got really invested in the game, also it was
Quarantine time so I had a lot of time to use.
I got into mods, servers and publishing BP‘s.
My first server was an Keen Server DE #2. (I believe it was)
We played with a few random players (don’t recall everyone) :
Lorddome, Enderstar, and a few more.
After a week of being inactive our base was attacked and we stopped.
I also started playing on a modded survival server called Hn-Z.
This is where I met Father Goat and his Goat Cult Faction.
We traded a lot and shared a lot of items or rovers.
It was really fun, I started playing while there was an event and
I won so I started with a lot of uranium.

[h1] 2000 Hours [/h1]

2000 Hours into the game and I was still hyped to play each day,
it was still quarantine time and i was still playing on Hn-Z and modded
Survival, i started playing each dlc scenario and got every achievement
at the same time as Enderstar99, i built a lot of vehicles and ships,
also started using custom Thumbnails for my ships, tough I gotta add an
Description and some more images still.
Most of the time I was playing survival, modded or vanilla.
I started playing on Keen De #2 again where I made a little YouTube series :
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyWau3dmWngPGZFXWXbE7gkHeJaPprkM9
We got really far, even got trough a server reset due to an exploit, but we never 
got to use our ships, they disappeared in the end.
I also stopped playing Hn-Z soon After.

[h1] 3000 Hours [/h1]

3000 Hours into the game the hyped kinda died down, I was still exited
to play the game but not as much as before.
I started playing on an Server called Space Limited Asia, where Goat
played too, after we established two mobiles bases and drove once around 
the planet the server got wiped, soon after we established a base on triton
called the TRL Rover Facility, it was a huge base that should look like a
wrecked rover, it never got finished because the conveyer to move your items 
was modded and got removed, but it was glorious. Enderstar99 has an 
YouTube Video showcasing it too :
https://youtu.be/r9SZ6guryI4
It wasn’t finished but still.
We also participated in so called Mobile-Base-Races, where we
used large rovers to finish races.

[h1] The Red Legion [/h1]
[b] The Red Legion or TRL [/b]
was an faction created by me inspired by the red legion from
Destiny one and two, also a little bit by the color of my then
current pc case which was black and red.
Everytime I joined a server I created the red legion, most times I published 
a Blueprint I put it in the red legion collection :
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2393626310
Since then I have been expanding it, or using it in other games.

I hope to expand this with 4000, 5000 or more hours someday.
Till then,

Been playing since the Early Access days. Fun sandbox game for Space nerds like me, it's not exactly super-realistic but that's okay, too much realism tends to get in the way of having fun. It's not as hardcore as you would expect but it can be a bit difficult in the beginning. Building ships and stations can be fun or if you're in survival somewhat of a challenge depending on your aspirations.

However I think they need some more ""Exploration"" elements in the game, like abandoned wrecks and stations with a narrative driven story that you can discover what happened to the wrecks and stations and why they were abandoned.

The DLC aren't too expensive and you don't have to buy all of them if you don't want, you can also earn skins in game when you play Survival mode. And they're easy to get.

There is a lot of reasons to love this game; The Mod Community is diamond quality imo, most the people who run servers love this game with a passion that brightens SE as a whole, and the developers who work on this game have built it brick after loving brick. I watched this game go from a few bland looking rocks in space to a fully exploitable solar system. Games like this that really raise the bar aren't just games anymore; They are an artistic marvel, and a testament of how far man kind has come as a species that we can simulate gods majesty all around us in an immersive experience that at this point in history seems one of a kind. What it truly does is paves the way for more to come I should hope.

This game will test your patience, your attrition, and your imagination. It supports the idea of space exploration and its all around just a fun base/vehicle building/exploration game. 

Some suggestions if you do end up playing this game. Firstly give yourself a lot of time to play because you will need it. If you don't have a lot of time to play SE its doubtful you will really be able to dig into the really cool stuff you can accomplish. Second is be picky about your server and be nice to the people who run them. They have to deal with peoples silly problems all day and some people take their frustration of the game out on the people who out of the goodness of their own hearts + love of the game willingly help run these things and do all they can to offer a quality experience. Third is simply play with friends or make friends while playing.

Some of my best gaming experiences have been in SE to the point where its not just a game to me anymore but a load of fond memories and a symbol of a shared human experience that wouldn't be had without so many people who above all love its concept.

Absolutely amazing...
This game offers so much creativity and content (when mods are used) that you can spend countless hours building something to just go and blow it up or actually use it. One thing that I will say is that the initial learning curve is harsh, complex menus and controls (I love the controls and the menus now, but I didn't at first). To summarize this; this game offers hours of content that can be boosted by mods to add countless more hours of content. It gets even better when you play with friends. Before you get this game you might want to watch some videos to understand what it actually is.

Still my favorite game of all time. It is the perfect sci-fi sandbox to provide the possibility for thousands of hours of vastly different experiences and memories. Additionally, the game runs a heck of a lot better than it did in 2019. The fact that keen managed to push the Havok physics engine so far on such a scale, with decent performance is incredible. A great game made better with friends

Finally...

I Found it...

The controls are easy to remember and there is easy to follow tutorials that the game encourages you to watch when opening the game (this can be disabled).

It follows the same trend as most other survival games (spawn, gather basic resources, make crafting station, gather higher tier resources, build better crafting station, expand base) but this one is different, how you go around navigating around a planet or through space is decided by you, use your suit backpack or make a rover or even a spacecraft.

And that is where it gets better, rather than having premade vehicle models that you have to use, you get to build the vehicles yourself (or of course buy some basic ships from stations). this game lets you design and build whatever you want in a 'Scrap Mechanic' esque way, whatever idea you are inspired by can be brought to reality in space engineers.

There is some neat scenarios the game offers aswell as an open solar system in either Sandbox or Survial where you can do what you want.

Unlike most games there is no set 'border' to remain in, you can easily stay planetbound or go off into the deep depths of space far from contact.

Space Engineers supports multiplayer and has many servers that you can play on or even create a private session for your friends to join you on.

There is workshop support and a blueprinting system which allows you to share your creations with others and download the creations of other players.

Relationship status can be increased with factions by completing contracts for discounts in their store, or relationship status can be decreased by attacking ships belonging to the faction.

I'm writing this review, due to the fact that I really like what the devs have done with the game and the modding community.

I do not have that much hours on active in the game, been trying to find a group of friends to play with and honestly before the economics patch, I was not that into the game, it felt like there was no goal to strive for.

However the economics patch changed that for me, and though I do not have that much free time, I'm looking forward to enjoy the new life that patch brought into the game and strive to either peacefully build an empire or to rule all the other factions (evil laugh).

I do recommend the game for starting players, especially if you have a few friends you can play with.

Let me first off by stating that this game doesn’t have a storyline for you to follow. This entire game is based around what the player can do. Personally I do not find playing without NPC mods or QOL mods fun. The range of what you can do in vanilla is decent but when you start adding stuff like NPC Encounters the game just gets bigger and more vast. This game has come a long way since I started playing it in 2014. The game has advanced so much since I started and it seems like it never stops advancing. From the DLC’s, Multiplayer and to the workshop the game just is infinite in what you can do or find. As of this review I have 640+ hours in this game and I still love playing it.

[h1] Should you get SE? [/h1] 
Honestly if you like to build, figure out problems, and just explore in general yes you should get it. The base game is only [u]$20 USD[/u] and yes there is the “Space Engineers Ultimate Edition '' which includes the base game, SE Deluxe, and all the DLC’s for [u]$70 USD[/u]. Personally I believe that $70 for everything is not bad at all but if you want to you can wait till there is a sale. With that If you get bored from building, mining, and thinking then this is not the game for you. This game can take a lot of grinding to build bigger ships and fleets.

Now its nearly May 2016 and I have got over 5200hours playing this game, I still think its awesome.

In the last 2 years or so this game has come a long way from what I remember it was like not long after release. We now have planets to visit and build on as well as a world that is 1Billion K's across to explore. Although, much of it is empty space with asteroids throughout, each and every world can be customised to suit your gaming wishes. There is 100,000's of mods available on the workshop that you can use to make your game experience how you would like it. If you enjoy Star Trek for example, there is many Star Trek themed mods that you could have in your world so you could build the Enterprise or maybe a Klingon Bird of Prey. There is over 200 planets that have been created by the modding community that you could populate your world with. 

The choices of gamemodes suit many different players, Single Player Creative mode where you can build whatever you wish without the need for resources. This is a great mode for designing and building ships or stations for blueprint creation for use in other worlds and also learning about all the functions of the many choices of in-game blocks. Single Player Survival, with this gamemode you can challenge yoursef to find the resources you need to build your hopes and dreams. There are several scenarios to choose from, each with differing setups to start a game, for example the Easy Start Scenarios give you a station on a planet with 3 basic ships to get you started in the game. in the setup for each game you can customise the setup to make it however challenging you want. From inventory size, crafting speeds to settings like pirate drones and even cyberhounds and alien spiders which will attack you or start chewing through blocks on your base to get to you.

Then there is multiplayer, you can host your single player game on your own machine to invite friends to join in, or there is many dedicated servers to choose from. I have been running a dedicated server myself for over 2 years now (spaceengineers.com.au). Now, I will be honest and say the multiplayer Netcode is still a WIP and at times, issues in game will frustrate you to no end. Don't let this put a dampner on how you feel about the game, the developers have stuck to their weekly update schedule and slowly but surely everything is getting better. As with all Alpha development games, some patches can end up breaking the game for some, but be patient as the team will surely have the issues patched up soon.

Overall, I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys building, using and showing off their creations. There is a plethora of player creations on the workshop, including blueprints that other players have created that you can build in game. You are only limited in this game by your own imagination. Search for Space Engineers on youtube too, if this review hasn't been enough to convince you, i'm sure some of the fantastic videos of player creations, machinima and the like would be enough to push you over the edge and make you want to buy it.

Hope to see you in game one day, and if you found this review helpful please give it a thumbs up.

Most Recent Edit: I was considering while editing this review for a 3rd time and deleting much of what I have written to reflect the many awesome changes and so much new content that has been added to the game.

SHOULD GRAB THIS GEM

Pros-
The devs never stop working on this game.
Sand box but if you have a good pc then it's limitless.
Build anything+ Workshop Mods and met some great mod users.
Not like minecraft.
Space.
Survival.
Multiplayer.
Much more is getting added.
They updated a ton of stuff on SE
Devs keep up the good work same as you Mod users.
This game still get updates. Devs didn't dump this game.
The DLC's with Mod support is really good.

The premise, the ease of use, the open ended possibilities, etc. are just amazing. After a ridiculous number hours (over 10k) I have spent using this software I still can't recommend it. My review is based on my current belief that this is NOT A GAME. Because of what it is, I have spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to make it into a game that I would like to play, which is a survival game that is not solely combat oriented. 
The modding community has made it more difficult for me to simply walk away from this title, as there are many new mods constantly adding to the game on a daily basis. We all recognize the potential here, and because of the steady flow of mods there is the potential to have one of them trigger that niche mechanic that makes my quest for my best GAME experience a reality. Sadly, that has not happened in the 10 years.
The easiest method of making a play experience that I would love is to make a series of campaign missions. This is where I believe KEEN has really dropped the ball. The original tutorials were replaced with a number of stand alone missions that are unconnected. Each subsequent DLC usually has a single mission or interactive environment associated with them. Why is there no base campaign that runs you through a number of environments and situations in story form? The DLCs could have added more content to the campaign without much difficulty. I'm not asking for a lot here, 4 or 5 inter-connected missions to start with, and then 2-3 missions per DLC would have been fantastic. Throw in the ability to reverse engineer how those missions were made and so many modders would have run away with the mission making this product would have easily been the most popular game on Steam for many of the previous years. 
We did get planets that were never intended to be part of the game, but they are mostly dead lifeless worlds. At best on each world there is one global predator that is actually a recurring NPC, and the biggest threat in space or on the surface are pirate ships and bases that launch waves of drones. Meteorites that always hit the ground leaving hemi-spherical holes in the ground instead of standard shallow craters (come on guys the ground is far harder than you give it credit to being), that if used will slowly degrade your game experience because of the extensive ground deformations. The only thing in the game that should do significant damage to the ground are Drills. While I'm at it there should be concrete, or some building material that is made of the the most common to mine material on every planet-like body other than refined metals. 
I really wish this product had a finished game as part of it. I wish that planets had animals, and potentially other inhabitants not just the ones that are trying to kill you. I would like to see the ground on planets nearly impervious to weapons fire or explosives. Every time I sit down in this environment dreaming for thousands of hours to make this into a game that I would like to play ... I wish it could be more than just more disappointment. The amount of unlocked potential is more than the pathetic quest for liquid water, which modders have made and has not added anything to this being a game. To me games are fun, and while I can amuse myself to a small degree with all the what-ifs to this product I still can't call it a game.",1522143326,1700647971,False,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

They allow you to be merchants, pirates, fighters, traders and so on. Some space shooters allow you to travel to other worlds while others let you explore the expansive galaxy.

Space Engineers takes space flight to a whole new level of space flight. This is not just a game, it's a creation tool. Space Engineers, not only allows you to fly through space and battle it out with your enemies, but this game lets you also ""DESIGN"" your ship the way you want it, exactly how YOU want it. Space flight is no longer about just ships, it's about designing and showing off your ship designing skills. You can design fighters, freighters, destroyers, titans, carriers, even space stations that take HOURS to travel the entire station. You can even design fighter ships inside the freighters or space stations, so you have something to defend your stations or freighters. Not only can you build your fighters, but you can also travel to asteroids and drill for minerals to design stronger materials to make better ships/stations for yourself.

Space Engineers also lets you do either single edit where you just edit the ship on your own without others watching you, or you can have others join you online, either as allies and team work your stations, ships, destroyers, or you can battle it out against your friends to see who will have the best fighter ships and who can build the better ships.

Along with that, if you think you have designed a good ship, you can post your ship creations on the Steam site and you can also check out other designs that others have made and see how they designed their ships. (UPDATE = As of now there are over 1,000 pages of Workshop items to view and download. Ships, stations, animations, asteroids, destroyers, mechanical devices, there's just no limit to what you can do.)

Space Engineers is no longer about just space flight. It's about taking the entire ""Build Your Space Empire"" to a whole new level of build and destroy. Build it, design it, add on to it, tweak it, create it, and use it, any way you see fit. Space Engineers is no longer about the game, it's all about ""YOU"". What ship do YOU want to design, and how will you control the space empire?

EDIT: 9/23/2014

WOW! EVERY single update that has come out since my review awhile back is mind-blowing. you can do so much more now that not only with offical game blocks but the modding as well. 

I love this game and everything it has. Here's to more excellent updates and a LONG life



EDIT: 1/15/2015

Damn.....its really all i can say the numerous updates, support, and various mods make this game something else.

now if they only introduce Oxygen, AI, and Planetary bodies this game would be perfect



EDIT 2: 11/28/2019

SE has come a LONG way from what it was since my last edit 4 years ago. Within those 4 years they added, Oxygen and Planetary bodies (though limited) to the game and because the Modding community is still strong many have added AI to make the game even more enjoyable. 

I still stand by this game even if they do had these DLC packs, though in theory they feel more like expansion packs instead, now but they are cheap enough in price and far enough apart to not break the bank.

Edit 11/26/2020

This year may have garbage but at least SE continues to bring a smile on my face, especially with its with friends

I have no issue with supporting Dev's, but the DLC flood that locked away core building components behind the pay wall was too much.

So as the Dev's got greedy, I stopped playing. But sadly so many players have been willing to dump loads of money into DLC after DLC just to have a full set of core parts for building, the game has gotten worse instead of better.

Space Engineers isn't an MMO where you might expect to pay a lot over time. But Keen seem to think it should be with the flood of paid DLC they keep pumping out.

This company has questionable practices that border on crowdfunding through Early Access.
The result is that out of their four main games, Miner Wars, Miner Wars 2081, Space Engineers and Medieval Engineers, three have been dumped, abandoned and totally unfinished. The forth, Space Engineers, is in a steep decline into developmental obscurity.

For those that were most vocal about the criminal way Early Access (EA) customers were duped and dumped, they have engaged non-paid moderators that abuse their position and hide behind a wall of total authority. They will ban you for totally personal reasons, in some cases, permanently, from their game forums. You will be banned for 'complaining too much' or 'bumping old threads'. And that would be ok, if they were consistent with these rulings. But they are not. They will pick and choose whom they don't like and then ban them without a warning or a right of reply.

KHS and it's forum moderators have a long history of customer abuse. They will draw you in with promises of a 'wonderful' game and leave you with a buggy mess at best. And god help you if you complain too much.

So, a word of warning, don't ever purchase from this company.

A word to the Steam administrators, KHS is abusing the EA system and using it as a crowdfunding platform for it's other non-related projects. May I suggest that they never be allowed to use the EA system again.",1585356559,1700306797,False,4,0,0.512354850769042969,5,True,False,False

The game has been for the better part of the time left abandoned, slow burning by the developers.
The worst part is it's not their fault (the devs) about the lack of new content over the best part of 4 years. This is due to the scope of game functioning as a fancy physics engine with the ability to build space ships. The game has polished inventory, controls and UI/UX. It's just old.

Currently the game recives block content as DLC and while it's mostly cosmetic i consider it dead file weight. The game has an economy system, and has missions quests and tons of other cool features but they all lack cohesion.
Recently bots were introduced to the game, and now you can automate certain tasks with fancy AI blocks.
The problem with this game is a lack of actual things to do, for casual environments. Single player is a simple dead end with very few challanges and boils down to ""how quickly i set up my grinder pit""

The game has an extremely low amount of actuall things to do, besides sandbox endless play. You build a miner get materials. Build a small outpost base and from there you're set.

The ""challenges"" are theese random encounters, well due to the way this game works fighting them makes no sense, it's way easier to just spam your players body at them to try to get on board stop the ship, then slowly grind down your way to the power sources, disable the ship then hack all the turets and throw it in your grinder.

Fighting theese ships is purely for fun as it's both a risk to your resources AND makes you loose on your investment. The quests are boring and very limited.

It turns out not only did I use a Gyro Override (which flipped my vehicle) but Tires can have nearly every attribute manipulated including steering angle and suspension.

This made the game far more enjoyable and opened my eyes to its potential.

Does it still feel like bland planet generation? Yes.
Does it take too long to get any interactivity outside of construction? Yes.
Is the game saved by mods? Yes.

So it's a coin toss but no longer a irredeemable. This just comes off as one of those things you will love or hate.

Give it a shot and decide for yourself.

Original: I just spent 2 and half hours designing a vehicle that was meant to sweep the terrain in order to find Nodes for harvesting.

It moved at half the speed of the player character while they fly. It went FLYING at the slightest touch of elevated terrain while damaging key parts and eliminating hours of work. Then it got stuck.

Progression seems to be punished. There are no enemies, no animals, no ambience. Just dirt and you with ineffective vehicles that are obtuse in design and prohibitive in nature.

I thought with a survival mode there would be some structure, but it just feels like an empty sandbox. I like space settings, I like building games, but I also like having something to do, some sense of purpose. This game just doesn't have that. I hesitate to even call it a game.

Getting started is a complete mess. The tutorial videos are tedious and not very helpful. Far too long on camera and movement, then jumping to quick select, but I don't need to know how to setup my toolbar if you haven't covered what blocks or tools are yet. Survival mode feels like an afterthought so don't expect much help there. If you try jumping right into the game, maybe learning as you play, just expect disappointment.

If you try to jump right into the intro to survival scenario, they do give you some tasks to help you learn. Unfortunately about half will get stuck on the first task. This happens if they go to oxygen first (closest task on the left). You will be tasked to refill your oxygen, but you cannot. See the base starts with an incomplete conveyor block and until that block is built you cannot refill oxygen. Instructions on your first block repairs are a task slightly further away. The specific block build needed isn't even covered at all. At least if you go to the closet task on the right first to refill health and energy it mentions that it isn't connected to oxygen.

Its really annoying because it doesn't take much thought to come up with a better intro scenario. Let me arrive on a ship bringing the parts for the base, build a starter base to learn about basic construction, power, oxygen, mining, refining, while the ship provides a safe starting environment and supplies. Then teach me about ship construction with a little mining vessel. If you imagine anything like this is in the game you are mistaken. 

If you instead play First Jump you will realize how they things you might build, might be incorporated into some kind of really light scenario. Its a really short and light scenario and serves as a crude intro to controls. It will at least actually explain how to repair a block when you need to. It will also introduce you to combat and just how bad that is. Though don't be surprised when it asks you to fight or run early on and you realize it hasn't even introduced fighting yet. How can you be teaching at the level of how to move and interact, turn  on lights, and then forget you never mentioned picking up, equipping or firing a gun.",1699461958,1699461958,False,5,0,0.504225313663482666,0,True,False,False

I've had it for a long while, but only recently got into it with some friends.
I really don't know what took me so long as this game is a blast for the creatively-minded.
I have spent more hours just messing about in this game than any other, in addition to keeping busy building ships, bases and mining operations, just to name a few things.

I really like this game, especially with friends, it really is a blast working together to survive the dangers and beauties of space and alien worlds, not to mention the occasional enemies, including pirates!

[h1][u]UPDATE[/u][/h1]

I've had a couple of years of pretty steady play in this game and have even delved into running my own dedicated server for this game. With that said, I'm adding to my review.

What I said in the original review stands, but I would like to add that the workshop for this game adds layers to the experience that I hadn't yet taken advantage of.
Though not required, I have since purchased ALL of the DLC for this game, I simply love 'eye candy' and that's exactly what the DLCs add to this game.
The workshop is a very sufficient alternative to buying the DLCs if you don't wish to buy them, but know this: Some of the blueprints on the workshop have been made with these DLCs and if you don't own them, then your downloaded blueprints may be rendered completely useless.
This is what partially encouraged me to get the DLCs as I could afford to do so.

The Space Engineers Modding Community is awesome.
I've added numerous mods/scripts to the game over the last 2 yrs. and the majority of them have made life just a bit easier in the SE world, but as with anything on the net, be careful what you download. Many of these mods are very useful, but there are also 'sloppy' mod makers out there that just throw their mods together with no real testing beforehand, and as such, can cause problems.
Read the descriptions carefully and if a mod does NOT have a description, I advise that you ignore it and move on, no matter how 'cool' it may look. (Personal experience speaking here)
The lack of a decent description is a clear indicator of a lazy author and/or a 'lazy-made' mod.
Steer clear of those to avoid potential issues.
I've come to prefer 'Quality of Life' (QoL) mods as they generally add to the experience without drastically changing the basic vanilla gameplay, at least not that much at any rate.

I've compiled a collection of my favorite Space Engineers mods and I will share the link here to help out any of you possible new players that may want to try some decent and well-made mods out in your games.

If you're looking for a Minecraft-like game where you can sink thousands of hours into building colossal vehicles and heavy machinery block-by-block and then using it all to demolish the environment, this game will definitely scratch that itch. 

This game also had way more opportunities for vehicle-to-vehicle combat than I was expecting, which was a pleasant surprise. 

There is certainly a learning curve to the UI and controls, but the game points you to some good tutorial videos and there are two tutorial scenarios that give you a firm grasp of the basics. 

It goes on sale pretty often, so if you see it 75% or even 50% off, I would recommend snagging it - even without the DLC, you'll definitely get your money's worth in terms of content.

EDIT:
Some tips for beginners doing their first single-player custom game on Survival mode:

Go to the Advanced Options:
1. Disable 'Block Destruction' (enabled by default) - collision damage is pretty nutty in this game, so if you leave this turned on, expect to crash and burn... a lot.
2. Set 'Meteor Impacts' to 'Armageddon' - meteor storms are actually a GOOD thing because they leave random ore deposits behind, some of which are normally extremely difficult to find such as Uranium and Platinum.
3. Do NOT disable 'Voxel Destruction!' Turning it off will prevent you from being able to mine resources! 
4. Enable 'Spawn Wolves' and 'Spawn Spiders' if you want to be attacked by wild animals :D
(both are disabled by default)
5. Max out inventory size and the speed & efficiency settings for tools and equipment if you want the game to go faster.",1698865963,1699264118,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In games like Factorio you build an ever expanding factory to fight off the local fauna and build a ship to get off the planet. During your play through you are working towards a tangible goal. There's also many sub goals like researching the next set of items and creating a new assembly line to produce a new component. These motivate you to keep expanding and keep playing.

This game, with its boundless opportunities for exploration and creation, has become a favourite of mine. Here's my detailed review, delving into what makes it a remarkable experience, as well as some of its downsides.

The Good:

Exploration and Creativity: Space Engineers thrives on the open world it presents. With a vast universe to explore, you'll never run out of places to go or things to do. Whether you're flying through space, building bases on moons or ice asteroids, or crafting colossal space stations to house your fleet of smaller ships, the game encourages unbridled creativity and adventure.

Multiplayer Delight: The multiplayer experience is where Space Engineers truly shines. Teaming up with friends to create, explore, and even indulge in comical antics is a joy. Watching your friends' characters flop around in zero-gravity while using jet-packs adds a whimsical element that keeps the game lighthearted and entertaining.

Robust Game Creation Settings: Space Engineers offers an extensive suite of customisation options, making it perfect for those who prefer a non-combat focus. You can tailor the game to your liking, enhancing the creation and expansion aspects of your journey.

Optimisation: Despite years of development, Space Engineers remains impressively stable and polished. Even on a mid-range PC, the game runs smoothly. It's a testament to the developers' commitment to optimising the experience for a wide range of systems. Notably, the game also runs flawlessly on Linux, even on unsupported systems, thanks to compatibility with Proton 8.

The Not-So-Good:

Price and DLCs: The game's initial price of £15.50 is reasonable given its calibre. However, the main issue arises with the plethora of DLCs available. While these add cosmetic items and support the developers, the cost can quickly add up. Some players may prefer purchasing the complete game with all DLCs or none at all. With the extensive list of DLCs, it can result in an additional cost of £55.86, potentially even more if more DLCs are introduced. This might be a deterrent for some players, even those deeply enamoured with the game.

Conclusion:

In summary, Space Engineers is a game I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone looking for an exciting, creative, and multiplayer-friendly experience. With over 100 hours played, I still find myself captivated by its universe. If you have friends to share this journey with, it elevates the experience even further.

When it comes to DLCs, they are optional, and your enjoyment of the game can be complete without them. Personally, I'm selective about the DLCs, choosing those that offer functional items. However, the choice of whether to purchase them or not is entirely yours.

Ultimately, if you decide to embark on this space-faring adventure, I hope you have as much fun as I have had with this game. Game on and explore the expanses of space to your heart's desire.",1699236394,1699236394,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Features that should be baked in are left up to the community to fix by scripting.  

Want to make a rover with an adjustable height? Sorry the wheels no longer talk to the ship when on pistons. There's a script for that but braking isn't possible. Not to mention that attaching one wheel suspension to a piston if fine, then trying to attach another one further along the craft just will not allow you to orient it properly. 

Nix the extending suspension, and just build a non adjustable height rover? You better avoid slopes because the rover then loves to runaway going downhill, then flip over, or alternatively rip out the under carriage and explode. Going up hill is no better.

Do an atmospheric flying miner you say? Good luck staying level. Trying to mine while flying is frustrating. Bump the wrong pixel, and flip over tumble and explode.

At 200 hours I can say I explored most of the immediate game potential.
I say immediate because if you want, it can last thousand hours if you get into timers, programmable and AI blocks and so on.

Basically the game is pointless, there is raw materials and tools and stuff to refine it. Once you get that in the first hours of play, i'ts up to you where you want to go.
There is no story beside some short pre-scripted missions in single player only.

You can build whatever you want, then go in space and colonize asteroids or build flying space stations or battle fortresses.

They put into it some REALLY CLEVER buid blocks like hinges, rotors, timers, merging blocks, blueprints of the stuff you build and printers to build it back and others that allow you to build machines yourself like automatic drilling platforms or whatever. The use of these blocks really makes this games for those who want to actually engineer solutions to problems and invent weird stuff.

That said, the game it's pretty fun, expecially with friends, if you like the pointless building of stuff after you grasp  all the game mechanics and stuff to get there (which for me, even it's a steep learning curve, it was major part of the fun).

Now to the dark side.
The devs are a little lazy about community bug feedback and there are some nasty bugs around since years and reported multiple times which aren't getting solved. Lot of requests by the community doesn't get attention and the game suffers from crashes from time to time and you will soon or later resort to the modding community, which is the real strength after the dev work, because it's enormous and well done. lot of people liked this game and added a ton of mods for it to do almost anything.

I met my fiance on this game, moved 3,000 miles to be here with him. It has vastly gone downhill. The developers used to pump out all this new content, guns, missiles, planets, graphics improvements, (usable, as in functional and does something different than the current-in game) blocks. Years later, we've seen thruster reskins, new skins, and minor decoration updates masked as ""Major Updates"".

When did you give up Keen? When did you say ""Ahh yes, this game is complete. The players can now be on a planet, mine said planet, build ship to leave planet, and exist in space."" The AI update was... A joke. It added some blocks that are kinda okayish AI wise but are really all and all just point-to-point gps ""i go here, now i go here."" You still have to tell it what to do, or program something to tell it what to do. 

The (first) warfare update was okayish. They added some new guns, the artillery gun and the autocannon. But that's it gun wise. Still no big daka dakas. No large battleship cannons to put on my massive battleship without needing to rely on 50 mods that may or may not exist tomorrow. 

There's no ultimate goal, there's no AI to interact with, the multiplayer is vast and laggy. Singleplayer with extra steps and you can't have your own custom playstyle. I'm just over hoping the next update is going to be a big one, one that actually changes the scope of the game. Something that makes me excited to hit the play button again and see what the devs have cooked up for me. I'm just   o v e r   i  t.

I hope you guys can get out of whatever rut you're in right now, because its hurting the game and killing your existing playerbase, not to mention anyone who wants to try the game, or has been waiting for it to be ""complete"". Still feels like an Early Access title at full release years later /=

It has great building and a bit of exploring from the get-go. The DLC feel fairly priced and pretty much only include different skins of blocks (and everybody who does not have the DLC will still be able to use the blocks, jsut not build them). While there are skins that you can buy from the devs directly, you can also collect quite a diverse amount of cosmetics via in-game crates that randomly appear and have a chance to contain a cosmetic. 

The modding is amazing.

There are ""story"" mission in the so-called scenarios, but unless you want lore specific to the mission as well as some achievements you do not need to play them. 

You can spend many hours in this game.

Until 5 minutes ago. My friend was AFK and i decided to take one of our 2 ships to go mining (This is on Earth by the way) so as i was mining for ice for our hydrogen engine for some reason the aircraft had a complete meltdown and wouldn't respond to any inputs, and no it wasn't a weight issue or a thruster issue the best we can determine is its something with the gyroscope because it has happened before and the only to fix it is by overriding it and praying, which resulted me in rolling down the mountain and banging it up pretty bad. I then decided my best bet was to take my newest ship i built for mining up to the mountain again to get back the ice i lost in the result of my previous expedition, to this point everything was smooth, i had my ice and was returning to base, and then a really bad rainstorm set in, which resulted in loss of visibility, as I was getting closer to base i failed to see one of our windmills which resulted in a high speed collision ripping out the underneath of my ship and flipping it on its roof (and again i lost all my material because it destroyed my storage containers), by this point I was very upset but I knew my ship was salvageable and I could repair it and get it going in no more than a hour, blown away by the sequence of events that had just happened i decided to text my friend about it all, while it was still raining and with the noise of thunder and lightning in the back ground, as i was explaining the lovely time i was having on this game my character GOT STRUCK BY LIGHTNING. I couldn't believe it, it was like the cherry on top for this whole ordeal, and so again i went back to my phone AND AS I WAS TEXTING HIM I GOT STRUCK BY LIGHTNING BAM I hear another bolt of sadness rain down close to me, in this very moment i was almost too scared to turn around knowing what was behind me but either way i did. Just as I figured all I can see is the  new wreckage of my ship strewn about and completely destroyed my ship with just the cockpit and a couple engines left.

   It's called Space Engineers, but they want you to start on a planet. You spend 5-10 hours mining stone to get a the beginnings of a base, that has no storage, because storage, rovers, and ships are locked behind cobalt, a rare mineral that is too deep for your ore detectors to see.
   You spend 20-40 hours finding minerals, and upgrading your base to be capable of building a space ship. You spend another 10-15 hours designing and building the ship to get to space. You then abandon all that hard work, and your rewarded with having to find all the mineral again, this time, in space.
You can participate in fixed and empty economy, trading, or doing the most boring missions to earn money. You can fight computer generated factions of space pirates that have unlimited resources, including ammo, that will hunt you down, and spend as much time as is required to destroy every computerized component of your ship or base while firing continuously, while you had to earn, mine, refine and craft every bullet that you use. Leaving you at square one.
   I feel like a beaten lover. I keep finding myself attracted to these games, that are 10-15% away from great. As if, somehow, if I just loved them more, or kept showing my support, that they would change, and stop mistreating me.
This game has the capability of being wonderful, but as is, it's vast, empty, and uncaring of your time. It's better with friends. It's better when PVP is well organized. It's better with mods. But as a base game, a survival game where progress is centered around building larger and more complex vehicles, and smaller and more specialized vehicles, it falls flat, even 800 hours, and ten years later.

Compatibility is also a bitch for this game. It won't work if you're on a Mac. I'd go for at least a Windows 10 i7-6700 3.60 GHZ CPU if you plan on getting this. If you've met these requirements, it's a fairly decent game. Updates are actually pushed pretty frequently, fixing a lot of bugs while also having a high chance of creating new ones. 

There is a lot of annoying mechanics that the game has that are there to intentionally make the game challenging, such as components not being able to move through small grid conveyors. Most of the challenge of this game comes mainly from ship building and designing things opposed to actually doing contracts and fighting. The ship building mechanics are fine if you're okay with the vanilla limitations, and some blocks are a bit jank especially in the physics area, such as rotors, hinges, wheels, and pistons.

Multiplayer is extremely unoptimized, and you will encounter frequent lag, rubberbanding, and connection difficulties when playing on a server beyond maybe 2-3 people, especially if you're hosting the server yourself.

Keen Software House themselves are notoriously bad with PR, their moderation team in the Discord banning people for posting harmless gifs and calling them idiots when they refuse to listen to the rules while simultaneously bending the knee to anyone who gets offended over words like ""retarded"" when being used in a general statement. Definitely lives up to the neckbeard Discord moderator stereotype. Furthermore, they emphasize greed and bland DLC content over prioritization of making the base game less lackluster and optimization. Keen at the moment is comparable to a distant cousin of EA.

I will update my review as soon as it is fixed and I can play the game again. Edit: to give them credit, they did fix the game breaking bug within 24 hours.

It feels a lot like minecraft, the main draw is the limitless sandbox, but once you beat the ender dragon you're pretty much done, it doesn't get any harder. If you go into this game with that sandbox mindset it is downright incredible, but if you go into it wanting to build bigger and bigger ships to kill bigger and bigger things then you're going to fairly quickly reach the limit unless you start doing custom stuff(it does have workshop and there are some pretty neat mods). And unlike minecraft, there are no big servers where you can just join and play a different gamemode, I'm not sure if the game can handle it or not, but there aren't enough players to find out. Your best bet is to find a community that has their own events or play one of the larger servers. My personal favorite is the draconis expanse server which is very well run and adds a lot of depth imo.

The sounds in this game are plain terrible, so many sound bugs when using realistic setting. And even when they are working as intended, it's like it's coming through the cheapest headphone cable you can find, there is almost a scratch to it. You'll probably just turn it all the way down or off.

I'm recommending this game because despite the problems I have found a lot of fun in it, but someone with different tastes might find that the problems are not worth it. I'd pay triple this price for an updated space engineers with an engine that doesn't break so easily and properly done sounds, but that is never going to happen, this game is not likely to receive many, if any, major updates going forward. It's an incredible foundation with amazing opportunities, but set in a pretty lifeless world.

There are so many core mods that fundamentally change and add so much to this game, and thinking about it now, Space Engineers is really only kept active by the hard work of people tackling poorly optimized systems to turn this game into what it likely should have been. The base game itself would be okay if this game was marketed as a building simulator, but it is almost entirely just building. Nothing else. It's shown as an exploration and problem solving game, but the only problems are what you create for yourself and the shitty server lag. There's no real depth or excitement beyond building things. It would be a long dead pile of abandonware by now without the Workshop.

Modders have given this game a full fledged AI rewrite with dynamic difficulty and unique encounters with hundreds of custom made ships and stations, a much needed combat system overhaul, custom worlds and much more three dimensional challenges. Not to mention the insurmountable quantity of custom blocks, items, scripts, scenarios, and downright awesome builds. SE is MADE by mod makers at this point, and has been for years now.

And now most of the largest core systems that the modding community needs has been turned off arbitrarily, with no warning, betas, or any other kind of assistance. I know its entirely within Keen's right to make such changes, however it really is a fat spit in the face to all the mod makers and enjoyers to make a rushed, half baked pile of garbage ""celebration"" in the face of all the effort the community has gone to realize the game Keen couldn't, or wouldn't provide.  These people are the reason you are still turning a profit for fuck sakes! Sorry, you can't have your community-made content that generates no direct revenue to us, but you can have two blocks (one of which is fucking bugged as I'm writing this of course) and a flare gun. Also you can spend $2 to buy two skins they gave for free years ago and one random new one. Cosmetics. Asking for money as an anniversary. Honestly, modders should be asking them for money for the amount of stuff they put up with, especially when it comes to arbitrary changes.

The route Keen has taken on this unfinished game has been like a mobile game. ""Here, a semi-working product, now lets add more paid cosmetic blocks than there are in the base game."" This is what they've done, and it's getting old. There is still so little optimization for the kind of gameplay that was envisioned for this game, that modded singleplayer is really the only way to get good performance and large ship battles together. 

There has been videos and demonstrations of that a Space Engineers 2 would look like, and while it seems interesting and has some improvements over things like voxels in game, I honestly don't think I'll be picking it up if something like it ever releases from Keen. Much to how other people predict, I too believe they would likely squander it like they have done this game.

There was a lot of potential in SE's vision, and I truly do enjoy this game, but it really is getting worse and worse as time goes on.

This is because in survival you need to collect the resources and materials to build anything but once you build a good mining, a good welding, a good cutting, and a decent combat ship for the very very rare space pirate. There is no point in continuing to play survival mode. You might as well just switch to creative after that.

The Creative side of the game is great however, I have zero complaints for that. Although I like building things for a reason. I could build a very large ship capable of holding and sending out smaller resource collecting ships. But why? What could I do with that ship? I guess I could collect a ton of resources. but why? Once I realized that the answer to that was almost nothing. I completely stopped playing. I do have many hours in this game yes. and honestly I don't know where most of them came from but all I know is that I enjoyed every single one.

I don't mind all the DLC, mainly because they are all really good. However there is just nothing to do with the things you build. Yes there are pvp servers but I feel like most of the player base does not play on those so I never really played them. [i] I also don't like getting all my stuff destroyed and stolen while i'm offline. [/i] Yes you could collect a bunch of stuff but to build what?

One major gripe I have with it is the Warscore system. It's essentially this: you have two 'civs', Civ A versus Civ B. Civ A is a colossal, multiplanetary, robot-driven, hivemind empire. It hates organics, and wants to purge the galaxy. Civ B is a smaller, democracy-based, pacifist empire. Easy game, really.

But in the declaration of war that Civ A has to sign, they have to state the terms of this war. I'm not sure why (aside from game-balance), but this purging, killer robot has to state which planets he wants to take and strip of life. So he does: all of them.

However, that's too much! See, each planet has a certain currency of ""warscore"" behind it. You can only afford small amounts. So, the killer-genocide machine says ""Ok, I'll take...5 planets."" he can afford 5.

He does it with ease, and at the end of the war, Civ B accepts surrender, and cedes the planets. Now, it'd be even easier to take Civ B, but the war system has pulled another neat trick: A PEACE TREATY FOR 10 YEARS PRIOR TO THE WAR!

So, while the game lets you create a hivemind, genocide machine, who's mission it is to purge organic life, and can't even hold diplomacy with them, it also tells you that while this machine has no respect for organic life, it does have respect for:
-How many planets they ""should"" take at a time- wouldn't want to let this end too quickly now, right?
-Peace treaties, because while we are purging their population on other planets, it'd be barbaric to declare war again!

It's a very silly system for war, but also a big system in the game. You can get perks to make things cheaper, but even with all that, it still takes too much warscore for you to Blitzkreig an entire civilization off the galaxy.

As always Comments are turned off to prevent trolls, etc.

I tryed to enjoy this game I really did.

But i'm a mixed control player. (would like VR controller with Mo Capp but it doesnt exist)
I prefer controller for most games. I also like high tech immersion. but hey the tech just isn't there yet.

This game lacks that high tech controllable factor.
there was just way to many buttons to have to remember.
it made this game far to non neuro-diverseness friendly.

Well the game was right up my alley:
I cant recommend it.... The immersion was way off. 
had to spend way to many time hitting the buttons key binding to full enjoy it.

well i applaud its realism engine....
 Its a video game and people do want full immersion experience...
It is a space game and space physics are different for each galaxy and species.
my recommendation is maybe in the next updates the should focus on controller supports/play
and have a little bit more of that space future tech....",1697628257,1697628257,False,3,0,0.444622397422790527,0,True,False,False

The main issue to overcome here is literally just user-error, I promise, this will become more apparent the longer you play, be it construction of a vehicle, or construction of a mod list and so-on, always ponder: am I doing this **** right? 

Currently running 305ish mods in conjunction with each other, it all be functioning smoothly for single-player/multi-player, just so people get a rough idea of how far you can push it, the star system still loads up in 2-3 minutes and has barely any errors. 

Takes the term ""sandbox game"" to a new level, scripts are your friend and there are a lot of user-created ones that work and will make your lives 1000% easier. 

This is NOT a game to play without using mods, you are just reducing the overall experience you could be having by leaving out countless features that enhance the game.

If it doesn't exist then you can make it yourself and add it, there are a plethora of tools available to make this easier, as well. 

The modding community for this is unlike any other, truly out of this world, endless support and tutorials for everything you could ever need; modelling, textures, in-game scripting help, ect... All available through discord servers steam guides and github, where people are usually available to answer any questions.  

I'll save you some time and effort and just say, if something requires another mod to run, it needs to be ABOVE that mod in your mod list for singleplayer/multiplayer. 
As an example, if something requires weaponcore to run, you need to put that mod ABOVE weaponcore in the list. Not everyone gets that memo and I feel like it is genuinely one of the most important things that I learned far too late.

It's not very expansive, it doesn't have a lot of direction, and there isn't much to explore, especially without mods. And yet, I've never played a game as committed to its physics and mechanics, that allowed you to have so much control over what you build. It is nothing short of remarkable. If they gave a little more direction - not even missions or anything like that, but better scenarios with developed factions and more places to explore, then this game would be near perfect. And most anything that the game lacks is present in the incredible modding community. Mods sure don't make up for a company's mistakes in a game, but it absolutely makes the game that much more enjoyable, and Keen have been pretty helpful and encouraging with the modding community, especially compared to a lot of games of similar caliber.

That it has a creative mode that allows you to work out your designs before spending many hours building them in survival mode, which mode is great to have all on it's own (survival mode that is). There is so much to do in this game that I found myself spending several hours doing things when it felt like just a few minutes had passed. Which brings me to the part I hate about this game - the learning curve! Wow. It has a significant learning curve that in some areas seems like the ""curve"" is a straight line going up! I just want to take a moment and recognize the many players who have helped me get a handle on this game - even though they are not aware of doing so. Players like Beeblebum who made some tutorial videos you can access on YouTube. Also Splitsie who's tutorial videos that are now some 5 years old are still solid examples to follow and get into this game. Kanajashi has some very good example videos as well. There are MANY others who spend great effort and time to do this for new players, with great cost to themselves in time and effort (spending all that time in the game specifically to record demonstrations and then more time and effort in editing it all down so a new player can digest it) - I don't think these people get enough credit for all that they give of themselves, and that it's all for free on YouTube! 

Once you get a handle on things, especially the simple things like knowing to hold the Control key while clicking the left mouse button in order to get the text input for things like specifying the number or percentage of the movement of a piston for example, I think it was Splitsie whom mentioned this in one of his videos. That was a game changer for me at that time! THANK YOU SPLITSIE! Where was I, oh yea, once you get a handle on things this game can really become an environment to get lost in. It's beautifully done, when you are immersed in the game time fly's by, as I said before, hours seem like minutes.

I have found one thing that I just don't get, maybe it's just me, but sometimes I get real heavy lag in my game, but only when I'm connected to the internet. Once I've disconnected the internet and play ""offline"" I never get that lag. Even though I tend to play in the games setting of ""offline"" as long as I'm actually connected to the internet at all it will eventually cause a lag in my game that requires me to exit and come back in, only to get that lag again in a few minutes. Never seems to happen if I'm physically disconnected from the internet.

I tend to write books when commenting - even when commenting in a YouTube channel, so I apologize for going on and on ... and on. Just get this game, find some tutorials on YouTube (the people I've mentioned have great and simple to follow ones) and get to becoming a great Space Engineer! (I'm still working on that last part myself - a long, long way yet to go, but that's just me.)",1697232569,1697232569,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is confusing and buggy as fuck - sometimes you just need to reboot the game for things to work, other times you'll go crazy trying to find that ""needle in a haystack"" that is preventing things from working. Survival mode is WAY too monotonous, and Creative mode is way too cheese. There's no real automation, and what automation there is is WAY too confusing - if you work really hard, you might be able to get your miner vehicle to automate going from Point A to Point B, but resources at Point B are limited. There is a 100 m/s velocity which is WAY too slow - you'll easily spend an hour (real time) doing nothing but flying from 1 planet to another - and you cant do anything else during that time, because the velocity will kill you if you get out of the chair. There are random, strange sounds like your ship being destroyed despite no enemies being around (bug?). The color-designation of an ""off grid"" piece (""burnt orange"") is WAY too similar to a broken/incomplete piece (""crimson red""). NOTHING in this game is well described. There is no way to ""hide"" the massive number of pieces that require DLC, so if you havent bought dlc then scrolling through the ""available"" pieces is highly annoying as most are not actually available, but because the descriptions are so poor, you dont know what any of them do anyhow. For example, there is ""light armor"" block and ""heavy armor"" block, ""Large Thrusters"" and ""Thrusters""... and they want you to ""engineer"" stuff (""ships"") without knowing the weight difference between light or heavy, or thrust power between thrusters, and that's not even getting into the whole large vs small block discussion, which doesn't always seem to work right. 

There are parts of this game that are truly amazing. Building a ship and flying into space, with the sun and other planets, is really a good feeling. Getting something new to work, and constantly trying to make working things better is also really cool.

The only reason this game exists is because it is the only one of its scale and type. If any other space themed sandbox building game were to come out it would likely be better than this for a couple of reasons. 

-The way the building grid is organised is fucking terrible. 
         -There is little compatibility between small grid and large grid. 
         -Building in large grid limits one 'block' per grid. This means that a light bulb takes up as much space as a full block. 
         -Building anything in gravity gets fucked up. 
-Decorating your ship requires 5+ DLC
-Programming your ship requires insane amounts of work and the UI is frustrating to work with
-Poor performance + requires unreasonable amount of storage
-Overall annoying UI
-Poor graphics

Bottom line, I already own it, and I used to put a LOT of time into it.  Now I play it when I have nothing else to do because it's still broken and it never gets fixed.



primary 'gaming' system
R7 5800X3D CPU
RX 6900XT GPU
64GB 3600 CL16 DDR 4 RAM (4 sticks of 16)
1T Gen4 NVMe Steam drive

GTX 1070FE (no GUI on the dedicated server so the GPU has no bearing on server performance)
32GB  3200 CL16 DDR4 RAM
Samsung EVO 950 512GB Steam drive

Not the fastest, but far from minimum specs & way above recommended specs


Pros & cons


Pros:

There are a LOT of mods available on Steam, 

Their dedicated server is free

It supports scripting

You can make your own weapons and complex machines  by combining blocks

The menu background videos are entertaining 

Large youtube presence

When it does run, it's a lot of fun but ONLY in it's modded form.


Cons: 
Mods are ONLY supported in experimental mode, which the devs are quick to tell you is unstable and may not be supported.  

So while there are over 125K (Not a typo, one hundred twenty-five thousand) mods on Steam they all are on a use at your own risk basis.  Mind you, the mod devs themselves are much, much, much more helpful than the game devs

Unfortunately, mods are what make this game fun

There is NO undo so when you delete something by mistake, you have to re-create the missing block or blocks

The dedicated server is primitive and takes hours to set up and get running

There is logging for the server, but interpreting the logs is not documented and is pretty much useless

Scripting is best suited for programmers, especially those proficient in C, so not really scripting, more like programming to compensate for the many, many deficiencies in the game

The UI is very basic and primitive.  To get a compass, minimap, or even color in your HUD or build menu, you will need mods. 

This game takes a LONG time to load with a decent list of mods (like literally, minutes...) so it's a good thing that they are at least interesting.

The game save 'backups' don't work.  Too many times I've lost hours and hours of work because neither the primary, nor any of the backups, nor even the prior file saves will load without crashing.  And for help, you only have the worthless log files (see above)

Also, the save files are wayyyy too fragile.  What do I mean by that?  I have had games cease to load right after saving them just because I lost power or the game locked up and had to be aborted.  That is nothing short of ridiculous.  and as mentioned  in the section about the useless backups, loading one of the 'backups' doesn't allow me access from then on to any of the work I had done in that game save.  All that time and work ends up being wasted and the save is effectively worthless, complete with all of its 'backups'

...and the 'cons' list goes on and on.


Purists will all say, 'don't use mods then'.  Sorry Charlie, I use mods, period.  If it has mods, I will most likely use them.  If you offer modding support it needs to be backed up with tools and at least a useable means of diagnostics. Otherwise, you might as well not even bother to include modding support.


And here's a thought for something which would knock everybody's socks off...
How about putting effort into fixing the problems it already has instead of making more $$$ grabs with skin changes???



Summary:
Single player-  It's an ok game when it works but know all of your work is going to be lost at some point no matter what you do to protect it.  There are a lot of other voxel based games out there, some of which are nearly as old, and many others which have better gameplay, graphics, features, capabilities, and most importantly, stability.  And while Space Engineers is not the worst of the voxel genre games, it's closer to the bottom than to the top compared to the other dozen or more that I personally either own or have played.

Multiplayer-
The game is an ok time killer which *can* be fun if you get a decent assortment of mods to work together, but be prepared to spend a whole lot of hours troubleshooting, adjusting, troubleshooting again, adjusting again and waiting on the server to do multi-minute loads in between all those adjustments.  Also, know that your game will be lost for good despite any number of 'backups' you might make.


Bottom Line:
I can only recommend it if you have nothing else to do and you already have the game
Or
Get this when it's discounted at least 90% off, (although more would be better), and be patient and willing and ready to spend a lot of time fiddling around if you decide to run a server",1644859679,1696881153,False,13,0,0.578459203243255615,0,True,False,False

That would be fine if you could do everything with just the keyboard, but no, you either need to move your off hand all over your keyboard or you've got to keep moving your dominant hand between the keyboard and mouse. It feels way clunkier than it needs to be, and I would really recommend taking a page out of Blender's playbook by just having a rotate button (like R) and then a simple XYZ rotation GUI. Anything that lets me keep my off hand in the same spot so I don't have to completely upend years of gaming/CAD experience.

Recently I decided to get back to it and the developers decided to become really pushy with DLC. They litter the in-game build menus with options of DLC items you don't have for no reason other than to push you to buy the DLC. It's sad to see the developers of a game I enjoy so much resort to this sort of actions to get more money. It just seems desperate. See I didn't get the DLC because I was just returning and I had no idea how to play the base game anymore, let alone with the DLC, but now I just don't want to buy the DLC and give you the evidence that shady DLC sales tactics work. In fact, it makes me want to go play Satisfactory instead.

This issue has been brought up to the developers through the official channels. They believe it's working as intended. As in, they didn't accidentally forget the menu littered with options you can't select to push you to buy their DLC. They think it is a legitimate sales technique, to pester their customers for more money in such a way.

My negative review is a small act of protest against this behavior and why it is being done. It's just unprofessional and greedy behavior.

First, there is no tutorial, the pathetic ones they give, don't teach you how to actually do anything.
One example is ""Refill your O2/H2"".  But they don't tell you how.
The other major problem is movement.
Bad movement will kill interest in any game.
When you turn on the jetpack, and move your mouse in any direction, you end up spinning out of control.  It's maddening, it's sickening!
I thought Empyrion was bad, this game is 1000 time worse.  Because at least Empyrion had a ""Level Out"" key to right yourself.  Thre's no such key in this.  It became unplayable.
plus the movement, in jetpack mode, will constantly kill you, with impact damage on everything you touch.

There is a lot of stuff in there, that could be an awesome game.  Until they fix movement, it's a hard pass!

The ability to create is incredible, and more gets added constantly.
Much like Minecraft and maybe Skyrim though, this game is elevated by its mod community. 
SE will give you some hilarious moments, and a way to create.

However, there are some downsides.
The base game doesn't have all the content (mainly parts and skins) that the DLC has, and if you want to design anything worth a look, you will want the DLCs. They are fairly priced though, not P2W, and most importantly, will not stop you from playing from someone who does / not have them.

The physics engine is pretty good, though weird clangy stuff still happens, so save often.

PVE still doesn't really exist without mods. It's coming, I think. But until then I suggest running mods like MES, and don't expect the world. Mods will give enough to tide you over, but we're all waiting for Keen implemented PVE.

Brings me to Keen - one of the few dev teams I've seen who actually listen to what their playerbase says about their game. How far this game has come in a few years is partially thanks to the listening ear Keen gives us. I know they gotta add stuff that makes them money, I have zero issues with it, but the adding requested things and general bug fixing is great.

It's still a bit difficult to get into the game at first. There's a bit of a wall you have to climb before you know enough to make what you want happen. It's not inherently bad, but the game could do with a ""New players start here, we got a guided walkthrough""  section like many other games have.

All in all, worth my 1200 hours. I bought before planets were even released and there was enough to keep me interested.

Though it still has the apparent bug here or there (though I haven't personally encountered any on my recent vanilla run) nothing like what it once was and the content that's been added has now given so much more possibilities to this game. The dlc's are a bit of a (minor) frustration but its done well in that they at least are more less cosmetic thus not removing potential content or creating ""cut content"" for a price, as well as not making it a pay to get an edge type deal and they are at a somewhat reasonable price so im not really devastated by it. 

I would Love to see another bundle pack added for all the dlc that are not currently included in the deluxe or add the (function adding dlc) to the deluxe. As I do agree that the game deserves some extra revenue which helps with further development, (as long as the content is worth the price being charged.... Looking at you Creative Assembly, Sega, all the rest hahaha 🙄😑😡). When you tally up all the dlc and it's much more than the actual game that's when there's an issue!

Good game with its slower pace and more inteligence(?) based building with conveyers and other complex components. Vanilla is nice but can be better with mods and DLC's.

It's all fun until u start to build a rover and spaceship. The rover will run through obstacles or fall towards a cliff or move too fast and get flipped upside down and unmovable. It just stayed there forever. Sad, lonely, devastated and unmovable and was forced to spend an eternity alone on the darkest night. The spaceship however is quite interesting because it is guaranteed to explode whenever something goes wrong. You build a cool-looking spaceship, u enter the cockpit and u think to yourself ""Finally it's done, let's fly!"" but unfortunately it's too heavy to fly. Boohoo. You added more rockets to it and now it's ugly. Boohoo. But hey at least it can fly. So u managed to fly and u fly so fast and the gyroscope fucked up your flight path and you crash into the mountain or straight up to the ground. Its explode. Its deadass explodes. If u were lucky only 1/4 of the spaceship's body is destroyed. It's hard to repair because the whole spaceship is not balanced and adding a rocket to stabilize it will only make it much worse as the rocket will only push it away and move constantly. Been there done that. So u thought to yourself ""What if I build a new one and it is like this, perhaps it will work"" for the next new spaceship. Spoiler alert, it doesn't work. Something will definitely go wrong somewhere and cause the spaceship to explode. So yeah, u repeat the cycle of hell again and again like Doctor Strange confronting Dormammu.

As a Clang worshipper myself I must reccomend this game. No, it's not the best thing I've ever played and sure it can be boring at times but it has a charm. You can build absolutely anything. The ability to spend hours on something and see it actually work is incredible. Engineers work out of necessity, and I love that feeling about survival mode. It's a little slow at first but feels great. The game itself does feel empty, but with mods it can be insanely fast paced and full of action. From new enemy bases and npc ships to literally just HUD colors and animated interaction. I'm not too fond of the devs Making the updates all just re-skin DLCs but I still buy them cause they're cool. Game is pretty fun with a group and hilarious but can also be a great way to relax by yourself if you're into that sort of thing.

TLDR is at the bottem.

honestly love this game, and I put way too many hours in this game, but I always come back to this and can't put it down. there's just something about this that always draws me back.

I mean don't get me wrong there's lots that could be improved in this game. and the servers could be better. but honestly its not too bad. Alot of mods fix those issues. 

its fun to play with friends, and even still with the amount of hours I got,  I still learn new things every time I play. Its a fun game. and a great way to get that creative survival fix. mind you the survival could be better, but mods fix that.

graphics and game engine are dated, but thats to be expected, 

honestly its just fun, complicated at 1st, but once you get the hang of things its pretty simple.

You'll never know how many thrusters you need for your ship to not crash (there is nothing telling you how much lift power each offers) when its either empty or full. Nothing telling you how much fuel time you have or how much fuel usage you have.
The biggest bug is the simple fact that sometimes even the smallest damage to your ship will cause it to explode. This is known as Klang (Yes the community has given it a name since it's such a big issue that has never been addressed from day 1 of release 10 years ago). Landed a ship softly on your connector? Tried connecting the ship to your base? Explosion, your cargo, engine and internal conveyors are all damaged, now you have to remove parts to get inside and fix them. Tried mining a mineral ore? Game doesn't recognise that it's there, proceeds to throw your ship around damaging it. Back to base to for supplies because your thruster is damaged.
Overall the game becomes increasingly annoying and painful to play due to bugs in the game engine. Great idea and good looking game but an absolute travesty and horrid example of development.
Playing on planets or anywhere near gravity is an absolute waste of time. Broken physics engine, broken lighting engine and buggy voxels will simply cause your ships to explode and crash for seemingly no reason.
There is basically little to not information within the game to help you on your journey. For example you might be spending a lot of time looking for resources such as Cobalt and Platinum. Well heres a tip (found this in a random comment on the wiki) - if you see black spots on a ice lake those are resources under the ice.
There is no reason to visit other planets. They offer nothing of value that yours already doesn't have nor have anything else going on for them.
You can spawn in space but you'll quickly realise there is nothing really to do other than building a big space ship to... do nothing with it. Sure you can hunt down clunky, weak and random AI but that gets boring quickly. 
Or you can try Multiplayer and enjoy the lag, bugs and the rare chance of meeting someone in game.

I regret to say it's not particularly the case.

The game itself is of the same stripe as Minecraft (Gigantic sandbox with a tiny bit of survival mechanics) and while I fully acknowledge this genre is not particularly my cup of tea, there are several issues with it that go past that:

First of all, the ingame physics are incredibly janky, to the point it could give Bethesda a run for its money. I assume that it's kind of inevitable, considering that it's aimed at handling potentially massive structures moving at high speeds with a lot of interactions between different parts; so something is bound to slip through the cracks. But even, it can be seriously frustrating.

The UI is an absolute mess. If you are working on anything bigger than a small ship/platform, it's is an absolute pain to both navigate and operate.

There's simply nothing to do. Once you got the absolutely basic survival needs taken care of and have some resources, there's nothing to push the player forward. The game itself kind of acknowledges this by offering some more conventional, objective-centered missions, but they largely fall flat due to how shallow the game mechanics are: The ""research system"" is completely tacked on. Combat on foot is an exercise in frustration due to the enemies having pinpoint accuracy and you dying in three shots, requiring you to play hide and seek with the turrets until you destroy them. The diplomacy system and commerce system...exist, I guess.

I assume you can get some fun out of it if you play it as a multiplayer experience (Probably with a hefty helping of mods on the side), but if you prefer single player games, don't even bother with this one.

I won't waste your time, I promise. Let's get straight to the point.

[h2]What is this game about?[/h2]
Space Engineers is an amazing game, like few I have ever played. And I am a guy that plays many genres like RTS, FPS, strategy games, city builders, RPGs, etc. Extremely amazing in terms of mechanics, infinite possibilities, and gameplay. It's best play with friends, although it is also worth playing it in solo mode. You will get to build vehicles, spaceships, machines, factories (I am not kidding), and every single thing physics and imagination can get you to conceive. You will mine asteroids or live in them. You will travel around huge solar systems, explore space, explore other planets, and build for any possible space exploration experience. However, the experience is more complex than what you may think.

Space Egineers is best described as a Minecraft for adults, young curious people, and [b]engineers[/b]. Yeah, I said it right, 'engineers'. As the game mainly includes all sorts of mechanics and systems you get to study in an engineering career. You get to see propulsion systems whose power you can measure in KN (kilonewtons), rotors, sensors, programming blocks, physics, and many other sorts of mechanics I am definitly not getting into detail, like chemistry involved in the refining of the minerals mined throghout the planets.

[h2]Who is this game for?[/h2]
[b]IF AND ONLY IF[/b] 
[list]
    [*]You are willing to learn about a complex but rewarding game in detail through videos and manuals, the challenge is for you. You don't need to be an engineer to play the game, but engineers will definitely feel familiar within the environment the game provides. You will get to catch on fast.

    [*]If you are a more casual player, but love studying how to solve problems and how things work, the game is also for you. You have to be a curious person.
[/list]

[h2]Who would I not recommend this game to?[/h2]
To people looking for a campaign, space FPS, RPG or a quick-to-learn game. For those who have no patience. 

[h2]My experiece with this game...[/h2]
This pretty much what you can expect.

Convo 1:
-""Dude, we need our first spaceship/vehicle to get minerals faster"".
-""You know what? We should build an automatic drill for this instead of using spaceships to get minerals"". 
-""Dude, that's easy. I mean, I don't know crap about it, but logic says we could use rotors and pistons to get it down this area"".
-""Well, let's calculate the weight to hold it up and have engouh power"".
-""I mean, we are poor rn, we can't use nuclear reactors to power it up"".
-""Then, let's build it not as a mobile vehicle but as a some sort of static platform. Like an extension to our base using eolic and solar energy to power it up"".
-""You know what would be cool? Let's use this same design but transformed into a spaceship to drill a whole asteroid. Then, let's build in it"".
-""Yeah, and we could build a fleet of programmable drones to keep it safe from enemies"".
-""Ok, I'll check on a basic algorithm and the documentation to program the drones"".
-""Ok then, while you do that, I'll build the spaceship to get us up there"".
-""Let me hop into building of the drill for the minerals from this planet then"".


Convo 2:
-""Dude, you know what? We should build a satellite that could act like the Death Star from Star Wars!"".
-""Let's build it on orbit then. That's easier than launching it to space"".

Convo 3: 
-""Man, let's build flagships, like huge ships that can become our base, transport vehicles and allow us to move to other planets"".

So, I've been playing Space Engineers for a while now, and I just had to share how awesome it is. If you're into creative and exploration games, this one's a gem.

The game keeps getting better with regular updates, adding cool stuff and making it even more fun to play. The range of features and items they keep throwing in is seriously impressive.

Building your own spaceships and stations is where it's at. You can get as creative as you want, and trust me, it's a blast. Plus, exploring the vastness of space with your creations is a feeling like no other.

The game's not just about building, though. There's this whole survival aspect too, and it's a real challenge. You'll need to gather resources, manage your energy, and fend off threats. It keeps you on your toes.

The best part? You can do all of this with friends. Teaming up to construct epic structures or going on wild space adventures together is a total blast.

In a nutshell, Space Engineers is hands down the best creative/exploration space game out there. It's always evolving, so you'll never run out of things to do. If you're into space and creativity, give it a shot.

Happy exploring!

I'm going to modify my last review to do a more pros/cons approach.  We'll hit the cons first.
1.  This game is harder than most to get into, mostly because of the poorly arranged parts list and lacking starter tutorials (most games are the same control setup, this one has a few extra keys).
2.  The physics engine is questionable.  There's even a word for it - Klang (or Clang).  If you want to see the problem fastest, just put some pistons on a rotor and try to make a crane.  You'll soon see all kinds of wobble, then later it'll explode and parts will go everywhere (on the positive side for this...or negative if you're a server operator - you can make propulsion engines using the poor physics simulation - called Klang engines, that cost no fuel to propel your craft).
3.  There are a bunch of DLC that don't address the major bugs of the game, though they have made some forward progress to address some of the things consoles miss that PC versions of the game have.
4.  Encounters are solely based on chance / RNG and there is no persistence where AI moves across the universe with purpose (maybe there are mods that kind of grapple with this).
5.  The only NPCs in the game are ships.  Even the mods to add NPCs with character models are kind of blah.
6.  The AI that does exist that controls the NPC ships (or the blocks you can use) have trouble with pathfinding through anything more complex than empty space.
7.  The scripts rely too much on server side processing.  I'm not sure there's any client side at all.  This means most server owners will disallow scripts by the majority of players because it will lag the hell out of their servers, so no automated mining scripts.  Besides, the scripts don't work on the console version of the game.
8.  Most of my games work on Linux now.  This game has one of the worst Linux portabilities out of my entire collection (about $3K worth of games) out of the games that will run on Linux.  The fact that this game works on Linux at all is an accident of course (and it wasn't designed to do so by the devs), but it's a royal pain in the ass to get going.
8.  There are no defined asteroid positions or asteroid fields, they're just individual asteroids that are RNG'd into place as you explore.  There are no areas with more asteroid or less density and you can't create those zones as a server operator either, the asteroid RNG just is. The only way to address this as a server owner is to make different regions of space with different servers and use mods to change ore types on some of the servers.
9.  If you want water instead of just ice on planets, you'll need a mod for that.
10.  This last con is just informational, I know there's a reason for it and I wouldn't ever want to make a multiplayer game that had these considering how much processing and information transfer would have to take place:  there are no planetary orbits / any orbits of anything at all.  Everything is static in position.

Now for the positives.
1.  You can build very complex ships out of all the parts available.
2.  You can fly in space and on planets and it has amazing space to planet full transition.
3.  You do have to account for gravity and the gravity transition is gradual, from 0G to full.  The planets have varying G forces between different planets.
4.  You can mine different types of minerals on both planets (at varying depths) and in space on asteroids.
5.  There are 3 different thruster types, atmospheric, hydrogen, and ion, with somewhat realistic thrust for each.
6.  The game has one of the most active mod workshops on Steam with thousands of mods (none available for consoles of course - if you use the console version, you can only play on vanilla servers, sorry).

This is a recommendation for the game.  I hope the next engine has better physics, NPC character models, better pathfinding for the AI, and Linux support.",1531093370,1695003972,True,0,0,0,4,True,False,False

----------------

my frist review of this game was in 2013 in early access, i now have thousands of hours of time in this game and still love it. they delopers are constantly bringing out new updates. even if you dont want to pay for the dlc you still get stuff with every update. ai update was alot of fun to make little flyers follow around a big ship even watching them crash into eachother trying to follow the mother ship. 

this game has all bases covered if you want a survival game you can have it. if you want a creative game you got it. 

first person shooter? yep got that too. 

space combat? thats in this aswell

random encounters are a little underwelming but exploreing to find random faction bases in survial to sell and recive goods is fun in my oppinion",1383582202,1694960926,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

So to enter a game that is 10 years old should be very interesting. And it kind of is. The company used a game called Mining Wars as the jump off point for this game. And, most impressive (I think) is that the game engine was written by the owner. (and probably others) It is impressive because you need a good head for graphics creation, server code, client code, mathematics and science, and where to grab modules that will aid in areas of your engine to jump forward. 

Now according to the company, this game supports Real Time Illumination. Well with my AMD card you could have fooled the hell out of me. If you dig a hole down and lateral to get ore, you can easily walk out of the hole. But if you go deep enough, the textures are all one thing and even near the light source it is easy to get lost since the textures are all identical. You get no 3D sense of space to know even what is up or down. (a sensation in SCUBA diving that gets some people killed) So I would say that they failed in that implementation.

The physics is pretty good...to a point. Everything is controlled by gravity on earthlike planets, and by the lack of gravity on some moons or in space.  The downside to the physics?  I have had to start my game at least 10 times in a row due to how my pod landed on the earthlike planet. Instead of a soft landing that sticks, landing in a tree or on an incline can mean rolling down the slope until your craft stops upside down. Many in the forums say this is a newer bug but it is a bug ignored by the developers.

There is no story after 10 years of existence so it is a little like being a kid and getting a huge box of erector toys and told - ""Now give me a ship even though you have 100 items and no way how they combine for your ship."" Fortunately, there is a plethora of tutorials to help you on your way. Yet the difficulty and learning curve is what my 40 hours represents. I finally landed in an interesting place (stone, ore, and ice are all in close proximity to my ship) and I was able to build a base and start a new ship without too many delays. My only delay now is learning how to know where to get ores and finding Cobalt.

Now the most general aspect -- game play. Construction of anything in any builder game (Techtonica, Satisfactory, etc) requires that the snapping system works flawlessly to be fun. This game fails in the flawlessness. Let's discuss my ship build for mining. So I laid down a small landing pad...it was laying on it's side but it was green and when I clicked it, it was right side up, and then 4 small blocks. The firrst to go down was my cockpit. So I positioned myself above the top block and ... the cockpit snapped on it's side. Now it is pressing a matrix of PgUp, PgDn, Del, Ins hoping to find the combination that puts it right side up. I finally get it but a move of my hand moves it off the stack. Oops. No problem I snap it back and....it is on it's side once again. Another mystery game of buttons and finally it gets put in place. Now comes the drill, which should be easy since the drill mates to a unit on the seat. Yup, it is up, but when I go higher and look down the drill was in the wrong place. Remove it, get 100% back (gratefully) and it finally snaps into the right place. This will coninues with everything I build. At least in other games if you get the position you want then move away, it retains that position when you return. (sigh)

The other things is just basics. For example, if there is a list of items you created there is no way to get them all out at once. Likewise with storage you cannot say ""Move all my components into the storage"" Flight is strange since you can go forward and back but cannot strafe.  Hit the typical strafe keys and you are rotated instead. And when you swing the mouse while flying you will also tilt instead of move. Aye what a time of it. So much of my fly time right now is straightening myself up. 

Now you might think I'm giving this a bad review. But I'm just setting expectations. This is a complex game which actually makes it fun for me. It is a mental challenge. And when you build a ship using a tutorial and see it coming together you can only stand and stare at it and say WOW. Research is strange because you ""research"" by building something to open up the next tier of goodies. And some critical things (like your atmosphere jets) require rare resources that may leave your ship on stilts longer than you want. But I image that first time you get into the ship and fly it you feel a great feeling of accomplishment! (I wouldn't know yet because I've not found Cobalt to finish my engines)

So if you like mental challenges and feelings of accomplishment then this game is definitely for you. The strangeness of the game is it's character. Buy it, it's cheap and a great time synch.",1694903801,1694903801,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The main gamemode is free play survival on a planet, you build a small base, mine rocks, mine rocks, mine rocks, oh god do you have to mine rocks. Then after mining rocks, building a base, unlocking the tech tree, making a rover to find resource deposits, stocking up on every resource you can get on the planet, its then time to try to fly. It took me dozens of hours to get something off the ground and after 150 hours im still bad at it. Once you manage to get into space on a jalopy of a craft finding rare resources that can only be found in asteroids, building a massive mothership, several asteroid miners, finding more resources, and maxing out your mothership. From there mods are the only way forward to fight enemy npc's, installing automated defenses, shields, making fighter craft to engage in pve against npc space stations.

Or you can pvp on a server once you've reached that stage, there are a ton of rpg servers,

They also have several gamemodes. With wave hoard defense, missions, theres a gamemode where you start with a tiny jank rover and go on death stranding missions for locating packages to return for money to upgrade your rust bucket into something fun, dozens of hours of hard work struggling to keep the vehicle operational until you can save enough to buy something that can actually fly or fight.

Dozens of hours with friends watching them crash into asteriods, trying to salvage their wrecks, figuring out how to setup LCD screens to display the motherships inventory, ammo, battery percentage, going from powering your ship off of hydrogen to uranium, becoming harder and harder to kill while raising the timer on how long before you have too actually go collect fuel from an hour to actual days. Designing better drilling ships, fighters, remaking new motherships with star wars esk hangars.

This is a game which I will cautiously recommend, because I genuinely do have contented memories of solitary mining during the fourth watch of the night, while listening to a recent episode of the ""Ukraine: The Latest"" podcast in the background.  Emotionally, Space Engineers is the equivalent of Stardew Valley for the highly functioning autistic.  It's ""comfy."" It's a game that Spock might view as a security blanket.

At least until recently, the automation was a mixed bag.  The potential is less only than Factorio, but I consider C# a truly horrible programming language; although a recent update introduced a number of appliance items which make automation much easier for non-programmers.  That is very welcome, but I would truthfully also prefer that the developers replace the C# API with Lua, if that is possible.

Another detriment is that while the PvP seems quite good, in combat terms, PvE/single player content is almost completely non-existent.  Granted, I normally always play Factorio with the biters turned off, but it would be nice if the in-game environment here was a little less sterile.

Space Engineers is not a game that I would consider mainstream, or for absolutely everyone.  For its' target audience though, (of which, to a degree, I am a member) it is solid.  It's also cheap enough that I can recommend checking it out.

Want to begin your first game with that scenario? Pay! Want to create a ship out of that workshop blueprint? The guy who made it payed, so you should as well! Want to use that block in your build, that functions exactly the same and just looks slightly different? Pay!!!!

I wanna talk specifically about last one. Payed blocks show up ingame with only hint that its paywalled being small icon in the corner. The same type of icon that half of non payed items use as well, so it doesnt exactly tell you right there that its payed. And its only when you try to use it, you realise you cant, and when you read the item description, it says you have to buy a DLC for that. That is so so so so so f-ed up.

One more game to prove the point, that pirates get better experience for lower price. Its not criminals who keep piracy alive, its games like this one.

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

The attention to detail on the blocks can lead to sleek designs or hard industrial designs spewing smoke. DLCs aim to expand the current options for a base game player, and do not give an explicit advantage to those who have purchased it over those who have not.

[b] I have only played single player, or multiplayer with a small group of friends. [/b] As such, my points will be tailored toward this type of experience and will not address PVP servers or Servers with low PCU limits. (PCU is the way a block is counted to keep server strain lower. For example a armor block will be 1 PCU while a solar panel might be 45)

[h3] Things I like about the game: [/h3]
~Game is still being updated and refined for a better player experience
~Physics are well done and allow for full 360 fields of motion, both in atmosphere and in space
~Numerous options allow for a player to optimize the game to their PCs capabilities, or can be turned off entirely to push the game engine to its limits
~Active Workshop community - Want a new ship/rover/building for inspiration or you just can't get one built quite right? Head to workshop and find new designs each week. Want a new planet with unique locations, weather, or hazards? Go to the Workshop. Want new kinetic, energy or plasma weaponry? You guessed it, its on the Workshop. Want to tweak a behavior or look of a block (such as the color of thruster plumes)? Check the Workshop. Almost anything you want can be found there. 
~You can create your own experience by choosing how you want to play. You aren't forced into any style of play. For example, if you want to play survival but don't want to grind for resources, you can turn on creative mode tools and spawn some in, without having to worry about the game punishing you for it. Or you can create your own star system, add POI to it, and then swap over to survival without any repercussions.
~Or, if you want, the game has a list of Scenarios that you can play, ranging from an abandoned outpost that you have to piece together what happened there, to a PVP arena, to drone wave survival. The newest Scenario has a Workshop edition where you can create your own version of it, allowing for new experiences each time you play it.
~You can create ships in creative, save them by creating a blueprint and load it into a projector to build in your survival world. This creates an easy way to test your designs without wasting tons of time and resources.
~While the base game PVE is lacking (IMO), there are numerous mods that address this, with varying levels of difficulty. See Assertive Combat Systems for an easier experience and Reavers or Pravda Heavy Industries for harder encounters. 
~Survival can encourage building new ships for situations; they aren't completely necessary, but the game is much more enjoyable by building them
~Creativity is your limit (99% of the time, anyways)

[h3] Things I don't like: [/h3]
~The vanilla game lacks dynamic PVE drone encounters. Abandoned wrecks can be fun, but vanilla drones are lackluster, especially compared to modded ones
~Different planets don't have anything that encourages travel between them, besides different weather events. While a couple mods address this, it is very noticeably missing in the base game
~Creativity is needed to enjoy this game. (not a bad thing, but it can be annoying sometimes)
For example, while I could build a ship that has a refinery bay large enough to rival a industrial world from Warhammer 40k, enough cargo to haul a small moon's worth of resources, and have all the guns so that it could delete the irl sun in a 1v1, that would quickly make the game boring (for me, you might like this, and that's completely fine). Instead, I can build an industrial ship with exposed refineries and dangerous catwalks hanging over the void, leading to tense moments where I hope an enemy doesn't spot me. I could have cargo ships with bays for small shuttles to transfer resources throughout my fleets and bases, leading to potential supply chains and a need to watch my ammo usage and restock my warships. This could then lead me to having a warship with enough guns to win fights, but not so many that fights either become boring, or running the risk of running out of ammo in the middle of the fight, forcing me to pay attention to my battles so I don't make a mistake and lose the fight. 

[hr][/hr]

All of that is to say that you will need to be creative with the way you build and play, and you might run into a wall after a while. In this way, it is like Minecraft for me. I play hard for a few days, weeks, etc., but then I will have to take a break for a bit, to recharge my creativity in the game, or else I just stare at my screen not doing anything. Many problems you will find naturally through playing the game, and many you will have to create yourself, either through mods or by limiting yourself purposely to come up with new ways to design your worlds.",1694145548,1694145548,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This has come a really long way from its noble beginnings.  There are scenarios to play, pirates to fight, or you can go totally oldschool and just focus on surviving.  The planetary play is much harder to figure out compared to the space play, so i suggest starting in space first.

The survival mode's early game grind is satisfying, especially as you find ways to build more efficient mining infrastructure. I also like the direction the game's updates are heading.


But I think it leaves a lot to be desired. The updates it's getting now are just big enough to be considered new content, and they all have a paid DLC associated that contains the most fun stuff, even if technically the functionality is in the base game. 
The suggestion page is looked at once every decade by the looks of it, and the most fun ideas are getting rejected with no reason given. Even bugfixes! 
Every fan seems to have a ""I love the game, but I wish they would add..."", and as seen on the 
suggestions board, some of these are shared by more than a thousand players


That's why I can only recommend buying the game discounted and if you're fine with it as is. It's bordering on abandonware territory, and it won't take adding one new minor functionality per year to fix that. 
Even if the effort is going towards SE2, they shouldn't milk this game like that. Either perfect what's already there and leave it be, or accept the most wanted suggestions for fun new mechanics and keep growing the game and putting in effort. 

Instead, we are stuck with a game where your creation that took you a few days to complete can just shake itself into explosion for no reason, and the animals act like temporary placeholders, meanwhile the devs are busy making 2 paid retextures of a few existing blocks per year.


As a side note, another game with what I find to be similar treatment from the devs is GTA Online. Rockstar only barely focuses on it about twice a year, as long as it keeps bringing in money. But even these updates usually feature a new gun, at least a few new vehicles, some with new mechanics, tons of clothes, and even a short storyline of missions. 
And look at the hate Rockstar Games gets for this. 
I don't want a game as unique as Space Engineers to share the same fate before it even feels finished

Overall, while the review is marked as positive to honor what the game is, it barely changed for the past few years. I can't really say I recommend rewarding the devs with money because a lot of potential of a good game is being wasted like that.",1633346964,1693958343,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Basicly, SE is like a computer simulation of Lego Technic with realistic physics and a huge enviroment, with huge voxel planets in it. You can build lots of different contraptions, vehicles, spaceships and buildings; basicly you're limited only by your own imagination and the games' engine limits, which are also quite generous, if you have a good enough computer.

Some might say that there is no point in building stuff in SE, becouse the game has only basic AI enemies and no specific quests, but for me that's part of a sandbox game design. Basicly, you have to make your own goals, like building a space station or reaching and landing on Mars or any other planet (there's currently eight of them, with different gravity and weather). If you're up for a fight, you can also attack NPC ships and stations which randomly spawn in space and on planets.

If you need goals, you can also load the scenarios which come with the base game; those have scripted events, specific tasks to do and enemies which attack you.

Here is a list of the most obvious pros and cons:

PROS:
[list]
    [*]The game has one of the currently best and most realistic physics engines
    [*]A huge galaxy with equally huge and fully destructable voxel planets
    [*]Many technical options to play around with, like rotors, hinges and pistons
    [*]From what i've seen, multiplayer works well for up to 20 people
    [*]nice modding community in the workshop
    [*]It's basicly Lego Technic in space with somewhat realistic physics and weather
[/list]

CONS:
[list]
    [*]The game engine sometimes does weird stuff and breaks your complex creations, therefor you have to save your game often and tinker around with more complex blueprints to get them to work
    [*]While planets are huge, they're also very empty and some advanced physics like air drag are missing (except if you use mods)
    [*]The AI enemies are few and pretty dumb, mostly they just attack you without any strategy
    [*]There is no real water, only ice, which can kill the immersion for some people (except if you use mods)
    [*]Multiplayer working well depends on server settings and restrictions; if players build too big, there can be performance drops
[/list]

TL;DR: in my opinion, Space Engineers is one of the best space sandbox games currently on the gaming market. If you like realistic space games & hard sci-fi (like The Expanse), don't need set goals to have fun and are willing to play around and tinker with technicalities and physics, you'll probably enjoy it.",1606523990,1693781562,True,2,0,0.525368213653564453,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately the developers haven't really fleshed out either the economy or warfare expansion much since the initial release, so compared to a lot of other games out there the universe can feel a little empty and soulless.

For people playing solo, or small groups looking for something with a better gaming loop, missions and a background story, then I would definitely recommend either Empyrion: Galactic Survival or No Man's Sky over Space Engineers, as even though the way the grids are handled are extremely well done and the creative building side of things is second to none in Space Engineers, it still feels like more a creative sandbox than an actual game compared to many of the others out there even after all these years and you'll need to use your own imagination in order to keep yourself entertained.",1693778873,1693778873,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wish I could give this game a ""neutral"" review. In its base state, it's an okay sandbox game where you can build starships and explore planets. It's even got a cozy little survival mode. With mods, you can make the ship of your dreams with its exact specifications and weapons. But if you want an interior that looks good, have fun forking over another $90. Keen locks all of their decorative blocks behind paywalls that release every other month or so, and without them there's really nothing to put inside your ships. All I can say positively about them is that they don't put genuinely functional blocks behind the paywalls, so it's not a pay to win game, just extremely annoying if you want a fully filled out ship.",1576964173,1693699110,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game was originally made as a space sandbox and it really shows. The only reason to build anything is that you gave yourself a reason/goal. There's nothing in the game to push you to do anything, aside from basic oxygen and power requirements to keep you alive. 

It's a good-enough game, but it's absurd they think they can peddle ""DLCs"" worth 1/4 of the base game, and all the content that is added is reskins and decorative blocks. It's even more ridiculous when you consider that the Steam Workshop has thousands of entries of decorative blocks and reskins and they are ALL free.

""Space Engineers,"" an opulent symphony of engineering ingenuity and cosmic exploration, presents an enthralling amalgamation of complexities within the vastness of a digital cosmos. This review undertakes a comprehensive deconstruction of the game, delving deep into its intricate gameplay mechanics, construction intricacies, spatial dynamics, and the dynamic interplay of creativity and survival instincts.

Gameplay Mechanics:
The fulcrum upon which ""Space Engineers"" oscillates is its intricate gameplay mechanics. An exquisite amalgam of physics simulation, resource management, and celestial navigation, it entices players into an elaborate dance with the laws of Newtonian motion. The nuanced control over the minutiae of spacecraft design and construction serves as both an intellectual pursuit and an artistic canvas for players to unleash their creativity.

Construction Intricacies:
The game unveils a mesmerizing expanse of engineering intricacies, demanding meticulous planning and design to manifest one's cosmic visions. From the micro to macro scale, the construction interface empowers players to craft highly intricate contrivances, from circuitry-driven automated systems to towering space stations. The resultant tapestry of structures weaves an aesthetic harmony within the vast emptiness of the cosmos.

Spatial Dynamics:
""Space Engineers"" articulates a spaceborne symphony of spatial dynamics that challenges players to contend with the void's vacuous expanse. The microgravity environment defies terrestrial paradigms, necessitating inventive engineering solutions. The interplay of orbital mechanics, ship propulsion, and spatial maneuvering culminates in a cerebral ballet demanding precision and foresight.

Creativity and Survival:
The duality of ""Space Engineers"" is manifest in the interwoven threads of creativity and survival. Players are not only architects but also astronauts, tasked with the perpetual struggle for sustenance amidst the cosmic void. The equilibrium between ingenuity and resource management, juxtaposed against the relentless vacuum of space, affords a profoundly immersive experience.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, ""Space Engineers"" represents a multidimensional odyssey into the realms of imagination and technological prowess. Its multifaceted gameplay mechanics, construction intricacies, spatial dynamics, and the inextricable fusion of creativity and survival constitute a compelling symphony within the digital cosmos. The game is a testament to the indomitable spirit of human curiosity, both an intellectual crucible and an artistic tableau, inviting players to etch their sagas against the backdrop of the celestial tapestry.

Mostly saying no because my previous no with detailed issues has mysteriously vanished.
Having to pay for skins that contribute nothing to the game = no.
There are buggy situations like sometimes trying to turn your landing craft into an aerial mobile center and some of the thrusters will or wont fire, then you restart and do the exact same thing and its fine.
Warp jumping will glitch and wont let you jump, says too close to object or something, possibly to do with ship blocks not registering as connected even though its been fine until a few jumps, i think i figured a work around out but cant remember it, but i do remember putting it in my missing review....
I had a mining vessel digging into the ground, im aware of weight affecting thrusters since i did a couple trips, but all of a sudden it decided it wanted to engage the reverse thrusters and they wouldnt turn off disabling my vessel, my first reaction was pull the nose level maybe its angled down too much but nope it just thrusted me across the ground, i had to launch a solo mission to dig it out of the ground after i tried removing and reinstalling the thrusters and it wouldnt hover and just pushed itself deeper, i eventually dug it out after dismantling most of it and it was like a rock was stuck inside part of the vessel blocks causing the whole headache.
Honestly it can be fun but you need friends playing with you to make it better.

The gameplay loop of gathering resources, building ships or stations, and exploring can be engaging for a while, but it can also get repetitive after a bit.

I appreciate the multiplayer aspect, It's more enjoyable when you have a group to share the experience with. However, the learning curve can be a bit steep, and the lack of non-confusing tutorials can make it tough for newcomers to get into the swing of things.

Honestly, Space Engineers is alright if you're looking for a game to tinker around with and kill some time. It's not a bad game by any means, but it's also not something that has completely grabbed my attention.

However, the core gameplay is by far one of the better sandbox-type experiences I've had. Ship/base building feels dynamic, exploration is realistic in a way that feels engaging to me (though I could recognize if/why someone would be bored by it), and a lot of the granular options (i.e. the ability to add in code and change very small things easily) are great. On the other hand, the existing AI is shallow, and some DLC feels like it's not worth its price.

Base building is interesting in how a lot of things are literally connected - you can dock/undock ships and other moving objects with relative ease, and they will incorporate themselves into the base pretty smoothly. You can connect inventories fairly inexpensively, allowing you to interact with anything in your base from anywhere once you have a good setup. Exploring the different moons/planets is slow, which I personally enjoy as it gives time to enjoy the view and make use of your ship's facilities. 

You have the option to set the ship to mostly autopilot (or fully autopilot, with the right equipment), so if you have a nice ship you can appreciate it more. Options for, ex. letting a drill mine at a certain pace, or having a turret automatically shoot in the right circumstances, allows for people to have more clever solutions to the standard problems you'll face. 

The controls are intuitive, which is impressive given the many different things you're able to do; however, at least for me, I was unable to change the controls for two very different settings (piloting a ship vs not) to use the same controls.

Engaging with the AI does not feel like a meaningful use of time. Enemy ships are interestingly designed, but there are no characters piloting them, and bases are completely empty. Wolves are comically bad; they all attack at once, in the same uninteresting attack pattern, then run at low health. If you kill them, they drop steel or solar panels or some other strange space-age items. I love exploring the bases, because they feel like they use the same tools as you're given, but I wish there were some sort of presence there, even if it were just computer monitors set up for dialogue or something.

I am a proponent of the idea that cosmetic DLC should have a lot more leeway than real content DLC, because it isn't as important for most games. However, this is the type of game where it feels more fundamentally related to the game - if you're not making a base for it to look good, what is it in service of? And so the fact that many paints and block-equivalents are paywalled, even if it doesn't give any advantage (though arguably some do, if only small), is a bit lamer than if another game were to do that.

I think if you enjoy sandbox games or automation games like Factorio, it's worth trying this out. I think there are a lot of improvements to be made, which I don't foresee happening, but I'd be happy to be proven wrong. I would recommend playing this game with friends if possible, as it definitely alleviates a lot of the issues.",1693368990,1693368990,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Before you could smash a large ship into another ship and they would scythe each other in half or get lodged within one another with debris flying in an extremely cathartic manner. Nowadays, even if you ram a ship at max velocity it will just bump off like you got into a fender bender. The destruction physics in this game is extraordinary and I just can't understand why with every update they make it harder and harder to destroy anything.

My journey through this immersive realm has been a thrilling exploration of creativity, engineering, and the boundless expanse of space.

Limitless Creativity:

From the moment I set foot in the vastness of Space Engineers, the world felt like a playground of endless creativity. The game's building mechanics are a testament to its ingenuity, allowing players to construct intricate structures, vehicles, and even entire space stations from a diverse array of blocks. The process of bringing my ideas to life, block by block, was both satisfying and rewarding.

Engineering Mastery:

Space Engineers challenges players to think like engineers as they tackle complex problems, from resource management to the intricacies of propulsion and navigation. The intricacy of the game's systems adds a layer of realism that's as humbling as it is exhilarating. Crafting and fine-tuning intricate machinery feels like mastering a grand puzzle, where every piece plays a vital role in the larger picture.

Boundless Exploration:

The universe of Space Engineers is vast and ripe for exploration. From barren asteroids to lush alien planets, every celestial body presents unique challenges and opportunities. Scouting for resources, establishing outposts, and mapping out the cosmos provided me with an incredible sense of adventure, pushing me to venture into the unknown and uncover its secrets.

Cooperative Endeavors:

The multiplayer aspect of Space Engineers adds a dimension of cooperation and competition that's as thrilling as it is unpredictable. Teaming up with friends to construct colossal spacefaring vessels, wage interstellar wars, or collaborate on ambitious projects is a testament to the game's potential for shared adventures. It's a place where camaraderie and rivalry intersect in a symphony of innovation.

Visual Splendor and Realistic Physics:

The game's visual design is a marvel to behold, with attention to detail that brings celestial bodies and spacecraft to life. The realistic physics engine, which governs how objects interact and move in the environment, adds a layer of immersion that lends weight to every action. The feeling of piloting a ship through zero-gravity environments, or watching as structures crumble under the forces of physics, is both captivating and awe-inspiring.

Community and Modding:

Space Engineers' vibrant community is a testament to the game's enduring appeal. The modding scene breathes new life into the experience, adding new gameplay mechanics, ship designs, and even entire game modes. The dedication of players to expanding the universe through their creative endeavors enriches the game and ensures that every journey is unique.

Conclusion: Crafting Dreams in the Cosmos

Space Engineers is a playground where imagination takes flight among the stars. The fusion of creativity, engineering prowess, and boundless exploration makes for an unforgettable journey through the cosmos. As I continue to build, explore, and engineer my way through this captivating universe, I'm reminded that the final frontier is not just a destination – it's a canvas for dreams and a realm where the limits of imagination are shattered, one block at a time.",1692819183,1692819183,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But here's my biggest problem with the game, when you log off of a server, you lose all of your inventory.   When you log back into the game, you will re-spawn away from your original start location. The only way I could get back to my original location was to destroy the entry pod I used to land (when re-logging) and then kill myself, which brought me back to my original location, though void of all my inventory.

It is just not polished enough, inconsistent and still has the same basic problems in being dependent on mods to perform any basic task.

The game mechanics are inconsistent, an example, you can move an action like turn a block on or off to a hotbar, great, and you also heave a toggle option, so it alternates between on and off. Everything you need right there. But other blocks that also have on off option don't have the toggle option. Why, why the fuc#. A simple example, take a tank, and look at the stock pile and auto fill. Just a toggle but inconsistent behavior.

Naming, daamm, after the new update for automatons, who the hack name the events on the event controller. No consistence what so ever, ""Angle changed"" quite a good name for an event, then we have ""Hinge/Rotor Attached/Detached"", wtf is that? Its like it was done by two complete different people. Just name it ""Attached"" or head attached.

Then you go for the actual functionality, again, seems like it was done by different people that never exchanged a single world about it with each other. Seems the initial idea was to have a single event to handle all similar blocks, which would be super good, like the ""Angle changed"", but then you have ""Connector ready to lock"", ""Landing gear"" locked and ""Magnetic ready"". Jesus just have ""Ready to Lock"" and ""Locked"". There also no event for hinge lock and rotor lock, they have lock but I think the dev that was going to develop the lock event for hinges and rotors got a day off.

See consistence, the game is not consistent and it is not polished. Simple naming and basic block info are note present in a technical game that expects you to calculate mass, weight and thrust, but it doesn't give you the info before hand. Its like going to a store, buying a super cool electric oven, installing it home and then realizing that it is 110v and you have a 220v house, ""because you can only see the oven technical info after you install it"", and now its fried. That is basically how the game expect you to handle energy, mass, thrust and weight. There is no info about it on the blocks, you have to build it first then you have the numbers. So calculate what you need after you build, which make the game heavily dependent on mods that give you those info before hand or keep googling info about how much thrust a Large or small Thruster has.

If you want to have cool and precise machines you can, but you can't have precise inputs because everything is done in chunks. The game allow you to manually enter specific values, like how far should a piston extend, but it completely prevents you from automating it, unless you want to learn C# just to set the distance that a piston should move, if you try to use it from a timer or something.

""Go make your creation, add connectors and rotors, hinges"" well now you can't control anything as it is a separated grid and does not respond to directional inputs. But that is no issue, as you can always just get a mod to move your subgrid.

10 Years of the game, and still don't have consistence. That is it, just make it consistent. Fix the naming, add power override on Thrusters just like wheels and Gyros have.

If, you get pass all this, yes, the game still a creative game like minecraft, stationeers, factorio, and mods will keep you playing it for a good while.


==========Original==========

Damm, I really wish we have a neutral review on steam.

In summary, the game works, you can build whatever you want and go from ground to sun.

If you are only looking for some kind of space game where you can build the ship, mining some stuff and fight some npc or do some pvp, yes it will works fine.

The issue for me is that the game limit itself so damm hard. Almost anything you want to do you have to use a script for it. Even after the new release of the automatons, you still can't just set some very basic stuff. One very common thing is having way to much stone, so lets keep 30k and drop the rest, well only with scrips. You can't even tell which item you want to monitor.

Lets mine until 50% of the ship cargo, well unless you only have 1 cargo, you also can't. The automaton (event controller) doesn't do this basic. If you add 4 cargo to the event controller, and set it to trigger at 50%, it will behave in 2 ways.

1 - it will only fill up to 50% of any cargo and stops, even though the other 3 are empty
2 - it will fill up 3 cargos to 100%, and stop when the last one is at 50%.

So, for me, that wants to use the game to automate the game, which you should be able to, you can't really. Even the power reading from the cockpit about the battery life is wrong. Make a floor with 10 or 20 batteries, add a cockpit, it will say the time for 1 battery reading, not all battery.

And, you guess it, if you want to know if you total power is like 30% or less, you also can't.
Those small inconsistency only keeps adding up.

For a game of this genera, one would expect to at least be able to do those basic stuff.
PCU limitation, by default you can barely build a base and a ship, so you have to go manually change some hidden settings.

Which, by the way, every single game you start, you have to set everything again, from scratch. There is no option to save the settings, same for mods, so, every game you start, you have to do all the configuration again.

3º view camera from large ship, again, limits you zoon in for no reason. More annoying then fighting giant Dark Souls 3 or Elden ring bosses.

I wouldn't leave as negative review, as the game works, it does what it say it should do, but it limit it self and don't allow you to do what you want to do with the game, even though that is exactly why one would play the game. This for me is a deal breaker.

Not being able to input a specific value from a block, lets say you want to press a button and set the max speed to 257, you can't, it is either increase/decrease button which goes by chunks, or scripting. Come on, script should be used for people that want optimal performance, and do fancy calculations like having a crane with multiple joints that levels itself as you move all pistons and rotors at once. That is a nice place to have a script setting some values for each part of the crane.

But the simple ability from setting specific values from other blocks should be there by default.

The mods, like other games, are what keep the game going. But unlike factorio, where the base game does everything it should do and mods just add a ton of new things, in Space Engineers you need mods to even do basic things like reading total power or cargo, can't have filters.

The game bags you to add more blocks, like having more thrusts to be able to move a heavy ship, which will just go against the PCU limit, which makes you build small and basic.

The sensor for voxel is almost useless, even picking up thinks from the start drop pod is not reliable, you go to the container, grab some items, deposit some stone, go do some stuff, come back to deliver more stone, but for some random reason, it doesn't allow you to pick or add stuff to the inventory. This normally happens when the blocks are not connected with conveyors, which is not the case for the start drop pod.

That is the best way I can describe, the game limit itself and prevent you for doing what you want, which just go against the game play.",1683307249,1692308898,False,33,0,0.666678130626678467,0,True,False,False

AI enabled basically gives me colonists, (mostly) autonomous drones that repair, construct, and collect random debris for storage.  there's some jank and learning to be done but thats this whole game.  As a solo player, this is game changing.  Setting up orders/construction on one grid then bouncing to the next one to do the same, then seeing the welding lights from the other grid as the bots work.  Satisfying is an understatement.

MES basically gives me threat that I don't have to explicitly create myself.  Not that this isn't something I want to do in the future but its incredible having such well designed examples in MES to learn from.  Also, the AI doesn't suck.  The first two real dogfights I had against an MES fighter ended in MY dumbass crashing due to poor piloting, while they were making sick turns at high speeds.  I accidentally dodged some missiles that would have hit me had I not been moving the right way already.  Let me repeat that, this community made AI fighter can competently pilot a high speed craft AND accurately launch dumbfire missles at moving targets.  I adjusted the top speeds/missile speeds of things as well (250 small vessel 325 missle), so they seem to just be able to account for that with no issue.

The game ALREADY HAD the following
a grid based, individual part based damage system.  This means if a thruster gets hit, that thruster takes damage.  continue to get hit in that thruster, now its non-functional.  If that was one of your main directional thrusters, you are now in trouble.  containers with ammo will explode if destroyed, if an active cockpit is destroyed while you're in it guess what.  I can think of exactly 0 other games where you can construct a ship block by block in a 3D environment and have to consider directional based damage when placing components.

ballistics and projectile mechanics.  this distances in this game are vast, and its so crunchy watching assault cannon rounds travel their distance then strike a target.  Forces are calculated, small crafts will be MOVED by larger caliber rounds.  oh also, there's penetration mechanics.  rounded/sloped armor has the impact it should have vs taking a projectile head on.
also there's velocity based damage.  fly into a hanger too fast and fun things will happen.

The implications of these two systems are INSANE for ship design when compared to other games.  For example, my first large mobile grid is essentially a mobile mining base.  Lots of turrets/armor and a connector for my small grid mining vessel on top, light armor on the sides, and essentially nothing on the bottom but landing gears and a connector.  It would get shredded if anything ever fired at the underside, but by design nothing ever will.  It's designed to never be more than 100-150 m above any surface, and to land/lock while I mine in the small vessel.

Want to attack bases?  Better think about underside armor/armaments, or maybe even a rover tank.  Want to have a deep space worthy vessel?  Better make sure to think hard about your attack angles and where you want weapons, cause they'll be coming at you from everywhere.

I CAN'T THINK OF ANY OTHER GAME WHERE I'VE GIVEN THIS MUCH THOUGHT INTO DESIGN

it also has detailed shadow/light mechanics as well as orbits (sunrises/sets) which makes solar panels really cool to use/setup.  This makes sunrises not only visually striking but stupidly comforting as well as the panels start producing that sweet, sweet energy.

There are plenty of other reasons to love this game but for me its really just the insane attention to detail that was always there, and now the mods/scripting/progress the community has made that fill in the gaps.  Give it another 3-4 years and it will just be 3D rimworld in space with the best ship design systems in the business.

PROS:
-Creativity encouraged
-Multiplayer is fun
-Building is easy
-Survival is challenging
-Explosions
-Awesome community and lots of cool creations
-Some variety in the creative menu
-DLCs are reasonably priced
-Programmable blocks are somewhat easy to understand
-A good amount of planets to go to
-Lots of repeatability
-Customizing blocks and painting ships
-Really cool seeing what you worked on actually function like its supposed to
-Ability to copy and paste ships from save file to save file/server to server

CONS:
-3 Options for thrusters
-Max speed is set to 120
-Not a lot of weapons
-Crashes are unrealistic, instead of blowing up or slowly skidding while exploding, the ships sorta just bounce off the ground or whatever they crashed into
-Rotors and Hinges are extremely finicky
-Nothing to fight, there aren't many pirate bases and all that is there are drones
-Nothing to explore on the planets

Overall, this game is really great. The cons are more or less inconveniences and don't make the game repetitive or bad.

Then again The sci-fi/Tech aesthetic isn't for everyone, Hello Kitty Island Adventure is now real, so there is plenty to choose from when it comes to games of all types. If you are that sort of person who makes their own fun by building, exploring, destroying and creating fun scenarios for yourself. This might be it.

You want to have a giant battle, get a bunch of your friends using ships, vehicles, buildings other people have built or if you don't find what you want, make your own. Don't have friends? the AI will fight you, now they will even fight for you. Don't want to fight? wanna be a space trucker? or just a trucker? Do it. Join a server, build a city with other players and have a little community, Why not?! You can!

You don't even need to be the creative sort who makes works of art for this. If it looks like a brick and it works its good enough. Don't like bricks? Don't want to build it? Get some elses who does and you get to play with the toys they made, they might even teach you something. If you were the kid who played with Legos, played with the models from the instruction manuel or the one who took them apart and built again over and over... Welcome home.

I see have spent many hours on this game already and that's just on the creative building mode ALONE. There is still the survival/resource gathering aspect. Custom scenarios where you get to play custom missions that turn this game into a shooter, a dogfigting game or a mystery game. If you are savvy you could make your own for you and others to enjoy... I have just touched the surface and there is content I haven't done yet more then 100 hours in!

Even the one bug is called a feature! praise be clang. And it has a healthy community of creators that keep things fresh and exiting. ON TOP of the years of DLC and updates the developers have created for this game!

This is what a sandbox IS. I feel like I have gotten more then my moneys worth and I feel like I will still have many fun hours ahead of me... Buy it you want, I ain't your Dad. I am gonna be playing this and having fun doing so.

Space Engineers catapults you into the cosmos with its intricate blend of construction, engineering, and space exploration. If you've ever dreamed of building colossal space stations, crafting complex machinery, and exploring the far reaches of the galaxy, this game is your ultimate playground.

The building mechanics in Space Engineers are nothing short of impressive. With an array of blocks, tools, and components at your disposal, you're free to construct everything from small shuttles to sprawling interstellar bases. The satisfaction of piecing together intricate structures is addictive and endlessly rewarding.

What truly sets Space Engineers apart is its attention to realism and physics. The game's realistic physics engine means that your creations need to be well-designed and balanced to function properly in a planets atmosphere or zero gravity environments. This adds an extra layer of challenge and depth to the building process, making every creation feel like a true engineering accomplishment.

The exploration aspect is equally enticing. Whether you're scouring asteroids for valuable resources, navigating the cosmos, or salvaging wrecked ships, there's always a sense of wonder and adventure. The vastness of space is beautifully captured, and the potential for discovery is boundless.

Multiplayer in Space Engineers elevates the experience to new heights. Collaborating with friends to construct massive projects or engage in intense space battles is an absolute blast. However, the complexity of the game's mechanics can lead to a steep learning curve, especially for newcomers, which might be a bit overwhelming.

While the visuals are adequate, they don't necessarily push the graphical envelope. Nonetheless, the attention to detail in ship design and the immersive sound effects help immerse you in the cosmic world you're creating.

In conclusion, Space Engineers is a space aficionado's dream come true, offering a deep and rewarding sandbox for engineering enthusiasts. The freedom to create, explore, and engineer your own space odyssey is a tantalizing prospect. Though the learning curve might be intimidating for some, the game's unique blend of construction and space exploration provides an experience that's out of this world!",1691526238,1691527580,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Thank you so much to the developers for catering to people who enjoy complexity, calculation, and strategy, rather than the crowds that like to ""come home and shut off their brain.""

Please keep it up. My wallet will do it's best to support you going forward.

Build, Explore, Fight, Survive. Not like the typical though. This game's building has moving parts, a touch of physics, and is hugely complicated. You will not be throwing up 4 flat walls and a triangle roof. You will be building all manner of curves and components. The block list is huge, creations can be scripted using C#, there are AI blocks, AI waypoints, spawners, aiming configurations, lighting configurations for light blocks, ...there is just so much here, so much detail! You will indeed be engineering.

I did not buy this game for a long long time, because all my research told me it didn't have much combat. Well, things change over time. This game has combat. Lots of it. Especially with mods. There are at Gatling guns, rocket launchers, artillery shells, assault cannons, rail guns, etc, in vanilla. You can arrange the shooting angles in your build, throw on welders to keep them repaired. In a dog fight, you can target enemy power, thrust, weapons, cockpit, etc, for tactics, look for weak spots, take advantage of line of sight, etc. You can invade NPC structures, dismantle them and loot resources. You can even make your own weapons, using AI and warhead, by building a homing missile block by block, or perhaps crafting up your own bombs you'd drop from height. Mods add a plethora of options with hundreds of different weapons, shield systems, armor types, and the like. Combat can be very very involved in your build and in your fight. 

I'd compare the building to From The Depths, and of course Empyrion Survival Galactic. The latter was based off this game, but was built on Unity and has horrible performance compared. This game is on its own engine, so it's much better performing and multiplayer is much smoother. The building is much much better and detailed too.

This game is a blast with some friends. I would not expect good PvP with a bunch of randos though, as there are some cheesy tactics that can be employed. So, there has to be some honorable play and agreement. There are a number of multiplayer servers with enforced rules and supervising admin, that make for good fun. Of course, you could also start your own.

The single player is awesome and very challenging. There are a number of scenarios, each with some thinking required on how to get through it. I spent 100+ hours just on the tutorial scenarios. This is one of those games you will be dumping 1000s of hours into. You will build, test, edit, test again, and iterate. There are also sandbox starts with various conditions, resources, and maps. All of it can be modded to your heart's desire.

Speaking of mods. Holy crap! There are so many very very good mods. Custom weapons, shields, random encounters, various factions, NPCs, trade, new blocks, resources, all kinds of things to make your game as spicy as you want! The mod support is superb and some of them have been active for more than a decade and still see updates.

Again, the building is involved. If you are not someone who wants to be intricate to where you sit down and say to yourself, ""Ok, I have 8 hours this weekend to build my explorer that's gonna carry my miner, complete with jump drive"", then it might be a problem. This is NOT an arcade game. It is a thinking man's game. Tap into your creativity.

Review in brief:
BASE GAME: Thumbs up ('buy') - nice features, abilities, and over-all enjoyable (if sometimes buggy) game-play, as well as a lot of good community-created content.
DELUXE GAME: Thumbs down ('don't buy') - does not add content to the game other than skins and music, and REQUIRES THE BASE GAME to play! 
DLC (in their entirety): Thumbs down ('don't buy') - limited offerings and complete lack of original (not re-skinned) content.

Let me start this review with a cautionary note: the developer likes to nickle-n-dime the playerbase to death. The game currently has a ""deluxe"" version of the game (at $8, requires base game) and 11 DLC (at $5/each). The deluxe version is only an add-on to the base game, adding some new music and a couple skins into the game. Universally, the DLC's are small, adding only about a half dozen or so things; and none of them add new functionality to the game. The dlc items are entirely either re-skins of features already found in the base game (like off-road tires that drive exactly like regular tires or vending machines that have fewer functions than the store blocks already in the game), or purely cosmetic items with no functionality (like new block textures, dead bodies or kitchens that don't do anything). I believe that $20 (USD) is a fair price for the game, but the developer should offer a TRUE 'deluxe' version of the game (base game, deluxe add-on and all dlc's) for $40. Instead, this developer charges high cumulative prices for low content.

Now, on to the review of the game itself...
I first got this game about 8-9 years ago to play with my my (then) 12 yr old son. We both enjoyed it a lot and there has been  very slow, but steady, improvement over the years. This is a typical sandbox survival game - you run around collecting resources (ores and parts), in order to craft items (blocks/machines), which you use to build bigger items ...like bases, tanks and spaceships. Yes, the game can get very repetitive, but at least there is a ""creative"" mode which allows you to skip all of that and get right into building spaceships and stuff. To start the game, you choose between 3 gaming options: pre-loaded scenarios, 'custom game' (less structured game-play), and scenarios (mods) created by the player-community. (No, there's no 'character' to make, or anything like that... just pick up your drill and start digging!) Especially if you chose to start with a ""space"" scenario, getting used to a 6-degree of movement (up/down, left/right, forward/backwards) system that sometimes has no true ""up"" or ""down"" can take some time getting used to it... but that part of it's charm. I once built an entire ""base"" in an asteroid while floating upside down and didn't realize it until I turned on the artificial gravity....{!thump!}... I was on the floor and all the controls were on the ceiling!

The original version of the game was played entirely in space (hence the name, Space Engineers), but it has expanded to include surface world game play, as well. Depending on the specifics of the scenario/game-play you selected, you might be dodging asteroids, fighting space pirates, spiders, killer drones and other 'baddies' (the game AI is not very robust, so don't expect to much from it), or you might be playing in a peaceful universe all by yourself. Of course, if you're on a planet, there's always the weather to deal with.

Being a voxel-based game, there are endless possibilities of what you can build. Some of the building blocks include powered and remote-controlled items like rotors, pistons, industrial-sized hinges, etc... and don't forget the weapons, engines and other fun stuff any good spaceship needs! The game play itself is generally stable, but glitches and bugs are not uncommon, so be sure to backup your game often (there is an auto backup option). There is also a fairly useful re-color/texture system in the game as well. The downside is that many of the textures and block/part re-skins are only available via the DLC's. Speaking of the DLC's, they are quite small (typically only offering about a half dozen 'new' [re-skinned] items/functions to the game.)

The game can support multi-players, mods and scripts, which the player-community has put to good use by offering some truly interesting creations for your gaming pleasure.",1691118166,1691118166,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Making a custom turret will likely do more damage to your own ship in the long run.  Automatons update will result in lost ships due to bugs in multiplayer.  Every update is broken upon release, like really broken, then you are at the mercy of QA'ing the software for them and hoping they decide to fix it.  Laser Antenna's have been broken for over 5 years now in Multiplayer.  

When you have 6,000 hours in a game the flaws are glaring.  You get to the point where you see other people trying to push the boundaries of the games with various things like rotors and or pistons and hinges and you laugh knowing they will die a horrible death.  The bug forums are a joke.  People report things with ways to recreate bugs and they are still told that the issues cannot be replicated.  Literally try to use a camera on another grid through a laser antenna over 30km away and watch it break connection after 1 second IF IT EVEN WORKS AT ALL.

Last one is when ever try complete scenario duty for related achievement it constantly fail. No, much indicator for it.

- Graphics heavy for these bad graphics... Even space (natively) ugly dark. I know it not 3A game but loading object can be small piece. It try to load large amount of blocks trees, surfaces immediately. It should be a little smoother than that. 

- Large and small block have strong compatibility rejection WHY? Why I have to use stupid hard connection block to merge them?

- It doesn’t feel me in real world interaction. It can be a more interactional world. Whenever hit block, it is just damaging, not bending, just a little collapsing or ugly shape. I think you need a woman's eye for this.

- An antenna or gyro should detect planet gravity line, meteoroids drooping point etc. component and it should show visually! I don’t mention 3A game, great AI sound, etc. We have a sit that has a ton of screen! This is increase environment interaction as well.

Which is mentally stimulating. A game where there is adrenaline, creativity and mental stimulation. You can not go wrong unless well maybe placing a block in the wrong place . . .

There used to be some bugs which allowed the re use of items from projections, this allowed people to re print their drives or batteries into a fully charged state. This was a bug apparently, many years it was not fixed. Until some one complained and then years later it was fixed.. (Problem is with this, the time in real life that I had saved by using a bug to allow me extensive space travel in shorter real world time was incredible) Now due to this being fixed, takes a lot of real world time. I wish they would fix or add the option to allow remembered states of blueprints. At least to have to option for some.

Why do you design a game where the resources drop on the ground, and then fxcking disappear? This idiotic design decision ALONE is enough for me to not recommend the game, and then we're not even getting into the fact that the singleplayer campaign is absolutely tortuous, or that slow-drilling gives resources but fast-drilling apparently gives zero resources (lol?) or that the entire process to start a new base on a map is shockingly obtuse because you need to mine AND grind down 50000+ stone which takes 4hours+ just to get your first assembler/refiner buildings. It's shocking. Other games like No Man's Lie, or Astroneer, or stuff like that are way way better.

Now they have locked mod support behind a service.
Do other, similiar games need this?
No.
Why does Keen insist on it then?
To make mod support easier!
Then why dont they make it optional for those who perceive issues?
Because they likely struck a deal of sorts to profit off of their customer base.
Keen has shown with their DLC policy that they are extremely greedy and dont even shy away from implementing pay-to-win features.
Likely the service, Mod.IO makes money by collecting your data aand selling them to other spying companies, while Keen Software makes some of the profit.

Engineering, by definition, is the branch of science and technology concerned with the design, building, and use of engines, machines, and structures.

The problem is that there are no problems to solve.

- There is no concept of aerodynamics, you can reach the max speed the game allows by slapping the same amount of thrusters to a literal cube as you would to a ship resembling a plane. 

- The max speed limit for any object is 100 m/s, that is way too low especially in space where you should be able to achieve much higher speeds. This means that no matter how fast-looking ship you build, it will still perform mostly the same as the first ship you have ever built.

- The controls for moving parts (i.e. hinges, rotors) are terrible, there is no easy and precise way to control them. I felt discouraged when trying to create more complex designs because they ended up being uncontrollable.

- The simulation of thrust is very simple, it doesn't care about thruster placement. You can make a ship with a thruster completely offset from the center and it will still hapilly climb up in a straight line because the thrust is applied to the whole vessel.

With that, there are no real engineering challenges offered by this game as everything is overly simplified. You have to make arbitrary challenges for yourself, but they will end up not really being challenges but just tedious tasks.

Another important issue is that the building in this game is simply not enjoyable. Building even a single block more often than not requires way too much time and materials. No one wants to spend 4 seconds holding LMB on building each small little block of a big ship. Material costs are fine, but your inventory allows you to realistically hold materials for maybe 8 simple blocks or 1-4 complex ones which results in constant trips back to your assembler or storage that only further worsen the problem of the game being tedious.

UI is one of the most terrible things I saw in a game - it is overly complicated and requires too much user input to perform what should be a simple action. Inventory management is also terrible, your items will end up in random parts of your conveyor system - alhtough to be fair you could solve it by using sorters, but a new player will have to suffer a long time before they discover it 10-20 hours in. 

I understand that many of those problems could be solved by mods, and thats fine, but this game simply has way too many issues in its vanilla state that should have been addressed long time ago by developers.",1689415338,1689415484,False,4,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

If you can't save progress, without 3 hours of watching youtube videos and learning, there is no game. (it was actually more like 7 hours, because I've made 3 attempts)

Very hard to get into. Took about 3 hours to learn the ropes and actually get setup with a survival kit but didn't have time to power it before a server reset. Third time trying to get situated and still haven't been able to swing a permanent respawn. I know how, now, after a ton of BS.

Anyone reading this and wanting to play the game: a couple of tips; first, you need to build a Survival Kit, the ship you spawn in with disappears when you log off and you will lose all progress as soon as you're disconnected for ANY reason; after building that, you need to power it. If you don't, you're screwed and if you log out, die, or there's a server reset, you will lose all progress. Which is hours when you're first learning. 

I usually love games like this, but not this one. This was my third attempt. 

I will amend my rating if they add a basic respawn point at your initial landing site. There are just too many ways to lose all your progress. You log out: restart the game. You die: restart the game. Your internet is interrupted: restart the game...",1689348753,1689348753,False,1,0,0.481481492519378662,0,True,False,False

[h1]Space Engineers is a Sci-Fi, Survival-Craft, Open World where you build and maintain Space Ships, Rovers and Stations of your own design. [/h1]

Yes, at face value, It does sound like a typical Survival game. But where it really stands out is the building your own vessels. People like to point out that SE is ""Minecraft in Space"" because your ships must be built [b]By scratch, block by block. [/b] So. to get anywhere in the game, you're gonna have to learn how to do just that, and it can be a tough process to build something good (which would be my only complaint). 
Other than that though. You have free will over what you want to do in the game, there are very few limitations.
Space engineers also makes a great time with friends. Whether it's surviving together, battling eachother or having a build-battle, it's worth picking it up for you and a friend.

Try it out, learn to play (Though give it at least 50 hours, the learning curve can be steep), I can guarantee if you like space games like Elite Dangerous or Star Citizen,  Space Engineers is the Survival version.

SUPER high quality game in a SUPER high quality game engine. the possibilities are endless.
This game gives off huge Minecraft vibes because of the game play loop in survival mode, If you're a fan of that, BUT.. 
with the added bonus of making vehicles, robots, machines, and space ships, super intense combat, and a fun exploration and progression loop. I would highly suggest picking this game up, it's worth it's full price
but if you get it on sale then you scored!

[h1]Core Game[/h1]

Space engineers is a game for quite a few different types of people! I myself am not the most creative person, which would probably surprise you considering that i have so many hours in a creative building game. but for me the thing i spent the most time doing in this game was, just simply downloading things from the workshop, changing them to my liking, then just messing around with them in creative mode. like making a halo fleet and a covenant fleet using ships from the workshop and then batting them out! Also keep in mind that i don't have any friends that play the game very much, so most of  the stuff i did was basically like playing monopoly with yourself.

but the game is just as fun for people who have tons of creativity and can build amazing ships themselves as much as it is fun for people who like games like Rust. You can play on countless community servers, modded or not and have a blast! Space Engineers is not just a game for people who want to build fantastic ships or create the world of their dreams, it is also a game for people who love space combat and just blowing up someone else's stuff!


[h1]Developers[/h1]

As much as people say that the DLCs are a plague on the game, I don't really mind them that much. Even know i am the type to normally hate when games overly monetize updates via DLC. But space engineers is different in the way that they don't make the DLCs each 15 dollars, each one is always $3.99 which when you look at the average price of DLC on steam, is dirt cheap! And without these DLC the developers wouldn't be able to develop the game any further. The DLC is how the developers fund the games continued Development. If we didn't have DLC, we would still be stuck with 2017 Space Engineers! 

On top of that you can tell from the Devs live streams that they are very passionate about the game, something that you don't find very often nowadays. You can tell that they love and work directly with the community! They a while back released a completely free community update that added a LOT of community requested blocks and features. I think that the more Developers should take notes from Keen!


[h1]Final Summary[/h1]

This game is not just for people who want something to vent their creativity but also for people who want to blow up stuff and fight other players and for people who don't have much creativity, but who want to mess around with cool ships others have made in a sandbox experience.

This Game has passionate and dedicated developers that want to see the game and community flourish! Even know some people say that the DLCs divided the community (Which it very well might have), The game wouldn't be where it is now if it weren't for the DLCs.",1609185504,1689254292,True,1,0,0.502512574195861816,0,True,False,False

The major one, is the grid mechanic. Trying to build a large ship is almost impossible (or at least I haven't figured it out yet) because the blocks don't always snap together, especially at 90 degrees angles, so whenever i try to fly a big ship that i built, it just falls apart and i can't put it together. I'd say that's the biggest issue of the gam, however there are a few smaller ones. One of those is the fact that you can't move while falling. I get that it's more realistic, but it,s really annoying when you fall to your death and can't do anything about it by aiming for a platform or such. Another problem is that the gameplay is not very intuitive. Of course there are tutorials, but the messages on screen aren't very helpful. I know thereare youtube tutorials, but I'd rather learn while playing the game, not watching videos about it.

Implicitly, the evidence is there for some types of people (looking at you, Lego fanatics and Minecraft nuts!), but if you have an attention span that has allowed you to get this far, BUY THIS GAME! 

I can not remember a game I am so eager to starting up like SE, every time. Fair warning, the learning curve can be quite daunting (as many hours as I have logged, I'm STILL learning stuff!) and the build time, depending on settings, may take hours to months to build. However, when you hear that ""woosh"" sound from your Gyros kicking in, and the hum of those engines when your ship leaves the station for the first time, its all worth it. Everytime. There will be your fair share of ""WTF?! moments"" but they are character building experiences at this point relatively for me because this game runs amazingly well now compared to earlier versions of the product. Also, the SE groups I have come to know makes me think that SE is one of the least toxic environments I have ever played in for any length of time. 11/10 recommend

Oh yeah, and watch for Klang...

Lastly, Keen, Marek, and our amazing modding community: Thank you for all of your hard work This is the game I have waited my entire life to play! YOU ROCK!!!

UPDATE 7/3/2022:

This game just keeps getting better like a fine wine! The love never goes away and the features keep improving! I have recently landed on an AMAZING MP server and decided to create a Boot Camp to help players get themselves up to speed. Eventually, I will stream our adventures! I would be honored if you joined us when the time comes! Let me know if this review brought you there! I *may* have something planned for you!

I'm 23 hours in yet I still cant find cobalt to make metal grids to make thrusters for my first ship or a god forsaken small storage container. I'm certain it's something I'm doing wrong, but that's the thing, I've been trawling through forum posts and other google searches and I cant find what i'm doing wrong. It would be no exaggeration to say I've spent more time googling how to solve problems than actually doing the things I want to do.
I will probably go on to watch a playthrough on youtube to get my bearings and get into what seems to be a very fun game. This sadly is why I must give a negative review. 23 hours is what most people my age have as time to game in a week. This would not be a week well spent and I'd probably put it down by the 4-th hour and not pick it back up.

It's been a while since I wrote my original review but my original statement still stands. The updates don't add as much new stuff as often as they used too as they are working on optimisations and bug fixes a lot more than they were before but that's still good anyways.

They've always done updates on thursday every week and as of yet I don't think they've missed a single week...in years... thats a lot of dedicated to the game and I can't wait to see it get better. If you like sandbox games but you want something a little more realistic which also features some badass destruction then this game is most likely for you.

One thing to keep note of for Space Engineers is as much as they have optimised it, for me at least, large worlds or planets can still lag a lot or just lag after a long session without any breaks. If you can put up with less than 60 a lot of the time the game is great though.

Of course there is one more important factor to consider when buying Space Engineers, the main game may have lots of content and being constantly added too but the mod community ensures you will never run out of content and I can see the mods keep coming for years to come. 

8/10 - Great sandbox game and a must buy for the fans of games like Minecraft, Ark or Rust who want their Sci-Fi fix to go with it.

This game has a great modding community so far, and we're only in Beta. If you're into games that include Mining, Building and Space. then this is definetly the game for you, It has so much you can do it. 

If you're not sure about this game, the developers make a video for each update which occurs each thursday without fail and you should also Check out VideoSage on youtube and LastStandGamers who both do helpful tutorials and run a survivial lets play on youtube.",1386350500,1688654486,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

1. Survival is interesting and fun, especially in multiplayer, but sometimes you need to set goals yourself

2. Creative is fun, but again, sometimes you may get stuck in thoughts, building meaningless stuff that won't make you happy or interested again and again

3. DLCs are.. Quite op in terms of combat and construction. It's not like they're P2W, but some blocks have properties which give a slight advantage over players without a particular DLC

TL;DR: BUY THIS GAME!!!

General Overview:
Space Engineers is a semi-procedurally-generated building and exploration sandbox game using a cubic grid system for building spaceships, rovers, aircraft, structures, and even naval craft (if you use the water mod), kinda like Legos on steroids. The land masses are comprised of volume pixels (voxels) much like Minecraft, but a lot more realistic looking.

Basic Gameplay:
There are two major game modes, the first being what beginners use, Creative Mode, where the player can copy/paste in their blueprints, build blocks instantly, and don't have to manage resources (power, fuel, ammo, etc.). The second game mode is where the real game begins; Survival Mode. In survival mode, the player must mine/collect/buy and manage resources to survive. The player is dropped into the game world in either a deep space pod (if they choose to start in space), or an escape pod deployed high above one of the many planets. Space pods must locate resources on asteroids, and escape pods must search the planet for resources. Both space and planet starts have their pros and cons.

Highly recommended tutorials:
New players should really, really, REALLY watch Splitsie's tutorials on YouTube. Do it. Trust me, he makes the steep learning curve much easier. When you get more advanced, I highly recommend BlackArmor's videos, as he has some bangin'-good tips/tricks to improve your builds. I also recommend new players run the ""Learning to Survive"" scenario, which is basically a tutorial, will really improve your skills, and even unlock a special space suit.

Scenarios:
Space Engineers has some interesting stuff that can either add to your sandbox experience, or, experience really fun PvP and PvE/co-op multiplayer modes, as well as story-driven gameply complete with scripted events, objectives, etc. These special modes are called ""scenarios,"" and they are absolutely worth playing if you want a challenge. One of my favorites is where the players are broken up into teams, are each given a garage and a short time to build a rover. When the time is up, the rovers approach the start line, and a death race ensues, where the other racers and the environment will fight you as you try to reach the finish line. Players can create their own scenarios, too. Try out Splitsie's ""Scrapyard"" scenario, once you get more familiar with the game, and want a real challenge.

Mods:
Space Engineers has one of the best modding communities I've ever seen, and modders are typically quite friendly, willing to listen to feedback, and even collaborate with other modders. The developers also highly support their modding community to the point where awesome mods have actually become vanilla features, and some modders have even been hired as full-time developers. There are so many mods, it can be overwhelming. I recommend you start with some of the must-haves, like Build Info, Build Hints, and Build Vision. You can even get more realistic skyboxes/lighting, like the mod ""Space Just Got Real."" There's even a cool mod called ""Star System Generator"" that can make you star systems using vanilla and/or modded planets, generating them in a configuration that can change things up if the vanilla star system gets too boring. There are also great survival mods such as ""Eat. Drink. Sleep. Repeat!"" and ""Plant and Cook,"" which will give your character basic needs, and the ability to grow crops (and even use the bathroom for its real purpose!). There's so much you can do, and I haven't even touched on the somewhat controversial plug-ins.

Updates and DLC business model:
KSH has been pretty good about keeping core gameplay mechanics free when introducing new updates, and limiting paid DLC to purely cosmetic items as a way for you to help support the studio. Children complain that the DLCs are ""too expensive."" Each DLC is about $4, or the price of a cup of coffee, so if you're an adult with a job, the price of COSMETIC DLC is totally reasonable. I really like this model of ""pay to support,"" rather than ""pay to win."" KSH has been stellar in their devotion to their community/customers, and compared to many big game studios, they put out highly polished content. We waited so, so long for the Automatons update (added A.I. blocks, and the coveted Event Controller block), but KSH's policy is to not release anything until it passes their high standards. Yes, occasionally a bug gets introduced, but they patch those right quick when they seldom happen, and they have an excellent bug-reporting system. I myself reported a bug, demonstrating how to repeat it, and within 72 hours, the ticket was read, and the problem fixed. KSH, as I said, are stellar, as long as you speak to them like an adult instead of a rabid, autistic child.

Ease of picking back up after a long hiatus:
Unlike Arma 3 (a game I wish I could play more), Space Engineers is pretty easy to pick up again if you haven't played in a while. The game allows for some crazy complex stuff (if you can code, there's a block that lets you write custom script, ffs), but the over all gameplay is easy to get back into. Space Engineers is one of those games where you get really into it for a few weeks, then you may not play for a few months, but then come back to it when other games just aren't fulfilling your need to create.

Conclusion:
I highly recommend this game. It's so good, and still very much alive after what? 10-ish years? It's a good looking game, too, and just so unique. You're sure to make some friends along the way, and maybe some enemies, too, haha! I've been gaming since 1989, and this game is way up there in my favorites. Probably not in my top 10, but probably in my top 15. I have played thousands of games across nearly every genre. Gotta recommend Space Engineers!",1413095324,1688090424,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Jump entire canyons in a hover ship or a rover. Create self-constructing structures. 
All the workshop content for this game just adds to the fun. 
Pipe in your friends to help survive or build in tandem- dramatically lower work time. 
This game is so technical that it doesn't really have a ceiling.

This game runs like dog poop though. I have a 1070Ti +7700K + 16gb of RAM and Space Engis abuses my hardware, even on low settings. After a good bit of building, I find myself in the console manually removing free-floating objects so my friends don't lag out of my world or fail to connect. Often times the game client will crash or the physics in the game will just break- sometimes even corrupting my save files. How? I don't get it, but it's still a good game and probably worth every bit of $20

-----UPDATED REVIEW: June 24, 2023----
The game engine is still the biggest flaw of this game for me. I'm now on a RTX 2080, 32gb RAM, liquid cooled i7- all overclocked. The game engine cannot handle destruction, debris, collision and constructed objects all at once. When I get the industry needed to mine and craft in place, I become very limited in what I can build, and how creative I can get. I like to build mobile drilling platforms, and larger ships. It's very difficult to have both, keep them, and go off into combat or exploration without dropping frames or crashing the game. And if it were not for all the mods from the community, this game would feel completely empty. The modding community is the only thing that floats this game- keeping it alive for all the past years.",1560470296,1687619203,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you have spare week to get decent spawn near must have ores, engines are still total crap ad I need literaly hundreds of then for any bigger ship, I wont even mention mulltiplayer as it was so bad that I even do not play it anymore. 
Anyway this is just my opinion. 

PS. New color scheme for ores are also nightmare.

Edit: And yea Keen, you had plenty of time to ""help me"", now I am rewriting my opinion just to warn people of your game, but some people like to suffer, so choice is on them :)

Edit 30.06.2022: I must edit my review as I play it again so despite all it's fallbacks, I guess it is very nice and enjoyable to play, once I change my building aproach. I will still say that engines are crappy with their poor power, which requires whole nacelles and half of ship overed in engines to make it fly decently, but that is engineering problem to solve right? Anyway, I will say positive and low DLC price is nice bonus.

Edit 13.2.2023: I decided to try and play again to see if any of stuff i hated in game got fixed or at least eased if that is possible. So in short nope. New bugs, along with old ones. My game crashes and tart spinning in circles almost every 2-3 plays. Engines are still ginormous but they still can't power ship even if they want to. What ever design I try without mods I need at least 1/2 up to even 2/3 of my ship to be engines. Nope i am done...again. I even am not sure what I was expecting i guess.
Edit: 23.6.2023. I tried to play again due to pure boredom. So i said to myself if I accept fact that all above is as is, will i be able to play? Well answer is as expected...no. I made small bump with atmospheric engine during docking and whole engine exploded and disintergated. Lovely.

You can build some amazing vehicles and bases, exploring planets and getting into fights or moving cargo. It's best experienced with friends in my opinion, but the majority of my time has been spent solo and the experience of designing and slowly welding up a massive ship is a relaxing loop. The biggest turnoff for most people will be the learning curve, as almost none of the game is tutorialised, so you have to invest a lot of time and effort to figure out how to best do things. Once you get over that hill then you'll start to notice things that feel missing: survival comes with no real natural challenges or even goals, the lack of small and large grid interaction is unfortunate, and at its core the game is relatively simple requiring few true engineering solutions. There are, however, plenty of mods to change these things and I feel they flesh out the experience well, and Keen has done their best not to change systems too much and break them, an impressive feat for a game with mods that still work from five years ago.

Do not be fooled by the positive reviews.

Look at the history of this game company.

******FULL RELEASE REVIEW 2019 LOLOLOL****************

WHY IS THIS GAME FULLY RELEASED? THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING FOR SURVIVAL!!!!!!!!!!! THIS GAME IS LITERALLY A HUSK. THERE IS NOTHING THAT WORKS PROPERLY! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!! THESE GUYS ARE SCUM SELLING COSMETIC DLC WHICH ISNT COSMETIC!!! HIDING BLOCKS BEHIND A PAYWALL!!! IF YOU ENJOY SHADY AND BAD BUSINESS PRACTICE BUY THIS GAME. 

-------------------------------------

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME I REPEAT DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON A SCAM.  THIS GAME WAS $25 CANADIAN, NOW ITS $40+ WITH NOTHING NEW SERIOUSLY LOOOOL TALK ABOUT A CASHGRAB AND A SCAM LOLOLOLOLOLOL KEEN IS A BAD COMPANY






****BETA REVIEW 6****
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.  LOL THE PRICE WENT UP. NOT EVEN WORTH IT WHEN ITS ON SALE. KEEP AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



****BETA REVIEW 5****
VISUALS AUDIO WHEELS. This game is utter  c r ap. The only positive is that wheels work abit better. They updated the visual on a game that has no gameplay.... The whole physics system still sucks. Survival is not existant, creative is just a cheap playground that only lets you do limited things with the creations you build. It gets boring fast. Even the destruction is left to be desired. You crash a giant ship into a planet only to feel a massive amount of dissapointment on how it bounces off  the planet or flyings right through the voxels. The stutters are so annoying. This shouldnt of been put in BETA so fast. Marek you are an idiot.  The only thing that saves this game is the mods. But thats a double edged sword. Half the mods are out of date and arent upkeept because the community has no responsibility to keep the mods uptodate. DO NOT BUY THIS TERRIBLE GAME. 



****BETA REVIEW 4****
PHYSICS UPDATE slight improvement on the physics engine.  Still even with this physics overhaul it just feels half as sed. 

****BETA REVIEW 3****
A small optimization boost. But the game is still not playable for more than 5 min. This game was rushed into a beta phase. The devs came out with a new skybox and it looks worst than the original. The orignal was pretty bad also. The community have more of an idea of what the game is lacking than the devs. This game as much as i would love i to succeed cant see it happening. 
What a shame. I want to change this review to a positive one but the issues are too relevant. 



****BETA REVIEW 2****
Still unplayable not even worth the 11$ summer sale. Why is this game in Beta it feels like its still in pre alpha.



****BETA REVIEW****
sim speed is slow. Everytime i start up the game the sim speed slower than a snail. Unplayable. Only cool thing is the new textures. The game is pretty unplayable. Why is this game even in Beta? 


****ALPHA REVIEW****
The game was decent before the planet update. After that the game has gone downhill. Pistons and rotors just exploding and ruining hours of gameplay work this is a problem that has been around for 2 years.... The game doesnt even run properly on recomended specs. The community is full of redditors with self entitled opinions that just  cant accept the games faults. Cant enjoy multiplayer because their netcode is bad. Cant enjoy singleplayer because of the bad game stutters or constant crashes while flying a ship out of the planets atmosphere. I bought multiple copies to share with friends and we cant even enjoy the mp aspect of the game. Dont waste your money until they fix these bugs and update the netcode if you are looking for the mp experience......",1452980271,1687334782,False,109,7,0.540530562400817871,8,True,False,False

Over the course of three years, the requests to fix the issue continued to pile on, with no response from Keen.

Space Engineers is a game that boasts a long and impressive history of delivering highly satisfying gameplay experiences. However, amidst its triumphs, there have been significant disappointments stemming from bad ownership choices and poorly implemented development decisions, resulting in a lack of clear direction for the game's future.

One of the standout features of Space Engineers is its intricate and detailed construction mechanics. The game provides players with a vast sandbox of possibilities, allowing them to build and engineer their own spaceships, space stations, and planetary outposts. The level of creative freedom is astounding, and the sense of accomplishment when your creations come to life is unmatched.

Throughout its journey, Space Engineers has managed to cultivate a dedicated community of players who thrive on collaboration and innovation. The game's multiplayer mode enables exciting cooperative projects, encouraging teamwork and fostering a sense of camaraderie among players. Exploring the vastness of space together, conquering challenges, and sharing experiences have undoubtedly been some of the game's highlights.

However, despite its strong foundation, the ownership choices surrounding Space Engineers have left many players feeling let down. Poor communication, questionable monetization practices, and a lack of transparency have eroded trust in the development team. Promised updates and bug fixes have been delayed or neglected, leaving players frustrated and disillusioned.

Moreover, some of the development choices have been poorly executed, hampering the game's overall experience. New features and updates have been implemented without proper testing, resulting in game-breaking bugs and performance issues. The lack of attention to fixing these issues in a timely manner has been disheartening, leaving players to contend with a game that feels unfinished and unpolished.

Additionally, the game has suffered from a lack of clear direction for its future. The development team's vision for Space Engineers seems scattered, with frequent shifts in focus and priorities. This lack of consistency has left players uncertain about the game's long-term prospects and has contributed to a sense of stagnation within the community.

In conclusion, Space Engineers offers a gameplay experience that can be incredibly satisfying and captivating. The freedom to construct and explore the cosmos alongside fellow players is a remarkable feat. However, the game's journey has been marred by bad ownership choices, poorly implemented development decisions, and a lack of clear direction. These issues have caused significant disappointment among the player base, tarnishing what could have been a truly outstanding game.",1420416179,1686949451,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Part of it stems from the lack of purpose. There is no campaign, and there is no variation or particular challenge in sandbox mode. The online mode can be engaging but is very dependent on who you're with; if you don't have friends playing then it's quite boring or hard to get in on.

The second problem I have is the developers greed. The multiple DLC packages for components that should've been in the base game is ridiculous. Additionally they have occasionally used updates to remove components that previously existed, only for them to be reintroduced later in a DLC packet. It feels like a bait and switch when they do it.

It started simple enough, my cargo truck / ore detector that I'd spent a lot of time working on and tuning just ran out of power before it could get back to base. No problem I happen to have just enough parts for a small reactor.. oh also need a small battery to get it working, hmm wow that sure took a lot of rock mining just to get the materials for that, I'm REALLY sick of rock mining at this point but I've yet to find a single iron patch in like 10 hours.. but okay, back on the road again, great.

Of course visibility on the way back is reduced to maybe 10 feet by weather effects so I find myself rolling into rocky, craggy terrain. Goes fine at first but quickly super stuck. Okay fine, this is awful but I can just spend the next 45 minutes smoothing out the terrain under the truck so it can get traction again and then carve out a canyon off to the side that's the closest way back to flat driveable terrain.

So here's the part where this turns from a recommend to a do not recommend. I get stuck. Not on a huge boulder or a canyon wall, no, it's a fist-sized rock that is floating in mid air. It's absolutely untouchable with my drill, no angle, no amount of wriggling changes this, it's just too dang small, but it's also absolutely impervious to my vehicle ramming into it, and it's perfectly positioned to stop me from getting this vehicle where it needs to go, or anywhere really.

Since I'm playing single player I can just enable admin commands, great... only to discover that the clean up function will not handle tiny fist-sized rocks floating in mid air, and my truck is too close to it for the voxel hands function to help either. It feels gross to even have to use 'cheat' tools to get out of this after all the hard work I put in to get where I am in the game now, and it feels even worse to realize that even if I throw every function at the book at this, it will do me no good.

If I were further into the game I could probably make some giant cargo ship to just clamp onto the truck and pull it out of there, but actually I'm not so sure because that tiny voxel is so perfectly positioned it would probably stop even that.. not to mention since I still haven't found an iron vein (that's the whole reason I was out there), I'd have to spend like five hours just mindlessly drilling rocks to get enough motors to get a sufficiently large air vehicle put together. 

So much obsession, just to have none of it matter either because the game lacks any meaningful mid/lategame content (my first playthrough), or because even with mods to make things more interesting, a bug present in the base game since forever (tiny floating invincible voxels that you can't get rid of) will present you with a challenge that no amount of engineering can actually feasibly mix. All you can fall back on is absolute miserable drudgery and I am completely spent. Don't go down this rabbit hole.

Because game advertises itself as something that it is not. In this game, you will basically be building, and building ONLY. The way that game is designed makes it virtually impossible to do anything else. On some promo materials there are big space battles with ships getting destroyed in a lot of funny ways including crashing into each other. But unless you deliberately build ships to see them getting destroyed in fake battle (or space station to crash your ship into) - this is not gonna happen. Every single ship needs to be built by hand. As well as it needs to be fixed by hand after said battle. And this can take a lot of time. So no - no survival, no battles, no actuall gameplay. Just building.

And if you're fine with that - the game is really good. Building and physics are top level, and super fun. You can save your blueprints and spawn them in creative - and then crash in super fun way.

TLDR: Amazing game if you like a sandbox game that can go insanely deep. Your limitation in this game is your own brain. Don't expect the game (survival) to give you a lot of goals or quests, the opposite is true. Slightly overwhelming start and learning curve with minimal tutorials and explanation. Youtube will be your friend. The game is way more fun with friends and/or multiplayer servers. The community and players are not your average toxic teens. The people i've met online were all open minded creative players. Mods and other player made things on the workshop add quality of life and a lot of content in my opinion.

After +-600 hours on multiple accounts, my conclusion is really simple: this 10 year old game is thriving and  would have died without our beautifull community. The developers actually integrate some player made workshop things. Talking about the workshop: one of the most active ones on steam.

Bought this a few years ago and recently started again. It only gets better. With their new engine in development, SE2 is still 3-4 years away at least, but that's okay since it is a quality game.

Some say that there are to much DLC's and i understand that. However its a 10 year old game, and i completely understand that 1 DLC per year (4€/DLC) is needed to keep the game up to date. I own them all, and must say: some were maybe not worth it, some defenately are. But for me personally, this was worth it. Battle passes or skins of other games cost way more.

One last thing i must mention: PC version is way more worth it. I respect the launch for consoles and like that there is cross play. I got a Playstation. But it's unfortunate that accounts can't be linked (you have to buy everything again). Also the workshop, mods and community is a big part of the game experiencein my opinion and this is not the same for console players. 

Overall opinion: base game price is absolutely worth the money and fun. at 434 hours on this account now, i expect that to be 2000 in 2 years, but we'll see.

EFF THIS GAME!

The game jokingly uses the term ""Engineers"" but don't let that name fool you.  There's nothing even remotely correct about the physics in this game.  This game is nothing more than a ""build something and blow it up"" simulator, because even if you DON'T want them to blow up, and take extreme care to treat your builds like they're made of glass, they're gonna blow up.  Especially rovers.

Hours and hours of work will go down the drain just because you decide to slightly adjust a rotor, or hit a small bump with a tire, or touch down slightly too hard.  I'm not talking about breaking a landing gear, which would be realistic on the latter example.  I mean a huge chunk of your build will just go boom.

So yes... EFF THIS GAME!

Minecraft on steroids is a good way to put it. I picked it up a while back when I was feeling creative and it hasnt let me down since. Multiplayer is definitely recommended, as survival is both difficult and... lonely. Gathering resources is a pain and this game is a grind, but all in all, I have gotten out everything that I put into this game.

Storage menus and component inventory within a grid's assembler access could use some work or change to become simpler or more user friendly. Accessibility to the onhand toolbar could use work or change as well.
Besides the glitch that happens when I loose internet and my game disconnects due to steam cloud sync requirement (please take note of this) I have never had a problem with any ingame issues.

One of the standout features of Space Engineers is its remarkable attention to detail when it comes to physics and engineering mechanics. The game places a heavy emphasis on realism, providing players with a vast array of tools, resources, and components to construct and design complex space structures, vehicles, and machinery.

The major difference between Minecraft and Space Engineers is automation. In Minecraft, there is none. You have to do everything manually. In Space Engineers, you don't need to wire your gun turret to the control station you want it to use. You just have to attach a gun turret to the same structure as a control station and that station will be able to control that turret.

Building things is very straightforward and pretty intuitive. There's even a ""symmetry mode"" that lets you slap together HUGE starships very quickly, as well as a blueprint system that lets you stamp down a previously-designed ship for easy construction.

UPDATE:
After three and a half years, I still haven't gotten bored of Space Engineers, and apparently neither has the developer. They have continuously added fresh, new content to the game that keeps making it better and better. Any year in which Space Engineers doesn't win the ""Labor of Love"" Steam Award, the awards are a lie; the voters were hypnotized by Mickey Mouse and Elon Musk (Cyberpunk? really?).

I think this is the only game for which I immediately buy every DLC, as soon as I see it. I don't buy all the armor skins and little things like that, but I buy all of the content packs, and sometimes buy them for my friends too. I love this game so much I can't live in a world in which my friends who play it don't have all the DLC.

It's actually a joke how bad they are. 3 Thrusters on the back of a vehicle should 100% send the vehicle spinning. Instead the vehicle magically floats. It's just not possible for something like to happen in reality so I have to say this game fails completely as a sim. Also sometimes my vehicles just get stuck in some gravity defying state when using pistons. until I add another item and them all the sudden gravity effects them again. Stuff like this ruins my immersion and frustrates me because; that's not how gravity is supposed to work.

You can build a lot of interesting stuff with the tools provided. It's sad that the engine itself has a lot of limitations. Basically don't expect to actually design spaceships based upon the physics of our reality because this game does not actually replicate them well. It's fun if you want to style something, but actually flying and engaging in combat is just pretty jank overall.  

There's a ton of customization available due to the included scripting functionality. If you really want to build something, you probably can. I definitely applaud the game for this unique form of creativity. Not many games allow you this much control over things. 

Overall, it's a really cool idea but it's held back by gravity feeling broken. I really hope the next engine improves upon all the issues with gravity. Actually having aerodynamics would be amazing. I'm hopeful for the future of this franchise.",1685155602,1685240282,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, if you're prepared to deal with the myriad of glitches and ""personality"" of this game, then you'll really get into it. Be prepared to rebuild things, reload your save, turn things on and off again, etc etc. Just a few minutes ago I had to rebuild a battery on my ship because it suddenly couldn't recharge. No explanation, no reason, the game just glitched and suddenly the battery was useless. Had another ship I built from a workshop blueprint. Every last block of it was built and operational, but the hydrogen tank *refused* to fill despite all systems working. Built a bypass, suddenly worked. You will become utterly confused at many points in this game, and the worst part is you could do *everything* right...but you need to restart the game to make it work, or turn a system off and on again for it to work, or rebuild a block so it suddenly knows what it's doing. It's absolutely infuriating.

Recently though, Keen Software House has made this game into a massive cash grab. As of writing this, there are 11 DLC's. Which is an absolutely ridiculous amount, especially for the tiny amount of content they each add. I don't think 4-5 new items and a few skins is worth $5. I will say however that the modding community is still strong and probably the only thing keeping this game good since Keen won't do anything. Maybe buy this game when it goes on sale?

Build beautiful, elaborate spaceships, only to crash spectacularly into a voxel-based planet to make the most amazing custom-made, unique crater, created based on the impact speed, angle and durability of objects that collided. Wander around the twisted steel and burning modules and contemplate how you gave your behemoth enough engines to lift itself, but forgot to account for the massive weight of the ore in your cargo hold that you just mined a short while ago.

Rebuild, improve on your design, and try it again until you achieve perfection. Then tear it down and build it even better. 

Can be enjoyed both while playing solo or with friends, playing in creative mode, surival mode or in between with custom difficulty settings. Plenty of mods, super cheap DLC that are mostly just cometic variations of free blocks and modules, and constantly improving for a decade. 

If you like to build stuff, this is the game for you. 

Has even different weapons and an option to turn on the hostile AI. Carve out your name in the enemy armor using a minigun, or blow them up a new hole with rockets, artillery or a rail gun. Fire the guns yourself or let the AI assist you in recreating massive battleship battles. Finish off any straggler with your trusty rifle or fire a rocket in their face from your portable rocket launcher. And when the battle is over, use a scavenger ship to grind down the valuable scrap from your enemies and melt it down in your refinery into valuable resources for you next battle. Throw their wrecks inside a grinder pit and watch it get consumed in sparks while your ship is sitting in a welder pit you built earlier, fixing it for you, using the blueprint you created.",1685100847,1685100847,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First and foremost, the level of freedom and customization offered in Space Engineers is simply unmatched. From constructing enormous spaceships to crafting intricate planetary bases, the possibilities are virtually endless. The game provides an extensive array of building blocks and tools, allowing players to bring their wildest engineering dreams to life. Whether you're designing a sleek interstellar cruiser or a rugged mining rig, the satisfaction of seeing your creations materialize in the vastness of space is unparalleled.

The attention to detail in Space Engineers is truly commendable. The physics-based mechanics add a layer of realism that enhances the overall immersion. Watching massive structures come to life as you assemble each component, meticulously placing thrusters and gyroscopes, creates a sense of accomplishment that few games can deliver. The attention to realistic physics and engineering principles adds an extra level of challenge and reward, making every successful construction feel like a true engineering feat.

Furthermore, Space Engineers offers a diverse and dynamic universe to explore. Whether you prefer exploring alien planets, asteroid fields, or engaging in epic space battles, there's never a shortage of excitement. The game allows for both solo and multiplayer experiences, opening up a whole new dimension of collaboration and cooperation with friends or fellow engineers. The multiplayer mode especially shines, as the cooperative efforts and shared achievements create an exhilarating and social gaming environment.

The developers of Space Engineers have also done an exceptional job of supporting the game post-release. Regular updates and the active involvement of the community showcase their commitment to delivering an outstanding gaming experience. The addition of new features, bug fixes, and optimizations have kept the game fresh and engaging, ensuring that players are constantly discovering new content and enjoying a seamless gameplay experience.

In conclusion, Space Engineers is a stellar game that combines limitless creativity, realistic engineering mechanics, and captivating exploration. The freedom to build, explore, and conquer the vastness of space is an exhilarating experience. Whether you're a seasoned engineer or new to the genre, this game offers an immersive journey that will keep you hooked for countless hours. I wholeheartedly recommend Space Engineers to any player seeking a unique and rewarding gaming experience.",1610732094,1684855132,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Bugs, well the game some core issues beyond of the lack of content (plus lack of blocks),  but if you can look beyond those issues that will not be addressed by devs then you might return and replay the game be entertained building something else that you have not done before.

1. LIES!! they told us back then the ultimate edition had ALL the dlcs then changed it AFTER we bought it, I know you need money for your work but at least apologize properly, so until then I will not buy further dlcs until they say sorry for misleading us.
          1/1- they did apologize to some of the purchasers but the fact they changed the description instead of 
          giving a refund or the frostbite dlc to those who bought it just shows where their morals lie, I will 
          accept the attempt at reconciliation but, in my eyes, keen should watch themselves lest they become 
          the next Bethesda/EA.
          1/2- they fixed the dlc pack for the most part.

2. not updated frequently enough and all the updates ARE ACCOMPENED BY DLCS THAT HAVE MORE THAN THE UPDATE?!
          2/1 it would seem they are trying to get on updates and better non-dlc features this is a good step in 
          the right direction I can only hope they keep it up.

3. lacking any story elements to draw you to other places and enemies are nonexistent a rubix cube has more engagement.

4. ""Experimental"" features are basically needed to play the game at the best experience I mean scripts I get those take processing time but the rest? ridiculous!

5. the tools THE TOOLS they are way too loud hell all of this game is too loud I would need a mod to SILENCE SPACE!! WHY?

6. the ""MOD.IO"" crap why do i need to agree to a website outside of steam when the mods are in F_ING STEAM!

7. the whole skin resetting to default problem that could be fixed with just ONE file option i hated having to go out of my way to fix a core aspect of the game.

the community around this game is very supportive and rarely any toxicity sprouts out and almost all mods for this game are well developed and the devs are very communicative. But the games performance can sometimes vary based on your system specs you need a good computer to run this game and the game is sometimes confusing to new players so I suggest searching up tutorials when you install Space engineers 
and ship/base building can sometimes be a hassel.

- The UX is absolutely terrible. That is the main reason why things are complicated when you first start playing it. It's not that things are complicated to do, it's that the interface is so bad it can sometimes be challenging to understand how to do things. 
- Physics and numbers are not nearly as predictable as they should be for some things such as thrust, power and piston behavior (at least with a chain of them).
- The game, in particular in multiplayer, is filled to the brim with bugs, and has a massive GPU memory leak which causes it to instantly take up ~90% of a 3080 Ti 's memory. 

To compound on the above, the game's been out for a decade now so none of these problems should exist.

Two of my favorite games are Star Citizen and Minecraft.  With Elite and 7days as second place.

Unfortunately I just cant get into it.

My biggest gripe is that moving my mouse left or right also rolls my character.  You cant just turn. As in, there is no 'yaw' in this game.  There is only 'yaw+roll', but there is also 'roll'.  If you want to yaw left, you yaw+roll left, then have to roll right after that.  Made worse that yaw+roll is analog (mouse), but roll is digital (keyboard) that is only 0m/s or 110m/s, so tap gently.  And yes, if you are not fully measuring your button press it can slam your head into things killing you.  This is for basic looking around in the game.

Second biggest gripe is your Survival meter.  Think Fallout 76 but more aggressive.  If you have to get up to take a shit, better recharge to 100% and make your break quick, because your energy level will be beeping on your return.  So you have a 10min leash on you, all while you are trying to learn the game. Which is complicated.  

But it's complicated in a good way.  I want to learn this, but it's just not fun.  

TL:DR
SE is like trying to rebuild a car outside in 50kt winds, and your 'significant other' keeps texting heavy drama every 10min.
I just want to try to build a f*ing car.


Note; I did try to use a Controller so I could try to adjust my roll as I turn with two analog inputs, but trying Xbox, PS4, PS5, and a steam controller....The game doesnt see any of them.  Game settings Specify Xbox One...I'm not buying a controller just because the developers are lazy.  xinput is xinput, and direct input has been around since the 90's.

The devs have since fixed some issues, (to a certain extent) regarding collision, clang, and autopilot, in recent updates. In addition to this, they have added some mission type things, but the game is still hindered by high latency and lag in multiplayer, as well as player movement on ground.

_______________________________________________________________________
I bought this game way back when it was a beta, and I was very very excited to be playing a game that allowed for so much creativity and freedom. 

Let’s talk about some of the best parts about this game: 

-Unlimited creativity 
-Sandbox survival 

And that’s about it. That’s really all this game has to offer. There is zero exploration really because the planet and asteroid generation is procedural and has no wildlife, unique structures or cool finds, and no end game. There are no NPCs to interact with, although the economy update was a huge step in the right direction, the game still simply feels empty. Ships randomly spawn and you can either ignore them or destroy them for resources but it’s not really worth it. There were some game modes introduced that allowed you to build a base and survive waves of drones etc, but it’s not that great. Multiplayer would be amazing if only they could fix de sync issues and lag, these limitations make the game very unplayable in some cases. The devs have continued to add dlc that has done very little to advance the game. The DLC in most cases has been cosmetic and added absolutely nothing besides cool looking blocks. However, they did add a few blocks that fundamentally changed some ship designs and rovers, but you still had to pay for it!! The lack of important ship building blocks (more shapes) and convenient blocks (different cockpits, weapons, shields, etc) has only been made possible by mods. 

There’s a few problems IMO that still plague the game that have been here since day one. 

1) Collision 
The devs can’t figure out how to make proper collision physics to save their lives. It’s actually terrible. Clang plagues the game, and actually though this can be a good thing in some cases because it can be used to make some pretty powerful weapons, but it’s still a bug. 

2) Hit boxes
Each block has a hit box that takes up waaaay more space than necessary. This causes small and compact builds to become unnecessarily large. 

3) Wheels
Rovers are heavily advertised, but their inability to perform simple tasks like turning at higher speeds makes them only usable at slow speeds and proceeding ever so carefully over terrain. The wheels do not grip properly and if they are off camber slightly it will cause the river to flip while turning. 

4) Autopilot 
 It simply doesn’t work. Scripts and mods have helped to fix this, but the devs seem to have said f*ck it and just ignored it since it’s inception. 


At this point, you’re probably wondering why I have over 1,000 hours in this game. The ability to create on this scale hasn’t been accomplished by many other games that I’ve played, a d honestly that’s what brings me back. But the devs failure to remedy problems that have existed since day 1 and their addition of cosmetic DLC has made me furious. Imagine if Minecraft made you pay a premium for every new set of blocks they came out with. 

Overall, save your money until the devs get their heads out of their butts and fix the fundamental problems with the game and add content that will progress the game.

The game looks good for sure BUT ONLY THAT, 

>first and formost its ARENA SANDBOX you got 1AU arena for 20 players with ship limit usualy around 5k blocks (mid-sized ship)...very badly optimazed game even the best systems lag on it talking about servers... 

>2nd updates while you got that serious problem with MP you got and anounce a grphics HUD update and its not like you add new functionalities you just re-arange the HUD and add icons and takes you 1 month and mayor update...lol would love the have that attention on he MP....

>3rd building system..thats the tricky you get just so-so block cover then keen tells you go figure out the rest alone..find mods or whatever..good grief finding the mods you want on the 5-10 active servers with more than the creator in them...

THE BEST ONE KEEN SPECIALITY..PHISYCS ROFL XD...community its calling the phisics nowdays CLANG so if your ship got rotors or pistons the only things that are actualy mechanical..your ship can :from float in the atmosphere without any engine working to actualy jsut start exploding and recieving dmg COZ of well CLANG..BAD PHISICS...

then comes the add from the trailer ...EVEN THE PLANET(oids) ARE ACTUALY MODDER'S IDEA AND EXECUTION...you can still see the mods in WShop..here its the thing KEEN DIDNT EVEN BOTHER TO WORK THAT MUCH ON THEM...PLANETS DONT HAVE FOR THE MOST PHISICS...no Airfriction..no water ...and  its THE bugiest, havier element for the system..

Positives :
Pretty fun game
One of its kind
Wide variety of blocks (Mostly DLCs that i dont have but its decorative thank god)
DLCs that are purely re-skins of vanilla blocks
Dat space combat
Large ships are very much possible with enough work
I can make a duck :)
M o d s
M  e  m  e  s

Negatives :
Takes a bit to get the controls down
It is pretty Resource intensive (Need a good pc)
Rather old so its sometimes unpredictable
you mostly need mods to even see a ship that is an AI
larger ships are usually a good choice in multiplayer for combating AI but in single player... yeah, shorter gun range :/

That is honestly my review, keep in mind i reviewed this with 31 hours total game time. its a fun game if you have a working ship, but that is the problem, it might take a while 'specially survival mode, even in creative mode you still need a bit to design the ship. It is easy mode the second you get a working ship and station (m o s t of the time) mods do enhance the experience but i kinda discourage weapon mods because the AI ships tend to not take those well and get split in half sometimes due to how powerful some modded guns are, so try to use vanilla weapons so its atleast is a challenge to kill an AI ship",1683423407,1683423407,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is a sandbox-style space exploration and construction simulator that allows players to design, build, and pilot their own spaceships and space stations. With its stunning graphics, realistic physics engine, and deep game play mechanics, this game has become one of my all-time favourites.

The level of creativity and customization available in Space Engineers is truly impressive. The game features a vast array of different parts and components that can be used to build almost anything you can imagine. From small, nimble fighter craft to massive, sprawling space stations, the possibilities are almost endless.

One of the things that set Space Engineers apart from other space sims is its focus on realism. The game's physics engine is incredibly accurate, allowing for realistic movement and maneuvering in space. This means that designing and building your ships and stations requires careful consideration of factors like mass, thrust, and fuel consumption.

Despite its complexity, the game is surprisingly accessible. The tutorials and help menus are well-designed and easy to follow, and the game's community is incredibly helpful and welcoming. I've had a lot of fun learning the ropes and exploring the game's many features.

In terms of graphics and presentation, Space Engineers is a real standout. The game features stunning visuals and an immersive audio experience that really draws you into the game's world. Whether you're flying through space or exploring the interior of a space station, the attention to detail is impressive.

Overall, I would highly recommend Space Engineers to anyone who loves space sims or construction games. The game is deep, engaging, and incredibly rewarding, and I can't wait to see what new adventures await me in the depths of space.",1683404609,1683404609,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can build all of this without mods. But with mods, there are no more limits. This ranges from airlocks as a singular block or a few new Clang Cola propaganda posters to thermonuclear weapons and a Death Star laser.

However in my experience playing this game on various bits of hardware. This is has to be most poorly optimized game I have played. I kid you not. This has been the only game, out of my entire library of 200+ games to BLUESCREEN my computer. I have met the system requirements, even the recommended requirements. Yet this game manage to somehow crash not only the GPU (multiple times) but straight up crash the entire computer. Considering others on here have reported performance issues which seems to be on the low of the priority scale. I'd say get an upgrade and keep the settings not on high.

But what about the game itself? I'll say that is probably just a 'skill issue' with the bugs I've experienced or whatever and I'll talk about the game.

It's good but not great.

Really though I find it relaxing to build and fly the ships but their is not much to do. I find it misleading how you see sprawling battles and vehicles battling each other on the store page and in the game on the title screen while that's really 2% of what you're doing, unless of course you're playing multiplayer, but unless you have a ton of friends willing to duke it out there isn't much in terms of combat, even in MP it's hard to find people on servers since the map could theoretically be infinite. Sure, if you willing to you can install mods but that's a band-aid solution to the problem. I hate to say it, but singleplayer and multiplayer is very empty just like space. You're lucky to see a ship sure, but the AI is barely anything to walk home about. I think the passive mobs in minecraft are more of a threat than most ships in Space engineers (Mods/Scripts not included of course).

I have noticed another thing though. The community seems to be split by the game design decisions the developers have been making. You get two people here. The ones that are like me and seem concerned about the future of the game and want it to be better or the people that are oblivious to the games direction and seem to think it's fine without fault. Sure the content is nice, and it help the developers get their paycheck but if the design isn't that much intuitive without an actual gameplay loop then what's the point of giving any criticism about it if the community doesn't care? Like sure, there's no endgoal, but there isn't much to shoot or to fight without installing mods.
T
he threats that are on the ground are broken janky AI dogs and spiders that barely effect the gameplay when you have a game about... space... and ships that can fly. In a game about building, flying and fighting space ships. It's very odd and it's super basic and there isn't much expansion on it. You can fight other ships if you get lucky and they spawn but most of the time you're flying around and gathering resources, and if you find a trade depot they are very empty and offer basic supplies, but are more of a time sink than anything. The battles are great in space when they happen, you have to consider fighting them but if you're caught without weapons you're screwed and have to start all over.

From what I understand people have been wanting to have AI in the game that actually is a threat and a mechanic. Again we go back to the split community, most of everyone wants it but the people who think the game is okay don't realize it would be for the better due to adding somewhat of a challenge to the very minimal gameplay loop. 

Rimworld, Astroneer, Minecraft, Terraria, Starbound all have some sort of gameplay loop in it that at least makes it somewhat meaningful to get to the endgame with challenging obstacles to get their that make people explain their stories. Space Engineers doesn't and that's what is holding it back from being an alright game to a great game.

I'd rather keep this descriptive of what I think is the problem. Which is probably not, and I don't want to just say 'fix ur darn gam' and get angry. I can see potential.

1.) The learning curve is only steep in single player...remember that. Some servers (depending where you are in the world) have amazing communities full of active and very helpful players. Say hello, ask some questions...even if 90% of people ignore you, the other 10% are usually just what you need.

2.) The sheer amount of possibilities is difficult to comprehend. You think there's probably a ton of things to do, but a ton is just a drop in the cosmic bucket, my friend.

3.) Stone Industries. This server is everything to me, I don't play solo, I don't play on non-dedicated, or even other servers. On average, there's about 75 players, with 90-120 on a good day, and maybe 40-60 on a bad one. There is a proper discord channel, the admins are very active, and some of them are legendary *cough* FreedomStar.

4.) “Space is big...really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space.”

 - Health is far too low 

 - Energy needs to be constantly replenished and there isn't a way to increase it like bottles for Hydrogen and Oxygen

 - There's no way to get armor to negate damage on person

 - Your Jetpack alerts for getting too low on Hydrogen don't trigger until you have 3 seconds remaining of fuel

 - The PVE is really lacking in content in the base game, which thankfully can be subsided with mods from the community

 - Speaking of the community, for a game so heavily based on Community Creations (they are the 4th largest Workshop on Steam) their Workshop integration is so poor, it's an absolute headache to upload and edit a creation.
Even the thumbnails don't load properly if you take a screenshot at the wrong angle and the image is over sized. Which you then have to navigate to the files, find the thumbnail, open it in paint and crop it down to the right mb size.

 - Weather would be fun however it is poorly implemented and goes through buildings and ships

 - Now for my biggest complaint. The UI is utterly abysmal, the mere fact that this sentiment is  apparently popular and raised often in the community and has yet to be addressed in years astounds me. There is no reason the ""Inventory"" should be split between 3 keys. Equipping a welder should be easy, but no, instead of the usual open your inventory and drag to hotbar, they chose to not have a hotbar on that screen. You have to open the blueprint screen, search for the specific version of the welder you have in your actual inventory, and equip that to your hotbar instead. 

 - and lastly the wiki and any info on this game is incredibly difficult to find and takes going into the Discord just to get a simple answer.

With all that said I do enjoy this game, the community is great, and the Devs are truly passionate about their game and it's future. They deliver cool updates, talk to the community through streams, and are not greedy like other Devs in the Survival Genre.",1615262260,1682907692,False,3,0,0.495659351348876953,0,True,False,False

Why so critical?
-survival experience is laking at the least. To survive you need only o2 which is created by 2 block solution,
     Mining is hell, firch try to find asteroid in space  with needed ore (can take literal hours with vanilla speed limit on 100m/s) then spend hours mining hauling and processing it. And aster getting every of ~8 ores you are done/ no need to mine more because you are set with ingoth for life.
     Building is as slow as it can be, why is building so freaking slow?! keen?! firstly you need to place carcass then haul components then weld it (can be simplified with welder ship) add to this redining ore and component prodiction and you are looking at hours of time to build basic box ship.
     Ship parts are dumb. Quite literrally dumb, you cant setprodition quotas for components to have stockpile, thrusters cant do vector thrust (so you need to place thruster facing all 6 directions) and to control of their thrust , either 100% or 0% power (yes you can set hotbar groups to set overrides, but this isnt maneuvering controll) , etc.
     UI makes me bleed from eyes. after changing it multiple times Keen got it to usable state, but still painfull to use. no hotbar binding to hotkeys (outside of preprogrammed ones like depower and switch lock to all things) aswell no ability to unbind those actions from buttons (ie to switch thruster controll to script, or make ""P"" contoll single connector).
Inventory management is annoing with all scrolling you neen to do, with to ability to presort inventories in terminal (so you would always see forst on the list cargo with components and h2 tanks with bottles). Prodiction ui is a nightmare which only get worse and worse with mods adding more prodiction machinery.
     Flight ... shouldnt it be core design of this game? it is slow and annoing, either you biuld small ship with abundant thrust (0-100m/s in 2s) or it will be painfully slow and unresponsive with no way to set cruise speed and autorotate to camera direction. Docking...... just why??? with all stated above it's so annoing to allign connectors to lock, even worse when you need to rotate camera basckwards but controls remain not rotated. so many connectors blasted bocause i hadnt switched off magnetic force on them so ship would get fliget and rotated upon contact. Collisons are the WORST. Either you place wheels/blastdoors on every contant surface or get random breakages because only wuth speed less than ~3m/s there are safe zone any more and hello damage. Why there is no way to switch controls to match camera direction from which you are looking?

TLDR. I do NOT recomment this game becouse it hasnt progressed since first publishing in 2014. The only updates it is getting latest years is a cashgrab for s reskin of a dosen blocks and hopefully a single new feature that doest have affect on gameplay.",1682765362,1682765362,False,8,2,0.528834700584411621,0,True,False,False

TLDR: As a game, it needs work. As a physics sandbox, it's phenomenal, bar a few scuffs. Survival mode feels grindy and creative mode feels hollow.

Let's start with survival. Some of these issues are remedied with mods, but that's not a good fix.

Firstly, the grind; There are little early game options other than dropping on the deck and smacking your drill against some dirt until you have enough rocks to turn into a base/vehicle, provided you don't start with one. You could artificially crank up the efficiency of blocks and tools or start with a prefab base, but takes the heart and soul out of it. It's even worse when you don't start close enough to resources either. Here are a few suggestions that might just help:
 - Adding cheaper blocks for smaller grids (like fabricators/refineries) may help.
 - Adding a slow but accessible way to get hydrogen, like vaporators.
 - Introducing tools like those mini-drills from satisfactory. Means less drilling and more ship building on your part.

Secondly, there are a lot of quirks and weird restrictions to survival building that make it unfun:
 - Small ships require a connector or have power-gen on board, there is no in between. Allowing ships to be powered off bottles would be nice, or being able to hot-swap batteries you can charge at base.
 - Connectors are static. You can't just connect the two with a tube, you're stuck with having to tediously docking properly.
 - Lifting vehicles on planets is more difficult than it should be. Being able to jack it up without a piston would be nice.
 - There is no terrain editing or terrain block (ie, concrete), it's all metal. Anything not connected by block shares no power, and as mentioned earlier there is no way to connect grids with a tube or wire.
 - Wheels are awkwardly separated into left and right. This could be set in a control panel instead, reducing on UI bloat.
 - You will often find yourself missing few a parts when building something; You can't just make rudimentary items in your suit on the fly, so get ready to do a lot of back and forth.
 - The UI is a tad tiring to use--icons sometimes too look similar. You will frequently find yourself looking at it just to find how many parts you need.
 - Tools take up slots for building rather than having their own dedicated keybind/slot in your inventory. The same applies for weapons.

Thirdly, there's a lot of nuance lost that could be fun to work around. For example, being able to pick up water from planets would be another good way to get hydrogen, or temperature of running machines having more of an effect on your ship. Having tangible NPCs would improve combat (and would give the guns actual use), add new gameplay options (like transporting passengers), being able to recruit NPCs to run your base, etc. Being able to repair ships by looking at a blueprint/hologram to find the damage would be cool as well.

Creative mode is a different beast; it doesn't have these issues because they are completely removed. That being said though, it makes the game feel rather hollow as a result. You don't have to manage your electricity use, you don't have to work around power generation, you don't need to worry about fuel, pressurization, temperature (not that it really was that important), etc. A lot of the fun of engineering a ship to survive the elements is effectively deleted, with most of the fun design going to building a fancy hull. That being said though, this carries over for most game's creative modes.

I should state I do enjoy this game, especially with mods patching up the missing spots, but I can't exactly recommend it.",1682558876,1682558876,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game suffers a lot from technical debt - look at KSP1 for a similar story - tons of bugs and code wich is written wich is jury rigged with the intend of ""finish later""

My favorite bugs include:

- Drops not spawning when you log off with one being active on the server (forcing the server owner to open the sandbox file and set a value back to true)
- Ships randomly glitching under the world
- The dedicated server being utterly broken without a simple copy paste action on your side (something wich takes 2 seconds for the devs to fix but they wont do it)
- Ore detector making the entire game lag if set at too high values
- Requiring multiple tries to join the server with crashes saying my graphics card driver crashed (no a null error in your renderer does not mean my driver crashed - just means you fucked up)

If your a fan of sandbox games and space excites you, then this is your game.  the UI is a bit clunky at first, but after a while you will slip smoothly into its' use.  the 6 degrees of freedom of motion can be disorienting to the new player, you'll either hate it or love it.
Pros: Fantastic mix of physics simulation and fun play style, in a sandbox world of endless exploration and creativity.  Single Player is solid and seems to rarely have issues even though the game is still in development

Cons:  Multiplayer is flimsy.  The playing together is excellent, but there is no tools to prevent hacking, the server is quite limited in capability.  Servers are typically limited to small groups and often suffer frequent issues, crashes and wipes.   UPDATE: Multiplayer has improved drastically, however servers are often overloaded with mods and laggy or under populated.  However the situation is still improving.  

Conclusion:
Great game, I recommend it to anyone.  but don't buy if you have your heart set on a rich multiplayer experience that will run smooth and long..  a lot of work to be done in the arena yet, but I believe it will get there eventually.  Multiplayer has improved, now server admins just have to start balancing thier mods and making use of better tools being developed for management.",1428969525,1682363762,True,3,0,0.559748470783233643,1,True,False,True

I decided to play a regular survival mode on Earthlike and after 10 launches I finally landed my pod on flat ground, upright. (1)

I spent a lot of time digging out stone so that I could manufacture enough raw goods to make my first assembler and smelter. The default keybindings for the game are absurd, and whenever I'd remap the keys to something sensible the game would just revert. 

I landed on some silver and gold but after retrieving some ore I found out that my smelter couldn't do anything with them. I converted the pod into a mining ship and have a nice little wind powered base going.
 
I took the mining ship out to find ores and just wasn't able to adequately clear enough ground to get down to rock, without having to land and dump the rocks out or return to base and offload. No matter what I tried, I wasn't able to RMB click or toggle it in a way to ""just destroy stone"" so I could clear out enough to get to ores, much like you can do with the hand drill (2)

I decided in an effort to save on energy I would build a Rover that would be able to transport the drill back and forth, with enough cargo to make the trips worthwhile. After hand drilling out the cobalt and iron I found and hauling them back to base while my drill charged, I then planned out and built a rover. 
I managed to get it set up, though it was a bit of a bulky beast, but I was able to dock the mining drill to it and set out. The center of gravity was a bit too high and seeing as ""parking brake"" undocks the mining ship, while parking at the ore pit the mining ship shot off and exploded both vehicles. (3)

It was somewhat hilarious, though I didn't have blueprints for the ships. I decided, let's go check out the workshop. I've heard good things about items in the workshop.
... in order to use the items in the Steam Workshop for a game loaded in Steam I have to connect to a third party site mod.io and create a separate account? That was what caused me to uninstall the game. 

Good luck engineers, I'm sure there's plenty of people who enjoy this game. I'm just glad I had the foresight to just buy the base game and not go full hog and buy all of the DLCs.",1682222092,1682222092,False,3,0,0.447368413209915161,0,True,False,False

Space engineers is a very awe creating game, it's what you make of it.
I've fell in and out of love with this game for pretty much it's whole decade old journey, back before I could even play it.
It has given me and my friends so much joy over the years from personal to public servers working for and against each other, waging wars against players and clang alike.

Every time the game get's stale someone in our friend group finds some interesting take or mod that changes the gameplay and rejuvenates the love.

Space engineers is easily my favourite game of all time, the joy of creating stuff for aesthetics, ergonomics, purpose, and overall cool factor is something I've not seen any other game come close to competing with.
In my eyes it's the most immersive sandbox game ever. Every server has it's own charm, whether they run their own scenarios, place forward their own rules, add in orbital mechanics, go full mad max mode or have their own political and governing systems, the list goes on.

The planet and asteroid terrain can be altered by digging or exploding bombs and you can built on either, or just built stuff in space. And has multiplayer.

The main issue with this game, is it still feels like Early Access and has major performance issues that never seem to go away and trend toward getting worse over time, which makes no sense as it started out years ago and computers keep getting better. There are various reports of the way it does weird crap to your hardware and mess up your Windows or whatever. So, check this out at your own risk.

You can build vehicles or planes or spaceships with a huge assortment of parts and pieces, contraptions, components that all work together in different creative ways. Your mind is the limit, or the problematic game engine and the broken mods are the limit (more on that last one later). People get extremely creative and build things not possible by taking advantage of the mechanics of the ""blocks"" that are available. Somebody made a train that goes into space to a moon utilizing the ""rotor"" pieces in an outside-the-box way. Another made a giant space cannon that can fire rocks using the gravity generators and again, some creative thinking. It's areas like this where the game really shines. 

The DLCs are spare in what they offer but it's not bad, usually on sale.

There is a massive community and number of mods that expand the gameplay extensively.
You can add new environment lighting effects, beam weapons, custom blocks and components, add shields to your ship, new armor or coloring types, new planets, moons, it's crazy.

On that note, the game updates tend to break mods on a regular basis.
So anyone that makes a mod should understand they should be prepared to commit to supporting their mod for as long as the game exists, and to update as soon as the game updates.
Since most mod developers don't think ahead like this or about such things these days, they just post something thatworks at first, and then breaks later, and never fix it, and messes everyone's saved games, sometimes corrupting them permanently and they're unrecoverable - so you lose everything you built. Forever...unless you saved the blueprints...for all of them. There's a bazilion mods out there and by my experience, probably less than 10% of them are up-to-date and still work and the rest are trash or broken.

If you want to play the game without mods, you can, but it gets boring extremely fast, especially since most of the default items (weapons for example) are limited and choices bare as heck. When un-modded, if feels more like a ""proof of concept"" program. That said, that this game can even do what it does is worth a HUGE kudos to the developers for what they accomplished that no one else has done. While yeah, there's other space-sandboxes, you can totally deform the celestial bodies in this game, for example, I drilled giant kilometers-wide-holes in planets and moons in this game. However, the enjoyment at some point gets marred by new functionality issues or mod issues, and going back to un-modded version feels like a soulless dance. 

It would probably be way better for this game if they:

1) Fixed the performance issues
2) Regulate the mod community the way Bethesda did with Skyrim SE, so the modders get their stuff together, this will help modders that actually put in their hard work shine better and get the credit they're due; or some process where they vett the mods.
3) Make more DLC that adds in what people want, the current DLC tends to be more on the cosmetic side, but you'd think they'd be cool with making more money by adding shields or beam weapons, custom celestial objects, or FX themselves. (for example, someone made a water mod that puts oceans on planets with water physics, and then others made boat mods - why don't the developers cash in on this using their expertise of the game engine to ensure it's stable? Instead, we get these mods that keep getting broken. It's tiresome).

That's my take. I no longer play this game because of the constant instability issues it suffers from.
One season it will work just fine, it's totally awesome, no issues.
The next season, the developer releases an update that messes up the game, or, breaks mods that in turn, messes up the game, OR somebody updates their mods, and THAT messes up or break the game.
And everyone shrugs and goes ""I don't know what happened!"".
No one takes ownership.

I have 499 hours and I probably spent 10% of that doing my own research and problem-solving every-blooming-time this kinda of antics occurred. As a casual gamer, there's no time for this kind of bull in my book. But I gave it a fair shake because I want games like this to succeed as they set a standard for other developers and put to shame those who just wanna license a cheap game engine and put out trash rip-offs. SE deserves a lot of good attention, because of what it has to offer, INCLUDING, what the modders have to offer, it's utterly phenomenal when its works. In the meantime: Get it sorted!

That is all.

I recommend playing the ""Star System"" mode, and to start with the planetary lander. You start in a ship, flying in the atmosphere of a planet, which you can't leave (because the ship only has atmospheric thrusters, which only work when an atmosphere exists), but you can fly around until you find the perfect landing spot. Once you get there, start scraping your ship to collect material to establish your first base. From there, the world's your oyster. Expand the base, make mining vehicles, explore the planet, set up outposts, ... And when you feel ready, make a rocket, and take off for the stars. If you're lucky, your rocket will be powerful enough for you to leave the planet's gravity well, and you'll be ready to make your first space station! Then of course, you will need a new space mining ship, a shuttle to get back and forth from planets and moons, a mothership to store your stuff and your ships, something to defend against pirates, ... And I haven't talked about the multiplayer yet.

Let me start  by saying I've been playing survival games for quite a long time. That said, I think the UI and task bars in the ships and vehicles need to be reworked. They are over convoluted for no reason. I know you are trying to simulate the complexity of piloting such ""advanced"" ships. However, stuffing all the functions of the individual components on the task bars meant for an entire crew is confusing and not needed at best. This game is set far into the future hence the interface should be more streamlined and once components are installed in a vessel it should work in conjunction for the bigger whole not require individual attention by the pilot of all people. My real car interface is more advanced than your pilot interface. Why would anyone other then an engineer in engineering need individual control of a gyroscope for example? I mean other then getting a land vehicle to turn upright that is - which is another whole story all together. The center of balance on your land vehicles is way off as well and on a normal gravity planets (EARTHLY). Flipping is WAY too easy on wide multi-wheeled armed vehicles. Just tidbits of ""do it just to do it"" are all over. There is more but you get the idea.",1682002080,1682002080,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would absolutely give this game a 10/10. The amount of possibility in SE is unmatched by any other game I have played in my 16 years of gaming. The base game is filled with all of the resources required to sate your creative/destructive needs. Without space engineers, I would have nothing to sink my endless creativity into. I would rather play this game than something like Mine Craft or Terra Tech (No offense to them of course). I played over 2500 hours on Space Engineers, 5000+ hours on MineCraft, and a little over 600 hours on Terra Tech and I just prefer to play this game.

Let's talk about DLCs. I know some people definitely didn't like the DLCs because the decorative blocks were really cool but not free, or because they didn't offer enough. I would argue that they aren't required to play the game or design good grids. They merely act as a creative supplement to enhance your design. I have found dozens of ways to work around not having certain DLC items, It is important to think outside the box. Even though I only have half of them purchased, I am slowly getting them one by one either when they go on sale or when I have an extra 5 bucks to drop. Compared to most games, 5 dollars is nothing when it comes to skins, especially because the DLC addons for space engineers contain more than just a fancy skin. For the price alone, the DLCs are unmatched.

What about this game makes it interesting? Well, it offers a wide array of tools for building things from rotors, hinges, and turret controllers that can help make turrets, tool arms, automated excavators, you name it. I've made replaceable elevator cabins using wheels and pistons, gravity-based ship accelerators for carriers, huge shipyards with automated construction platforms, and plenty of other crazy stuff. The interesting thing is that I get better at making certain machines as one would in real life, and I am able to make them more compact, more efficient, or more powerful than I did before. So if you don't mind a little manual labor, and you love making crazy contraptions, this is perfect.

As far as the co-op goes, it has a system I would say is similar to Rust, which a few people aren't a fan of. There are dedicated servers that run vanilla only with around 10+ people and there are player managed servers that can include mods and sometimes more people. The only downside is that making a personal server is sometimes difficult. I personally have played a small amount of multiplayer, but I enjoyed every bit of it. Playing with friends is the best. In an online co-op, you can join forces with others (I'm sure they would enjoy having an extra hand), or stay solo and play it covertly. If you don't have a ton of friends to play space engineers, it is not as bad as you might think. I almost exclusively play solo or with one friend and I have had the most fun doing so. I love chilling out, drinking a cup of hot cocoa and annihilating space pirates or mining entire asteroids or building thousands of drones and letting them go crazy... you get the point. It all depends on play style.

If nothing so far has you convinced, let's take a little detour down to the workshop. The workshop is absolutely FILLED with stuff, which comes at no extra cost to you. It has everything from intricate ship re-creations to mods that add bubble shields, giant laser weapons, and tons of functional/decorative blocks to mess around with (I personally love the weapon mods from Aryx). I use 20+ mods from various authors that make the experience unbelievable. Huge fleets of pirate ships battle my strongholds, battleships, and drones using rail guns, homing missiles, and defense shields. The workshop is really something to behold, and it stands as a symbol of the community and the sheer amount of heart that goes into this game.

Last, but definitely not least, I really want to give keen proper credit for having a robust support system. I have had my share of dilemmas, from corrupt worlds to broken mechanics (many of them being a problem I most likely caused). I turned to Keen's support team and they pulled through every time. Their support page is full of issues they either fixed, or are currently fixing. All you need to do is ask or just take a look at support tickets from people who have had a similar issue (it is very likely that someone had an issue and got it resolved). If you need help and you can't seem to figure out what is going on, submit a ticket and they will be there to help. From the many problems I have had, they put in hours of problem solving to help.

Overall, this game is one of a kind. I have been playing this game so long I can't even remember (That, or I have short-term memory loss). I started when SE was still in its testing phases. I did an early test of the game and fell completely in love. The more I played, the more I wanted to keep playing. Hopefully, if you were on the fence about getting this game, you will take this review into heavy consideration, because I 110% recommend it. Keen and the community deserve every bit of the credit given, if not more.

Happy Building :),

This review like all the ones before it where writen without the aid of a writing Program like Grammerly.

So Last Time We learned that i Love this game for good reasons but still my opinion is biased so take what i say with some salt

Now then i will start with the bit that seems to make gamers go {uuuuu that the next ea} DLC or for the Normie Downloadable Content.

1.DLC
To start No Matter What at the time of Writing This Review 4/18/2023,April/18/2023 All the DLC's are Cosmetic in Nature, 
I can Not Stress This Enough All the DLC's are Cosmetic in Nature. To Explain further There are No Gameplay Features Locked Behind Paywalls
as such i can not Blame them For it or Falt them For it . Now to Explain some more i Hate DLC's like What Paradox Games does Where they lock Stuff behind Paywalls.
However Stuff Like Loot Boxes & Cosmetic Stuff i can and will Tolerate as that is the Players Choice to Buy, Let Me Repeat Players Choice To Buy . 
The Former is Gambling There is no way to hide it, i do not like Gambling but it is a lesser Evil Compared To Paywalling, Like wise the latter are also a Lesser Evil Compared to Paywalling.
Why Do i call them Lesser Evils simple They Keep The Developers Payed to keep content rolling out of there dungeons .

I feel that covers DLC Quite well Moving on the Next Mods

2.Mods
ah Mods the Spice of the Gaming Community, no matter where you go you will always find some in some form or Another, Whether its in the form of a steam workshop , other websights or Backally Deals
There will always be some . Space Engineers Has two Official Mod Sights. The Steam Workshop & Mod.io , {i have no Real Experience with Mod.io so i will not comment on it} 
The Steam Workshop has been as far as i can tell been supported sense Space Engineers's launch onto the store . The way it is Implemented Should really Be the Industry standered as far as i am concerned ,
Over the Years there have been some Plagiarism problems but as far as i can tell they are not there anymore or it is way more low key than before, Either way not much to complain about.

That should cover every thing i feel you should know for now on the Mods. Next Gameplay

3.Gameplay
The Gameplay. There is not a lot i can say about it , it is there . There is Creative Mode build shite, do stupid shite or do Crazy Shite. Survival Mode is more my speed, here is how that song and dance goes.
Mine Rock, put rock in mechine, Get shiney Bricks, Put Shiney Bricks into mechine, Make Shiny Bricks into Components, take Components and make Blocks, Blocks make Ships & Stations to Do stuff Like Mine more Rock or Fight.
That is it as far as i can tell after playing 2,130.1 Hours of The Game. Granted there is a Very Very Steep Learning Curve, if there was no info out there, but the info is easy enough to find that it does not really matter.
Getting skilled at the game. That is the trick and not a easy one. Getting Good at Flying is also a good idea, Remember Strafing and Spinning is a good Trick, 
and if for some reason you find the life of a pirate is more your speed. When engaging a ship always have 3 movement keys held down while trying to find a blind spot make sure to change what keys every Second,
then use that blind spot to Infiltrate the ship, unless you have an easy Hacking mod the pirate life is a very hard life not one i would Recommend.
Overall i Recommend Getting a Easy Hacking Mod & Some Ships Spawner Mods and Trying the Pirate Life at least once it is very fun, I would Recommend that you have at least two players for this life style though,
one to stay home and do stuff with the ships, either melting them down for scrap or Making Multi ship abominations and one player to get the ships. This Play style is very fun 10/10 would recommend.

there gameplay done

4.The Community 
There are some Cautionary tails out there but overall it seems quite chill some server not so much,
if you are going to Post something to fix something i would recommend being very careful about what you say,
again Cautionary tails are out there as someone who is mostly a ghost on the forms it seems chill enough.

overall i would recommend this game but again take what i have said with a grain of salt as i am Biased


Old Review down Below

Space Engineers

""Space Engineers is a sandbox game about engineering, construction, exploration, and survival in space and on planets.
Players build space ships, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and use, pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets
and gather resources to survive."" Steam Store Page

Why I Love The game and have sunk over 1,100 hours into the game

1 The Game

Space Engineers Came to me right after I got bored of Minecraft I cannot say how long ago that was but you get the idea, to me space engineers was the evolution of Minecraft
and as Minecraft catchphrases, the only limit is your imagination I felt that applied to Space Engineers very well I could go on and on about the meaning of that one line
and what it meant for both game but to sum it up to space engineers had a lot more ways for my imagination to run wild as I am a Minecraft builder by nature

2 The Developers

When I got Space Engineers the lovely People over at keen software house were doing the weekly patches and I got the game a month and some before planets or rite after
planets I think it was before but I can't remember every few mouths they release something big to the game granted for some of the big updates it took them a little under six
mouths, for example, the multiplayer update that one was a good one but you get the point

3 The Mods

Well this one does not need much explaining but I will say something Brief the modding Community is a fine one besides the Plagiarism problems on the steam workshop
I have not been Paying attention to that problem in recent time but the XPGAMER made a video way back that talk about that I can not be bothered to find this video
as Mentioned Earlier in this review I am a Minecraft builder at Heart and the Plagiarism problems have kept me from Releasing most of my cool ships as what's the point if
someone just copies it and places it on the workshop


I've been in the group of people who have known about it since it was made but I only just bought it on my steam account in 2016 however I tried buying it in 2014 and 2015 but failed due to me losing the steam account details and I even bought it once on keen soft houses website and at the time I did not have the best computer so I could not play it well until 2016 witch I think was a little before or just after the planet update this game brought me to my best friends thus I am grateful
That sums up why I love the game. Sincerely Woolodin Prime",1490158710,1681814025,True,2,0,0.543859660625457764,0,True,False,False

- Sandbox in the truest sense. The only limitations really are your imagination (and what the Klang Gods allow).
- New content added regularly, opening up new inspiration and aesthetics to play with.
- A huge workshop library of amazing mods to toy with.
- Scenarios to choose from (both baked in to the game or off the workshop) if you want something with a more pre-defined story or theme to play with.
- Build spaceships, bases, and whatever else any way you like and/or find blueprints on the workshop to add to your game.
- Customize your character at any time, change as often as you like. Find new skins for suits and tools in game (or buy the ones you realllllly want on the market if you can't wait to get them in game).
- Very reasonably priced DLCs.
- DLCs don't give advantages; so no pay to win.
- Creative and Survival modes.

will still keep a sins list below anyways.

Space engineers as it stands, is a solid sandbox game allowing a lot of creativity in designing vehicles. global parameters like resource gain can be adjusted to make the game experience suit your needs.

Physics are solid. and the collision physics and deformation are still a very nice feature of the game, and it was the one feature that drew in a lot of customers early on.
Not much has been done to the deformation physics since then feature wise. but it has been optimized and bugfixed pretty nicely.

The real strength of the game lies in it's survival mode. you do not actually need to eat, drink, sleep or relieve yourself, but you do need to ensure you have a supply of power and oxygen. leaving you more time to focus on gathering resources and designing ships or structures.
You start off with a survival pod which allows you to convert rock into materials. you then get a smelter to use high concentration ores of minerals. and later large automated refinery complexes that can process massive amounts of ore at a time. it's a very natural and satisfying progression curve.

Currently the game is stagnant the developers are not adding much needed features like weapons and progression. you can find all the resources in the game on your starter planet. there is no advanced tech or mk2 equipment. the game ends progression very early.

Verdict: Fun experience. making and using ships is interesting and enjoyable. physics are in a good place and have little jank. solid building game. 7 / 10.


Sins list below:
1: No wings
2: 104m/s vanilla speed limit
3: //
4: bullets travel at 120m/s which is very slow.
5: //
6: You turn your ship with gyroscopes. not RCS
7: Iron magically turns into steel without the addition of carbon.
8: Your nuclear reactor installation needs no radiators.
9: no temperature system at all in this game.
10: //
11: //
12: No Lasers
13: Hydrogen combustible engine is less efficient than a rocket motor.
14: Lack of transition blocks for advanced shapes.
15: barely any exploration content without mods
16: no PVE enemies without mods.
17: game needs mods to be fun
18: devs spending more time making cosmetic DLC than adding content to the game.

I also don't recommend it for those who want to build massive ships using lots of mods due to how unstable the game is already and that sometimes using mods or just playing vanilla can have your worlds and ships you were working on completely unloadable, Which has happened several times.

The DLC is also paid mods but they end up also being inferior to the mods they copy, See warfare 1 DLC and the passage intersections mod it ""borrowed"" from. Alternatively you could use mods but keen always seem to completely render mods unusable for awhile with every update. There are also features that are said to be completely impossible such as projecting the subgrids using the projector block which more involved mods have been able to make possible.

Oh and totally not pay to win DLCs... that add versions of blocks that have unique purposes and functionality, Also just flat out look better have better attachment points, etc,

Going through all afew examples:

-Bed- Functionally cheaper cryo-chamber alternative with better mounting points,
-Industrial Cockpit- Different conveyor layout with a much better view and 2600 more hitpoints than the normal cockpit, 175 more than the fighter cockpit... You know... one intended for combat that is a much larger target.
-Vending Machine- A standalone compact cheap version of the shop block that you could easily stick in any hallway anywhere without taking up a whole block of space.
-ATM- Standalone cheap version of the withdrawal and deposit of the main shop block, Handy for letting you deposit credits that you find at a moments notice so that you don't lose them to death or other players.
-Dispenser- A functional vending machine that while technically just dispenses beverages... they do heal a small amount of health.
-Jukebox- Something that would require scripts (disabled on almost every server anyways) a button and a sound block all wrapped up into one item you can use anywhere... Not pay to win but pay to avoid needing a programmable block.
-Window Wall- Has only afew more hitpoints than normal windows, But also does not need girders.
-Transparent LCD- You want a HUD on your bridge? Display info without blocking sight? Want better attachment points? Its yours... oh wait you thought that the mod still worked? Ha no...
-Grated Catwalks- What catwalks SHOULD HAVE BEEN... Also with much more variety than the vanilla ones.
-Railing- More variety than the vanilla low walls, Less durable but it's literally a block to save you from walking off a ledge and experience a drop from low orbit.
-Rotating Light- Something that would require a rotor and two spotlights... the rotor being disabled alongside pistons in multiplayer normally. So essentially pay here for something that other people on the server probably cannot recreate outside of singleplayer.
-Gates- Less ugly than hangar doors and comes with an integrated button making it more compact and sleek.
-Offset door- a door that lines up and looks much nicer than the vanilla alternative.
-Sci-Fi Control Panel- Larger easier to access quickly with an LCD. Straight upgrade from the tiny panel.
-Sci-Fi 1 button panel/4 button panel- Straight upgrade if you are using scripts which can output statuses and indicators to them, Also handy for displaying labels directly on the buttons without scripts.
-Buggy Cockpit- The rover cockpit has the LCDs too low to be easily seen with more reasonable FOVs.
-Offset spotlights/lights- Physically smaller more compact spotlights that sit almost flush on the fronts and rears of small vehicles reducing the likely hood that the catch and get damaged.
-Weapon Rack Block- Exists on a small grid, Meaning you can stash a weapon onto a vehicle, Spare ammo possibly In places like inside small grid transport craft or trucks, Or even just spares.
-More Passage Blocks- Mentioned above it's basically a vanilla alternative to mod except you can use it on servers, It also has all sides sealed allowing you to make hallways that are less vulnerable to depressurization in combat.
-Embrasure Block- Not pay to win... Assuming you completely ignore any potential PVP happening on foot or inside of a ship using these.
-Industrial Refinery and Assemblers- Easier to access and move around when placed inside a ship likely making repairs easier.
-Warfare Hangars- Nowhere as ugly versions of the hangar doors even come with windowed versions. For a fee.
-Searchlights- You can make a knockoff clunkier more fragile version that may not even be able to be built on a server using the custom turret block and rotors and hinges... which are probably disabled on the server anyways.
-Helm- A control station that does not take up aton of space... Has alot of useful applications since you don't get ejected afew meters away when getting out possibly.
-Access Panels- seem to be armored access panels.
-Automaton Programmable block- Appears to be a programmable large grid block... WITH MORE THAN 1 ATTACHMENT POINT... You thought gyros were bad when they come loose? Have you had a single floor tile go and then suddenly you lose all your control. Want an alternative? Wanted it to be free? Too bad.
-Automaton Sensor/Camera- Both claim to be just reskins that look like they have some armor... but considering the industrial cockpit has 2600 more hitpoints and it's just a reskinned cockpit.

Part of this game is just making cool looking ships and sharing them on the workshop... Unfortunately this means if you don't pay for the DLCs you are not allowed to experince some creations on the workshop, some vehicles will fall apart or simply be missing the cockpit with all the controls timers and commands required to pilot it, or some other issue.

I also still unfortunately am stuck with duplicate DLC skins due to a bugfix mean't to ensure people obtained their DLC items. Due to it being an issue with the game but the items being in my steam inventory I'm completely left in the dark on how I'm supposed to get the issue resolved and only have one set of DLC items.

Personally, I mod the game to make it insanely difficult in single player. A metric TON of hostile NPC ships including many that actively hunt you or send a non stop flood of drones after you in space. On planets i use similar hostile ship mods plus Raiders, Zombies, Animals and Robots are constant threat. 

The Daily needs mod make it so you have grow food and have water. Plus as an added Bonus I Add the Grind to learn Mod that forces me to to hunt the NPCs to learn the tech I need to survive. 

Oh, and During all this I use the permanent death and Armageddon settings just so I don't feel tempted to stay in one place for too long. too much Voxel damage will eventually cause killer lag.  

My preferred play style is a bit too much for a dedicated server sadly, as the clean up tools are either not aggressive enough (which will soon cause an overload of lag) or they just wind up deleting grids before they can be fully captured (that causes people to complain LOL)

The game's focus on engineering and construction allows players to design and build their own spaceships, space stations, and planetary bases, using a vast array of blocks and components. With a variety of gameplay modes, including survival mode, players can spend countless hours exploring, building, and defending against hostile forces.

Overall, Space Engineers is a game that is easy to lose hours in, thanks to its deep gameplay mechanics, stunning visuals, and near-limitless possibilities for creative expression.

biggest flaws:
- its is terrible for and against new players, it has one of the steepest learning curvs i hawe experienced

- little npc activety, so mainly just building and gathering resourses

- pcu limit (hate it). it realy helps with lag by limeting how mutch ewery player/npc/faction hawe but just knowing that after i build 10 ships or make 10drills or something i hawe to destroy the old too make new stuff.

Building is amazing, possibilities are limited by wonky unfixed physics engine for a very long time now. It's a meme for years now but not a very funny one if it never gets fixed.
There should be WAY more PvE content as right now the only thing adding this is mods. In my opinion this should really have be a part of the base game and not something you have to go looking for in the steam workshop. If I didn't love building and designing ships and stations so much I would have been done with this game in 50 hours tops which is very little for a sandbox game in my opinion.
I also think the developers should look at a game like Minecraft and see how they make you work for meaningful progression and with that make it feel a lot more rewarding to do basic things.

[b]The long way[/b]
I have really enjoyed all the hours and years of playing this game while waiting for content that never came and have come to the point where I'm sick of waiting. I rarely write reviews but I want this game to improve and hope that this gets my point across and maybe for others who agree with me as well.

Here's a pros and cons list of my experience playing this game for 500+ hours, maybe it's not as much as many other people have but I think it's safe to say that I've seen a lot of what this game has to offer.

[b] PROS [/b]
- Creativity in building is amazing but limited
- Scripting adds a lot of depth to what you can create in the game and the new Ai update looks very promising!
- Dedicated community 
- An endless supply of mods
- I find performance to be pretty alright for the amount of things you can put into and do in a game like this

[b] CONS [/b]
- It's an amazing sandbox as you can destroy everything and shape in the way you like but you can't terraform to shape things exactly the way you want them to be which is kinda sad
- Collision/physics system is bad, clang is a nice meme but the reality is that it's ruining amazing building possibilities left right and center for years now
- The modding community is fixing and adding things to the game that the developers should make and/or fix themselves
- After your first couple hours in the game you stop unlocking new things in survival to create new things with so there's no real sense of progression after that besides creating your own engineering problems to overcome
- [b] The PvE content in this game is basically non existent [/b] and I'm gonna split this up in multiple points because it bothers me the most out of all
- There are rarely any hostile ships and stations spawning randomly in your world and they're not worth any of the trouble of repairing your ships/stations etc. The resources you gain from these fights are not worth your time at all.
- The real PvE scenarios (not counting the survive waves scenario) are really well made but very short and feel like only a teaser compared to the endless possibilities they have at their disposal 
- The wave survival scenario is fun once or twice at best and is a poor way of implementing PvE content
- NPCs are basically non existent besides the new ones they added with the economy update which also add VERY little content to the game
- [b] Exploration is meaningless. [/b] Besides wanting to build an even bigger ship to explore more meaningless places, there is no point to exploring at all. The only things you can discover are very rare crash sites on planets or in space both of which you have very little resources to gain from and thus no real reason to do something with. You can get it all faster and easier by mining/refining/constructing said resources yourself.

To sum it all up, my biggest problem with this game is the fact that there is nothing to do at all other than build ships in creative or make it a little bit harder by making them in survival instead. There is not a lot of sense of progression in the game besides understanding how something new you try to build works and the few progression things you get done in about 5 hours once you understand how the basics of the game work. This will kill your motivation to do anything eventually and leave you feeling empty as you built the things you made just to make something and there is zero purpose for them in the game.",1622230636,1681299018,False,6,0,0.550551712512969971,0,True,False,False

What i like about the game, 

  You can build some pretty cool ships if you have the patience for it, and it's not terribly obtuse with the built system like some other games can be (From the Depths i'm looking at you!) 

The whole pressurization mechanic is wonderful i love it. 

I'm struggling to find other things that are positive... 

What I don't like about the game. 

The massive amount of instability, Even in single player the game is terrifyingly unstable with it's physics and mechanics. 
This is only multiplied in servers with friends.

The complete lack of anything resembling an objective, 
There is a money and trade system in the game, but it is like a ghost. 

Back when the game first released into early access the whole collision mechanic was a huge novelty. But it really wore off. 


Overall i can't honestly recommend this game. If it has some kind of goal in development it's vague and scattered. 
Try some other space sim/rpg   Avorion or Empyrion are good examples. StarMade is also a Niche title that i really enjoyed,

The DLCs are worth having and I have no issues donating money to the cause of making SE better but can we finally get some kind of depth to the game. Maybe the ability to jump to a new system with different planets with new resources or advanced blocks to find and research. Even it it was just incredible visuals that would be something.

Quite hard to build your own creations, but you can use blueprints for ships from the community workshop.

From mining ships and rovers to massive motherships with hangars and space stations, the possibilities are almost endless. Multiplayer with friends is fun, servers seem pretty cool as well.

One major issue with the game is the lack of content within the game itself. While there are some basic objectives and missions to complete, they are often repetitive and lack depth, leaving players with little incentive to continue playing beyond the initial stages of the game.

The game is heavily reliant on player-created content, which is often created through servers, but this content is not supported by the developer team and is even sometimes actively discouraged. This over-reliance on player-created content puts the burden on the players to create their own enjoyable experiences, which can be hit or miss depending on the quality of the servers and the creativity of the player base.

In addition, Space Engineers is incredibly buggy and glitchy, which makes it frustrating to play. The physics engine is unreliable, and objects tend to clip through each other, causing unexpected collisions and crashes. The audio design is also unimpressive, with generic sound effects and uninspired music that quickly become repetitive and grating. The objectives are often unclear, and the overall game progression feels slow and unsatisfying. The controls are also clunky and unintuitive, making it difficult to execute even the simplest actions.

Finally, the multiplayer experience in Space Engineers is frustrating and buggy. The game's netcode is unreliable, and players often experience lag and disconnects, making it nearly impossible to play with friends or strangers online.

Overall, the lack of content within Space Engineers, aside from the player-created content on servers, is a major drawback for the game. This places a heavy burden on the players to create their own experiences, which can be hit or miss, and the lack of quality control can lead to a lot of frustrating and unenjoyable experiences.

TL;DR Space Engineers a disappointing choice for players looking for a more structured and cohesive space-based gaming experience.",1543135035,1680711189,False,1,0,0.51327437162399292,0,True,False,True

Minecraft is my favorite. I won't change my review to negative HOWEVER... The sound bug that is supposed to be fixed with the automation update has been well known a persisted for too long. I've searched and searched for a work around and there doesn't seem to be one. It involves repeating sounds like assemblers and engine not ending their repetition. The sounds stack and stack until it becomes a cacophony of sound that makes the game unplayable (imo because sounds are important to me. I would have switched to arcade sounds, but folks said that wasn't a fix). I want to conclude that I want to play this game now as I have a wonderful modded adventure in mind that I can't start because of this bug.

Why? I tell you why.



- Most of community suggestions/ requests are ignored, only those that are comfortable for devs to make considered

- [b] PAID DLCs in early access [/b] No kidding. I have dropped the game at this point already. But, judging by other players' feedback, it seems DLC went from ""mostly cosmetic"" to ""must-have gameplay features"" (but I'd recommend to doule check me on that one). I understand why they did this - they were not able to finish game, jusmping from idea to Idea (AI research, Medieval Engineers, scenarios...), so they could not attract more fund by selling a raw unpolished game itself to new players. Instead, Keen started to milk dedicated fans with DLCs.

- 7 years - and game... is still not a game. It's just ""entertain yourself"" constructor. Engineer is a people-servant, a problem-solver. But devs do not know that. Outside of some scenarios, you have no goal to work with

- The engine is terrible. After several years of not playing this game, I got back to check what people were saying... and found that nothing changed. Every mobile part of your construction has the tendency to shake and, eventually, explode randomly. Large ships? Forget about it! Engine still cannot handle it. This problem was raised and pointed years ago. And what was devs' reaction? They've updated to DX12!!! Amazing. Expect it's not.



This is especially sad for those who paid full-price during beta 5-6 years ago.



I won't go further. Just check other negative reviews - most of them are true.

If you buy this... constructor (this cannot be called a game), you won't get decent product - you'll just sponsor another ""i'm an artist, I don't care about your needs"" lazy developer, with Bethesda-style monetization.",1609687309,1680443337,False,5,0,0.501901149749755859,0,True,False,False

You can play Star Wars setups or Vanilla+ setups and more. You can go the engineering way, you can make it a vanilla easy mode, you can beef it up with countless NPCs which in combo with meteor showers can make the game extremely tough to survive and thrive in, a serious challenge.

The game has received positive reviews for its immersive game play and open-world possibilities. In Space Engineers, players can explore, build and survive in a vast, open-world environment. The game features both single-player and multiplayer modes, where players can work together to explore the universe or compete against each other. The game is set in space, with players able to visit planets, moons, and asteroids, each with their own unique features and resources. One of the most impressive aspects of Space Engineers is the level of freedom it provides. Players can construct their own spaceships, stations, and bases using a variety of building tools and materials. This allows players to create unique structures that fit their individual play styles. The game also features a robust physics engine, making building structures and vehicles a challenging and rewarding experience. The survival aspect of the game is also well-implemented, adding an extra layer of depth to the game play. Players must gather resources, manage their oxygen and energy levels, and avoid hazards like meteor showers and radiation. This adds a sense of urgency and tension to the game play, making each decision and action crucial to survival. Space Engineers is an engaging and immersive game that offers endless possibilities for players. Its open-world design, building tools, and physics engine create a fun and challenging experience that will keep players engaged for hours on end.

==============================================================

I played the game for years, surly it's a good game for creating, but this only happened in early years of the game. 
The developers show no desire to improve the engine or game mechanism, they always sell DLCs without actually new things, and at the same time old bugs are never planed to fixed, what make me really upset is that they always change things or setting as their own view, for example the change of collision size without considering the players' creation, as a result the ships or vehicles you made in last version may come to ruin after a big update, especially the API for script or MOD, you will never know when your script or MOD you coded and shared on workshop failed because the sudden change of APIs.
What's more, I never know what the developer actually had done in these years, as what I had said above almost ALL the new DLCs' functional blocks came from the steam workshop made by players (except skins or textures), we old players are always confused which part of those jobs were done by KEEN themselves? I don't know, but even thought the DLCs are almost made by players and can't see what KEEN had optimized for the game, but new bugs are more and more with their update, which is a really puzzle to us.
Those circumstances made me impossible to play the game normally, since the Warfare1 update, at that time in 2021 some of the menu buttons and texts are always missing during my playing, and after the Warfare2 update in 2022, all the texture, skins or toolbar icons in game are missing, these only happen after their update, I post the problems to them, but they never consider these troubles as their own problems, the bugs I report on their website even does not receive any reply yet.
If you take a look at the announcement KEEN published these years, they seem to put a lot of time to optimize the multi-playing or the XBOX version of SE, but multi-playing performance is still very poor, you must have a very very high-end server or PC if you plan to hold an online party with other SE players.
Some programmers and I guess, most of the problems above are due to the engine of the game, VRage, it is an engine coded by KEEN itself in 2000s and nobody else uses it, more important, it is tooooooooooo old for programmers to optimize in 2020s, it's so out of date that you may find many strange behaviors in SE, for example the max speed of ships is limited to 100m/s only, ships with movable parts linked with rotors or hinges are evidently unstable, and the land vehicles with wheels would suddenly get crazy and fly to the sky while you are driving it on the surface of a planet...etc, the physical system here is somehow a disaster in 2020s, but think of that it coded in 2000s, you may learn why.
So if you are a new player looking for free-building games, try anther one first please please please, SE only suit for old ones like me. :)",1580411758,1680205643,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's also not that much machinery, which is a bit weird for a game like this. It doesn't satisfy anyone who is into making complex supply chains or factories. 

Survival wise, the game is also a bit sparse, with strange roadblocks which don't make much realistic sense, which is never really fun. There's also basically no one to interact with in a solo game. It's not like, say, CDDA, rimworld, factorio, or so on, where there are some NPC's, clear objectives or ones you can set for yourself. I've often found myself thinking ""Now what ?""

Given there's a slew of DLC's coming out too, I think the game is going to get a fair bit more expensive too. 

If you are good at making your own fun, I can clearly see yourself having fun making bases, rovers, shuttles and so on, but if you like an experience with a little more guidance, if you like fluff or charm, or you don't have patience for bad UI/UX, you may want to try something else.

The best way to describe the feeling is ""You know those other space games with cool big ships? Well now you can build one yourself or get one from the workshop and it's fully destructible and makes for awesome flight and battles."" 

Had a blast building massive ships and seeing them destroy pirate vessels or lift off the earth-like planet. It also felt quite satisfying and there were a lot of problems I could tackle in different ways which I enjoyed as well. Frankly I did need to watch some tutorials about the game to start understanding it and I'd say that the inventory system might be a little weird but overall it was still fun.

A lot of resolutions but weirdly not 2560x1440, weird. The take on where you have to build X in order to build Y made no sense, an artificial barrier in this game where the whole point is to build the best.
The DLC blocks showing up everywhere is a stark reminder it has issue to say the least with monetization and exclusion. They have stopped caring to attract new players and focus on milking the existing base.

Update 2021/04/11: Nope. This game has gone off the rails. If you want a game like this but better go to Empyrion and play that. Their interface is straight to the point, story or no it is not a pain in the ass experience with a huge reason to be modded before being played. Don't know what they did to the graphics but man do they have lightning issues galore.
Uninstalling this mess. Damn...

Update - 2020/01/12: Reason for broken mods - They are resold back to players. What you used to do your self is now a DLC that costs money. Base game is still what it is but dear me is Keen getting dumb.

Update - 2018/10/13:
Yeah it can get worse. The loading goes quicker but basically it is still build quickly. Next patch will rip your builds to shreds. Mods are gone, some just gone, some just turned into vanilla. Just a ruins the experience. No wonder noone builds with mods anymore, they are always get broken. Play vanilla or get 'rekt.

Update - 2018/05/20:
Nope, nope, nope... Changes have been made and this game is now as appealing as rotted fish mixed with feces and poison. Do not buy.

Update - 2018/02/19:
Crashed the FPS to crap, made everything previous look like crap and changed how a lot of things worked, for the worse mostly. All in the name of looking pretty. It's like someone showed the devs where the bloom option was and they decided to 'enhance' the game. Things mostly work but a lot of things are as I stated, changed for worse.

Update - 2017/09/18:
Quite a bit of improvements. Mainly updates no longer breaks everything when loading up after one. Quite a few improvements on memory and cpu. Graphical glitches are still prevalent but not
bad at all.

Update - 2017/04/04:
Still craps out on updates it seems but a lot less that I can see. Still will not build with pistons or rotors as they will blow up your builds. The egnine is as bad as minecraft with widescreens and can't render geometry well. Sun rotation is an immersion breaker as it circles the game world it feels like and not the planets around the sun. You can certainly feel the sandbox more clearly, even more clearly than in Minecraft which says something.
But overall - It's fun again in a weird way.

Update - 2017/01/28:
Beta is way better, at least it doesn't crash as often. Basically, they've changed to model in how they deploy changes, stable and beta. Now at least it's worth playing since you can save and load and expect it to work. Haven't tried the pistons and rotors but no high hopes there.

Update - 2016/09/20:
The game crashed the whole playthrough after another patch - I'm never playing this game again.
There is no hope for this as they can't manage saves in any meaningful way at all. Just don't even bother with testing by the things I've seen. You wanted planets - you got a ruined game.

Update 2016-09-18:
Speed is back, sort of, still lagging at times so not sorted completely. The new thing is not exploding pistons or rotors when patched. This time it was every single turret firing at everything else. Still not a positive - It's not like Minecraft in the sense that every release was better and more - this is more plodding and aimless.

Update 2016-01-04:
Reinstalling sorted out the instant crashes on launch it seems.
Now however the ugliness of the planets appeared. A system that runs Fallout 4 on Ultra should not feel sluggish in this game when on medium/low settings. Optimising the code a whole lot would be required. Even when starting on a quickstart the loadtime is closing on the minute.
Just not worth the effort...

Update: Due to the collision detection on load of saved games and the absolute garantee that any build that you try where save and load is necessary will blow up in your face I strongly discourage you from buying this game unless you like concepts over actual products.
Keen is adding features while this game is slowly losing stability. Simply put, the secondary crew is learning to program on this game. You can't reliably save and return to point hence it's unreliable at best.

Cheap description is minecraft in space. But that's describing a symphony by beethoven as a rather nice tune to enjoy.
And considering I have more or less 3 years in minecraft and a 400h+ on Engineers I can say that.

This has lacked a goal to work towards if you like, like minecraft, with a lot of different blocks, like minecraft, in a rather sandboxy world, like minecraft, with some basic rules on how they fit together with few exceptions, like minecraft. But that's the base of it.
This game allows you to build just about any odd thing you like. Now you can also program inside the game as well to really script your own things with the components. And this is where it goes far away from minecraft. It's not just simple programs but rather advanced things. Add then the workshop items which has the same base as the rest. Special thrusters, guns, decorations and so on. And the modmanager works directly with the workshop so what you got enabled is always up to date. And the modding community is active and friendly - and their work end up in the base game if it's good enough.
This game is extremely well made so far, weekly updates and a dev team that really communicate, not listen, with the actual players to make a game that really works for everyone. I usually have a balanced view to the game so here it is:
The weekly updates - You rarely have time to try things out before the next cool thing arrives. And this is going more and more for dedicated servers and multiplayer than single player.
It's not boring as single player, it's a solid experience, but unlike minecraft this is really gearing towards multiplayer.",1420832898,1679931848,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is still good, despite what the community may say, mainly because this is one of those games where YOUR imagination is the limit.  Think of a box of Lego and it is pretty close.
It is a sandbox style survival game with a creative mode, has had many updates the past year and the DLC you pay for is purely cosmetic, this means you do not need the DLC to have the full benefits of the game itself.

You can press your face right against what you want to delete and still delete something randomly around you. The game is just a frustrating POS most of the time tbh, but building random stuff that I can then fly around, is just too enjoyable.

This game needs some real work to actually be ""good"" where I'd try to talk other people into playing with me. But its still fun to build until the horrible 'hit box' BS when building makes you rage quit.

In short me and this game have a love hate relationship, its about 70% hate but that 30% ... 


Original review below ::::

I really want to love this game, but after not playing for awhile, I forgot how to do most of what I did know, and now there's new stuff that I can't seem to get to work for me, and just generally, the game is far more complicated than it needs to be so the most mundane tasks can become frustrating because the game refuses to cooperate. The concept is great, and when things work the way I want them to its great, but when oxygen generators refuse to put out oxygen and things refuse to connect to said oxygen generator for no other reason to annoy me (my favorite is when I have something connected, I destroy it while adjusting things, and then I can't get the same exact item to attatch again) I just want to blow everything up and erase the game from my hard drive.

Some things could really use some stream lining and simplification, rather than being complicated for the sake of being complicated. But I'm sure some people like the pointless complication in some aspects of the game, so whatever I guess.

For me though, after leaving it for awhile and returning, I've realize just how pointlessly over complicated some of the game is, and while you can escape most of it by simply ignoring it and playing creative mode, that IMO, doesn't make it ok. Especially since going to creative mode eliminates about 80% of the gameplay (mining isn't relevant, you can't die so battles are pointless, etc etc) the rest is just floating around in space doing nothing.

Its a fun game, if you have pateince for broken game mechanics and completely unnecessary complication, I'd say pick it up - Especially if you're the type to only play one game for awhile. But if you don't, or like me, you play a lot of different games, then save your frustration and play something else til they get it all sorted out.

Due to the sheer amount of bugs, and random over complication, and the lack of really anything to do, I can't reccomend this game at this point. There's ton of potential here, but they need to clean up the controls a bit, and make the game more user friendly if they want to market this game beyong a super tiny niche.

I'll try again in a few months or so and see if it's any more user friendly.",1485049806,1679538429,False,4,0,0.47039109468460083,1,True,False,True

Space Engineers has always been the type of game where you need to make your own fun. It's a sandbox game, and it says that right on the tin. If you're looking at this game and hoping for a compelling survival experience out of the box (ie, looking for the game to give you direction on how to enjoy it), then you'll probably be disappointed once you've completed an initial run of the main survival game loop.

However, if you are the type of person that gets the most fun out of creating your own goals and your own fun, then this game offers nearly limitless possibilities.

A good amount of the time I've spent in this game has been in Creative Mode. Just building ships and stations scratches the ""Lego"" itch for me quite nicely. While I'm no where near as skilled at building as some others in the community, it's been an enjoyable experience slowly honing my craft and style. I do hop onto Survival every once in a while as well, though my preference is to play with a variety of mods to make things more challenging.

The developers of this game have a good relationship with their creative community, which has allowed the modding side of this game to flourish. This further adds to what I mentioned above about ""making your own fun"", since you have a massive selection of additional features (via mods) you can use to curate your experience. These are mainly handled by the steam workshop, which takes a lot of the hassle out of loading/unloading extra content. While mods do sometimes break, the developers do make an effort to limit the damage that game updates can often cause to mods.

While on the topic of mods, this is the first game where I got serious about learning how to develop mods in general. For me, building mods has become just as fun as actually playing the game - and I've picked up some real programming skills as a nice side effect from this!

On it's own, it could be said that Space Engineers might have a finite level of enjoyment. But when you factor in the creative community the game has built over nearly a decade, the ways you can enjoy this game become nearly endless.",1679447021,1679447021,True,3,0,0.537095606327056885,0,True,False,False

They abuse the community's willingness to try 'new things', as proven by the recent AI Ship Generator. Keen only uses this game to gather data for their primary company, Good.ai. 

This game features a complete disregard for people with disabilities of any sort (compulsive counting, eye sensitivities, motion sensitivities, misophonia, etc). 

Examples include:

- a huge focus on the numbers 3 and 5, zero blocks that focus on 2 (there are 1x1 wheels, 3x3 wheels, and 5x5 wheels, but no 2x2 or 4x4 wheels)

- the welder and grinder have bright flashing

- camera isn't horizon locked ever, leading to strong disorientation on non-horizontal terrain

- Lots of blocks feature extremely repetitive and sometimes jarring ambient sounds (beeping/humming/etc) which can hinder people with ADD or ADHD

[i]Fundamentally[/i], it is a good game. However, the fundamentals is where it stops.

There are TONS of issues with this game, none of which have been addressed in 5+ years, only some of which I will list here:

- Multi-GPU rendering, for example, uses the NVIDIA SLI profiles from when the game used a completely different engine.

- Tons of gameplay bugs, such as limited resources in Creative Mode

- Normal bugs and glitches, such as stuck/glitched air vents draining H2O2 generators

- And more severely, a focus on adding things *nobody asked for*.

- Railguns are limited to 2km. Like, what? Seriously?

- Large ships are difficult to make and manage simply because of how performance intensive they are

- Small grid to Large grid adapters take up a 5x5x5 small grid space

- Severe lack of various block sizes for small grid (only 2 oxy tanks, only 2 hydro tanks, no variations, 2x2xN blocks simply don't exist)

Again, fundamentally, the game is there. But that's where it stops.

- The game has random encounters, yet rarely do you stumble upon them

- Mods are required to view cameras on displays

- There are no NPCs unless you use mods

- Survival has no endgame, unlike Minecraft. There's no final boss battle.

- One of the reasons this game exists is to develop and study AI, yet such a thing is nonpresent in the game. Ship autopilot sucks and is very limited.

- Complete and utter lack of a radar system or dynamic map

- Weather exists, but is a repetitive hinderance

- Complete disregard for people with disabilities of any sort (compulsive counting, eye sensitivities, motion sensitivities, misophonia, etc)

Then the game offers you to play around on endgame scenarios where you can taste ships, land tanks etc. Understand the objective but loading is slow and ocasional hangs prevent it from shining on that point. Still missions are polished and keeps you busy.

After 3 customs starts i was able to play the way i wanted, you land on a drop pod with minimal functionalities and start your way up the tech tree and materials providing. Its nice that you just mine rock and you get basic metals and all the basics will work from there even if there is plenty of rock to mine. But the automation is easy to use and there is a easy yet powerful build planner.

Also for its age you can drill terrain which is amazing for a craft-survival game since most make you play on fixed geometry which is boredom guaranteed. Being able to modify landscape to your needs is amazing, frankly i dont know if you can landfill, but procedural drilling is good in my book, being on foot or land vehicle or even a friggin drilling flying ship.

So i got what i wanted, lonely at space without overpopulated scenario and where displacement will make sense to look for things.

PD: My pod landed on steep terrain and tumbled upside down, yet im able to interact properly with the basic stations it comes with.",1679176359,1679176359,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The building system in Space Engineers will be familiar to those who have played either of the aforementioned games.

There's a lot to do, and the emphasis is on building, not survival (though I have seen videos of people using mods to make the game more about survival).

[h1] Game description [/h1]
Space engineers is an open world sandbox game set in near future, where space travel is a normal way of life. There is no ""end game"" or goals besides the personal ones set by the players. However expect space ships, rovers, bases and resource gathering to be almost guaranteed to be part of a normal play through.

Everything in the game is destructible, so in theory yes you could mine an entire planet. The player usually mines and collects resources in order to assemble parts and then make structures. These structures are also destructible.

As mentioned the game has no set goals or end game. So the player must decide a goal themselves. This could be reaching a specific planet or building something, you can also spend your time simply building things like bases or ships in creative mode. It is not uncommon for players to download mods and play with other people on servers or with friends, where you can work together or compete.


[h1] How is this executed? [/h1]

The game is honestly mixed in how well executed its concept is. Some areas are pretty fun, including the process of building and assembling ships, bases and rovers. I prefer Survival as it offers more of a reason to build these things and forces me to develop things according to my environment. However creative also has its positives.

The game can be and in my opinion is the most fun with multiplayer, whether on a public server or just with friends. You can work together, share knowledge, or you can create opposing factions and fight each other using the games range of hand held weapons and weapons that can be put on vehicles/bases. Unfortunately I find that the multiplayer is not very well optimized when you have larger bases, more vehicles etc and can cause lag, however that was when hosting with 1 friend on my computer. Dedicated servers appear to do better.

Despite multiplayer being fun, singleplayer has its downsides. You dont really have anything to do once you have built a base and have a space fairing ship. Sure you can repeat the process on other planets besides the ""earth like one"" that are more hostile, but the game play is pretty much the same. There is also a lack of enemies to defend from, although it may be possible this is changing in the future.

Finally, the game expresses a lack of proper tutorials. The game offers a lot of stuff but its confusing and in some cases impossible to find out that some of the features exist without seeing someone else do it/teach it to you. This can be extremely infuriating sometimes.


[h1] The biggest issues [/h1]

Ok here is why my review is so mixed: its Keen software house, the devs of Space engineers. The devs appear to care less for the actual game play and fun of the game and more about profits, and as such they have released almost every recent major update with a DLC that puts a lot of content behind a pay wall, and even doing this whilst the game was in Early access some time ago. This has meant updates feel small and meaningless and the player base is extremely unhappy with this.

Furthermore there are many MANY bugs that have been simply ignored in the game, and whilst the game is not unplayable it does make things difficult sometimes. There is actually one issue called ""Klang"" that is kinda treated like a god in a joking manner in the community, with the DEVS of all people actually naming some of their items after it. (like ""Klang Cola"" Personally Id say that's pretty disgusting behavior from the devs to not only ignore a bug but then treat it like a joke.

There is a silver lining, what the devs miss completely out in the game modders have taken up and out done the devs in so many ways, making the game a lot more enjoyable to play and challenging, so after mastering the games basics I would 100% recommend getting some mods.


[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Despite the bad neglectful devs who honestly don't listen to the players enough, as well as some other issues, I would say I have got my moneys worth, although without being in a multiplayer server I don't think id have put even 50 hours into the game.

Singleplayer can be fun for some, whether that be creative or survival, especially with mods. Although I DLC's also add a little to the game and make up for whats missing in the main game, I would suggest buying them all whilst on sale.

Overall: 7/10

When I bought this game it acted completely fine and I got a good 50 - 60 hours and I loved it, it was amazing, until it just, stopped? At first it was saying some error occurred I starting the game and it was fine. Next, I was in the middle of making a rover and it gave me another error and now I just cant save, I lost half my progress in making that rover. Finally, the game crumbled, whenever I open a save it 9/10 times it crashes and says my graphics card is overheated, let me give you a hint, ITS NOT.

The last time I reviewed the game was at 600 hours, it's now been around a year or so since then and I basically have 800 hours - I discussed previously how there is a lack of content and that mods are required; this still holds up true. In the current state of the game, there's no incentive to 'survive' on their survival gamemode or even build anything on creative because you're only building for the ""fun of it"" - note that I quoted this because it's not really all that fun anymore. Every time I recently try to play the game as an attempt to find some enjoyment out of it, I just end up quitting because there's nothing fun to do - even with mods it's now insanely boring.

I don't see the game recovering unless the developers stick their heads out of their asses and stop releasing low quality 'DLC' because that's the issue - people try to defend them saying that ""it's only $3"" or ""game additions are free"" however when it's been going on for so long, it feels more like a smack in the face for the older fanbase than aesthetic content and sub-par free content at the side of it - these individuals miss the point that they've been doing this for years without any significant update; I'd go as far to say that the warfare updates weren't really all that impressive since they didn't add anything to supplement the new weapon system and all the additional content.

Honestly; save your money (even if there's a sale) and look into something that has enough content to satisfy you long term because with the current state of the company and the game, there's no passion it seems or any incentive to give people what they want for content. From this point on I won't be playing this game again unless someone else takes over or I find a better game that is a derivative of what this was supposed to be.",1616855827,1678612325,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. Fix the hand drills.
To drill for ores without a ship, you use a hand drill. To pick up drilled ores, you need to press F repeatedly. Ores sometimes don't spawn on your crosshair and roll around, requiring you to chase them. This is annoying, and ship drills simply put the ore into your inventory automatically. 

2. Add explosions to damaged blocks.
This is a feature I want added. Say your reactor is damaged, and you have to repair it or evacuate before it explodes. This could happen for other blocks such as batteries, and This would add a fun gameplay experience that you could easily disable in settings.

one thing i dont like is that small grid ship blocks cost the same amont of pcu that large grid ship blocks do

my thoughts now? is good




OLD REVIEW BELOW: 

You may look at the thumbs down and think I don't like this game but in reality I love this game, I often lose hours of the day designing, building and testing space ships but it so hard to recommend this game.


First off the bugs: this game has more bugs than a spider web over a pile rotten meat... I'm looking at you pistons...

Second: Currupt save files, I lost a large space station and moon base because of this and going through some other reviews this isn't unique to me

Third: There is this weird issue with connectors where if you leave you ship connected to a station or larger ship it will have a seisure and won't stop unless you somehow get inside and disconnect (which by the way will more often than not cause damage to one, if not both ships) or reload the save

Forth: Planets eat proformance, you spawn a planet and goodbye framerate and that brings me to...

Fifth: Random Framerate drops and freezing, you can understand why this would make me mad.

Sixth: Crashes... no need to explain why this make me mad.

There is more but you get the picture and now let me tell you why I love this game

One: SPACESHIPS! I CAN BUILD SPACESHIPS OF MY OWN DESIGN

Two: The modding community of this game is amazing, more often than not I will find exactly what I need to build that oh so perfect ship

Three: Creative mode offers a lot of options for building your perfect ship and you can take that design and make it in survival using a projector

In summary I would give this game a 6/10 It's good and has potential but with the garbage multiplayer and the before mention bugs I can't recommend this game until those issues are fixed",1466817092,1678247861,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I honestly can't begin to describe the value I get out of this game. If you have a bunch of friends who like tinkering, building and trolling then you really don't have much chance of finding a better game to play together. I have well over 2000 hours i believe and I am itching to get my hands on the next major update. Most of this time was solo or closed server 2-4 player co-op with carefully selected mods and AI enemies added from the workshop, but the vanilla game can be so good now that i have started hopping on the public servers and that is getting so much better with the incoming Automotons DLC.

There is just something about the core gameplay loop here that is immensely satisfying. Building stuff that works together and relays information, items or services between everything... Bases, outposts, vehicles, industrial rigs, mines, satellites, ships of all types and sizes and roles. It's all here and if you can imagine a way they should work together, you can probably do it.

It has its quirks, but the community and the modding scene is excellent and I will continue to come back to play this excellent game again and again... and again... and again.",1678190739,1678190783,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To be fair this is a massive game and is basically Minecraft, in space. You can build some amazing things. If you decide to play this game alone, however, it just turns into an art program. You can make stuff but that's pretty much it. There is minimal life on planets and it's pretty much just vegetation that has no purpose aside from aesthetics.  This game has a lot of potential and is very beautiful, but it needs some non-player life added to it in a major way.

The game is set in a vast, open universe, where players can build and customize their own spaceships, space stations, and even entire planets.

The graphics in Space Engineers are absolutely stunning, with incredible attention to detail and realism. The game features a vast range of environments, from the vast emptiness of space to the barren landscapes of alien planets, all of which are beautifully rendered.

One of the most impressive aspects of Space Engineers is the sheer scale of the game. The universe is massive, and there is an incredible amount of freedom and flexibility in how you choose to explore and build within it. The game encourages creativity, and the possibilities for building and designing are virtually limitless.

Another standout feature of Space Engineers is its attention to detail. The game's physics engine is incredibly realistic, allowing players to build and operate their spaceships and stations with a high degree of accuracy and precision. This level of realism adds to the overall sense of immersion and makes the game incredibly rewarding to play.

Finally, the game has a thriving community of players, modders, and developers, which ensures that there is always new content and features being added to the game. Whether you are a seasoned veteran or a newcomer to the game, there is always something new to discover and explore.

Overall, Space Engineers is an outstanding game that offers a unique and engaging experience for players who are interested in space exploration, engineering, and creativity.

The game is probably my favorite game of all time. It may really only be about building space ships with not much else to do, but the shear amount of possibilities when it comes to designing ships and functioning systems really outmatches the depth of any other sandbox game. Some of you reading this review might have already tried space engineers and maybe you played with a friend or you built a simple brick with some thrusters. I would highly encourage you to look closer at what this game can offer. Go to the workshop and download some cool builds... you will soon be inspired as you realize how many options there really are. You can build replica ships and vehicles from other franchises like Star Wars or Star Citizen, you can design an entire fleet or faction of ships, you can build an effective PvP ship, and you can build the dream exploration vehicle that you've always wanted to live on. 

The gameplay loop is so satisfying when you finally complete a project that you put time and effort into and can fully enjoy your work by showing it off to your friends or building it on a multiplayer server. You do need to be creative and to enjoy the game to its fullest you have to build things like they would be built in real life. This means that while you might not necessarily need airlocks, crew accommodations, or exposed windows in the game, building them will make you feel more immersed in the world and your ship will come to life. This also means designing ships with a specific function. Don't design the end-all-be-all ship that does everything. Specialization is key to immersion. If you're playing survival, challenge yourself with some mods that add hunger or thirst, more dangerous PvE encounters, or limit your abilities such as jetpack move speed or no atmospheric thrusters. 

TLDR: If you've put 10-25 hours in this game and found yourself not sure what to do next, go check out the workshop and get some inspiration for a build. Don't get discouraged when your ship isn't workshop standard, and don't compare your progress to other people's.

This was  near game in early access 10 years ago. for 70 dollars today i am shitting myself thinking about all that is wrong with that.  There are newer games doing the same thing made today for less. Try those.

All the images and videos I saw for the store page contain these 10 $5.99  packs in addition to the 19.99 game. The only thing they claim ""it's not pay to win.

It's scale make it life-like, with giant planets and a totally destructible environment. It's like a giant build-your-own adventure puzzle. Space Engineers doesn't overwhelm you with thousands of different blocks, instead giving you just enough tools to concoct your very own warship, space station, or Mars rover. My first week playing this game, I ended up with a 47-hour playtime. This is a survival game that allows you the freedom to focus on what YOU want to make, rather than forcing you to chop trees, plant crops, drink water, etc before doing anything.

Pros:
+You can do anything you want, so long as you can build it.
+Scale makes multiplayer a treat, with enough room/time to prepare yourself before the bad guys show up
+The cheapest way to get a space ship from Star Citizen
+Shockingly stable for a game with endless voxels
+Incredibly useful tutorial that's ends up being pretty damn fun
+Awesome workshop asset/mod support. KEEN Discord is SUPER helpful

Cons:
-Occasional rendering issue on first login (Dude Where's my Cave?)
-Give us more decorative blocks!
-Can become a little bit of a menu-sim bouncing between ship inventories and builds
-Not a fan of the UI for Comms/GPS/Inventory

As of writing this review (pre-Automaton update) there is very little to this game except for the building system itself. There are no other engineers floating around space with you on singleplayer, just empty ships and desolate space stations. The most you'll interact with AI opponents is the occasional tiny Space Pirate drone, but that can be fixed with mods that add oponents.

This plus the lack of any endgame goals, the lack of a solid progression system, and no actual characters to interact with means this is little more than a glorified 3D modelling software.

It can be demanding on the PC specs, but that's understandable considering what the game is capable of rendering. I love the seemingly infinite possibilities for ship design, the potential for world building, and the incredible variety of blocks and tools. The Steam workshop integration is seamless, the blueprint system (for saving designs) works extremely well, and the DLC policy of the devs sets the gold standard of ethical monetization. My only wish would be for more opportunities in multiplayer to collaborate against NPC enemies (and more NPC enemies in general). 

An aside for new players; the learning curve can be a little steep, but the systems are actually very intuitive. Once you learn a few basics on how the grid system, inventory management, and power works, everything else falls into place quite nicely.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

Space Engineers is a sandbox type game somewhat like Minecraft and other big sandbox games. However for this game you will be building vehicles like space ships, planes, and ground vehicles (either tanks or mechs). Even with one thousand hours I still find my self building what ever is stuck in my head. For some, it is a way to build cool ships to battle each other and some just like to build. For me and my friends we are the latter, building some of the dumbest things and smashing them into each other with nuclear bombs (side note Nukes are modded not base game, workshop has a lot of cool stuff for this game.) With friends this game is truly a fever dream, expectantly when you play survival. Now for most, when they play survival they usually just have them and their friends get together and build stuff but... For me and my friends it is ALL, OUT, WAR. We do some rp (very surface level stuff just to give reasons to blow sh!t up) and wage wars against each other in factions. Some of the most fun I have had are in these moments where unique moments happen so often that I simple can't forget them. For example one moment I remember well was when I was at war with a bunch of my other friends, I was out numbered, hard, however I had easily the best warship in the server to a point where I was undefeated in space combat. At the time I had another friend that was interested in the server so I let him join my faction till he got used to the game. little did I know that the friends I was at war with had come up with a plan. They would do a two way assault, two of them that where suck on Mars would go to attack my planetary base there. The Other two would assault my orbital fortress over Mars. Since I had only one War ship and the friend on my side was very new at the game so I couldn't give him what was my Flag ship, I was forced to think of something. In my panic of trying to find out what to do after a hand full of minutes trying to think of what to do. There was an attack heading for my planetary base with no defenses but I had my Flag ship stationed on site to protect it. However they where already laying siege to my orbital fortress and it would take to long to get to it in time to defend the fortress and my planetary base at the same time. In a panic I sent my noob friend to use his first ship he had built to stall the ground attack. I would break for orbit and fight up there. My friend would engage with the ground force and do damage but not stop them and would get shot down. I was at the half way point to the fortress and had to stop and think of what to do. However It was to late, for the orbital attack had not only had the enemies taken the fortress but they where moving it (mindful it had not thrusters) They didn't run away with it, the fortress was actually falling. Now I had a different problem I had to deal with a Fortress as big if not bigger then my flag ship falling and crushing my planet base. Meanwhile I whole time was saying ""FUCK,FUCK,FUCK,FUCK,FUCK"" hoping that it would miss the base. I would fly my ship to intercept it in hopes of destroying it before it crushes anything important. It would miss all on it's own and the enemy ground force retreated since they had nothing good enough to destroy my flag ship. In this moment I was no longer the big bad of the server. 

Truly this Game thrives off of creativity and I could never have imaged such a moment like that happening between my and my friends. 9/10 game pls fix host connection advantage and improve engine if possibly.",1676321069,1676321069,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

TLDR: Yes, I recommend the purchase, but beware if you are going to play dedicated multiplayer.

Pros:
====
1. The ability to goof around building cool stuff is endless and I've spent a good amount of time just trying to create interesting devices, ships, etc. - and for this alone it is worth the purchase. A little imagination goes a long way with this game.

2. They're a little slow with providing shapes for niche uses to meld older blocks together nicely, but they've been getting there with new updates.

3. Mod support is incredible and the mod community has made some awesome stuff for this game.

Cons:
=====
1. Sometimes the physics simulation just goes insane and something that should in theory be within the constraints of the engine goes berserk and destroys everything - this physics behaviour is kind of embraced by the community jokingly, but it genuinely is a shame it's so unpredictable. Some consider it a charm of the game, but I don't.

2. Dedicated multiplayer needs reworking. Optimization is awful when playing multiplayer and the server software is fairly unstable. The hardware requirements are a little odd and out of date with current hardware you're likely to be serving it from - which causes annoying things like focusing your server around a single hyper fast core, not multiple.
De-sync, grid glitching, slowdown, wonky physics, etc. are all usually prevalent whenever anything meaningful is occurring on a dedicated server (ship battles, large crashes, large mining operations, complicated conveyor networks, etc.).
Mods, 3rd party server apps and addons go a long way to helping to solve some of the issues, but they shouldn't be a go to after all this time.
We always end up hitting some kind of weird performance issue or cap after a certain amount of building with friends - and it's a real let down.

I could go on at more length with more points, but I consider these the mains do buy / don't buy points of interest.",1675903629,1675903629,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Update after a few years, in 2023:

OK, let me explain further, in terms of other space games out there.  As we all know, different games scratch different itches, so to speak.  Not all games can do all things.  SE, however, does a very good job of holding its own within the current (2023) panoply of space simulation games.  The following is a direct comparison (my opinions of course) of SE and other multiplayer space games out there today:

SE vs Elite and Star Citizen
- Elite is much bigger, overall, but you cannot build your own ships or bases.  You can't do much except ""engineer"" your own ship, giving its systems a boost or two of improvement.  Star Citizen is quite a bit smaller, but still a little larger than SE.
- SE has ""jump"" FTL drives, to move you around the given solar system more quickly, once you have found the right materials to build and power them.  FTL travel is therefore a mid-game capability.  In Elite, you get FTL travel from the beginning, but it's pretty limited in distance.  In Star Citizen, it can depend on what ships you buy to get started with.
- SE's ships, especially when using the blocks provided by the DLCs, can look quite nice, sometimes even holding their own against the in-game ships of Elite.  And, SE lets you design and inhabit the interiors, which you can't do in Elite.  I think some SE designs even hold their own compared to Star Citizen, which of course allows you to go inside and toot around, go to sleep, etc.
- SE NPCs are pretty much invisible.  Trading, contracts, etc. are all done by terminal.  Enemy ships and drones are pilotless.  If you see another character, they're a real person.  The reason you see them is only because you set up your SE server to allow other players of a certain type (friends, etc.).  It's not an MMO.  Of course, in Elite and SC, there are lots of NPCs to interact with.
- SE is moddable.  Planets, ship designs, base designs, planetary improvements, quality of life improvements...etc.  In Star Citizen (and Elite) pretty much everything you see is provided by the developers, and players don't build almost anything.

SE vs. Empyrion
I think SE's closest rival is Empyrion.  Both have resource acquisition and building at the heart of the gameplay.  Both have large and small grid sizes.  However:
- Empyrion has interactible NPCs of various factions.  SE also has factions, but you don't ever actually see them, so they always feel a little theoretical.  Hey, there goes another Faction X ship.  OK, they're gone.
- Empyrion's surface vessels are hovercraft, while SE focuses on rovers.  To me, the rovers are more fun.
- Empyrion planets seem loaded with a lot more flora and fauna, but a lot of it repeats on multiple planets, like those protein-rich ""hot dog"" plants.  
- Speaking of those plants, Empyrion's survival system also includes hunger, so you have to eat and drink, in addition to breathing and staying healthy.  You can also be poisoned.  So, there is a fairly extensive food prep and storage crafting system in Emp. that does not exist in SE.
- Both games have developer-provided scenarios to play, and Empyrion has a storyline that is fed to you by an ""AI"" via your HUD and data pad.  SE sort of does this in tutorial scenarios and maybe elsewhere.
- Both games have workshop designs for bases, large and small starships, ground vehicles, etc. where players can upload and share their creations and mods.
- Both games are moddable.
- Empyrion has oceans and lakes, while SE planets don't have these unless modded.

ALL games have ground and in-space combat.  Which (as noted in a recent article) is a bit too bad, given that peaceful exploration is a major draw for such games.  So...play as you want; you can in SE (and possibly also Empyrion) turn off hostiles / animal spawns and just chill out on your own planet, building bases and such.

ALL games have some form of mining / resource extraction.  I find SE's the most satisfying.  Mining the asteroids by hand is a lot of fun.  Building mining ships makes it faster.  Building auto-miners for planetary resources is also an awesome way to go.

ALL games have exploration.  In the case of Elite, going deep into the galaxy is the name of the game.  In Star Citizen, it's finding special details left by the developers.  In SE, you can find relatively nice spots on various planets and moons (roughly a dozen, modeled after our solar system) and setup homes / bases / mines on each, and perfect your ship designs.  Or face off against other players if you like the combat aspects.  Recent DLCs have enhanced the weapon types and ship designs to look more ""military.""  In SE, roleplaying is definitely encouraged.

Conclusion:  SE is still doing a great job in 2023.

(story text is small and goes way too fast, plus it plays over cinematic events, forcing you to miss the event while reading, or stop playing and press enter to catch up on the text before you go forward).

I can tell this is gonna be a great game, but it needs polish and a better tutorial.  The current one feels like being thrown into some sort of main story while barely being instructed on how to use whats in front of you.

Like....    I don't need to be able to see this hot mess of control panels and connectors and settings and formattings before you're ready to show me how to use them.  Make all that stuff hidden before its ready to be introduced so you don't mental-flashbang your newbies.

And if this is a sandbox game, make sure you specify that the tutorial missions are instanced so I don't spend an hour collecting every material I can get my hands on just for you to take it away from me when my ship has a scripted cutscene death in the open world sandbox game, effectively wasting all the time I spent collecting those materials immediately after being instructed on how to collect materials.

For real.  The game is like...  ""Here's the farming tool.  Here's how to farm.  Here's a whole facility with spare stuff to salvage.  And your new ship has a lot of storage too!"" ...  ""P.S.Y.C.H! XD  Your ship died in a cutscene and all that farming was for nothing L.o.L.z XDXDXD.""

Although it is often confusing and not user friendly it is worth to giving it a chance. I find the build of this game unique and intriguing. I'm often frustrated to the lack of information on most of the physics but the community has made up somewhat for this lack by posting tutorials and documentation publicly outside Space Engineers domain.
