Without spoiling anything, I can only say that I spent LOTS of time doing trial & error. First time SHOULD be in the easiest difficulty until you start figuring out how the game works for the first 50-70 hours...

No matter the playthrough, the first few characters you make will suck, so don't get too attached to them. Then (once you gather your bearing and only if you care about steam achievements) start an ""Immortal"" difficulty playthrough. Achievements only unlock if you are playing in this difficulty (only one exception).

Now about the story (spoiler free): You have to a chat minigame in order to unlock some mysteries. Depending on how much information you managed to unlock, the final ending dialogues will be different. Also you reach different conclusions depending on how many and which mysteries you unlocked. 4 different versions.

If it wasn't for Sseth's video i would avoid this game as a ""rimworld clone"", but it actually has way more mechanics inside, as well as a proper Story and mysteries in the world of cultivation. 

The only bad thing is micro-management (basically lack of QoL) and if you want to collect achievements you will need to learn A LOT of excel spreadsheets and different guides (or just use mods or modify game on your own to speed up\simplify the process).

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

This is a game where numerous insane things are possible, such as ascending a bowl of noodles to godhood. Not exactly optimal, per se, but it's possible. There's a grindy element to it, lots of resources and events rely on random chance, even down to getting a promising dude to train up. 
There IS a main story! But it's kind of terrible and following it can be quite a pain, you need a lot of grinding and RNG to complete it. It's not recommended for newbies, outside of getting the initial bonus stuff.

I Purchased this game 6 days ago and it has completely taken over my life.
My first Sect Went quite well, or so I thought. My first Cultivator has a Max Qi of 1867 by the time he was ready to form a golden core and he got a Tier eight golden core somehow. A few days later my Sect got attacked by band of cosplaying furries who were taking large quantities of steroids and everyone got trampled to death via their super powered bovine hooves.

In my current run the game gave me Female cat yaoguai who I was going to originally gonna give the Xiandao Sunflower refining law, but whilst mining I found an ancient casket that contained one of the shendao laws. So I decided to do the only logical course of action and turn the cat woman into a deity. Meanwhile My main cultivator/sect leader is casually flying around the world in search of ginseng and large quantities of wood.

My one complaint is that I need a mod to have multiple pets at once. Please GSQ in ACS2 let me have the dog and the fox at the same time.

If you do not like relying on guides, do not play this game. 

Perhaps the situation is different if you are HARDCORE into Wuxia and you know that evil sects cultivate earth flux already or stuff like that, but before this game, I didn't even know what the cultivation genre was.

I'm serious, you will rely on guides from the time you start playing all the way until you have beaten the game. If at any point you decide to stop following a guide you will be essentially unable to advance in any meaningful way until you go back to the guides.

As an example:

To do basically anything in the game, you need high tier cultivators. To get high tier cultivators you need to do many things, most of which the game explains well in its tutorial. Unfortunately, you also need to know where to get {magical energy rock}, {super plant root}, and {dream snow} (these names are made up to avoid spoilers). You can get all of these in exactly one way: you send a reasonably lucky cultivator to one of about 20 exact places, REPEATEDLY, with each exploration having a small chance to reveal the exact area that has this exact item. There are no hints as far as I saw to the location of any of these essential items. 

I am legitimately convinced the game would take 1000 hours of spreadsheet keeping to actually find out for yourself where every essential game item is, and this example is just for items! At every turn, there are 10 things the game seems to expect you to just already know in order to progress and it just never stops.

Following a guide to better understand Feng Shui or game mechanics in general is fine in my book, you learn it once and then you can utilize it yourself. But relying on guides 100% of the way through the game or else you just cant do anything at all is just...

You're basically not even playing a game at that point in my opinion.

To the devs:

Your game is already very successful and well loved, so I'm not sure you even SHOULD make changes based on what I personally want, but if I was going to play your game, I would need to be able to reasonably do so without looking outside of the game for information. Maybe you can expand the social dialog system to include hints about how important getting more max qi is for cultivators to get better golden cores or about the whereabouts of certain essential items.

Additional thoughts after 30 more hours a few years later

My above review still stands basically as before: 
If you don't like the thought of being hand-held by a guide the entire way, this is probably not the game for you.

HOWEVER. This game is probably the single best game I've ever played at providing a feeling of deep progression, so if the guide thing DOESN'T bother you, or only sometimes bothers you and other times you can deal with it...

Cons of this game, lack of information and for someone never familiar with fengshui, going to take several trial and error and gameplay.

Wish the 2nd one would include feature such as storage spaces in a box/shelf/container. Perhaps also some blueprint of typical rooms our courtyards in these time period. Better fight simulation than just seeing standing on an weapon while launching artifact fight. Want to see more boom boom effect like the movie for cutilvator that mainly use spells. 

another con of the game, random character creation rather than choose what to create and rndom visual appearance.

if 2nd game will be 3D, perhaps simple like Going medieval would be nice idea, with priorities table.

The design is similar to rim world, and there are some similar mechanics such as building storage and freezers etcs. However, there are different aspects as well like cultivation rooms and auctions. Fans of Wuxia novels would definitely enjoy building your own sect of human and or beasts, joining auctions for rare and common materials, as well as going on various adventures.

Pros:
-Freedom of choice to do things
-Helpful community (there are many in game helpful suggestions and explanation )
-Music has a nice wuxia theme
-DLC not too expensive and provides more variety of materials

Cons: 
-My only cons like most people is the social interaction which can be time consuming if you don't use a mod
-Takes a lot of time to learn everything in depth. I created three different sects before I got comfortable with the mechanics of the game.

- Build a sect

- Play a variety of maps
- Mod the game if you like

Cons:
- Experience things go from normal to hell in less time than it takes you to think ""where did things go wrong?""

However, one of the standout features of the game is its innovative Feng Shui mechanics, which add an extra layer of depth and complexity to the game.

In Amazing Cultivation Simulator, the Feng Shui of your sect is of utmost importance. The placement of buildings and structures, as well as the layout of your sect, can greatly affect your disciples' cultivation speed and success rate. By paying attention to Feng Shui, players can enhance the power and effectiveness of their sect and improve their chances of success.

The game's Feng Shui mechanics are intuitive and easy to understand, yet they add a great deal of strategic depth to the game. By experimenting with different layouts and designs, players can create a sect that is both powerful and aesthetically pleasing.

But the game's strengths don't end with its Feng Shui mechanics. The game boasts a wide range of features and mechanics that make it a truly immersive and engaging experience. The character cultivation system, for instance, is well-balanced and rewarding, allowing players to train and improve their disciples in a variety of skills and abilities.

The game's graphics are also impressive, with beautiful and detailed environments that capture the essence of ancient China. The game's art design is detailed and stunning, and each sect and character feels unique and full of personality.

Overall, Amazing Cultivation Simulator is an exceptional game that is well worth your time and attention.

1. interface is annoying to navigate through
2. There isn't much optimization/strategy to preform. 
3. Early game is aggressively much longer and much more boring than other colony sims.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

However, the game's extreme complexity and lack of clear explanations can make it difficult for players to understand and enjoy.

One of the main problems with the game is its steep learning curve. The game throws players into the deep end without providing much in the way of tutorial or guidance, which can be overwhelming for new players. Additionally, the game's mechanics and systems are highly convoluted and unintuitive, making it difficult for players to understand what they need to do in order to progress.

Furthermore, the game's lack of explanations for its various systems and mechanics can be frustrating for players. While the game does provide some basic information, much of it is presented in dense and impenetrable text, making it difficult for players to understand what they are supposed to do. This lack of clarity can make the game feel unnecessarily punishing, as players are left to figure out the game's systems on their own.

Reasons I love this game: 

- It wonderfully converts Chinese Taoist, Buddhist and Wuxing philosophy, traditional Chinese medicine concepts and xianxia tropes into game mechanics. Chinese fantasy is a super fun genre.
- The five elements (Wuxing) really come into play in the game in a number of ways, with almost every item in the game being assigned or needing to be created with a certain element
- You're forced to learn feng shui and practice it to a decent degree in your decorating, lest your disciples become depressed and drop dead of heart attacks. It is, however, a good technique to maim people and place them in an ominous (bad feng shui) room to die so you can harvest agonised soul shards from them.
- The animism is so hardcore I had a random piece of iron ore on the edge of my map develop sentience. Trees gather and glow with qi (lifeforce) and the environment as a whole can be affected by qi flow. Turning different things into humans gives different hairstyles.
- You can have an adorable spiritual dog who can defecate in any number of contexts and places you desire!
- There are a variety of exciting character backstories and traits that can really make you invested in them
- Characters have popups that make them feel real - e.g. someone could be cooking and begin to cry (lol, mood), they can have unique conversations with each other at lunch (mine like talking about their scars...), they can fall in love and it can be one-sided or requited (my ugly yaoguai manual labour slaves are being friendzoned by my ladies til the end of time xoxo), they can get into arguments and have such dramatic falling outs with their roommates you have to do a switcheroo, etc.
- They also have moodlets (similar to sims) and are affected by their lifestyle and what's happening around them. They have reactions to the type of food they eat, the weather and season. They can also have relationships with each other and this mechanic is even better with the Tie the Knot mod (the most popular English language mod for the game) as you can have siblings, cousins, parents, crushes, admirers, lovers, husbands and wives (...and harem members lol) and have Mary Sue children.
- Character deaths feel immersive as you can build graves and tombs for them and other characters are impacted by their deaths, gaining moodlets and providing reactions. I was really surprised when my first tomb automatically labelled itself with the name of my deceased character and her friends gathered around her to offer prayers. The game then told me to check the epilogue section in the main menu and when I clicked into it it generated a story for me of my character's future experience through the reincarnation cycle and all the different creatures and people she became. Just super neat.
- You can play as awakened animals known as Yaoguai, with the type of animal they are affecting their stats and personality. Cats, for example, are as prissy as real life cats and refuse to do any manual labour (can you tell I'm a dog person?). They do, however, excel in detail work due to their sharp and judgmental eye and can be very charming...
- There are dragons! And demon beasts! But dragons!
- Base building is extremely satisfying and feels fun too due to the characters' reactions to work, having to keep their moods up, and even the animations (I love seeing them hauling two water buckets on sticks and chopping wood at the timber station, for example) as well as the appealing decorating options that fully take advantage of the beauty of the mythological ancient Chinese setting
- There are seasons and different types of weather - also, your characters can carry around umbrellas when it rains. Cute.
- Pretty special effects for cultivators and certain weapons
- Complex health and medical system where every main part of the body (flesh, bones, and organs) can come into play and can be affected in certain ways. Characters can lose limbs, experience internal damage, have their skulls crushed, acquire scars, suffer heatstroke and frostbite, etc. You can craft acupuncture needles and medicines. Injuries can affect pain (and therefore mood), senses (perception), movement and ability to carry out skills. I loved the fact that in Kenshi different body parts could be affected, this game takes it a step further.
- This game isn't a farming sim but as someone who loves farming mechanics I found a fair bit to enjoy here. The environment is affected by temperature and certain plants have specific requirements (and you can make your own temperature-controlled greenhouses!). Plants take a certain amount of time to grow and can be affected by their surrounding environment, fertilisation (but these are ancient times, so by fertiliser I mean it the old school way - poop and dead bodies) and your characters' farming skill. You can tame and passively breed animals, and no, it's not too complex, but every time mine die I experience physical pain in my chest, so. You can also use a variety of ingredients to cook many different recipes, I've managed 50 different ones so far and am working on improving my ingredients so I can serve my characters top quality meals.
- You can persuade others to join your sect, recruit them through different events and constructing city recruitment agencies, and even invite people to stay over to boost your relations, essentially providing a hotel-style minigame where you have to set up ideal accommodations to ensure your guests are fully satisfied
- The survival aspects are intense and fun. There are also a number of different types of maps you can choose from for where your sect will be based.
- You can reanimate corpses into undead puppets to do your dirty work
- You get a choice in how to react to certain scenarios - help that fellow who lost his way or kill him to get that shiny sword he has on his back? Gain resources from other sects through diplomacy and exchanging information they want in exchange for their intel or steal from them and wipe them out?
- Your adventures are not limited to your home base's map. Your cultivators can travel all over to socialise with other sects, explore, and gather resources. You can set up your own temples.
- You can pursue immortality while facing tribulations from the heavens for your defiance of the natural order of life and death
- You can become a ""god"" who receives tons of worshippers by your gate and can choose to accept and deny prayers
- You can practice a variety of schools of cultivation, each with different focuses and effects
- You can develop obsessions, which are basically glorified mental illnesses #representation
- The art style is really cute, offering a little bit extra than pixel games while still not exceeding itself so I can even manage it on my junk laptop that's been dropped on its head a few times too many. It's modern but modest and just works, perfectly balancing aesthetics and practicality",1669401146,1669401146,True,19,0,0.705448627471923828,0,True,False,False

The study materials for this game alone can cover at least a semester of a college major. Instead of giving a proper review, let me tell you some tips on how you can get a Tier 1 Golden Core from your 1st (or maybe second) generation of core disciples:

-Cultivator should have, at base (no cultivation) around 40+ Qi Sense

-Eat 2 Earth Flux, 1 Purple Junk pill (I always do my first generations without wicked flux because it's unnecessary)

-I personally do around 6 of each Red Ginseng and Ganoderma

-On the day of breakthrough, season should be really good (3+)

-On the day of breakthrough, have a talisman of good mental bonus (around +10 will do), take a purity pill to keep it pristine (important)

-The location should have a Qi gathering of at least 600+ or so, no need to overkill

-Always use the best weather, keep it up all the way through

-Time the breakthrough so it ends in 5 Yin Yang, just before -1. The 5 YinYang should be up majority of the time of breakthrough to the end. It's okay to save scum just to get the timing right.

-Learn every manual giving max Qi, Qi Sense, Constitution and Int. Don't bother learning the one which explodes your heart, it's unneeded.

If you get everything right, it should give anywhere between 130k-150k Base T1 cultivator which are fine for 1st Generation. If you mess up the mental and/or timing, it can go as low as T2. To be honest, there is just a little incentive to go for T1 before for 1st Generation since you mostly rebirth them once you have dedicated ""King maker"", ""Alchemist"" and ""Artificer"".

Fair note though: don't try to play this game without savescumming, without mods and without help. All three are pretty much mandatory. For a few mod recommendations for features that really should have been core functionality:
More Grid Info
Show Law Stats

Open Otherworld Rift

1. Element harmony is everything: From making your sect more auspicious and inviting to aiding your inner disciples' breakthroughs, to even influencing how much items are produced at a building if what i'm told is correct, you must make sure that the right elements are near each other. There are plenty of guides in English to help you out.

2. Cultivation is the bread and butter of this game: Your task is to help your (most worthy) disciples ascend into powerful cultivators who can live for hundreds if not thousands of years and wreak foes with awe-inspiring abilities. There are different manuals and paths your inner disciples as they are also known can take and most cater to a particular element and play styles. Expect to hunt for many of them all over the world or purchase them from allied clans. Meanwhile, your [strike]peasants[/strike] outer disciples focus on keeping the base tidy and building more buildings, though as time goes by, they become more useful as either future inner disciples or abbots for your new acquisitions on the world map. Just don't get famous too quickly before you are ready or you might suffer a repeat of the fall of the Taiyi Sect

3. Gossip often: You can learn about the NPC's and become their friends. Some may even sell you special items if they like you enough. The rules of thumb are simple: People will only tell you what they like/dislike or be more likely to join your sect if they trust you enough, they are still less likely to tell you more confidential things about themselves such as their precious treasures but someone else might know, and the information you gathered will make the other person like you more but only if they're interested in that person in the first place.

No matter how you wish to cultivate your disciples, just remember that the only limits that exist are your own knowledge and skills.

Focusing on trying to get a T1 Golden Core was a nice challenge, but after that and after hitting Primordial Spirit, my interest in playing started to drop. I was hoping once I hit that level, the game would actually open up with fun stuff to do, but none of the stuff to do actually seemed to be fun. It seemed like I had pretty much seen all there is to see as far as what the gameplay was going to be like.

It didn't seem like there was much actually fun gameplay as I was, for the most part, just sitting and waiting for my inner cultivators to repeatedly go on adventures so I could get more items. So basically the main way to acquire resources and make progress seems to be completely passive, uninvolved, and slow - either farm cotton and sell it, then buy what you wanted, or send people off on adventures with your fingers crossed. And each adventure round trip can be pretty slow. 

If doing that stuff was more of an engaging loop, like interesting combat or action of some kind, it might have held my interest. But in my experience, the combat in the game is feast or famine and completely uninvolved on top of that. There is no flow to be found here. And there is a LOT of just waiting and doing nothing even with the fast forward options available.

The only challenge seemed to be finding the right information on wikis and guides to know how to do something. Attempting to figure it out by yourself would be a frustrating time sink. Pretty much all of the gameplay seemed to be just learning about the poorly-communicated mechanics of the game. And even annoying things like what effect an item actually has. Items in game have descriptions but they often don't tell you their actual effect, so you have to turn to a wiki to find that info.

And then at the end of all of that researching you start to wonder what you were really researching it for, because it's not like you're going to suddenly discover engaging and fun gameplay despite knowing that info.

And even with the lack of engaging gameplay, there's also the myriad shortcomings and QoL issues that really add up even with mods. For example, not being able to see people's full stats when recruiting from a Spirit Hall. People not doing work despite it being set as their priority (chefs not cooking was my biggest problem). Slow scrolling speed of the screen. No sound effects when zoomed out to the furthest distance (and there is really no reason to zoom in - it just hinders your ability to see what's going on).",1661482898,1661483352,False,3,0,0.478260844945907593,0,True,False,False

But it is not without flaws.  The mid to late game management lacks any form of automation functionality and gets rather burdensome trying to manage every aspect of every cultivator eventually.

Light spoilers regarding content, also take my understanding with a grain of salt. I'd say I've actually played about 40-50 hours at the time of writing this.

Pros:
* Lots of depth in the systems in game
* 3 different cultivation systems (Shendao/Godhood, Xiandao (Qi Refining/Golden Core), Body Cultivation)
* Community is fantastic
* English translations are good
* A great platform to experience fun stories, think of Rimworld and all the silly stuff that happens but with mythological proportions

Cons:
* Oh god where did my weekend go
* Lots of depth in the systems in game [You will end up studying, or suffering]
* The social minigame is annoying, use it your first playthrough, then get the mod that gives you the one click favor to avoid lots of it.
* You can travel to other maps, but can't build on them. The world is pretty static. It may be off putting if you like playing the same way every time, and want the replay value from a different world to try it in. In my opinion between the difficulty options, and depth of the systems allows for sufficient variety in runs. Want to make it spicy? Pick a beastman and have a clock ticking down until his tribulation. Or focus on a specific element, law, or cultivation style. Impose restrictions like being an evil sect and only interacting with other evil sects.

However if you just want to play ""Rimworld-like"" game in a different setting and not really familiar with the cultivation thingy, i'd think twice before buying it. Below the details:

At the beginning it looks fairly simple - if you ever played Rimworld or any other basebuilding/team development games/city builders you'll be right at home. But then...then comes cultivation.

This game has much more complicated cultivation mechanics than most of  other Xianxia games - for example, you actually have to take into account Feng Shui when building your base - like, wanna have your bedrooms with doors at the west side? Haha your whole sect gets their hearts taken by ""haunted house"" modifier. Want out to practice a manual which looks cool at the first glance? Haha find out that some of its later elements are incompatible and your char is basically useless now.

IMO, the system here is MUCH more complicated than complex. Meaning, it is not that complex or difficult, its just done in a very confusing way...being familiar with most traditional Chinese concepts and xianxia lore in general, I in the end managed to figure out what's what. So if you're into it too - it is well worth the price...

...However, if you never seriously played any cultivation games before and have no idea about traditional Chinese folklore(Xianxia)...don't start with that one. It may look as simple as Rimworld but its not. Try Tale of Immortal or Tale of Wuxia for example, they are also on steam and are much, much easier to comprehend, despite being set in the same universe/lore. 

Well, on sale you can try starting with this, but I warned you :)

Overall: 7/10 good but I wish it was tad less clogged with unnecessary minor mechanics and obscure modifiers. 
P.S. probably would be 10/10 for you if you have big in interest in Feng Shui thingy specifically

But that last bit will come in the sequel. An intrepid modder could easily turn this game into whatever flavor of occult nonsense they prefer personally with enough effort. 

It is a pure crossover between people who like to focus on bending mechanics to their whims, and absolutely weird vibes. Your interior decoration matters to help give your people magical powers, as well as what compass direction the door faces. Rare items need to be collected that store massive amounts of power, and people will use them to level up by staring at them for an extended period of time from a comfy cushion. And of course, mugging people for their books helps you become a god. 

Overall? Pretty neat game. Translation is bad at points, but never so bad I couldn't understand what it was getting at. Probably optimally enjoyed in its original language and with the cultural context that informs it, but honestly what's there is simple enough once you realize ""You are running a small parallel society of people who want to learn martial arts till their martial arts mastery translates into magic through sheer skill and understanding, and who have the potential to grow even stronger if they get more people on their level who can teach them stuff they wouldn't learn otherwise"". Like, seriously, the sect you play as a descendant of is called the Taiyah, and they are literally known for brewing medicines that cause you to die, reincarnate as a whole ass grown person, and start all of their training over again with a lot more ease in progression and the chance to get Even Further in their refinement. These are the kinds of fuckers that go ""Wait, I'm not powerful enough even as a fucking demigod, let me go try again with a better plan this time"". And yeah, they might only have vague memories of their previous life, but they could easily write themselves a book with instructions on how to go even further beyond and let things sort themselves out, its not like they won't immediately stumble onto the sect again.

1) Yes, this game has rich content. But the developer did not give a detailed instruction to every mechanism (the simple instructions in the game is not enough for you to beat the game). I have to frequently searching online for my questions. This would waste new players a lot of time (>500hrs) to fully understand this game.
2) The game is overly complicated and exhausting to play with. Especially when your sect start to have 36 members. Taking care of each person is a challenging mission. You have to frequently pause the game and check everyone's status. Too much micromanagement! The game itself lacks freeing-hand mechanism after you upgrade your sect. The game developer should not expect every players to searching for mods to relief their hands.
3) The info collection is a pain in the ass, which you have to talk with a lot of NPCs (really... a lot). This should be optimized to a easier style (do not tell me there is a mod. It's not good enough!). Also, the task of solving certain mysteries has completely no hints or clues. Very confusing...

This game is based off chinese mythology and various works about ""immortal cultivators"" (xianxia) and is also clearly inspired by Rimworld. The thing is, rimworld looks like a small arcade game in compraison.

This really is a simulator. Rules and mechanics are obscure, there's a lot of depth, things on purpose aren't clearly explained, you have to figure them out. Figuring them out is fun. At the same time, you can take it slow and lay low without being assaulted by bazillion of enemies right away.

The premise is that you're one of the few survivors (or the sole survivor) of destroyed taoist sect. You've survived the destruction, and are now trying to rebuild, and advance on path of ""cultivation"", which basically means gaining superhuman abilities and then, if you're lucky, perhaps reaching immortality. If you can, that is. To do that you practice a ""law""(a set of traditions) that grants you more powers.

Reaching immortality and gaining power is not easy, because everything interacts with Feng Shui's five elements, and there's matter of dealing with Qi. Five elements (Fire, Earth, Metal, Water, Wood) are organized in such way that one that one element is empowered by another element, and at the same time it is supressed by one more element. So, if your ""law"" involves a specific element, and you're sitting in a room full of items made out of incompatible element, you're going to have a bad time.

Untangling all those rules is a lot of fun. At the same time, playing this game explains a lot of things you'd encounter in chinese cultivation works (comics, novels). Because the picture of the world is quite grim. Mortals toil to support powerful cultivators who fool around to maintain sane mental state, and when they aren't doing that, they're sitting on their room in lotus pose, while the mortals are digging soil, farm vegetables and raise buildings for those lazy superhumans, slaving away with a tiny hope of ever bein allowed to step onto the path of immortality themselves. But at the same time those superhumans are capable of creating talismans, using alchemy, creating artifacts and performing miracles. Some of those miracles come with terrible price like devouring lifespan, and in the end most of them die, being destroyed by ""tribulations"" (a test bestowed upon you by the heavens to see if you're worthy of your power), killed by demonic beasts, and other cultivators. Normal animals gain sentience sometimes, and turn into yaoguai - half-human half-animal monsters, and they're racing against clock, desperately trying to amass enough power so they can overcome their own ""tribulation"" which will come quite soon. 

This is fascinating, and the whole t hing made many things I've seen in novels click.

-----

All things considered, I'd say this game is amazing, but is not for everybody. If you want easy victory or clear mechanics, this is not for you, because keeping things obscure is kinda the point. It is also translated from chinese, and has multiple minor issues with UI and occasional odd translation here and there.

Also, there is one bad part in the game. The chat minigame. It is utterly terrible. 

It is also a bit unfortunate that they retained rimworld's top down view, even though the game uses 3d models, unlike Rimworld. i'd love to see this in isometry. 

So the bottom line if you ever had interest in chinese xianxia novels, this is definitely worth checking out.",1654434254,1654434254,True,26,0,0.75848919153213501,0,True,False,False

The premise is that you build and groom your ""cultivators""in different ""laws"", these are Qi paths, all which are equivalent to magical powers that you give to your characters. There are two types of characters: inner disciples and outer disciples. Outer disciples are common humans (or Yao Guay: humanoid beasts) with different skills which help sustain your little colony by hunting, farming, mining, etc. Inner disciples are superhumans, are incredibly strong in battle and have magical Qi powers. While the game at first may seem similar to Rimworld or DF, it is much more than a mere colony sim. Everything in the world is affected by Feng Shui and the 5 Elements and their interactions so, orinetation,  and materials must always be taken into consideration. Once there is a specific breakthrough and you get your very own Mini Universe to store almost everything, the way the colony works changes drastically and becomes much more focused on the Inner disciples and their cultivation paths. I have played for over 200 hours and am by no means an expert. This game is very complex and there are times, when you'll seem to be doing fine and realize you did a lot of things wrong and now your inners are very weak compared to those from de AI, so they'll wipe the floor with your entrails.

As a side note: always check your sect's reputation and try to keep it as low as possible. Once it grows , invaders will become stronger and stronger and you might not be able to handle them!

First, before I get into the actual review, let me help some folks out with a very simple remark. If you like to ""try before you buy"" by taking advantage of the Steam refund window, don't bother with this game. You cannot get even an idea of what the game is all about in 2 hours, so if you're really on the fence about spending the money on it, just don't. (I don't consider this to be the game's fault, it's just how it is.)

Moving on: this review is not negative because of a lack of polish, substance, flavor, or stability. There are some problems along these lines, but they're pretty modest. Let me give a few examples anyway.

The translation and UI have some significant faults. As just one example of this, there is no way to read why feng shui modifiers described as just ""Bedroom"" or ""Workshop"" are actually good or bad. It turns out that these lines are based on the direction that the door faces matching up with what's inside the room. The game does explain how doors into various rooms should face, but this UI element does very little to help you know whether you did it right.

Similarly, the tutorials, even though there are an unbelievable number of them and each is separately done pretty well, do not really come together into a coherent picture of what you want/need to do, why you want/need to do it, and how you actually do it. The tutorials are more like ""here is how you do this thing"", but they provide very little context for what that thing is for, or even how far into the game it will first come into play. This is only partially caused by the complexity of the game; it is also caused by the overall tutorial experience not being very well thought out.

The tutorials and the in-game tips when you reach certain milestones are often redundant to each other. This can make it feel like it was kind of a waste of time to do the tutorials at all, especially in the early stages...and when doing less than half of the tutorials takes well over an hour, that's a pretty significant problem.

For just one more negative detail before I get to the main point, I want to mention that this game's social system is the most unbelievably tedious and pointless thing I have ever seen in any game. I don't even know how to explain how terrible it is, so if you want to know about it, just go watch SsethTzeentach's review (which is generally positive but is quite negative on this point). There is a cheaty mod that basically lets you bypass the entire system, though.

Despite everything I said above and other issues along the same lines, there is actually quite a bit of good stuff here. At the very least, there is enough for me to get past the issues with the translation, UI, and tutorials. There is not enough to make me willing to bother with the social system, but there is a lot you can do without touching that, and again you can more or less bypass it with a mod if you want to actually experience the game's story (what little of it there actually is).

With all that said, the main thing I wanted to say with this review is that although this game eventually gets good if you give it the time, the amount of time it takes to get good is excessive, as is the relatively low amount of enjoyment that you get in the meantime. I've already sunk the time in, so I can sort of enjoy it now, but in those early stages I was honestly paying more attention to the shows I was watching on the other screen than to the game. 

Most of this ""it takes too long to get good"" feeling is not really related to the pace of the game when you already know how to play. Indeed, I suspect people playing established rush strategies can keep things moving at a pretty good clip right from the start. Instead, it is mostly related to the pace of the game while you are still learning things. 

Now why isn't this learning experience fun? To be sure, part of it is that the game is too hard to learn. But a game being hard to learn just drags out the learning experience. I could be OK with that if learning the game were fun, which in some games it is. But in ACS, rather than having a fun experience of unraveling complex and nuanced systems, your learning experience mostly amounts to asking a bunch of questions about seemingly complex mechanics, which ultimately have objectively correct answers. This is especially true earlier in the game; 20+ hours into the game you start to see some nuance. 

In some rare cases, the straightforwardness of solutions is related to balancing issues, where one solution to a problem is vastly superior to another in every way. For example, there is basically no reason to actively farm Inspiration (the currency used to teach cultivators new skills) by using the Train mode, because you can obtain Inspiration much more than 10 times faster by using your agencies. But in most cases, getting these questions answered is just what the game is about.

To put it another way, despite its sandbox appearances, this is a game that can be largely spoiled by a guide. Here are a few examples of what I mean by that. There are optimal ways to build rooms. Each location has a static pool of resources and a static exploration map, which means that the availability of various resources is basically the same in every game (changing your local map doesn't really change all that much, nor does the order you discover maps when you explore). The storyline is scripted; even the names of the important characters are fixed, so for example the first person you hear about in the story will always be Yue Qingchou, and she's always a member of the same sect. There are standard tactics to keep your reputation from rising too high, so that you crush every invader you are likely to see unless you crank the difficulty way up. (But if you do crank the difficulty up when you are pretty new at the game, learning the concepts will take [i]even longer[/i].)

I could give more examples, but I think you get the point. Overall, it takes lot of effort to learn these secrets on your own. Whether you view that effort as a huge grind or a fascinating journey is a matter of taste, but I started finding it to be a real chore as soon as I had any idea how to play. Once you know a good portion of these secrets, I have already seen that there is a fairly deep management game embedded in here. But without a guide, it takes dozens of hours to learn enough to access that game. When you've learned that much (whether you used a guide or not), you see just how shallow many of this game's ostensibly complex systems really are.",1608954808,1642725637,False,434,15,0.816226661205291748,41,True,False,False

Interface is clunky, adventure locations lack complexity, AI is inexistent. Characters are hard to control to do specific things because they have their own schedule (like in a RTS) and they will move away to follow that schedule as soon as you end an action. This is supposed to be a numbers game but there's so many things that do not work or don't work as intended that the game ends up being a frustrating mess.
TLDR :
This game has more bugs than China has people. Joke aside just check the number of unresolved bugs in their discord before buying the game https://discord.com/channels/608499065071861761/689313458461605919 , game should be beta probably.
So this is a video of me playing the game on the hardest difficulty. 
You can see how the game looks like - not much cause it should be a numbers game, but when you make a numbers game you gotta be precise and there's so many bad bugs in this game that is not worth. The video will show some AI bugs i encountered during normal gameplay, read the description for the exact time of the bugs.

Check out the movement loop bug at 1:03:17, read the video description, even such a basic thing as movement is bugged !
On top of that, some other bugs like Body Cultivators getting stuck in combat (affects even some very hard to beat enemies from an entire sect , Demonia sect) until the starve and faint and they become very easy to kill, it's hillariously bad !

Did some research and found someone else posting in steam forums saying something that sounds like they had a similar issue. Other forum users dismissed the claim, and perhaps it is a false flag, but it seems highly suspicious to me. Never had a game show up as a virus like this for me.

Sad to give it a negative review as it seems like a pretty good game, but not worth the security risk. 

And to all those who say it's not a big deal because lots of programs track you on the internet, they do and lots of anti-cheat software games have is... unethical to say the least.

After spending 300+ hours in this game, learning all the guide, tips etc, the reward for creating the strongest sect is lackluster.

Each enemy sect have roughly the same power, if you can defeat one of them, you can defeat all.
The reward isn't really useful since they are the toughest enemy in the game. It like getting ultimate weapon after defeating final boss...no reason to use those weapon at all. 

Each sect have a legendary formation. But you won't have enough formation point to use them efficiently until you beat another 5-6 sects, learn their unique formation and wonder.
By the time you can use those formation, you already halfway conquering the whole map.  You don't need that formation at all to finish the rest. If you using shendou or physical cultivator, that formation reward is completely useless

For all the complicated mechanic they put in this game. I don't understand why they didn't expand on the end game.
All these time spent to learn so all the game mechanic, and those end game fight just take less than 10min and it is nothing epic. No dialogue, no story.


The main story is just tedious to do. Instead of normal dialogue, now you have to talk with thousand of people to unlock their heart and then they give you tiny piece of the mystery. I never gone past 5 peoples before i get bored. 

If i can travel back to past, i would tell past self that this game just not worth the time and effort to learn. The learning curve is really steep for no good reason.",1632036724,1636431195,False,66,8,0.696899235248565674,0,True,False,False

The game itself is a micro-management game similar to Rimworld, but with Xianxia instead of sci-fi. It takes a while to figure everything out, and you're likely to experience disasters for your first couple of games. After that, though, the game opens up. There're so many systems in the game that even after 200 hours, I'm still discovering new things I didn't know existed. The battles are fun to watch, but require enough input and attention that they don't feel boring, even when they last for an extended period. The Feng Shui mechanics of the game make for a slightly more engaging base-building element than otherwise, and make for interesting puzzles when designing aesthetically pleasing bases. 

As you accumulate experience, the game tends to open up, especially towards the start, and has multiple game modes oriented towards returning players. Achievements are actually disabled for the beginner modes, and only enabled in the ""immortal"" mode, in which only a single save is allowed, which is overwritten whenever you exit the game. Immortal mode has a number of modifiers and special rules that can be toggled to make the game more difficult or to add new challenges. When the game says that the mode isn't for beginners, it isn't kidding. Many of the modifiers multiply the difficulty of the game by many times, with several that are infamous in the game's community for being wipe points even for fairly experienced players. 

The game's in-game mod interface and mod store work fairly well, and have relatively powerful creation tools. The game also comes with built-in documentation and can be fairly easily edited to make minor changes to parameters in the game.

All that said, there are downsides to the game that somewhat take away from the experience. The help menu is hard to find, and the game's wiki tends towards unhelpful. This is somewhat offset by the helpful and friendly community on discord, but isn't a good substitute. The translation of the game is barely meh by standards of chinese to english games, and there're certain things that have different translation depending on where you look. Anyone who reads a fair amount of Xianxia is likely to be thrown off by the non-standard translations of major realms that only roughly match up, and the story is honestly little better than gibberish. Furthermore, it's more common than not for text to simply be unreadable because it runs out of the space it has allocated. Finally, the game is incredibly slowly-paced. Certain important events are completely unavailable until day 300+, which can easily equal 30-40 hours of gametime in a single save.

All in all, I heartily recommend the game. The minute annoyances of the problems with the game are very much outweighed by the gameplay itself. Whenever issues came up, I quickly tended to forget about them amidst all the other things I needed to do to keep everything running smoothly. I'm on my seventh sect now, and I still haven't run out of things to do.

My knowledge of xianxia isn't that good, I just know some of the rudimentaries and I feel like knowing a little bit more about this Chinese genre of fantasy might be helpful.
Also I turned the voice over from English to Chinese because the English VO was recorded sort of badly. This lady's hard consonants always pop because she apparently recorded without a pop filter. It's quite off-putting.

-rich in theme and concept of taoism
-the min/maxing is very satisfying
-lots of hidden features and mechanics which makes every play-through unique
-the character progression is basically unbounded so they can always be pushed into having more power
-the doggo is so cute! graphics are kind of basic but have some charm to them
Cons:
-Lots of thing that feel like they should be explained in more depth are left with very basic explanations and tutorial is incredibly underwhelming
-There are very little guides and wiki support
-combat is messy, cumbersome and its very hard to understand whats going on alot of the times or controlling how the battle flows
-some necessary features are tedious like visiting other sects and chatting in general
-the game can be relentless and punishing at time putting you in situations totally outside your control and with no options

Boy was I in for an experience with this gem. Starting with the title, its very strange for us westerners ""cultivation"", ""golden core"", ""qi"" and the list goes on. And to top it off, the vague explanations, barely no guides and limited tutorials really give this game  huge entry barrier. Also it strays alot from the typical rpg archetypes such as mages, warriors. Here the classes are ""laws"" which have elements and dictate other things in the game which adds another layer of complexity for the ones who are not used to this type of genre.
However, I think one of the aspects that made me enjoy the game was specifically its complexity and having to figure out things, although it was very frustrating at times, INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING AT TIMES. Even at this point I still don't understand at all some mechanics like the health menu.
The game has many layers of complexity, hidden mechanics and interactions. But once you keep playing you start to get a ""feel"" for whats right or what will probably not be good for you cultivator. One other thing that I enjoyed is this very thing coupled with the worldbuilding and implementation of these concepts, it made the game feel very rich in culture and theme.
The game does not hold your hand at all and has a lot of imperfections, but I think that is part of the charm, yes it couldve explained things better, but with the gaming landscape being littered with copypasta mind numbing games, im so happy to have stumbled upon this unique 20 dollar game which I have played  more than all my 60$ dollar triple AAA games combined.",1631147321,1631147321,True,2,0,0.514747858047485352,0,True,False,False

-Deep and complex game(i still dont know everything)
-Colourful visual and soundtrack
-Grindy but with its own complexity such as upgrading your guy requires the right weather,ying yang and so on
-tons of explorations and suprises
-A lot of interactions with the gameplay elements, such as turning your summer cloth into flying killing machine, buffing your pee pee for stat boost, using your own poop as fertilizer (im not joking), mini games such as talisman drawing
-Tons of crafting and alchemy
-Tons of spells and magic(lost your arm because you got mauled by a giant tiger?grow them back at the cost of a fraction of your life and 30k qi(mana) )

Cons
-The ui needs some polishing
-You cant manually place or remove item which means if your dog poops in your Wood Fengshui room, it could mess your cultivation up. I do wish that we have more control of this as disciples sometimes arent reliable to do their job.
-A LOT of Rng, this isnt necessarily a bad thing however can be irritating sometimes.
-Npc interactions and dialogue is...well how should i put it..not fun.
-Exploration requires you to move in revealed parts of the map, you cant move your guy around the fog of war, which is kinda annoying.  
-*Can be micro-intensive* such as managing cultivators mental state, managing disciples equipment, room storage capacity and so on which can be tedious. 

Conclusion: Despite its flaws, i still recommend it for everyone.In my opinion, it isnt a hardcore darksoul-like difficult game, just extremely complex.

Interesting mechanics, lots to learn, great variety, fun combat, pleasing aesthetics and animations. Highly recommend, as it makes it way into the list of one of my favourite games.

Quick Tips:
- Don't touch anything on the game setup screen (maybe change map size from medium to large for more starting resources)
- Don't start with a non-human (aka Yaoguai) in your first 'colony'
- Don't go to the very bottom left of the map in the fist few weeks
- Learn the basics of Feng Shui in the in-game help book, most important one you need first is bedrooms must have a door facing south

There is basically no part of the cultivator fantasy that this doesn't allow you to achieve. Even down to creating super geniuses that can chop through swathes of equal-tier cultivators like cabbages. 

If I had to give a criticism, it's that late game progression more or less mandates the use of Hell Gates which are an objectively evil act in a game that otherwise allows you to build your sect as either corrupt or righteous. The game won't ding you goodboy points for it, but as a player you know that your sect's ""righteous"" label is nonsense if you're using one.

I want to be honest. I hate this game.
Considering my hours I pretty much want to love it. 

This game is no joke. And the RNG can be pretty heavy. I have had bad stuff happening to me, friends which also play the game deemed to be impossible. Well, it is possible. And the most hilarious events can happen on a daily basis. More experienced players surely find their ways to worm out of situations or know exactly what they are doing at any point. I'm telling you, you won't, most of the time. This game is so complex and filled with secrets and mysteries to the brim, that the difference between someone knowing what they are doing and somebody who knows not might look like this:

(might or might not be a bit overexaggerated but close to reality):
Player that doesn't know what they are doing: Oh, day 30, everyone has shelter, food and I have a running place now.

Player that knows what they are doing: Day 30, I insta teleported into some secret place, wresled some demons, obtained secret laws I stole from places god even doesn't know and I did all this without anyone knowing it was me. I have cultivated the highest tier for my soul. The world doesn't even know I exist. But I am on the way of becoming a god.

The latter having a tremendously higher survival chance as well. You can turn down difficulty a lot, but if you play on ironman (immortal) which is also the only way to farm steam achievements for this game, the scaling of this game becomes ridiculous. 

Frustrating even. Even if you think you're be doing well, always keep in mind there is always one bigger fish than you in that ocean, that is this game. If you think having a ""king of magic"" is fancy and you think you're doing well.. think again. 

You can easily watch him being mauled to death by enchanted feces while the other attacker manages to decapitate the entire rest of your place with his flying bucket of water. Don't ask me how that works. But it does.

And all of that just happened because I didn't know stuff, secrets or how to approach things. Things to tremendously increase my survival chances the next time. Every time you die and lose your entire savegame, you learned more.

It's an abusive experience, this game beats you senseless but you'll keep coming back. 

Have I mentioned that I do hate this game?

Mostly because it really feels like it's a Chinese game with a English mod, and not a English translation.
The VA in the tutorials are fine, but my issue is with the translation... it feels awkward at some parts, and the font it's really really bad. Since the UI is made for Chinese chars, the English really doesn't fit the screen, and all the time feels like you are playing a game jam game.

The content in the game it's great, not gonna lie... and I'll keep my eye on the game if it gets an update that addresses this issue. But at the current state, I was not enjoying myself while playing, because it really felt... just off. 

Other than the translation, there are a bunch of other things that could use some patching... 
- The 2.5 models don't fit the game background at all, it feels like you are playing with weird poorly made assets from mods. 
- The information on the game is really not ""balanced"". They over explain some parts, and don't give information at all on others. The game was really smooth in this first hour, until one characters died out of nowhere, with no information on why, or the reason. And if it was in some of the menus, it was really unclear where. (And I have hundreds of hours on Colony Sims, so I was paying close attention to their health). 
- The priority system was really just a worse RimWorld/Oxygen Not Included/Any other sim implementation. It was just ""one job"" for each person, and ""do or don't"". And again, if there were settings besides that, it was really unclear. 
- There is no feedback on interacting with the UI. Not transition, animation, it almost looks like an HTML game.

The game just feels like an unpolished alpha of itself. Like they are making all the content, nonstop, using placeholder assets everywhere. And if you can ignore that, be my guest and try it out!

Basically it is Dwarf Fortress/Rimworld with a Chinese Fantasy theme and more of a focus on min/maxing your characters than survival. It's also basically a crash course on Daoist Esotericism which is incredibly interesting to learn about from a Western perspective as we are not typically exposed to it. 

The game does have a steep learning curve though, especially with the terms and themes which may be new to a player from the West. Getting through this curve is incredibly worth it though as the game is very deep and there is a ton to do and explore. There are some amazing guides online which help immensely, especially Ic0n Gaming's tutorial series on YouTube. There is also an active modding community which has some mods that are almost a prerequisite install before playing.

The game is not perfect of course; the translation is not the best, there are bugs and glitches, and a some of the game systems (especially the social system) can be frustrating or even downright confusing at first. But if you can overlook these negatives, you are presented with a unique sandbox gaming experience that is rewarding to play for hours.

Feng shui is easy to get a hold of (if you heard people complaining) but the game doesn't teach much of the game well and the English wiki is still being built. 

What is important and esoteric is Qi gathering and all that goes into making a state of being called ""Golden core"" in the game. This is basically a philosopher's stone of western fantasy but you create it in yourself. Collecting high Qi gathering items (which are rare and need to adventure or trade for) and placing them in a way that concentrates the Qi they give off into a center point is how you aid your core creation when the time comes. 

You can also do many things to pre-buff lowly ""outer disciples"" before ""promoting"" them to ""inner disciples"" (which don't need to eat anymore but do it for fun). These inner disciples can learn skills that buff stats or lets you do things like change the weather. 

One thing I would like them to improve is the adventuring could be more randomized. There are quite a few set locations you can go to (few when starting, you have to adventure multiple times to discover the rest). A lot of the randomness comes through set events that can happen and discovering skills through them. 

Very fun game, reasonably priced, enjoyable emergent story from the peons you make and grow. Definitely could be better though.  I honestly think it's an incredible improvement on similar games out, not a copy of them.

You will probably be overwhelmed when you start this game. There are so many layers of interacting systems and deep mechanics, and to make things more confusing the English translation is a bit weird and not terribly easy to follow. Your followers will probably end up horribly injured by wildlife, or die of exposure, or even heatstroke because mining igneocopper places them in scorching hot environments. And as far as overall plot goes you will probably have next to no idea what's actually going on.

I encourage you to stick with it though, because it is staggeringly fun once you get the hang of the basics.

In essence, it's a lot like Rimworld, only instead of building a colony on some strange alien planet, you're building a monastery where people can attempt to ascend to godhood by studying supernatural martial arts and philosophies. It is extremely like a Wuxia film, full of esoteric Laws of Heaven, people flying around on magical jade swords, and achieving enlightenment through meditation, mighty adventures, and sometimes practicing calligraphy.

There are other important differences from Rimworld, as if the setting weren't already enough. For one thing, there's a strict hierarchy to any sect you create. Everyone starts as a beginner, and trains in ""Foundation"" martial arts until they're ready to become Inner Disciples and learn one of the many Laws which will define their path to immortality. when you promote an outer disciple to an Inner, they stop doing manual labour altogether, so be sure you have a backup peasant to cook meals, haul materials, and craft basic tools or your sect will collapse for lack of workers! On the other hand, an Inner Disciple becomes an extremely powerful individual; they no longer need to eat, living off Qi, they can create and wield powerful artifacts which act as autonomous weapons, and they can learn a multitude of miraculous magical powers such as healing spells, changing the weather, and more. 

Each stage of advancement in an inner disciple's training involves reaching a limit and attempting to ""breakthrough"". This can be as simple as spending a day or two in meditation, or it can require a grueling battle against Heavenly manifestations of power like a thunderstorm. Failure can cause injuries or kill the disciple outright, so preparation is vital; They should be in a good mood, have a calm and composed mental state, and the local surroundings should be rich in Qi and a particular element, such as a room made out of fiery or icy materials (which brings in its own issues of heat management). If they pass the test, however, their power increases greatly, their pool of Qi grows, they get access to new abilities, and their life expectancy grows by several decades. An inner disciple can easily one-shot a grizzly bear that might cause an outer disciple to suffer multiple permanent injuries.

There are several playable ""races"", too. The Yaoguai are half human, half animal, and they all have their own unique abilities and disadvantages. Wolf Yaoguai are excellent fighters, for example, while cat Yaoguai get bonuses to fine crafts like tailoring or making talismans but don't like doing crude labour. They all have one disadvantage in common, which is that at some point they must face a Heavenly Tribulation which will either make them fully human, or devolve them back into the beasts they resemble. And unless you know what you're doing from the start, your first generation of Yaoguai will probably fail, turn into powerful demon animals, and slaughter your other disciples.

What else? Well, there are Spirit Pets: Sometimes, at random, or after a specific adventure, you might find an animal you can adopt as a pet. These animals are *incredibly* powerful, and will probably be your damage tanks during your sect's early days. They must be trained, though. Every now and then they will pick an action which you can encourage or discourage. Are they allowed to eat spoiled meals? Should they occasionally bite disciples or defecate on someone's bed? Do they search dead enemies for items? You can tailor your pet's behaviour quite well using this system, and when they become an adolescent, you can tailor their combat style by selecting a particular diet: Eating fruit might be good for intelligence, where cultivating their Inner Core is best done on a diet of tubers, and so on.

But there's more! Every now and then some wild animal will attain a sliver of understanding, and you can fan this into full blown intelligence with a memory game where you collect the shards of experiences the animal has and distill them into full-blown memories and thoughts. And then, when you're ready, they transform into a Yaoguai!

I could go on and on because even this is only scratching the surface of the game's interacting systems. Each of the Laws you can learn have very unique ability sets. There's the physical cultivation Laws where you train your flesh, muscles, bones and organs to become an absolutely terrifying combat machine, which even lets you regrow lost body parts. There's the map of the known world, full of adventuring sites, villages and cities where you can set up temples to recruit, gather resources and experience, and affect the greater world as little adventures in those locations prompt a policy response from you. There are all the rival cultivation sects, good and evil, that also adventure throughout the world (and which will claim artifacts and treasures if you don't get there first!). There's the complex Feng Shui system where building rooms and work stations in a certain way awards bonuses to productivity. And there's a whole modding community working on countless additions to the game, never mind the devs themselves planning DLC and sequels.

Rimworld is a lot easier to get into, and very much has its own scifi/western style and gameplay, and it's a great game, there's no denying that. But Amazing Cultivation Simulator adds some very niche elements, and goes far, FAR deeper into those, and has an absolutely gorgeous Mythical China Wuxia aesthetic, and in the end they are both incredibly different games with a similar premise on the surface.

The game is fun to explore in a sort of laid-back, casual way. There doesn't seem to be any pressure to reach a certain goal in a set timeframe to avoid being wiped out. That's nice when you have no idea what you're doing :D

I also like the chinese taoist setting. It gives the game a very ""crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" vibe.

One downside is though the constant clicking you must do just to do even basic things like crafting. It's not as streamlined as Rimworld. The shortcuts are poorly configured (changes the button for the same action for different items) and aren't changeable. This makes it a clickfiesta which can cause carpal tunnel syndrome and I'm not kidding.

Hey hey, People.

Yeah. Worked with a few other games that I got MASSIVELY into so I figured why not, right?

I have spent... Four hours on this game so far. QoL Mods? Uh. Yes. And did some digging on guides and played the uh... whatever in the world kind of tutorial that was. Overall... I feel that there is some big depth in this game and fun to be had. It is and is not like Rimworld. It is and it is not like Dwarf Fortress.

It's... Bringing order to chaos through the use of qi and Daoist principles executed in such a fashion that it will probably leave you scratching your head to figure out what in the hell is really going on here.

When you load the game up, you are FORCED to play the tutorial before going forward. Which is yeah-okay-fine. Except it's not fine. It will leave you going, ""... Wh-what. Okay you showed some simple bare bones basics but what th-"" And then you get into the actual game proper.

Which. Doesn't give you much to go with. You start with your 'hero' and two disciples if you go with the more or less 'default options'. And... Some resources on a map with a Fog of War and.... Some guy who will watch over you for two weeks but not tell you do much. Short of build a fire.

Thankfully, there's guides out there. On every topic you could want but none of them to me particular stick out because they seem to jump all over the place with regards to the content. Because the content jumps around. Systems in this game are crazy inter-connected. There's no avoiding it.

So if you're someone who likes to really dig into the five aspects of Qi and why rooms need proper feng shui so your disciples don't die when they sleep in them (because oh yes, they will die if the room is 'ominous') (EDITORS NOTE: OH! ONE THING! YEAH! You may have noticed in Sseth's video the little feng shui icon? Build the meter. It's a big flat disk looking thing. I'd go back into the game and look at it, but once you establish your sect? Yeah you want that).

The music however is absolutely fantastic, and the art style and UI takes a little getting used to, but after a while you hardly pay it much attention as you're too busy wondering why someone is flying around your village, checking things out. Or why there's that one crazy strong monster on your map killing your disciples and not taking any damage.

I.... I mean I want to recommend this game. I honestly want to like it. I feel there's some real potential here...

... But the tutorial needs a serious root canal to cover more than just ""Here's you mine and build stuff"". It needs to cover some of the core concepts. And while there are popups and the codex, they still don't cover everything. Though the ability for other players to make comments in the game which you can read from most windows is.... Something of a help.

Overall, so far... Yeah. I mean. I'll keep working on this game. Trying to enjoy it. But so far, it won't really impact the 3200+ hours I have in Rimworld as of this review.",1627677019,1627677019,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,3,True,False,False

There is little ability to point and say go do that there. Instead assign a group of tasks that are available.

This is going to be confusing to players that only played it for the first 2 or so hours. The beginning of the game is almost like a palette swap clone of RimWorld and naturally, everyone tries to play it like one. Then these people get really confused after they actually start the real part of the game (when you start to get inner disciple) and wonder why nothing you've learned from RimWorld works here.

RimWorld is a survival builder, focused on surviving the next escalating raid or harsh random event. This is a grinding, character raising, RPG builder. The focus on the game is to grind the strongest character that you can and collect the best items that character can gather, ""ascend"" then raise a even more powerful next generation. Eventually, you use those characters to defeat the powerful bosses, defeat other sects, and conquer the world. 99% of the game's mechanic takes place after you move away from the RimWorld aspect of the game. So if you are wondering why your inner disciples can't do manual task, that's because you shouldn't focusing on that at all (just leave a few ""workers"" permenantly as outer).

Now that said, the mechanics in this game is so complex and so random that you will need multiple 100 page guides to fully understand and optimize. It is debatable on rather these are actually good mechanic at all, but even without over optimizing, there is enough unique mechanic that it literally took me 100 hours just to understand the game (let alone optimize for it).

Your sect/school is focused on churning out magical cultivators (separated by ranks) whom will ascend to the heaven or die trying. The initial stages are similar to Rimworld but the magical portion and combat are way different.

The core mechanic after the initial stages is basically building a place to facilitate the cultivation/training of your cultivators. In the middle stages you will reach the Golden Orb (i forgot what the translation they used) where your character will gather qi from nearby area to form a Golden Orb. The more qi there are in the area, along with compatible Feng Shui, the better the chance of getting a better grade Golden Orb (1-10 with 1 being the best). This will largely impact the max qi of the character along with some other stats. Then you will progress eventually to Demi god and and face heavenly tribulations (aka thunder will rain from the sky and strike you down) before ascension if not earlier; and the max qi of your character will play a huge role in determining success or failure.

While all of this sounds nice, it takes quite a long long time. There are many memes out there for the length it takes to ascend in this game (prolly 100+ hrs if not more on first playthrough). Some Law or paths take longer than others to reach certain stage and/or ascend, and each have its own strength and weaknesses (utility, combat, abilities, etc.). Ascending your characters is not the end, as you are playing the sect and not a single character.

The main gameplay loop is wait for time to go by while your character are cultivating; send some people out one in a while to plunder.. err i mean gather treasures. Learn various new laws, and some drastically different way of cultivating. Build up your sect into a power house with multiple demi god. Then challenge tough creatures and/or npc sect (they are very very scary).

I found something called a Spirit Seed, it says ""Increases your max Qi"" got my sect leader eat one and it just straight up killed them...  Why is the game like this, it doesn't make any sense!

The UI is all over the place and there's no tutorial that actually explains more than 4 buttons, although this didn't bother me much it was rather annoying to find that I've gone and built everything out of iron instead of wood because the UI didn't highlight that selecting materials was an option and it just defaults to iron.

It's hard to see the impact of most of what you've ordered, what your goal should even be. Okay, I made a building they can sleep in, and they'll be happier. Now I've made a farm so they can eat. Now what. To what end are you doing anything else, where's the next problem. The cycle that makes this genre good is the one of constantly having more things that need doing, take a game like Factorio and that constant need to get something done which cascades into more tasks.

You need to actually order everything manually. There's no kind of auto manager, no way to say hey make this if you need it for something, it's very micro heavy in a game genre that should be very macro. The ridiculously tiny population further promotes micro and slow game play.

I didn't play much since I'd already had enough of it within a short time, so my feedback is limited. But I don't see the point in continuing as I'm not getting anything out of it.

VERY difficult to get started with, but the game allows so much modding via in game and offers a variety of maps that replayability is amazing. Started multiple games and get screwed by the game while trying to figure it out. Made some (very) OP characters, items, and potions to increase the rate of cultivation. Looking forward to figuring out the endgame components. Have I mentioned that as of this Review I have still not beat the game.

Story is a bit weak, but at least there is no handholding. Sink or swim, just like the real cultivation world mangas. 
10/10 - I have a baby flood dragon growing nicely and a maxed out dog demon.

Suggestion for beginners 
- create mod items to help deal with the cold and hot weather (clothing)
- create blueprints for rooms. Outer disciples can share a room, Inner disciples need their own room. Blueprints are a pain at first to figure out the drag and copy feature from the main craft menu, but once you do, it makes building things much quicker - maybe more for advanced players
- create at least one OP character (i named mine Elon Musk lol)
- create a potion that speeds up cultivation and max Qi
- do not max out your cultivation with a character until you know you will not need him/her to defend sect or to fight tough oponents
- get the formation feature as quickly as it is available by finding the dead body of your Tayin sect elder and searching his corpse (cant fight ancient cultivators or flood dragon without this)
- choose the wetlands with that sweet spirit soil and send your inner disciples with high perception all over the map to discover secret locations (must do multiple times and multiple places will be revealed) so that you can farm minerals from these locations like igniscopper
- carve out a mineral vain veins and build a treasure house away from your sect so that it is safer. natural rocks cannot be attacked by inner disciples to my knowledge. put some walls inside and a door. keep your most precious items here as the flood dragon will attack your main buildings but wont go after remote locations
- build a room with a stove, a well, and an area that can just hold food and water. make this away from your main buildings and put a bell inside of it. this is where outer disciples will be sent once the sect is under attack from the flood dragon or others.
- click the three dots on items. the community is pretty nice to share their discoveries about items and how to take advantage of them.

Feng Shui
- an earth room and doors. A Steel Bed, earth furniture around the bed.
- a wood room and doors. A Fire Bed, wood furniture around the bed
-Room doors to the south
- a workshop door to the East
- a room with a stove and tables for your disciples. Click the auto feature allowing them to make their own food. Feng shui is as explained for rooms above and the door is to the West

Mythical seeds and trees
-create a room that feeds the nature of the plant, so an earth room for the metal tree, a fire room for the earth tree, and a wood room for the fire tree, etc. use displays and put the items on top of them. people can move around the displays. Pay attention to the room temperature requirements as they may need to be altered between summer and winter. Some trees are more prone to be cursed like the fire tree than others like the steel tree.
- Plant in spirit soil, but you may be able to raise them at a slower rate in fertilized soil, not really sure
- build rooms around to contain temperature.

Heck even the negative reviews have like 600+ hours played, should tell you something. 

In this game, you are given characters that will 'power' up and get stronger over time. You can think of it like dragon ball z where they have power levels. The goal of the game is for you to build a base and over time slowly raise very weak mortal humans into powerful demi-gods capable of splitting mountains and chopping the seas in half. 

Without getting too much into Chinese Lore. This is where you get the 'cultivation' part of the game title from. Instead of cultivating / growing plants or trees. You are cultivating people and making them into truly powerful god-like entities in the world, each with their own unique set of skills, spells,  weapons, and equipment. 

In the start of the game, you will have very little knowledge on how to do this. Like how plants need water, sunlight, and good soil. There are a myriad of factors that will create the 'perfect' human. And most people will miss all the subtle hints, clues, and trial and error to get just them all right in their first couple of playthroughs.

To illustrate how indepth the system is.  Many player-written guides for a single aspect of the game can be over 100 pages. 

There is pretty much more depth in this single game, than practically 99% of all game out there in the market. It will take weeks or months for the average person to get 'good' enough to where they feel comfortable with all the mechanics. 

And this is where a lot of the complaints tend to be focused on. Some people may find it a total waste of time, or that some mechanics are frustrating. But if you are having fun, it's pretty much like any game out there. 

No, you do not need to code, or install a million mods, or read all the guides. You can enjoy the game just fine without them. 

The big problem is that this game can be so addicting as you are slowly and patiently raising your people that it can drive ppl crazy. And what you are hearing are the ppl who got so addicted they went off the deep end and jumped off a cliff of insanity. 

But, like all good communities, there are several mods that pretty much bypasses anything people may find annoying or just add more flavor stuff for fun. Just like Rimworld. At the end of the day, how much you enjoy the game, will just be up to whether or not you like really open-ended sandboxes and complicated mechanics.

Being able to become god, tame monsters, and learn chinese mythology and lore are just a plus.

Someone who has played this game for too long.",1623269245,1623271101,True,121,5,0.918388068675994873,5,True,False,False

Enjoyed it so much that just about all the time that I've spent on the game was just on the one ironman save (after a few games to learn how mechanics work and so on). I've even liked this game well enough to join it's discord. And in there I've seen a number of people comparing this game to Rimworld. 

And it does have some similarities: the top down view, characters coming to join your settlement (sect) randomly, getting attacked by rando's with some regularity. I haven't played Rimworld myself, but the core game loop seems quite similar. 

But there's some important differences. Instead of organ harvesting people's extra kidneys and selling them on the market, you could have them learn a particular cultivation method, in which case their 'treasure' falls off. You can then sell that, for a few hundred spirit stones even. But you could also, say, enchant it into a magical artifact for one of your combatants to use to defeat attackers (be they people, demon beasts or what have you). You could also use particular miracles to turn that treasure into a sentient item, then another one to turn that item into a new person (who, if you manipulate their stats the right way, could turn out to be one of your most powerful cultivators). Then you could have them cultivate the same method, go through reincarnation, and repeat that a few times to get a collection of 7 of their treasures to arm them with as weapons. But, you know, no kidney market. 

This is a game where you can raise your little people into gods (literally ascending them to the heavens and leaving a shine behind that can be used to buff the people left behind). This is a game where you can make someone who punches so hard anything they fight dies near instantly. This is a game where you can keep your head low and create a sweat shop that makes money by splitting money into bricks and then using those bricks to manufacture weapons that sell for a wide profit margin, then buy your way into having various rare materials without having to get them the hard way (adventuring, or what have you). This is a game where you can pick a fight with a dragon and watch in horror as all the water on your map buffs the water dragon and all your people swiftly perish to it's wrath. 

TLDR: If you don't know what cultivation is, you can certainly find out by playing this game. But you could also come swing by the official discord and ask questions there. It's a good community, and a well priced little game.",1623051585,1623051585,True,7,0,0.592910051345825195,1,True,False,False

It's amazinging in-depth and thoughtful in how it takes such a complex and diverse fantasy genre and turns these into mechanics. It's actually more so than many novels, which tend to be simplified. 

While playing, you can have all sorts of interesting things happen, such as suddenly the wheat you were growing attains sentience/enlightenment! This happened to me and then my outer disciples accidentally reaped it... RIP

Random events happen, such as a Fei appearing in the sect land, causing rain and illness which doesn't go away until you slay the beast. Upon doing so you get to take the rare beast blood and Fei hide! 

I think that some things can be a bit complicated for people who are not familiar with the Cultivation genre, but not so much so that you can't even play. You can muddle through pretty well without your entire sect being on the constant verge of being wiped out. Just, guides can be helpful so you don't reach stuck points later on. 

One of my absolute favorite features is the mystery investigation. There is this awesome social screen where you can talk to people and find out their likes/dislikes and any secrets they know! I love being able to build up relationships with random NPCs, bribe them, etc. They have different personality types so they aren't all going to react well to the same thing. (Ex. upright people will hate you if you try to bribe them, but greedy people will spill everything they know.)

I also really like the cute art for the Achievements, it's funny and quite enjoyable. 

Overall, I highly recommend the game, especially to either fans of Cultivation novels or people who like in-depth simulators like Dwarf Fortress. This is similar to Dwarf Fortress, but as a bonus you can actually enter specific areas with direct control of your inner disciples in order to talk to people and take more direct action, so it's less monotonous.",1621113177,1621113177,True,30,1,0.635644853115081787,0,True,False,False

This isn't meant for people who's looking to casually play stuff (You can do that but you won't even need to wait for the first few minutes before you come across something that you don't know)

I've looked at some few stuffs here and there and all I can say is that there's a great lack of easy community tips in google, but there's some people doing youtube videos for tips and tricks, and there's also the discord.

Don't worry about not knowing some stuff as the Game itself has tons of tutorials both voiced and to read at the same time but all I can say is that it's a lot (crazy lot)

Progress is pretty slow in this game (I don't know how it might look like compared to other games since this is pretty much the first time I've played a Genre like this) 40 Hours in and I've barely covered anything important, and this is with stuffs that I've configured myself (Cheaty as hell) There's a Creation System where you can create your own Items / Reincarnators  (Custom Named) and stuff in game and you can also upload from other people so you can create pretty much anything you want with custom stats too (Limited option if you're not doing it the modders way)

Anyways, If you're planning to play this game then be ready to spend your time, not just to play but to read out on stuffs as there's a lot of mechanics that you'll probably have to figure out (Like certain items increasing/decreasing temperature and etc.) You're basically studying as you're playing at the same time, some people might think they'll know how to play just cause they read Novels with the aspect of the Chinese Culture, that may be true to some extent but it will only help you to understand it a bit easier than normal instead of what you might think.",1620750533,1620750533,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You basically cultivate your pawns through physical training and later meditating from outer disciples to inner discplices, which then have to cultivate themselves to reach godhood and become immortal.

Some, in the process of reaching immortality will lose their infamous genitals, but, oh well... Don't worry, once your pawn cultivated himself enough, he can regrew his lost, most precious part.

Gaining cultivativation ist most easily achieved by traveling to your agencies on the map, where you can also adventure to places and meet other sects. Befriend them, fight, trade, help or just ignore them.

The starting system is similar to Kenshi in how desperate you want the situation to be. The goal of the game is to ultimately play in what is the Iron Man mode where decisions you make are final when made. You train your sect, send the members out on missions you can even explore using any one of them yourself. Eventually you invade other sects and become the king of them all. Or not and get obliterated by random elderly people that keep harassing your sect.

Graphics: Middling, there isn't anything special happening here - you are looking at something close to what we would have seen in 2006 maybe in some cases earlier. It's kind of like having someone buy you a new toaster versus a toaster put together  with ad-hoc pieces: at the end of the day they both still toast. To be fair the lighting effects are well utilized, but I mean this is stuff we've seen again since 2002-ish.

Art Style: Very good, I enjoyed it and it did this very well - you get a lot of pleasing things to look at that really pulled me in to the world of mystical cultivation. The art work is consistently good and mostly energetic.

Music: Your typical fare from the orient, it definitely isn't bad but if you've heard the chord progression once you've heard it a thousand times before.

Gameplay: This is hard... it isn't that the game play is bad... just that this game is about 4 different games in one. I'm going to hold towards its benefit that it surprised me with how many and how well thought out each style of gameplay was. But I will hold against it how damn complex and counter intuitive some of them were. First off the primary mode of play is the easiest it is going to get, if you can understand what you are doing here then you are golden. It might take a play through to learn how you're supposed to grow your sect so your members are strong but once you understand the book mechanic you are good. However Shendao is like Chess to the rest of the games play styles Rock-Paper-Scissors. After 300 hours I still don't know if Shendao is worth the effort, it's like death by shnoo-shnoo.

This game is definitely worth a look at if you are curious about this world of cultivation, if you just like management games as well, and if you already know about Xianxia style games then know this stops a few stages before Apotheosis with Shendao being kind of what Apotheosis is but in a weird way.

Give it a go, you can't go wrong and if it's on sale definitely grab it.

For those who play Rimworld, this will feel like a poor man's unfinished copy of an attempt at recreating Rimworld that got stalled halfway through, but the Chinese fantasy themes will hopefully be enough to distract you from sheer lack of any quality of life mechanics in the game. All and all, this is a good game if you like xianxia, and alright if you like Rimworld.

You will also learn about chinese culture along the way.


-You will spend your first few hours inside the game. But as the game progresses you will spend more and more time outside of it. You will start to read guides, then you will ask questions on discord because the guides are mostly wrong, misleading and misunderstood. Then you will ask more questions on discord. Then you will start to look up data in the game files, because its the only reliably way to get on information. Then you make a friend who knows somebody who reverse engineered the game. You start to talk about the game in ""Whats the formula for X ?"". Then you scratch your head because even with the data files available and decompiled code you still cant figure out how the game works. As an advanced player you will be able to formulate sentences like this ""Dont push your qi gathering over 2500 or else you will create a qi void.""

-You will sit down and start to make elaborated plans for character development. Collect data, compare and make informed decision. On a medium level this will take you hundreds of hours.

- Fights are disappointing mostly, and we still dont know how they work exactly. Dont worry, another 400 hours and i will be able to make a guide, so you can read about it.

- Bossfights are even more dissapointing.
You cant follow the fight visually, your choice is literally to watch a health bar window, or get epilepsy.
Throughout the fight you will sweat blood and tears to not kill them too early.
Bosses have zero consistent damage, 99% of the time they do nothing, but look away for a second and they will insta kill most things outside of a formation.
They randomely destroy your sect. Which actually has nothing to do with the fight, they just do it for shits and giggles. They will die anyway, but at least they hassled you as much as possible.

- This application has no goals, it is the most sandbox application you will ever play. Its not a sandbox game like Terraria, Factorio or Satisfactory. There are literally no goals in there. At least in the other games you get actual goals you want to achieve, or something that you want to get access to. Not in this application. The first hours you spend on this application won´t be less meaningful than the last hours you spend on this game. It all depends on how you set your own goals. If you want to spend a 5 hours marathon on this and feel like you achieved nothing, you can do it here.

- To enjoy this application you will need mods, and lots of them. Just like unity needs plugins to do special work, you will need mods for this. The most popular mod is the one that lets you cheat in anything and everything into the game, and change anything into anything. Then you want to get more tiles grid info, because thats actually information which might help you. Elysium for easier management. And, and, and .. .

- This application is the kind of application which ships with 3 very good songs, and then plays them over and over again. Thats not a joke. You might want to get a mod for taht too.

- Translation. Its not bad, and mostly done, but ... the game uses the same words for different things, and different words for the same thing, and so ultimately, you will have to turn to datat sheets and decompiled code again to get an understanding of how things work.

So what do you actually get out of it ?
- You will be able to write your masters thesis on Feng Shui after a hundred hours, because you literally cant take 2 steps without knowing about it. If anybody needs to learn about Feng Shui in an anjoyable manner, this is the experience.
- Animal People
- 501 chinese medical ingredients
- chinese mythology
- you will learn to decompile a game, because you cant get to know it otherwise
- 1001 game mechanics. Most of your time you will spend on figuring out how the game works. In fact, thats how you count how far you are in the game, in the amount of mechanics you know about.
- 3 very good songs

So ... I just wish this application had goals you feel satisfaction over achieving them, fights to look forward to and a story to unravel. Oh yes, there is a story, but in reality there is none.

If this application keeps you interested for 600 hours i guess it deserves a thumbs up.",1615987235,1616531145,True,497,314,0.93647003173828125,16,True,False,False

The game doesn't really feel like it's built for exploring those secrets. The interface for some game-critical concepts, like the Feng Shui system, isn't very well suited for playing around with it. When it comes to developing characters with spells and all, things get very micromanagement-y very quickly, and it pulls focus away from developing these elite few mega-cool characters and exploring their abilities, and pushes it onto stat grinding and searching for just the abilities that let you grind in a particular way.

I feel like this game could be a lot better than it is, but if you're into Chinese fantasy or Xianxia novels, it's probably worth playing. If you're not? You might have a better time with other complex games.

Am I going to keep playing? Yeah. But, that's with a lot of frustrations around the way the game is put together.

This game is about pursuing immortality, and due to the way time works, you'd be lucky to get through 1 year of your immortal's several-century lifespan in a day's full play. That's disappointing, and makes me feel like the game wasn't really designed with its subject-matter in mind.

First thing: This is not Rimworld! This is Rimworld! This is not Rimworld! 
The first one hour feels like Rimworld but once you have your first inner disciple the game changes drastically (in about 2 hours if you want good stats for your first inner disciple. Use your first bottle of 'forming pills' properly. Nudge.).  Your inner disciple is the key to becoming super strong sect and you have to use them as 'collector' for different material, fighter against different attackers and heros for different quests. (Yes there are RPG style quest inside and you have to make people happy or fight them in order to proceed through).
 
Unlike Rimworld where it is all about sci-fri survival, this game is about mystical training and stats build. The way to build different things is very different from Rimworld. There is no fridge to build but you build a fridge room by building a room using water element material and put a water element holy relic in the middle (you start with a water element room but it is not cold enough). Where do you get that holy relic? Quest
 
The learning curve is steep as hell. I know Chinese Culture like back and forth but I have read through thousands of forums to understand WTF is going on. There are FuShun problem from the start and you have to balance your building material with temperature. How to make your little guy have a high temperature tolerance? Get a Fulu or talisman to improve temperature tolerance.

You can cultivate your animal turns human cultivator which is kind of interesting. After 160 hours in this game, I have not explore this part yet! Neither have I finish the RPG part.... This game is deep... I recommend this game but you need to put some effort into it. Otherwise this game is not for you. 

I hope to write some tutorial in English for this game so that more people can enjoy this :) Anyone knows where to do it?

The ""Easy"" Mode is hard enough for most players (including me but I'm just insane). It is an unforgiving game and you'll make a lot - a lot of mistakes and many of your beloved cultivators will die or ... other things may happen to them.

Soo let's begin why this is a good game.

First of all it has very diverse game mechanics - nearly every school plays differently e.g. there is the school of reincarnation where you will be weak for the most part of the game but when you become powerful then you're really strongbut then you`ll lose that power again because - reincarnation. Yet there is also the ""recommended"" school (forgot it's name - was something like six suns) which will allow for a much more steady grow giving you a good protector from the beginning (and you will need a good protector). It's really up to you how you want to start your game - you will eventually obtain more ""laws"" (schools). (there are a lot of schools you can choose from - some of them are more unique than others and all of them have their own requirements).
Secondly there the so called Yaoguai - animals that were infused with so much Qi (""Mana"" if you want to compare it with other games) that they become ""more sentient"" about their enviornment and maybe even become cultivators themself - strong ones. Yet they also have a trick - so be carefull ;) (Do NOT pick them on your first school). Next to the Yaoguai you can also have - and now fasten your seatbelt - living objects. Isn't that fun ? Maybe - except when your wall decides to become sentient and run away .. or your ""rod"" (yep things like these also exist).
So where do I continue - well there is an entire world out there - you can be good or evil  (or neither) and become allies with other schools (much recommended becauses those schools are pretty damn hardcore hard to deal with and they`ll eventually attack you). You can also fight those school and ""conquer"" them (I did it with a nasty little ""insect"" sect that attacked me on a daily bases just because I somehow accidentally killed their sage during a field trip).

Anyway - you can do a lot of cool stuff - build your school, tempel, [...](whatever you wanna call it mine is the DaiLi - Yep THE DAILI), kill a dragon or two, turn immortal - normal stuff. Yet most importantly -steal artifacts (like for real - steal them - they are strong af).",1606600729,1613750267,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cultivation can be defined as ""the process of trying to acquire or develop a quality or skill."" To which we can further define in the context of the game as [cultivating] our body and spirit towards godhood. Essentially we are in a martial arts and cultivation themed world ordering around NPCS that have the focal commonality and driving force to cultivate into godhood and presumably immortality by any means necessary (yes we can be benevolent or evil). 

I do not presume to hold the entirety of the game's knowledge and all of its systems, and I actually found the best source of knowledge in this game comes from their discord group (linked on the steam page) and the comments people can leave on each of the games items. 

On surface level people may see it as an easier survival mode Rimworld clone, but this is only on the surface, beneath this lies systems about elemental balance, pet evolution, animal sentience, natural disaster management, outpost management, politics with our sects, a relationship simulator between NPC's and some light-hearted PVP, the development of your characters revolves around a law you pick to cultivate your character after your character has developed their body (foundation) enough to be able to handle further development, some examples of cultivation laws are laws that focus on the mind (a city builder in your characters head, including population control gimmicks), body building (bone structure, muscle and organ development) and the development of your core to be able to ascend your spirit. Each law also has different spells or skills that help with battle, colony management and character stats. To be able to successfully develop a law, one should opt for a law that has a good affinity with the character's stats and be aware of the games systems such as the elemental affinity and Feng Shui that will help aid cultivators in their pursuit of godhood.

Overall I went in for the similarity it had to Rimworld but discovered an even greater game (my opinion), that seems to be polished quite well and I urge newcomers to not get disheartened by the seemingly big learning curve and depth because the game can be easy, and it rewards you with new discoveries the further you go into it. 

Achievements are enabled by immortal mode, cheats are not needed since there is an in-game item and character editor on the main menu and if you discover anything or need any help do not forget to share it with other people in the group discord (but please be patient).

1. 反人类的UI和判定，怪物那么大的模型就一个格子判定，一群人冲过来还要攻击一个一个去点，这游戏打的我右手的都有腱鞘炎的感觉了，因为这段时间我根本就没玩其他的游戏.
2. 官方教你玩游戏系列，把人类砍成这样就是逼着去选妖族，但妖族就3个种族有点用，其他几个种族完全都是废物.如果是九劫档, 动物还要从灵智开始培养起.
3. 过于操蛋的金融系统，赚钱实在太难. 逼着人一开始就想法子去烧晕各个门派的大佬然后扒衣服. 想勤勤恳恳的赚钱那是做梦.
4. 建筑操作的恶心，置物架的操作我就不吐槽了，同样的物品放置物架还要一个一个点，都2021年还有如此智障的操作. 各种技能的释放也是好笑, 既然屏幕中间有人物UI为啥不能直接技能点上去然后释放?
5. 各种事件的触发条件很不清楚，每次打游戏还要去翻一大堆大佬的攻略资料，游戏里的F10说明也鸡肋，不是所有人打游戏都会先跑去看大佬10几个小时的攻略视频的.
6. 调控温度能不能智能点，为了种地每块地还要去整这些东西
7. 门派里的小人选了执行命令还经查会发呆, 而且风水的判定经常很迷惑, 特别是一些镇物.
8. 优化没做好，游戏玩到100天以后就开始卡顿了，打2077都没觉得会这么卡
9. 开局逼着你去其他门派偷东西，结果还偷偷和谐了几个能偷东西门派，典型的暴雪做派。降低难度的BUG和谐的飞快，游戏体验的优化从来不干.  NPC的警戒范围也不弄个提示. 小人被打死了就要关游戏重开.
10. 从门派买东西还要什么狗屁人情, 为了人情还要用邪道去杀掌门, 随便一个物品就敢要10点, 高级道具获取太困难除非用邪道方法.
11. 九劫难度炼丹固定概率失败? 想提高难度需要这种方法吗? 
12. 搬运尸体能不能出个系统解决下, 用了MOD还是一样的蛋碎, 做一个平均分配尸体肥田的功能很难吗?
13. 小人出去驻扎, 到了地点也没任何提示, 还要不停的按M地图去看.
14. 智障般的攻击AI, 我明明每个入侵的NPC都点了攻击, 还是有时候会漏掉然后外门小人就经常被入寝的NPC给打死了.

At first glance people are going to think to themselves, ""oh, it's 2d, I have many characters, they build buildings....it must be like Rim World or Dwarf Fortress."" No it's not.

This is a stat collecting game. It is not a strategy game, in my opinion. You will not be fighting tactical combats or laying traps and predicting your enemies routes. You won't be choosing between tons of viable options to reach a short term goal. What you will be doing is watching movies on your other monitor waiting for X numbers of things to be built, X number of adventures (your guy going from point A to B and reporting a reward), or X number of something else to accumulate. It is very much like an Asian phone game in that they assume you have an endless amount of real life to burn.

Sure there are several laws to choose from to start, but there really are only two that a ""so much better"" than the rest to start with that you are just hurting yourself, by not repeating the most obvious and optimal route.

Many will think this game is very difficult. However, its not difficult strategically. It's one of those games that is only difficult, because you will have no clue how most of the mechanics work, what particular items do, or what paths to pursue. I have a feeling that once you memorize all of that, the game would become quickly boring.

That said, I am having an OK time with it, between my other games. I am strangely drawn to the challenge of figuring out, ""HTF does this game work?"" I do feel some sense of achievement, once I figure out, ""Oh you do this to get that."" There are a lot of mechanics in the game, a lot of items, and a good number of stats.

So what will you be doing in this game?

Well, you'll be ""cultivating"" your characters, of course. You build a handful of buildings while minding rules about which side the doors go on, and what materials have to be used to appease rules about elements. You'll build the exact same buildings the exact same way almost every game, so its not like other civ building games. Yes, you'll be smithing swords and tailoring shirts. You will not be creating armies or fighting off hordes.

Combat, at least in the first 100 hours, is going to consist of one of your guys running up to some other guy, standing there, and watching their qi bar or hp bar go down while the game compares stats. You don't even move much, unless you just want to flee and have someone else tank hits. It's literally just going to sit there and compare numbers for 5-10 minutes. Later on you get formations and spells supposedly, but even then, I don't think there is much to the combat at all.

You'll be clicking through mind numbing dialogs in a ""mini game"" where all you do is click the LMB to chat until the person likes you enough to give you useful information. I don't even look at the screen while clicking....It's painful.

You'll be trying to figure out how to get various items that raise stats. You'll be trying to figure out what stats effect what actions. You'll quickly find out things like ""Oh, people are completely useless without the luck stat, because evidently, it controls whether you get a reward on most adventures"" or , ""Oh, I need to eat these pills to raise my max qi, and max qi determines most of my strength""

You'll should really expect to completely fail and get no where unless you consult some guides or get on a discord. Do keep in mind though, that a lot of the enjoyment from this game comes from figuring out how to play.

The game does not spawn new maps aside from the tiny zone you build in. The events, NPC characters, quests, etc. are all the same every play. So, I don't know how much replay there will be. You can go down different paths to enlightenment, I suppose. It's super slow paced, so I don't know if I will want to replay before something else comes out that takes my attention. We'll have to see.

All in all, it's not horrible, but it isn't something I'll be talking about 3 years from now.
They could make it much better with bigger maps, procedural generation of other sects and their maps, characters, etc. It really could use a more involved and exciting combat system. I generally just need more to keep my attention while playing, so I don't find myself watching movies on the second monitor.

As of this review I've played for almost 100 hours, and I feel like I could whittle away a few hundred more before being finished. I'll probably never finish it— but I've played it [i]enough[/i]. I've ascended cultivators to immortality, I've struggled with Immortal Mode, and even tussled with the Flood Dragon.

The problem is how those 100 hours are spent. The majority of your time playing this game will be micromanagement. You'll move from micromanaging your outer disciples to micromanaging your inner ones, then micromanaging your outposts, then micromanaging your relationships with other sects, and so on and so on. When you don't micromanage, you wait. Wait for the next cultivation breakthrough, wait for the buildings to be built, wait for your adventurers to return, and so on and so on. This is made worse by in-game deadlines; your pet will always appear at day 30, and the 25th clue only appears on day 565, for instance. You may very well jolt awake five hours into an ACS session to discover that you've missed a one-time-only event and that you can no longer 100% the story. Time is your greatest resource in this game, but you need to spend it like a billionaire shilling out for his fifth yacht. 

And yet, even after all that, the game is strangely beautiful. I find myself getting drawn in back again and again. There's an elegance to the mechanics and the method. There's a sense of intrigue behind every unexplained game mechanic and every unsolved mystery. And, of course, 100 hours gives you a connection to your randomized little cast of characters that you just don't get in other games. I cried when my very first character ascended to immortality and left behind my sect forever. It's these feelings, this sense of depth and satisfaction that makes the game worth playing.

In fact if you know nothing about cultivation I wouldn't recommend this game. However I do recommend this game and I'll explain why: The game is well made, it is a good game. It's just not for everyone who can't put the time in because this will probably take hours for it to really get good. 

About the game: This is a survival management game with chinese cultivation added into the mix. 

Points of the game which I feel you should know before buying:

Short Version: Complicated, complex and might be hard for anyone who doesn't understand chinese cultivation or expects the game to be easy/rimworld. You will definitely get your money's worth out of the game otherwise and if you choose to stick with it. 

Long Version: 
-Cultural Barrier(for the western world): This game suffers a cultural barrier that folks in other parts of the world may not understand and get hung up on some of the terms or how the flow of the game works. The tutorial does a good job of showing you how to do things. But, it does not explain the flow of the game very well which I feel is important due to the complexity of the needs of your disciples and knowing where to go next. 

-Complexities: Everything is very well detailed and there are alot of little and big things in the game that requires a lot of trial and error. The needs of your disciples is alot more than food and water, there is a spiritual aspect of the game you need to keep an eye on. Plus you have tons of commands, sects, orders and tools you'll have to go over and learn as you go by in the game. It's a really long list.

-Tutorial: It's really long, not pointless but it doesn't explain the flow of the game well enough. It does a really good job of telling you how to do something and explaining it. But it doesn't tell you when you need to use this or why you would need to do this. There isn't a tutorial map that can hold your hand through an example of the flow which I think is what would discourage many from continuing the game. While the idea of the game looks fun, it's also too complicated to understand without an example to go off of (Go to youtube and watch someone play it really) 

-Once you get the flow, the game is slow. It takes a really long time to find a good place, build decent sustainability, build your sect up and progress to those dragons you see on the trailer. Like it might take hours/days, so dont expect to play this within steam's refund policy to know if you like this or not.",1610356942,1610356942,True,37,1,0.743721485137939453,0,True,False,False

My only note is that you shouldn't expect a really enormous focus on base-building.

-amazing soundtrack
-amazing gameplay
-enough humor to keep you going
-lots of tooltips but not that many to make it to easy

Its a game where you have to build, manage, explore, fight, develop and everything revolves around a cultivation sect, and as I am an addict for xianxia novels, this has hit the spot for me.

Another key factor of this game is that it is a big ol time sink. Hours will go by playing this game. This is comparable to other sandbox/ building games such as Minecraft where there is always something to do and areas you could have done better.

Now to address the Rimworld similarities. Rimworld has been on my Steam recommended for a very long time (We talking years) and I never got it because it just didn't look that interesting. While in contrast I really enjoyed the WuXia aesthetic of this game.

还是有bug，比方说打蛟龙的时候（或者有时候打人），小人的剑会如同抽风一样在空中前后移动，但是就是不去碰对面的法宝（或者去打蛟龙）。我要手动让小人靠近蛟龙才能让他们的剑打到蛟龙身上。
交易区，仓库物资搬运繁琐，为什么交易区和仓库不能做在一起？比如说仓库里有东西要出售，你就挂出售就行了。很多法宝无法收入储物小天地，还要手动搬到交易区——搬完交易商人都走了。
无法灭门，而且我去其他门派里偷东西时居然发现他们门派弟子因为天冷被冻死（这太荒谬了），比如青莲剑宗的看守小人居然会被玄牡珠冻死(?)
后期（500天后）玩法乏味。至少1000天内要有有新意的内容吧？

The Base Building also has some mechanics into it like Feng Shui that you need to account to and so on where it starts to diverge from the Base Building that is similar to RimWorld. But other than some small survival and early game features that are similar to that of base building games like RimWorld or even Dwarf Fortress, it starts to become an RPG and the Base Building just starts mostly to be placed towards the back-burner (You'll build stuff from time to time) until you find the need to build a Royal-styled Majestic sect base or a Soviet-styled utilitarian sect base.

HOWEVER, this game has a deep learning curve and the bare-bones tutorial zone barely helps you get into the game with proper knowledge and only teaches you the basic controls and the story that the Classic begins with. I recommend you to check the wiki for guides as well as the discord server for their help (They also contain guides there as well). But feel free to enter the game blind.

Anyhow, I've been playing this game mostly non-stop learning the mechanics of the game, going from guide to guide, scouring through the discord requesting help/tips, even restarting multiple saves because I've done badly.

If you want to play this game, be prepared to lose, often, a lot of people

TL;DR : game is gold if you're willing to put in the time, even though there are some problems here and there.

So what are the pros and cons ?

Pros :
+ In game wiki

+ In game forum kinda. On every item, people, location and so on, you can see the comments of people playing the game, helping each other out, or memeing their way into the game

+ lots of content, from different cultivation laws, to races, to mythical stuff

+ Sect management. You obviously micro manage your inner and outer disciples but as your sect grows bigger, you need to expand. Create branches that gives bonuses, create shrines in the neighboring locations to get more resources and so on

+ Difficulty. It's a pro for me but it might be a con as it's really hard to understand everything. you wont ascend to demi-god on your first game, trust me. Mine ended when two cultivators from another sect were angered and one shotted everyone in my sect. Don't anger too much people in the beginning.

+ just overall feels like your favorite manwha

Cons :
- Music. Sometimes, the game stops the music, even if you've set it to loop endlessly (cause yes you can set how often the musics should loop, which is actually nice) making the game like a bit dead

- Difficulty. As i said above, the game is really difficult, just one misstep and you wipe your own guild

- Secrets. There are in game secrets and mysteries, but making progress on them is soooooooo long, it might get boring and you just forget about it.

- Interactions with other sects and people. It might feel a bit tough in the beginning, if you want to learn some stuff about people, you need to ask the person you're talking too about every single damn thing. You want to learn the favorites of a sect leader ? this is how it goes :
chat and gift until you're at 60 of favor, discuss about the sect leader, if he knows something he'll say so, discuss about the thing he said he knew, discuss about the sect leader again until the dude says : I don't know, who is it ? Cause yeah after learning weaknesses, personnal treasures, all their favorites and dislikes, their location, you dont know who that person is

- in game wiki. Even though it's nice, to have one, it might feel a bit empty from time to time.

- physical cultivators. way. too. overpowered. i have one, he single handedly defeat each and every wave my enemies sent to attack me until now

There might be some other pros and cons that i haven't explored yet, like formations, sect wars, divinity and shendao laws but yeah, if you're hesitating cause you like this kinda game but feel a bit lost about it, don't

Edit : 
After some small added game time (only 110 hours or so), i can add some stuff. 

About shendaos that's fun. feels like a game in the game where you have to manage your divine palace. Funny
About Physical cultivators they're not too overpowered. It's even more than that. i even saw a guide on the internet telling you how to make one in 300 days or so that can solo sects

Text version of the video review below

After playing this game for quite some time I can fully recommend it. In a nutshell ACS is one of the deepest and richest Sandbox RPG games I've encountered so far. It has a knack towards base building but it's completely different to titles like Rimworld. It shares a similar base design, but ACS leans way heavier towards character development, world exploration and fantasy story telling.

Pros about this game are it's insane depth, a very cuddly and wholesome graphics style which also has a pretty high quality standard. On top of that it's moddable and therefore there's no ceiling to the content of the game. Everything makes sense, is very well fleshed out and offers hours and hours of interesting content if you are into Eastern Fantasy.

The Cons are: Steep learning curve as hell, a pretty clunky UI which is at times mildly infuriating and a translation which leads to misunderstandings and confusions at times. The third part is something I am pretty sure will be gone in a few months/years. Don't get me wrong, the translation is solid, but it's noticeable that there still needs work to be done.
The Learning curve is what I consider the heaviest Downside of the game. You really gotta dig deep into the game to actually enjoy it. But that's also a Pro - if you dislike shallow or too easy games in general

My summary: Absolute recommendation! 
Albeit it's quirks the game is one of the deepest and richest experiences I've had in 2020 and I don't think the devs will stop here. The game is moddable (translation work from Chinese takes some time though) so we are sure gonna see a lot more stuff in the coming years. 
If you have doubts - check out a few gameplay videos and decide for yourself if the gamestyle scratches your itch, cause the game sure is quite eccentric. But if you get past it's hard shell, it's an adorable simulator which gives you so much freedom of design and choices - it's awesome!",1609579641,1609579641,True,50,3,0.793500781059265137,0,True,False,False

Have not played it a whole lot but ill give my take because a game should be good enough to start to want to keep playing and it is but it can be a but complicated .  One major perk of this game over  rimworld are the characters being fully 3d ""They have limbs"" 

What makes the game also different from rimworld is the setting and in place of technology is a elaborate taoisum and fungsui  with 5 elements with what things are made out of and where makes or break a room vs a simple ""more bling makes everything better"" of rimworld and pretty much every other game. So it is  attention to detail and even trying to accomplish something like that is a feat itself, will see how well it works or able to understand it.

I think it was inspired by rimworld but allot of games have that systems of mood and keeping a team alive in a colony or spaceship (space haven) which are all scifi,
and this one isn't, in place of rimworlds complicated mechanics it has its own equally complicated ones which are unique. 

A pet peve I have is some areas where it does not work as well as rimworld like supply zones are harder to resize on the fly  and parts of automaton does not work as well, a lack of a ""allways have X"" order so you just have 5 meals ready or whatever resource number ready. And no draft function of them pausing work ordering them like RTS units so you could do interesting tatics like having archers shoot them and holding position with melle units and or just ordering people everyone or some people spot to protect them, or to all attack a dangerous animal at once. The game shouldn't try to be exactly like rimworld but those handy things would be very good to have.

At the same vein of those quality of life features I would like to see from rimworld this game has things to offer would like to see in rimworld, namely the 3d models of characters (and will see more as go along). If you click a character it not just shows the actual model in game, it shows what they are doing, so I saw the turtle character laying on ground sleeping and occasionally other characters walking by in the profile, its an attention to detail thing that makes the game seem more immersive and interesting. The same devs probably make a good scifi colony game too (the yagoi can be 'aliens') and I definitely would want that too, and or it might be good for the rimworld people to hook up or contract them for some 3d models in game to be more like concept art. 

Another way its different which I am not sure is good or bad  but matches the world is that you have no freezer, so DONT just hunt every animal  to stockpile meat, wait until you actually need more meat to hunt something. Not sure if its a problem that is in game, I would like to refrigerate mounds of food that would spoil otherwise but thats rimworld thinking, roleplay less technology setting like IRL in oldie times people kept animals alive up to point of consumption. 

The turtle characters are also really slow so I would not recommend starting with any of them, I like the aesthetics having them be too much and actually like a turtle that is humanoid and not a generic humanoid with a turtle skin, so they get points on lore and being different but for same reason I will not want them for my own squad.

I played it and kept playing and will likely do it more latter, so it passes the test of being something that risks being addicting time sink, so a good game. 5/5 or 4/5 something like that.",1608063051,1609448045,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For the record, I left the game on a lot, hence so many hours. I enjoyed it for a while, but there are these random brick walls that I have yet to figure out how to get past. For example a few inner disciples just could NOT breakthrough, regardless of all the buffs I had on them.. I basically had them maxed and their breakthrough chance was sitting at ""Insignificant"". Bug? Maybe? Another unexplained rule in the game? Possibly. Anyways..

Basically there is a massive learning curve in this game and I still haven't figured out everything. But the bugs remain and are pretty significant. On top of that, it's like a different department designed each screen as none of them are the same. Some of them work with an Enter, some you have to hit numbers, some you have to click.

Speaking of popups. Holy good lord.. It's like back when popup blockers weren't a thing. Go to move a disciple to do something? NOPE popup....ok close that...back to what...NOPE POPUP. Going to close that popup? How about another one on top of that. Arg. There are some controls to modify the popups somewhat, but you still get useless popups like 'Random bandits were going to attack you, but decided not to."" 

Then just the overall design of the game just doesn't really seem thought through. Trying to organize anything is near impossible. The filters are just too broad, and items are classified oddly. For example 'Pills' are their own category, but pills can also be part of another category.. such as medicines. Then they all just sit there in an unorganizable manner so it's near impossible to find that Talisman you just created.

I feel like this game has a lot of potential, but needs a lot more refining and debugging.. Yeah that stove bug is insanely annoying..",1607279532,1609384124,False,8,0,0.479892253875732422,0,True,False,False

Includes a sometimes helpful, always entertaining, wiki style tips menu for every building and material in the game.

It is on the very surface similar to Rimworld in building mechanics, but beyond that it's about training up your inner disciples so they can break through into new states or ""levels"" of power. This requires a lot of optimization, whether it be in rooms with good feng shui that complement the disciples element/law, quality of clothing, amount of qi gathered in the area..etc. There's a lot going on in the game, but I wouldn't call it ""deep"", more just an enormous amount of content that has the facade of depth but is really just a lot of stuff. For example, feng shui isn't actually very hard to get. Once you understand how it functions (some elements complement, others oppose, positioning matters), it's quite straightforward and you'll have little trouble in optimizing things.

The essential mechanic is to level up your disciples. This is supported by going out on adventures and gathering resources. You also discover lore, secret locations, build up recruitment centres that help spread your sects influence, etc. There are a lot of interesting stories that pop up, and many items give access to new laws, talismans, spells, etc. It's very very content rich for the price you pay.

It's good, but again it's a massive time sink. Cultivation takes a tonne of time and a lot of time is spent watching and waiting.

The main reason I've spent so much time in this game, is because it fails at explaining it's own mechanics despite a lengthy tutorial. Even with the countless guides and very active discord, it still took this much game time to learn the many mechanics and put it all together.

After all that. After all the testing and learning and installing countless mods to fix blatant gaps in both QoL and functionality - I found the game to be relatively shallow, buggy, imbalanced, and lacking polish. Everything you do in this game takes an immense amount of time and repetitive effort and the payoff just isn't there. 

I have legitimately only fought two of the three super bosses without the use of mods. On your own, you'll likely never figure out how to fight the last two bosses. If you do manage to figure it out from discussions on discord, there are several layers of RNG you will have to muddle through that will take you many hours. If you do manage to spawn these bosses you'll find, depending on difficulty, they either require tons of maxed out disciples (which is a very long a repetitive task) or are outright unkillable without the use of unbalanced mods.

There's also a lot of mechanics in this game that are just... bad. Bad to the point where I can't even fathom the mindset of the dev. Just anti-fun, anti-player, disruptive, unfinished, and unavoidable garbage. However, you can workaround most of these glaring failures through mods.

That I would be able to handle anything this game threw at me placidly. I thought I would laugh at others as they struggled with their heart demons.

I was wrong. A mere frog in a well, unaware of the wide world and my own insignificance.

I came in expecting a Rimworld clone set in Xianxia. The sheer complexity of this game in comparison however was a true slap to the face.

I had made the worst mistake a cultivator can make. I failed to see Mt. Tai.

Oh... I'm not being paid by the word and can stop padding my review?
Right.

Yeah, so in my opinion this is better than Rimworld, to some extent it's comparing apples to oranges though.
Rimworld is very RNG heavy and you can play it different ways, save scumming to build the perfect colony or dealing with the crap it throws at you and trying to survive. Difficulty in Rimworld comes from two sources, the player's masochism (e.g. starting with shit characters, deciding to build their colony on sea ice), and RNG.

It takes 1 freaking rocket launcher to potentially cripple your colony.

Cultivation simulator is very different. It captures the setting well, what with outer sect disciples basically being expendable slaves that do menial labor, and inner sect disciples being largely outside of your direct control as they just... cultivate.

The difficulty of this game is largely focused on overcoming yourself, achieving greater heights in cultivation.

It might be possible for a mid grade golden core to bumble their way to the peak of primordial spirit realm, however the heavenly tribulation will ensure their end if their talent is lacking.

There are many different cultivation laws, including physical and faith based ones as well as more typical ones.

On balance, I would say this game is 3-4 times as complicated as Rimworld, which is both a good and a bad thing.
On the one hand, it can be rather opaque at times. The tutorials don't fully prepare you for everything in the game and you'll constantly be learning as you go. For example, the fact that you can teach disciples skills from other laws isn't really explained, you have to figure out or read somewhere online to transcribe your laws into manual pavilions.

On the other hand, it means that there's a lot more to do than just run your little colony, and the late game is much more substantial than the ""watching paint dry while you wait for the ship to be ready"" end of Rimworld.

Even after you get a badass demigod, it's not like they can singlehandedly go in and wreck entire other sects. A powerful formation of badass demigods though... that's another story. There are also super bosses in the flood dragon, phoenix and torch dragon that will require formations of immensely powerful cultivators to overcome.

My current sect is going towards 700 days of playtime, having passed 5 in game years already. I've gone from a third rate sect where a grade 1 golden core was a pipe dream to a powerful force in my own right. And I'm nowhere near the point where I've done everything the game has to offer. It's not as easy as just slapping some power armor on your pawns.

Overall, I would say the game is absolutely worth the money if you're willing to put in a bit of legwork to learn the mechanics, especially for fans of Wuxia and Xianxia.

If you don't read Chinese webnovels, some of the stuff will be pretty foreign to you. It doesn't mean you shouldn't consider playing, just that some things won't make as much sense. If you DO read webnovels, and you're a fan of Rimworld or Dwarf Fortress, prepare to spend many, many hours in this game.",1608844371,1608844532,True,4,2,0.506445705890655518,1,True,False,False

[*] The tutorial is extensive and very good.
[*] It shares some similarities with Rimworld, so if you have experience there, it will help get started. 
[*] The similarities with Rimworld are only on the surface. I find ACS to be vastly more interesting, beautiful, exotic, exciting, ... [/list]

[*] The tutorial is a good place to start, but it may take more than 2 hours to do all the tutorials. If you have any thoughts about refunding, be mindful of that time. I suggest doing about half the tutorials, then just jump in and start a game.
[*] Find one of the getting started guides just to help with character selection and perk selection. You can't quite just accept all defaults without making choices, so this is where the learning curve is not fun (i.e. before you can even get started.) [/list]

One last thought: the guides available on Steam and on Discord help some, but I think many of them are out of date.

But there are some significant frustrations as well. Since most of the game is fun and just fine, I'll touch on the few but major negatives.

You cannot tell your disciples ""GO DO THIS THING NOW"". No matter what, you cannot do that, ever. They will do it when they are ready. You can prioritize the job, and some things are innately very high priority (like fighting, they'll generally stop and go fight pretty quickly). But otherwise, nope. They'll do it when they're ready. You can prioritize their job preferences, and tell them to do or not do certain types of jobs, but if you want a specific thing done, you cannot get that. 

Example. Let's say you want someone to go craft shirts and pants for everyone. You have crafting materials available and ready for use. You can go into the work menu, take away all other possible jobs other than tailoring, you can tell them to prioritize tailoring jobs, but you cannot just tell them ""walk over there now, get to crafting"". They'll do it in their own time. Or not. I've had exactly that for the last 3 hour (real time) of game play. Trying to get winter clothes made. Well, winter is here, people are cold, and my best tailor (who has no other jobs, and materials available) simply will not go craft the clothing. I even queued up jobs for winter clothing with every type of material I can make the stuff out of, it's not getting done. Double checked everything that I can to make it happen, as far as I can find nothing is stopping them. I haven't blocked access to the crafting stations, they have mats, they have no other work allowed to them, and it's prioritized. No clothes. Even if I'm wrong and there's an issue, it should not be difficult to figure out, ya know? I can craft everything else. I can even make the cloth. But the clothing? Nope. Need a wall built now? How about something to change the feng shui of a room so your guy can cultivate faster? Whenever they're good and ready, and not before. Maybe they want to do everything else on the map first, it's not up to you, it's up to them.

Everything is like that. You can't just compel them to do the job you want done. It's all prioritizing types of work, but no way to just say DO THIS JOB NOW. SO FRUSTRATING.

The game takes place in a fictional China-like setting, and the game is steeped in Chinese culture, which is really cool. The learning curve of this game is basically unrelentingly straight up. I'm now 73 hours in and I'm still discovering so many things. Now, that being said, I do think certain mechanical aspects of the game could be better explained to keep you from making serious mistakes. But overall, if you want a game that doesn't tell you everything and expects you to experiment to learn, then this is a good game for you.

Graphics: Passable.
Music: Good, but repetitive.
Tutorials: Well, there's about 50 of them. And yes, even with all of those tutorials it barely scratches the surface of what you'll learn. They do cover the very core concepts well.
Gameplay: Outstanding.
Language: Passable but not perfect. The vast majority of the time I understand what I'm seeing. Also, note that sometimes things don't quite fit properly. I'm assuming this is due to English words being longer than Chinese words in some cases. It doesn't prevent gameplay at all.
UI: This is where the game could do better. I don't mind experimenting, but it feels like often decisions are made in vacuum. And not just pre-decision but post-decision. I built an item to improve a disciple's mental state, but it doesn't seem changed. Why not? It is all just a per perplexing when it doesn't need to be.
UX: There's a LOT of micromanagement. It doesn't really bother me that much, but there are aspects that could be much better.

Overall, I love this game. I love this game FAR more than I thought I would love this game. I thought this would be a weekend game and then put it down, but I'm obsessed* with digging deeper into it. The big thing to keep in mind is the insanely steep learning curve. If you're down for that, then this is a good buy.

This game plays like rimworld at its base level with many additional mechanics that are all inspired from chinese xianxia themed media. You indirectly and directly give orders your outer sect peons to work and cultivate while a select few will be chosen to rise to the top and eventually grow strong enough from this plane of existence. In order to do this you construct a base of operations with  buildings that allow you to do various tasks  as well as go out and explore to find rare resources that increase the strength of your cultivators.

However there are many small issues that (when combined) make playing the game an odd mix of fast forwarding as fast as possible when everyone is just sitting around and doing jobs and cultivating and then pausing and taking 20 minutes to fix some minor details. Some mods are needed to fix stuff like the balanced cultivation method. Additionally there are mechanics like qi gathering that work a bit unintuitively and it can be hard to tell if you are doing the right thing since you can only see cultivation compatibility when someone is about to breakthrough.

Additionally if you are not already a fan of other xianxia works playing games in this genre for the first time from a western perspective you may not understand what a lot of mechanics such as qi, cultivating, elemental affinity, sects, talismans, etc. are used for or what they represent in game.

Edit: second week in, I can talk about it a bit more with good conscience.

This game is ultimately about delayed gratification, if you don't save up for the right time, the right resources, the right climate, the right student, the right technique you will stall eventually. But on the other hand if you don't do the sub-optimal thing you will die. You have to juggle both expertly if you want to survive. Same thing for building things at the beginning, you could go for the perfect room but it takes a lot of work, or you could go for good enough and go much faster. You have to balance the needs of the now versus the potential rewards later. Both are crucial, if you don't level strong enough cultivators you will die, but you need them both quickly and later and the need for both time are very different and conflict with each others. This makes for some great juggling, though sometimes a random event might feel frustrating. I remember a physical cultivator mowing my 6 low level inner diciples in seconds once because I pissed some other sect too much, or 3 combat event popping at the same time, one giant magical serpent on a rampage in my peons, while a bunch of mad non-magical cows murdered my best farmer (ironically a cow as well) on the side while I was fighting 3 enemy cultivators with my main fighters. So yeah, sometimes you can get screwed, the game will push back if you piss of the wrong people too soon.

As for the Fengshui aspect don't freak out too much, it is quite simple once you get the hang of it, after starting back a few times and following other players advice bubbles for rooms and stuff you'll get through easy. It does leave with some constrains though. It might feel frustrating for some not to be able to make what you want visually or functionally, but sometimes restrictions can breed creativity in ways you wouldn't have guessed before.

I'm just sad the community is not bigger for this game, I have a lot of fun and I could use a decent streamer on this... sadly the ones on youtube are even more clueless than me.

For example...Rimworld is a colony builder where the machine like efficiently interconnected buildings are the meat and bones of the game while you deal with love, hate and romantic drama of your pathetically weak mortal colonist. In the end only struggling to build a spaceship to flee the confines of the planet.

Amazing Cultivation Simulator is about the journey towards becoming a GOD. How to do that? Nothing short of perfection. 

Managing everything from buildings, training, trading, adventure in search of ""opportunities"", crafting artifacts & medicine, stocking up your library for second generation disciples and beyond. Train that stupid little sh-t... I mean nurture your spirit guardian animal of your choice (reminds me of Naruto). War or ally or trade with other sects--steal their secrets of power! Build temples to gather faith and increase your strength and outpost to expand your reach. Set your path either by hypocrite's long path of justice or realist's shortcut of evil.

Remember...good or evil, everything comes with a price...usually you have to pay with your life (in specific number of years of your remaining lifespan...do mind not to exceed your lifespan credit limit to avoid untimely expiration of your gods).

Your future depends on how many powerful gods you could cultivate to protect and guide your sect. Nothing else matters but your heavenly ascension.

The early game is just like Rimworld with a mythoglogical twist.
If you enjoyed Rimworld you will enjoy this part of the game, or you might be bored by it , depend how you feel about rimworld clones.

After maybe 5-10 hours you will get into the ""cultivating"" side of the game , which is the main side of the game.
It's a massive learning curve ,especially for those who are unfamiliar with Cultivation theme.
You will pull your hair to figure out the feng shui mechanics and without reading guides you will fail at it miserably. You won't find the resources you want , you will fail at exploration. In general you will be stuck.

The game is massive and deep , sometimes to it's own demise, you will struggle to find proper menus and options , because there's just that much complexity in the game.
Personally I enjoy steep learning curves. Hence my 290 hours on record in last 3 weeks. I loved the journey , but I can see how one could get sick of it.

Ultimately tho the game is way too grindy , once you learn what there is to learn it takes too much time to get the right resources , the right manuals , the right combination of everything.
Everything in this game beyond the starting resources has to be ""uncovered"" or is accessible at random times.
Often you will find yourself waiting days until the conditions are just right. 

The game switches between very micro managing heavy impossible to track everything to days upon days doing nothing at all

I took me 3 days irl , to finally dig out The talismans that I was looking for and I have characters with Maxed Alchemy , Crafting Intelligence and Luck.

Without patience of a saint, you will never get to the endgame of this game.

From a survival aspect, the game is very simple compared to Rimworld. I'm pretty sure your (mortal) characters just get sick from ""eating dirt"" instead of actually starving. You'll eventually get healing spells and craft medicinal pills that make any wound that's not immediately fatal pretty negligible. 

The real meat of the game comes in the cultivation systems. ACS has a lot of systems that it doesn't explain in depth. It's up to you to figure it out, or more likely scour the official Discord for guides/help to kind of figure it out. 

It can get grindy, if you get into trying to make your characters as powerful as possible. Which, I mean, is basically the point of the game. Managing Feng Shui & the Five Elements can be a fun task when trying to build/optimize the layout of your sect. 

If you've ever played Rimworld and thought, ""I wish I could just train my characters to become really powerful."" ACS might be for you.

The basic premise is that you (and a group of up to four others, depending on the starting perks selected) are refugees from a devastating attack on your sect by an unknown enemy which wiped it off the map. Your plucky group of survivors are now starting up a new sect, while searching for clues as to who (or what) was behind the attack.

I'm playing on Immortal / Ironman mode. Mostly because I'm sucker for achievements, which you can only get on Immortal runs, but the fact that this also turns all the difficulty and event sliders up to 11 makes things more interesting. It also prevents savescumming, a mixed blessing/curse.

So far the most 'exciting' part of not having a save to fall back to is dealing with events:
There was the time one of my cultivators traveled to another sect, and was given the options of 'sneak around' or 'leave'. I'd taken a day and a half to get there, so I figured ""what's the worst that could happen?"" The answer is: the other sect finds you, pokes out your eyes and rips off all your limbs, allowing the remaining torso to make its way back to your sect. Oh, and your reputation with them goes down by -200, so they're probably going to retaliate against you.

While I would rate the translation of this game to be overall excellent, there's definitely some ambiguity in some of the choices. The most interesting that I ran into was having one of my cultivators run into an evil sect's minions, who were up to no good in a town, and I was given the choices of 'help them', 'insincerely help them', and 'leave / ignore them'.

If you thought that 'insincerely help them' would mean that you'd help the poor townsfolk... yeah. Not so much. Instead of [i]just[/i] causing regular evil mayhem, your cultivator does that, [u]followed[/u] by backstabbing the evil sect and stealing their shit. Evil points galore and hatred from the sect you just screwed over.

Anyway, it's got some rough edges, and it throws you in the deep end (but it's got an [i]excellent[/i] searchable in-game help function; as well as an in-game wiki for just about every item and topic, which is... [i]occasionally[/i] useful).

But if you like the genre and can ignore the small bothersome things that happen in this repetitive game, such as not being able to click in fog of war when exploring, or not having a separate work task for crafting that doesn't produce items with quality*, then this game is a definitive must get. The game is long and grindy but its part of the game's charm so to speak.

* There are work tasks and skill levels for tasks (1-100), lets say your crafter has a 70 level crafting skill, but you need multiple ones to run crafting tasks simultaneously, some that produce ingredients with no quality parameter such as rolls of cloth from cotton, while some others which do produce items with quality dependent on crafting level parameter, such as clothes themselves, the game doesn't let you pick which character uses which work station, and doesn't give priority to the ones with the highest level, so you might end up with a worker with 1 tailoring level making a cloth with 10 quality (1-100) basically ruining the process and the 70 tailor making rolls of cloth which is unnecessary since the rolls of cloth have no quality parameter, when the 70 tailor could have been producing the clothes with 100 quality (max). So yes, neither is the process of assigning workers manual nor automatic, it is completely random, and you can't control it unless you forbid the workers from doing a task action in general, which makes it so you have a smaller workforce than necessary just for a lack of optimization on the game. The game could for example add a separate crafting job for non quality items, or a checkbox for characters to only be allowed to create items with no quality, but it doesn't.

There are also issues with priorities in general (workers ignoring higher priority tasks in favor of lower priority tasks despite being set correctly) and also the haulers/Peons which don't always use the closest storage, etc. 
Like i said If you can't forgive a game's lack of optimization this game is probably not for you, on the other hand the devs are constantly updating and the game has mod support, so some of it is mitigated by the mods such as Elisium.

Like rimworld but with much deeper (in my opinion) mechanics.. Unlike rimworld this game has much deeper focus on story and RPG elements and less focus on survival element (its still there, just not as involved as rimworld)

Despite this - its very well polished and everything makes sense and works well together. Really the polish on this game is amazing. But remember this game was made in chinese so some translation issues can be slightly noticeable. The mechanics are very polished and I haven't encountered any bugs.

Also lots of info not available. Be prepared to search for info. Its also very complex.

However communities are being built fast.

I say its mechanics much deeper than rimworld because:

Every single thing you can think of in rimworld - has at least two extra layers in this game.

For example: crafting.

First layer: You can craft normal items, weapons, clothes etc. - Vanilla rimworld.
Second layer: Can craft magical artifacts, elixirs using normal items using Qi (Basically like mana in this game)
Third layer: at primordial spirit level can use attachments to enhance your artifacts and normal items.
Fourth layer?? - there is probably a fourth layer but I am only 40 hours in and I haven't gotten that far yet xD (Yes! Expect to sink LOTS OF HOURS into this game)

Next example: Skills

First layer: same as in rimworld your character has traits and skills.
Second layer: your character also has stats: Potential, Perception, Constitution, Charisma, Luck - EACH OF THESE IS IMPORTANT. These stats almost have a personality of their own and if you dedicate time to this game you will learn where each stat shines most.
Third layer: Inspiration skill tree - Basically... I can write about 10 pages on this alone.
Fourth layer: Manuals - again ... I can explain but what's the point we are 4 layers deeper than rimworld already.
Fifth layer: ??? probably there is also a sixth Layer. I am only 40+ hours in.

Next example: Classes (in this game they are called ""LAWS"")...

First layer (wait rimworld doesn't have classes) ... well this game has LAWS or CLASSES of character That correspond to each element of the Feng Shui. (basically fire, earth, water, metal, nature)
Second layer Actually some are hidden and you can find secret classes that don't belong to any of these elements
Third layer some secret classes can become god and unlock heaven mechanic - which is a building mechanic, where you build a personal heaven - and this is on top of actual outpost(agency) building mechanics which already exist in this game.
Fourth layer - awakening mechanics for animal/human hybrids have their own ""classes"" 
Fifth layer.>??? again probably more to this.


Okay ... I mentioned a few examples of mechanics and their layer but there is probably about 20+ more. I am not exaggerating.

For example, one of the mechanics:
I saw one of my iron bars got ""Illuminated"" - which meant it became ""Alive"".

I didn't know what that mechanic was, so I searched a guide for it... I expected a couple of pages in the guide so it can explain this mechanic.

The guide on JUST THIS MECHANIC - HAD 112 PAGES IN IT!!!

Apparently - you can eventually make these illuminated objects become human???.... But they will have special stats that correspond to object.

You can do that eventually, but remember the goal here is to build your sect. the individual cultivators are secondary to that. Focus on what will make the sect strong and naturally the cultivators will grow stronger with it. Be ready to have a decent cultivator initially and progressively improve with each new generation of disciples. finally when your later gens are stronger, feel free to rebirth your original cultivators to get the boosts that were only available to the later ones due to their hard work. There is already a burgeoning community that will help explain things if you come find us on discord.

When you start it literally plays exactly like the start of Rimworld where you chop down trees and mine while making your area sustainable for you.

Now onto the next part. Once your characters gain enough ""Foundation"" experience from training they can become ""Cultivators"" these are your line of defence. Depending on the tree you pick determines the special powers and what they do. From being able to make zombie slaves (reincarnation six paths) to being able to change every part of your body (physical cultivation) including your genetalia. There is alot to explore.

Usually as soon as you reach the ""core-shaping"" stage you get the ability to refine your qi (mana) into a golden core which determines if you are strong or weak. The closer it is to Grade 1 the better you are going to progress (it's hard to reach core 1 without cheating/knowing all the mechanics).

In the end your goal is to reach ""Demi-god"" level of skill to the point where you can ascend to become a true-god. This is basically just killing off your character or reaching the end goal. 

The whole goal is to survive as long as you possibly can fighting mythological creatures.

To elaborate a bit, the basis of this game is a colony builder much like Rimworld in that you start with a handful of random schmucks in the middle of randomly generated nowhere and try to keep them alive by building a settlement. There are additional factions around you on the world map (which is not randomly generated because there's a story) that you can interact with, there are raids, traders and animals, hostile and otherwise. Also, expect inclement weather.
So much for familiarity - mythological content starts from here. Your random guys are actually survivors of a cultivation sect - kind of a chinese magic school/guild if you like. They have every intention to rebuild that sect, and that means cultivating chi and going for immortality. This is its own chunk of gameplay, different laws are trained differently and do different things, certain resources are needed to keep your cultivators happy and competent while being entirely useless or even dangerous to mortals. So you manage that system, get comfortable with it, until you run into the next entire chunk of game demons and body cultivators. Turns out any animal on and off the map can be enlightened and start its Journey to shapeshift into human form. This involves gathering thoughts on the environment until the creature is sufficiently smart to take half-human form. They can then cultivate like everyone else - or take the path of the Body Cultivator, which is its own, different thing that doesn't use qi, instead using ambient elemental essences to mutate the body into a finely tuned killing machine. This is necessary because the Heavens don't like animals turning human on a whim - they express their anger with lightning coming for enlightened animals. The smarter they are, the sooner the punishment comes for them.
And if you've digested that one, well... There's another system coming along. Because you don't actually need to have your guy going for immortality under his own power - why not start a cult instead? That would be the Shendao- or Divinity-Cultivator. They are their own thing which doesn't use qi or their body, instead founding a church and gathering believers. This one has its own UI that would pass for a barebones mobile game in any other context.
Did I mention yet about the adventure maps where you can do additional small quests for resorces? The fact that you can raise a pet (which, again, has its own separate mechanic)? Or the boss fights against dragons or pheonixes? There's even a Challenge Dungeon. Oh, and a story, I suppose - with a mystery that needs clearing up (you guessed it, all new, seperate system).

On the other hand, though, the game is hard to get into. There are - as you may have noticed - a lot of seperate mechanics which you have to mesh together juuuust right for them to work well enough to ensure success, and the game is not very forgiving of mistakes in any way. You can lock yourself out of a whole chunk of the story and you wouldn't even know it happened. It helps to know a bit about the whole cultivation thing beforehand, I can't imagine how impenetrable this must seem without foreknowledge.
The translation is decent, but the fact that these concepts were not meant for the english language shows. Dao for instance can mean path, sword or the esoteric concept of ""Dao"", alongside many more. Which one is intended depends on context. Currently in the game is a mountain whose ""Laws are winding and confusing""...  You see what I'm getting at - it's not perfect. But it is very playable, and there is an In-game-notepad-feature where you can leave comments and hints regarding the game concept they're attached to - just look for the little speech bubble with three dots or try right clicking.

In conclusion, this game is initially a confusing mess of systems interacting in arcane ways, but it is a very good mess and quite satisfying to tame and master - just like cultivation should be.

This game, however, just keeps getting more and more interesting the longer you play it.

Amazing Cultivator simulator is, in essence a  ""make your kung fu  / wuxian clan"" simulator, with goal of creating immortals.

The game is slow paced ( played 13 hours not past first year, but I do not use maximum speed), complicated as bleep ( example, you can make animals sentient, you literally can choose what thoughts they meditate on, feng shui matters a lot so on).

There's diplomacy, battle, resource gathering, building, adventuring ( both in text and in areas), tons of events, random wonderers, attacks and calamities, metric bleep ton of materials and items.. and list goes on. Let's not even get to manuals and elixir pills.

You can also create your own charecter either on basic level or more advanced using the in game content creation tools.

The biggest issue I'd say with this game is the complexity, even with tutorials and wide encyclopedia, the game is really hard to get hang on, if you have zero experience on the genre.  Controls are also bit unintuive, such as selecting target then pressing V to move them, but you get used to it fast.

I highly recommend this game for everyone who's fan of wuxia / build what ever you want games, just be warned, it takes several hours to really get just the BASICS of this game, and the stuff you can do increases the longer you play.

One of the many interesting things you can do in this game is that you can force feed practically anything organic to anyone. And most items be they pills or other items, have different yet funny effects. 

Did someone get greedy and attack your sect? you managed to knock them out? do you want to really screw with him? Instead of killing them, why don't you force feed them a rebirth pill? it will turn them into a mortal, causing them to lose their entire cultivation, skill set, and max age limit. Not enough to relent your anger? Feed them a pill that makes them obese, then another pill that makes them ravenously hungry. Them let them wander off on their own. What happens to their new life is no longer your concern. 

Do you want to be a real anti-hero? Go adventure out into the wild, and chances are you will meet other cultivators from other sects who adventured out to gain experience. Some of these cultivators can be inner-disciples, elders, or even sect leaders. Repeat the steps above and... hehehehehe.

Whenever I personally feel particularly vengeful after being raided while minding my own business... I would feed these people... excrement.

Yes, excrement that are left all over the map. 

The result would either kill these raiders outright, or they would eventually get up.... and just.... wander off the map. Being forced to eat shit can apparently even break the mind and spirit of an immortal cultivator. Who needs torture when you have such prominent tools lying around. 

PS. I am probably the ONLY player cultivator walking around with excrements in my pockets/inventory.

PSS. If your own units eat shit, they will get a near permanent moodlet debuff. Guess its this moodlet debuff that i give to my enemies >:D

PSSS. It is only a matter of time before the entire cultivator world unites to erase my sect from existence.

Original review:

I have spent about 40-50 hours in this game in the last few days, and I am enjoying it immensely. I'm so glad the English translation finally was released. (I only play off-line except to get enough time to write a review.)

I hate to compare games since you may not know anything about the other game, but I do want to say that this isn't a Rimworld clone. It shares a lot of the same mechanics and the interfaces are similar, but everything about the premise, goals, people, culture, reasoning, and so forth are all completely different and unrelated. You're not trying to escape a planet with futuristic tools, you're developing disciples in a cultivation center to keep the balance between good and evil, using many techniques and tools straight from ancient Chinese culture and mythology.

In my opinion, that statement doesn't cut it. The core of gameplay is just something entirely different. Rimoworld is essentialy colony menagement game, with strong focus on survival and dealing with material loses. 
But this game is entirely about Cultivation, building up legacy and making sure future generations can go even further. Frankly it's more akin to the Sims. Every single cultivator is important, and you need to personaly choose his/her path and skills.
What about bulding a base then? And your non-cultivators? In base building you really don't struggle with getting enough materials, and you focus on getting the perfect Feng-Shui. Getting enough food is super easy. And as for non-cultivators menagement, you just set their jobs, and forget about them until either they die, or earn their promotion to cultivators.
The only things you need to pay attention to, are cultivators, and treasures they get. You slowly build up ultimate cultivation rooms for each element. Go on adventures and try not to bring too much heat on your sect. It's so easy to get cought up in playing a hero, only to piss off every evil sect in existence, and end up with your legacy wiped out by quadruple raid of evil aliance.

And I have to say, this game is really good at making it's theme immersive. It's great represantation of cultivation, it's slow, planned, and you will work hard to get perfect golden core and open your path to greatness, risking staying at lower power level for a long time. You will take risks to aquire rare treasures. You will delay ascention because of earthly attachments. And it's way too easy, to look down on mortals. There will be the temptation to turn to evil, as draining those unworthy mortals speeds up your progres so much, and they are to blame for being weak, not you. And you may be tempted, to accept poor Yaoguai mortals, and help them form shitty golden core, only to watch them unavoidibly fail their tribulation and turn to beast made of precious materials, that will be helpful to your cultivation.",1607087518,1607087518,True,3,0,0.550172984600067139,0,True,False,False

While it's in the same genre, the game's approach to complexity, micromanagement, and UI separate them into two very different games. This game is much closer to Dwarf Fortress spliced with a squad based RPG. I'm personally enjoying the face applied to sandpaper that is learning to play this game, but despite knowing many people who enjoy rimworld and a couple other colony builder games there's not a single one I would recommend this game to.

Edit: After 20 hours of fumbling with the controls/concepts I finally realized this game actually isn't about survival at all. The game is about long term planning, incremental applications of perfection. It's even less like DF/Rimworld than I thought, as very little adaptation/reaction is required. There's no real point in figuring out mechanics yourself (so you can apply them in unknown future situations), because ultimately they more or less converge on the communities favourite layouts and there's no real surprises in this game.

Setting:

This game takes place in a fantasy world based on chinese mythology. While that sounds familiar enough, as someone deeply in love with western fantasy settings it took me a while to wrap my head around it. You are in charge of a small outcast group of people who found a wizard tower/monk school/religious sect. The concept doesn't really exist in western fantasy so it's hard to describe properly. The ultimate aim is to become immortal and incredibly powerful, I'd argue ""to become a god"" but ""gods"" don't exist in this setting as far as I'm aware. The path to doing so involves becoming a martial arts master, unlocking your qi (mana) and learning a law (school of magic).

To keep it simple, you're training muscle mages.

Gameplay:

The game starts out in a very familiar setting. Couple people with big dreams and a pile of sticks. Except don't build a house out of those sticks, you only have enough for a timber cutting station and it's annoying to figure out how to make more without a timber station.

The UI is unintuitive, somewhat carpal tunnel inducing and complex (Slightly better than DF still). It's possible these UI setups are common in asian games, they do tend to have different control schemes from what I remember of the odd asian MMO I've played. There's an expansive set of tutorials that try to teach the basic concepts, but there's 20 odd tutorials and none of them go particularly in depth while your eyes glaze over. It's worth noting, the translation is actually pretty well done with only the odd exception (like an empty room being described as ""devastated"").

The actual gameplay starts out as a simple colony builder, but the complexity catches up with you the moment you dip your toe into the deep end and produce your first muscly boy/girl/shapeshifterthing. Their path to progression focuses more on consumption of boosting agents than you'll expect coming from a western viewpoint. Creation of magic artifacts is likewise a mundane and common requirement, although adventuring to find powerful ones is also part of the core activities. Worth mentioning that the concept of feng shui is a core mechanic, base design has many hidden synergies that will impact the efficiency of your buildings/training/artifact creation. The game doesn't describe them in game very well, so short of looking up guides or going back to tutorials you just need to memorize everything. Mostly it's based on element compatibility though, which is quite intuitive thankfully.

One of the kickers is that ""laws"" (schools of magic) aren't readily available to learn and straying from the suggested starter law gave me a support setup. Healing/empowering others and making crops grow. Small comfort in the face of hostile sects and magical creatures. Not to say I was helpless, my mage is more than capable of killing the paltry threats the game has thrown at me so far just by bludgeoning them to death ineligantly with artifacts. But based on my last game's mage being licked to death by a magic frog I'm certain there's a clock ticking before threats roll by that will require actual combat mages.

It's at this point where we run into the RPG elements. Character setup really matters. I mean like, it *really* matters in this game. You have stat affinities for schools and potential caps on top of your usual skill list. Skill unlocks, equipment management, and room designing take up a lot of time in a game that already feels slow. In my most recent game of 4-5 hours, I feel like I've progressed about as far as I'd get in an hour of rimworld. I'm sure I'll get the basics more quickly with experience, but jeez this game has a lot to work with. As of yet I only have one mage, but endgame videos show sects with 10+ mages. The micromanagement on that is mind boggling given what I understand of it at this point.

The game also feels... old? Not mechanically, but I can feel the touches of ""our players are bored, lets give them more mechanics to keep them interested"" from years of development. It's certainly part of what makes the game bewildering to the uninitiated.

Summary:

I definitely think there's a type of player who will enjoy this. But I can't think of a single person I'd suggest this game to, due to the incredible complexity and lack of intuitiveness. To quote my friend who watched me play this ""What does humanity gain by having a game this complex?"" but hey I like it.

Just make sure it's your cup of tea before grabbing it. 2-3 hours will not give you enough of a look at the real game to know whether or not you'll like it.",1607014443,1607014677,False,42,3,0.597798645496368408,0,True,False,False

Its Rimworld at start, But at the end the sect dosen't really matter that much other then feng shui and Qi. You are getting your best stuff by sending your cultivators out of your sect to face the dangers of the world. It is quite nice as the sect is quite easy to defend in end games not counting big stuff. But if your best get wounded by from fight it can be very costly to heal meridians or grow limbs. 

The danger comes in early game from animals then later from exploring the world. Does have the nice feeling that one cannot grow to steal the heavens fortune by staying safe. Sometimes it bit booring when rng screws but for my experience you have to choice to back out but cultivation is wrought with danger on each step. Each Demigod steps to heaven on corpses of cultivators.

Some bad stuff is that game is full of noob traps.:
Like Importance of feng shui. ""evil"" rooms can cause heart attacks. Nice when you 50+ crafter dies from heart attack caused by feng shui. I do like it and tutorials are good. But bit sad that Stone + Iron rooms are the way to for almoust everything.

The first generations is just the foundation for gen 2 then after gen 2 matures you can re-do your first generation by breaking their cultivation and remolding their stats to fit the law.
Qi cauldron before golden core. Very slow to do at start no point.

Knowing that you can learn all the basic skills from all laws. So at start you get 1 law to start. Early quest get you your sects other 5? laws. You will have the quite few laws before the mid game. One can ""save"" the laws in your book pavilion where your cultivators can learn all the Qi increase and stat skills from different laws. The laws that feed or are fed by the law are cheaper but you can learn them all. 

There are quite few quality of life improvements could be done. Mods do many things. But like the Rimworld's do until have 50 in stock would be quite nice.
Stockpile management, I do realize the storage building makes it mute but like copy settings from other stockpiles?

I have read some of the negative reviews and they are honestly hilarious. This game does not try to trick you into it with an expectation that you are going to play rimworld or any other of those colony management sims. Those parts of the game are there and you do build a base and make clothes and grow grain. But after a while you can just kind of set it and forget it. With over 2k food sitting in my freezer I'm honestly not even sure what is in there and I couldn't care less. The problem seems that people walk into this expecting to try and survive or something like rimworld because that game is harsh and tries to kill you. This game is about creating a dominating sect and focusing on your inner disciples and creating a flourishing powerhouse. And of course this is all based on fengshui so if you have no interest in that you will fail at this game. Building a kitchen that is inauspicious WILL cause it to catch fire constantly. People can and will die from your poor town design choices so you gotta figure out the system and work with it.

But this game really stands on its own as amazing simulation game of any of the Chinese cultivation novels/manhua you may have read and if you are into that stuff this game will almost certainly be 100x more fun for you. If you read the reviews you will see all these stories people have about their sect and this is 100% what makes this game awesome. Personally I have no idea what I am doing, what half this magical elixers, relics, medicines, and other such things even do. However, that doesn't stop me from trying to collect.

I sent one of my practioners off to some mount doom adventure thing that popped up and he brought me back some fire lotus or something. Didn't realize my reward drop off point would be an issue till the thing heated up the surroundings to 200c and lit a building on fire. Some how one of my people managed to carry it to a pedestal I put in my ice crystal mine so I could stop getting notifications about fires. But, this thing also came in handy later when I built my water cultivation room. I had an aritifact in there I won off some gambler where all I had to bet was 150 years of my lifespan. Problem was it cooled the room to a chilly -200c and my practitioner nearly died of frostbite trying to breakthrough. Put that other fire gem in the corner - voila only -70c in that room now even if it is a little angry about negative elements.

Right now I'm working on training up my pet dog to become a qi powerhouse. It different from the sentient bamboo screen that wandered into my sect to eat rocks. Also different from all the chickens that joined my sect in the middle of winter and died of frostbite before they could even get to my pasture where they would have died anyways. also different from my other project. The tiger I bought off a wandering merchant who had awakened to the intelligence of anxiety. I send him around to eat feces, sniff trees, and stare at people while they work in order to deepen his understanding of anxiety. 

I honestly feel like I haven't even scratched the surface of what this game has to offer and I know that by looking at some of this crazy other stuff there is that I should be working towards based on some guide(BELOW). So for me its really hard to resist playing this game nonstop and I often look at the clock and think""when did it become 5am? I was only working on setting up another cultivation room to break another guy through to golden core... maybe I'll just play a little bit more...""

The good:
A deep, feature-rich game with lots of replayability.
Easier to learn the basics compared to other games in the genre. Untold options appear in good fashion as you progress.
Difficulty and progress speed are adjustable with fine grain control.
High level of polish in many aspects of both graphics, gameplay and performance.
Well translated into English.

My concerns:
There's still no detailed wiki on English. Everyone is still figuring out how to master lots of different game elements and relying solely on Chinese gamers / translators.

Then this game is for you!

Feng Shui will dictate everything from what direction you can put doors on buildings to what you can make materials out of.  It's so important and unable to track for a significant first part of the game, it will literally kill your people.  Don't worry you eventually unlock an overlay to see whats happening.  Just click that button so it pauses the game, then hover over things to see whats being affected.  Dont worry it will still be unclear, but hey you have an overlay!

Enjoy farming for food? great cause plants take YEARS to grow.  It's easier to just harvest stuff laying around, unless you just make huge tracts of the land farms in anticipation of hours later you may have food.  Not that it matters you can forage or kill animals for plenty of food up until at least 10 people (when I gave up)

Why do you have to pop up with an entire dialog tree everytime someone opens a box?  What do I do with people who attack and are knocked out?

The game is excellent. If you enjoyed Rimworld or Oxygen Not Included, you'll probably enjoy this.

Now, my fellow Daoists, for the actual review. 
I originally bought it due to my love of xianxia novels and was excited to see the world I love in a video game. The trailer looked... messy. With lots of fire and whatnot flying around, but I figured I'd give it a shot anyways, and I'm glad I did. I was expecting Rimworld + cultivation, but the cultivation element is far deeper than I assumed it would be. Is it like Rimworld? Undoubtedly. Are there things Rimworld does better? Definitely. There will be times you curse your disciples out because you can't give micromanaged commands like in Rimworld. But the xianxia elements, the ""magic"" the Feng Shui, the world, alchemy, the cultivation all feel like excellent additions that Rimworld just doesn't provide. They're not just stapled on gimmicks, they provide a breathe of fresh air for anyone who loved Rimworld and just wants... I struggle to call it a 2.0, but let's go with a really cool DLC.
I was also very impressed with the English translation of the game. I was expecting google-translate, but got a translation that's perfectly fine 99% of the time. Sure, every now and then you'll get a typo, or an explanation that doesn't exactly work, but overall it's very well done.
My review obviously contains lots of references to Rimworld, and that's because the two are obviously very similar and so comparing one to the other is natural. Much like Tekken vs Mortal Kombat, Command and Conquer vs Starcraft, Guitar Hero vs Rockband, or League of Legends vs DotA, the parallels between the games are obvious. That doesn't mean one is a cheap knock-off of the other. They can give you more of the game you already love. And that's exactly what Amazing Cultivation Simulator does.

-----------------------------------------------------------
รีวิวแบบยาว 

เกมนี้ถูกเอาไปเปรียบเทียบกับ Rimworld บ่อยมาก ๆ เนื่องจากช่วงแรกจะเหมือน Rimworld เลยเป๊ะ ๆ ซึ่งอารมณ์คล้าย ๆ กับการเอาตัวรอดมากกว่าอะไรที่มีความรู้สึกว่าเป็นหนังกำลังภายใน


ตัวอย่าง Video การเล่นช่วงแรกลองไปดูข้าม ๆ ได้จะเห็นว่ามันคือ Rimworld ดี ๆ นี่เอง [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek_lO7Oc01o] Youtube [/url] 


แต่เนื่องด้วยเกมนี้เป็นเกม Xianxia ซึ่งมันเป็นแนวนิยาย ที่มีคำว่า Cultivator ความหมายคำนี้แปลว่าเกษตรกร แต่ในกรณีของเกมนี้คือ การฝึกตัวเองเป้าหมายคือการไปให้ถึงจุดสูงสุด ซึ่งส่วนใหญ่ตามนิยายแนวนี้คือจะกลายเป็นพระเจ้า อะไรแนว ๆ นั้น

ถ้ามองให้เรียบง่ายมันคือ Rimworld ที่เราต้องทำให้ตัวละครของเราเก็บเลเวลไปจนตันนั่นล่ะ

แต่ประเด็นมันอยู่ที่ เนื่องจากการเก็บเวลในเกมที่อิงมาจากกำลังภายใน เส้นทางมันไม่ราบเรียบแน่นอน ไหนตัวละครเราจะไปเหยียบเท้า(ตีน) ของพรรคอื่น หรือโดนเด็กพรรคอื่นทำกลับมา หรืออยู่ดี ๆ ก็โดนหมั่นไส้มาไล่ตีแบบ Rimworld ก็มีเหมือนกัน ไหนไอ้ที่เราฝึกนี่ สวรรค์จะไม่เป็นใจ (เนื่องจากการที่เราฝึกเหมือนเป็นการขัดเส้นทางสวรรค์) เลยส่งฟ้ามาผ่าเราตอนที่เรากำลังจะข้ามขั้น แล้วยังมีไอ้เรื่องที่ว่าการฝึกมันแบ่งเป็น 5 ขั้นใหญ่ ที่แต่ละขั้นจะยิ่งทำให้คนเล่น(เรา) ปวดกะบาลขึ้นไปเรื่อย ๆ 

แล้วเกมนี้มีเนื้อเรื่อง มีฉากจบ ซึ่งเงื่อนไขที่ทำให้ดูฉากจบก็ไม่ได้ถูกบอกไว้อย่างชัดเจน 
แล้วที่สำคัญมี MOD อีกเพียบ(แต่ช่วงนี้มีแต่ Mod จีน คงต้องรอกันก่อน)

สรุปข้อดีข้อเสีย
ข้อดี
+ ตัวเกมพยายามอิงความเป็น Xianxia แท้ดั้งเดิม แบบไม่ได้ดัดแปลงหรืออิงไปกับนิยายอะไรเรื่องหนึ่ง
+ เนื้อหาเยอะ ทำให้เกิดความรู้สึกแปลกใหม่เหมือนได้พยายามค้นพบอะไรไปเรื่อย
+ ด้วยความที่ว่ามีเนื้อเรื่อง แต่การเล่นแต่ละครั้งมันมีเหตุการณ์สุ่มที่ไม่เหมือนกัน ทำให้เหมือนมีเรื่องหลักกับเรื่องรอง แล่นไปพร้อม ๆ กัน ส่งผลให้การเล่นแต่ละครั้ง เนื้อหาไม่ค่อยจะเหมือนกัน
+ จำนวนม๊อด ที่เยอะแยะ ยิ่งถ้าอ่านภาษาจีนออกจะไม่มีปัญหาอะไรทั้งสิ้น แต่ถ้าอ่านไม่ออกก็รอดูม๊อดอังกฤษที่ค่อย ๆ คลอดมาทีละนิดก่อนได้

ข้อเสีย
- UI บางจุด ทำให้เกมเข้าใจยากกว่าเดิม หรือทำให้เกมน่ารำคาญกว่าเดิม ยกตัวอย่างเช่นการทำอาหาร ที่ไม่มีการกำหนดว่าทำถึงเท่าไหร่แล้วหยุด (แต่อันนี้แก้ไขได้ด้วยการตั้งอาชีพพ่อครัว ซึ่งมันจะไปทำอาหารเรื่อยๆ เองโดยอัตโนมัติ)
- เสียง Effect เพราะว่าเกมนี้เวลาเล่นส่วนใหญ่เราจะไม่ได้เล่นที่ความเร็ว 1x แล้วพอเราเล่นด้วยความเร็วสูงขึ้น พวกเสียงเอฟเฟคก็น่ารำคาญขึ้นไปตามความเร็ว

-----------------------------

เอาเป็นว่า ใครเคยอ่าน Xianxia แนะนำเลยให้เล่นเพราะคุ้มค่ามาก 
ส่วนคนที่เล่น Rimworld มาก่อน อาจจะรู้สึกขัดใจอยู่บ้างเพราะ UI หลายอย่างจะห่วยกว่าใน Rimworld

Even so it is confusing, the start is your basic rimworld experience (with a little added nuisance) build up rooms, get a basic economy going, make sure everyone doesn't eat their own shoe. However once you get your first Inner disciple (small warning, they stop working after this) the real meat of the game begins as you start your own school based on a selection of laws and the game opens up to a more civilization/crusader kings vibe.

Still have to maintain your populace and need to keep a balance of Outer disciples (Workers) and inner disciples (Monks/warriors) though eventually you can add golems into the mix for additional workforce.

The ultimate goal is to become the biggest sect, but this game is a LONG one. You will spend a long period of time growing, I was about 5 hours in my first game before I had acquired my first inner disciple which put a kink in things as she was my primary cook at the time. Then you notice it will take a LONG time before that inner disciple makes any real progress in their training. So when picking up this game expect the long haul but it is a BEAUTIFUL long haul.

Graphics wise this game has a gorgeous aesthetic, from the trees, to the buildings, to even the grass and flowers and I could spend all day enjoying the scenery (while my new cook sets fire to the stove for the Nth time).

Some hours in, I'm noticing a departure from Rimworld's  way of doing things, and some of the systems in this game are deeper than any comparable system in Rimworld. Everything having to do with magic/qi is far and away deeper than, say, psychic stuff in Rimworld.

But there is something charming about this game. Rimworld honestly puts me off sometimes with how brutal it can be, and how frankly nihilistic it is. Amazing Cultivation Simulator has an entirely different ethos under the hood, and I think that's an improvement.

Some of the game systems don't make intuitive sense coming from an American culture, but that doesn't matter; most things are documented well enough.

If you've played Rimworld, use that as your baseline for how to feel about this game. Understand it's not a 1:1 comparison, but it's close.

Starts off playing a bit like Rim World and that's as much RIM as it gets because then all that changes as EVERY CLICHE in EVERY CULTIVATION NOVEL kicks in, Here just to name a few I've seen

-You'll discover Oh you need to face door a certain direction kitchen to the west, crafting to the east, and rooms to south everything else can be north. 

-balance out the Feng Shui is important

- Figure out how to cultivate fast, Things get harder, You'll get a pet which powers which you can train its mechanic system, 

- The cultivation laws have their system. Your PP will fall off because you cultivate a Yin ability but then you'll have a chance to grow it back. You'll even discover laws with depth like body tampering body parts (Like Rock Lee from Naruto) even growing your PP into an artifact weapon and other parts of your body into super pieces each body part with like 10 different muscles and become Ultraman, just one of the many laws but wait THERES EVEN MORE laws that you can find later on depending on your race and if you aren't human there are tribulations which can turn you into God knows what.

- There are sect and quests in the world to discover, evil Sect of hermits, a sect of good guys who rides swords? Hell, there's a  female sect that sucks the QI energy from your body through sexual intercourse along with other evil or good sect out there, you can be friends and negotiate with them or be a good/evil sect yourself to suffer your consequences.

- There's a farming system with its mechanic

- Random Events that happen as you quest, when you quest it has its little questing mechanic, there's even auction houses in this game like novels

- Freaking auction houses like the novel Don't offend that young master

- As your sect grows you'll find out it opens MORE things like sect wars

- There's a Romance system wtf!?

- Dragons and mythological creatures start attacking you, literally GODS how do you stop them!?

- There's even immortality advancements

- The Devs want to add EVEN MORE stuff to the game? hot holy damn!

- The game supports mods and has an in-game message board function giving hints and other God knows what.

Some of the bad stuff I've seen (Which some has mod to fix up)
The fog of war mechanic is awful (can be mod fixed)
The diplomacy between sect could be redone and boring (Can be mod fixed)
The micromanagement on the disciple practicing or cultivating is wonky (Mod fixed this)
The micromanagement of talisman and items on your character is really tedious
Itemization should be a list instead easy to switch out and in between.
Too much clutter of UI material which can be condensed way better.


This game is goofy and with so much depth it makes up for the small problems and mistakes. Once you get the hang of it, you'll probably be pressing shortcuts on your keyboard like a boss.
Good luck my fellow cultivators and don't offend any big sects or young masters out there. The whole point is to become powerful and not well known until you can handle the world as an immortal

Complexity may surpass Civilization, Egosoft X3, Crusader Kings 2. I've only begun to scratch the surface of the top level.

Automatic Thumbs Down for making me purchase permanently just to try it.

Does it resemble Rimworld? Yes. So what?
I remember when Rimworld came out and there was a massive row that the pawns were stolen from Prison Architecht. The truth is that it's an efficient way of presenting the art style the developer wanted.

The game is difficult to get into, and it feels unintuitive sometimes. If you set your people to chop wood or make bricks, and they don't, there's no easy way to see why. Turns out that there's some sort of internal priority system that means that some tasks are always done before others. 

The Cultivation system is alright. I'm used to it from LitRPG books, so it's a bit less translucent than I'd like, but it works well. 

Learning all the systems is going to take a long time.

[The good]
- A good simulation/strategy game for cultivation genre fan. We might see awesome game about cultivation someday but this game is a good start.
- Rich features. You have 3 basic cultivation method and a lot of method (around a dozen) to achieve immortal dream. So what does that mean? Heap amount of time to find them and heap of new exciting magic to discover. And each method would have a different way to level up....sometimes it's a bit repetitive but just sometimes.
- Lots of way for you to play the game. In my first play through I became a super a**hole and tried to rob large sect's stuff which ended up making my sect being destroyed. 2nd play through I play the nice guys but everyone came and rob my sect :(....you get the ideas, be evil, be good, be stupid...your choice
- You can mod them and there are a good community out there....
[Mixed]
- It got that RPG element in there. Haven't tested out the new adventure mode. But in the old version, you can expect to role play yourself to some degree only (ordering character to move around, select what they want to do like the sim...)
- You would have to spend time to understand how the game mechanic work so that might make you frustrating a bit at first.
[Bad]
- Expect simple graphic
- The character customization need more work. I can change my character's avatar but not their body type (bummerrrr!!)
- The story line seems disconnected to me, you can basically laze around for hundred of years and forgot about the main objective...",1606565771,1606565771,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Then onto points I like about the game;

- Trial and error. Your first save will most likely be horrible. But after some time, you'll start to see what works and the unwritten laws in the game.
- Cultivation. Oh my, this is a grind, but it's a fun one... After you learn a few things.
- You're going to end up with a character that is stupidely overpowered.
- Artifacts. Can both be found and created.
- Talismans. If you know them, you can create them, since there are blank ones you can paint on (I think?). Knowledge is power, and so is stacking a character with talismans.
- Depending on how you play, you may or may not be hated by everyone... You can also supposedly go to war.
- There's a lot of stuff in this game which I haven't seen or figured out yet. But it's a fun challenge.

Things I don't like;

- People really don't like fully wooden buildings. Most likely a good reason for it.
- Inner diciples do not do any building, farming, etc. It's reasonable, I just don't like it.
- I have no idea how to gain manuals yet, but I think you have to steal them, which is fine. But finding a random cultivation method in a ruin or a tomb, would be kinda neat (No idea about this).
- Formations. They explained it to me, I kinda got it, but I have no idea how to make one or activate one.

I love it so far but I'm a big fan of cultivation manhua and novels. I'll update this when I get more time over the weekend but so far the only thing I want is the ability to have the audio in chinese and the text in english.

Edit:
Okay so after another 5 hours and having gotten a couple of my guys past the foundation stage, the game changes completely. It's Chinworld until that point, but I guess that's understandable at the starting point of any Dwarf Fortress style game like this. You cut trees, build stuff, make a base and get set up.

After you get a couple of proper cultivators started though, a whole other game opens up, with well thought out, very rich and complex systems, which will probably take me hundreds of hours to even scratch the surface of. I really wasn't expecting a whole lot from this game given my experience with Tale Of Wuxia, but I actually found the fortress style colony sim suits this type of game way better for me. It has tonnes of depth and bags of character and charm.

The discord community are great, everyone is really helpful. In game, they've also implemented the most random comment section you can access by right clicking in some places. It's weird but I love it. Clock chat is best chat.

If you're not familiar with Cultivation Novels or Manhua the best way to describe this game is imagine a Dragonball Z game built in the Rimworld engine.

There's some judder if I zoom out all the way, otherwise the max speed setting really is faster even with 12 peeps running around, vs. Rimworld where max turns into normal speed late game lol.

So far.

I say so far because, taking a peek at the guide, there is just a massive amount left for me to see in this game. Look for the English guide and you'll know immediately if this game is for you. I'm praying what I've got is enough to hold out until late game.

ACS is kind of like watching paint dry if paint had mystical martial arts and turtle poop. I guess it's not like watching paint dry in that sense but it seems important to include that comparison because you really are waiting around a long-ass time for stuff to happen while people shuttle poops to your fields and slowly build up their power levels. I have not played with the game speed sliders yet to see how much that changes things, but that option is available.

One point of frustration is how opaque some seriously game-breaking mechanics can be. Because I'm furry trash, I initially set all my cultivators (colonists) to be Yaogua, but I guess that was a horrible mistake unless you're godlike at minmaxing because they either turn into bloodthirsty monsters if you don't complete their 'tribulation' or just outright die because there's no goddamn way to get that many fuzzies strong enough in time to do so.

If you like weirdness-prone simulators like Dwarf Fortress or Rimworld,  or if you just like Xianxia in general, this is for you.

My entire monastery burnt to the ground after I slew a demon who turned out to have flammable, self-igniting blood in the middle of it.

One of my monks had a bedroom. That bedroom had such bad feng shui that it literally killed him.

Another monk meditated on feminine energies so deeply that his.... er... monk junk fell off. I fully intend to forge it into a powerful artifact. 

My most powerful monk has become deeply aspected to the element of fire. He has a private room to cultivate himself in that's so stocked with fire-aspected items that it's hotter than a furnace. It doesn't bother him at all, of course, but there's this recurring problem of regular-people caretakers that keep going in there to sweep the floors and they pretty much instantly burn down to ash.

A giant hole opened in my monastery and there's a dragon living in it that will absolutely murder my entire school if I don't build him the most amazing bedroom imaginable.

One of my most powerful monks is tiny old man that does nothing but play Go all day and compose bad music; UNLESS bandits attack, whereupon he immediately hops on his sword and flies over to instantly paste them all in the span of seconds.

This game is soooooo much complex, deep and rich than a vulgar Rimworld-like. The lore and Chinese culture are adding different layers of micro managing to the characters and the environment. Here you are not surviving (I mean yes you have to lol but  that's not it) you are trying to reach Immortality, and you will see that in this game, TALENT (of your characters) is important. This game concept is a bit aggressive to beginners as there is a lot of mechanism and concept that you need to understand and the interface doesn't exactly cover everything. However once you're starting to catch on with the gameplay you will turn into an optimisation maniac.
 Even if you cover all the tutorials (and they are many trust me) you won't get some little details unless you are a careful reader or search for help on internet (or know about the culture). The learning curve is my be a bit slow in your first games, but once it clicks it clicks, you can have all the fun you have growing your new cultivator sect and its powerful immortals!

While this game is often recommended to people that like colony builders like Rimworld its really not much like them at all, the rimworld style gameplay only takes place in the first 2-4 hours of a save, after that the game becomes more of a teambuilding RPG map exploration game, based around maximizing the training of your chosen people so you can grow an even greater next generation.

The game suffers a little bit from replayability due to having a set map and campaign, though considering that a single playthrough can take hundreds of hours and there being enough deep systems to still facilitate multiple runs with different gameplay styles and focuses I don't feel like its a real issue. 

There really is not much explanation of how to actually proceed in this game and the amount of mechanics that come up with nothing more than a paragraph help blurb seem endless.

Knowing I've only actually played this a little while at time of writing, I do still think this game warrants a positive review - I've been following the game for a while through streams, lets plays, etc - so I'm not going in blind here, and I think a big thing with this game'll be just getting visibility, at least for the moment.

What this is, essentially, is a Xianxia version of Rimworld / Dwarf Fortress. It definitely leans more on the Rimworld side, with extremely simplistic 3d models for the characters. If you don't know what Xianxia is, you might have heard of Journey to the West, and this is along those lines. Basically; Chinese monks meditating, learning, doing alchemy, and fighting to gain access to the deeper mystical realities of the universe to reach Dao.

Edit 1:
Finished the tutorials.  They can get a little tedious because of how much is thrown at you but I'm not sure any better way of delivering the information.  What is clear is that there is far more of an RPG element to this than Rimworld.  Well, RPG isn't exactly the word because you aren't playing the role directly.  Your sect members have much more ability to level up, become stronger, go on adventures.  And your very first sect character does get perks that control what they are good at and what you start with.  Do you want to be start with a extra knowledge of alchemy (and a boost in related stats)?  Do you want to start as a sword cultivator (with a decent sword)?  Would you rather be more charismatic and bring more than 2 companions to start your sect?  Are you a loner who has no one help them, but is practicing a very powerful Law?


Original:
I'm still currently making it through the tutorial, and will update my review as I explore more of the game, but first impressions is that this is a good game.  It is quite close to Rimworld, but with technology being replaced by cultivation (electric powered AC replaced by cold spirit stones to keep your food fresh).

Overall the tutorial is nice and in-depth.  It is a bit obvious for someone who has played similar games, but I can't fault it for that as it needs to be accessible to players new to the genre.

It's [?] Rimworld!: No. It is not. You'd be more correct saying [RPG1] the same as [RPG2]! The similarities are that you can build things on a square grid from a top down perspective and that there is a work assigment menu for 'out disciples'. We might as well call 'out disciples' your ""interns"" or ""minions"" or ""unpayed practicants"" - You see where this is going: While they aren't irrelevant they aren't the point of the game. And the ""outer sect"" gameplay is more like you cross the early settler games  with rimworld: You have much more control about the exact shape of your base but overall the outer sect is realized by ""Scurry factor"". And again: Don' let this influence you in any way - outer sect is still not the point of the game. 

And now to also mention the central point of the ""basebuilding"" since I read so many times: ""not enough control!"". It's Feng shui. It is an other rathole in itself which I won't go down too far but let's give an example what this is about: Most things in the game have an element and those elements have a relation to each other. For example ""water"" nutures ""wood"" but supresses ""fire"" (yes, most of them are obvious). So if you have a workplace assoziated with ""wood"" then it is great for the room to have a lot of ""water""; and if the workplace is ""fire"" then it is a really bad idea to have a lot of ""water"" around. Add to that that you should not overcrowd rooms or leave them to empty and for some roomtypes doors need to be in a special orientation (e.g. bedrooms have their door in the south). Part of the ruleset is quite easy to explain, some I don't know why they are like that but in the end the tooltips and help function are good enough to figure it out pretty easily.

Now to the point of the game: It is growing your _inner_ sect disciples. Which are (or: should be) your valued competent specialists, combat force, explorers. There is an absurd amount of content for that and I have barely scratched it's surface: Crafting, equipment, level ups (which are non trivial and can be optimized a lot, it's not some EXP bar that makes 'pling, level up!'), formations (put multiple disciples into one for higher effectiveness - and so many options to build those formations), skills in a lot of forms and colours which your disciples can learn ...

And all again influenced by feng shui - for your 'wood type'~~pokemon~~ having a lot of nuturing water around is very helpful. The artifacts/tools are better if their owner can nuture them (so i.e. fire artifact for a wood type), quality and chances for level ups are influenced by it ...

tl;dr there is a whole lot that isn't ""rimworld"". In fact beside initially looking somewhat similar there really isn't a lot of similarities. (And I have hundreds of hours in Rimworld and the claimed similarity was one of the reasons why I had a look). Amazing Cultivator Simulator is a very enjoyable game for me and I recommend it if you are interessted - but being interessted because you want another Rimworld isn't the best indicator you'd like this game. (Not that I would understand why you aren't looking for even more mods in that case anyway)

Also the price is fine. It is currently 21€ for the 1.0 release - I got it for 15€ in early access - but after 40+ hourse (over 2 saves) I am starting to dive into a lot of the finer ""micromanagement"" aspects (which a lot of people complained aren't there - they are there, you just have to play the game further than deciding ""it's not rimworld"") and there is still a lot of content to explore.",1606390858,1606390858,True,110,4,0.869504868984222412,0,True,False,False

Those are WRONG. This game is only similar to RW if you brush the surface of this game. Beyond that, the actual combat and character building of this game is extreme deep and complex, worth hundreds of hours of experimenting and exploring. There is even a proper main story plot panning out surrounding the mysterious destruction of your previous faction. 

RW is fundamentally a survival game, where resource management is tricky and surviving is difficult. This one, as you might have guessed from the tittle, is not a survival game. It's about this whole cultivation thing. Surviving the elements of nature is easy in this game, build a good character and turn them into a demi-god, now that is a challenge. This game has the loop of delving into seemly simple mechanics only to discover deep and complex systems, and then feeling everything is straight forward and easy again once you've mastered it. A sign of good and thoughtful game design in my opinion.

Apart from the obvious language and culture barrier, which I don't really have a solution to, the one main struggle you might encounter during playing is the pace of the game. It is really slow, I will give you an example. At the time of writing this, I've been playing a new save on hardcore difficulty level. In about 40 hours, I progressed around 400 days in-game. So you can expect to play somewhere around 12 hours for an in-game year. Granted lower difficulties progresses much much faster. But this game has various hints that suggest you can play one save for more than a thousand in-game years. Traditionally, in Xianxia genre, the process of this cultivation thing is slow and takes thousands of years. So, depends on how you look at things, you can either say the game is too slow, or fits the title just right.

Also, I have yet to encounter a decent wiki for this game yet. So you gotta do it the hard way, discover things by yourself, by trial and error. There are some helpful comments in the game from other players on certain items but they are mostly in Chinese.

If you are a fan of the exotic Chinese high-fantasy world of Xianxia, I know there's a few out there, I highly recommend the game. It attempts to depict the part that usually get emitted or simplified in novels and other games. For others, I'd recommend the game but also be careful. This is not a game for everybody and certainly not for less patient ones. Language barrier is a tough one to cross. I don't know how much of a thing Xianxia is among non-Chinese speaking people, but I suspect there are communities of them, so maybe reach out for some help from those people. I'm sure they are nice, if they exists somewhere. You never know, internet is a big place.",1606290945,1606290945,True,451,14,0.941485464572906494,0,True,False,False

In many ways it's like an incremental game, where every time you break a points ceiling, some new mechanic is revealed to make your number go up even more. It's min-maxing: the game, and if that's something you like, buddy, you're in for a ride.

You have your daoist gokus that can reshape the map with magic, become immortal with alchemy, forge powerful artifacts and gather resources to lay foundation for raising the next generation of even stronger, smarter and faster gokus.

You have your physical gokus that can mutate their flesh and bone into inhuman abominations, regrow lost limbs and reach enlightenment through punching things really hard.

You have your godly gokus feeding off belief and worship, amassing thousands of followers and building a palace in heaven.

You can turn a literal piece of crap that your magical doggo made into a goku if you have the right skills. Hell, you can make a door or a frog into a goku. The possibilities are endless.


Cons: yeah, it is a bit janky, UI can get a bit used to, graphics are RPG Maker assets tier.

Through the setting, there is alot more complexity through the elements and management of cultivating magic that really set it apart and above the others of the genre. I don't really buy it as 'chinese rimworld' as while it shares with Rimworld the DF roots and the graphical style, it is entirely a different take on the genre. 
 
You kind of run a wizard school, where practitioners master martial arts and meditate to cultivate their minds and bodies towards the acquisition of magic, you have to mange this cultivation, keep a balance of inner and outer disciples (wizards and workers) and build a good school, the materials of buildings matter as it effects the elemental energies that effect the moods and magical ability of your wizards. 
There’s also an adventuring and quest system which is pretty fun and allows you to learn you magics and gain new buildings and stuff.

I can say that I loved Rimworld, but I am currently enjoying ACS even more. There is a lot more to explore and uncover when you get into it, but it does start a little slow. I feel like it is less stressful than Rimworld because you aren't getting hit with a catastrophe one after another.
The cultivation aspect is the main focus of this game which sets it apart from Rimworld. It is so complex that I cannot fit it into this review. The base building is highly influenced by a Feng Shui mechanic, so you can't just put everything anywhere.
It helps to have some knowledge about Wu Xia, which makes the game more enjoyable in my opinion. Go read some translated Chinese manhua like Apotheosis if you haven't read any.
The game does lack quality of life features compared to Rimworld, especially around managing your people and items, but the game is in early access so maybe they will be addressed at some point. The gameplay more than makes up for it.
The learning curve in this game is HUGE. It took me hours to get through all of the tutorials, and even afterwards I didn't know what I was doing and had to trial & error. Everyone in the official discord is extremely helpful if you have any questions.
I would recommend NOT looking too deeply into guides that handhold you. Worrying about min maxing your characters early on takes away a lot of the fun. Exploring what the game has to offer is where a lot of the fun comes from. 
The official discord community is extremely helpful so be sure to check it out. I’m sure you will have questions.
The beta translations are decent and definitely playable. You will have to join the official discord and check the pinned post to get the steam beta access code.

[u]Note that there is a lot to mention about this game, but not enough room to put in this review.[/u]

[h1]Overall flow[/h1]
In Rimworld, you're constantly thrown catastrophes based on the ""storyteller"" which tests your ability to survive. ACS is less of focused on surviving and more focused on cultivation. I was initially let down because I thought the game was too easy. I never had food problems. I one shot everyone whenever I got raided. It felt like too simple of a game, until you uncover everything else this game has to offer. 
Rimworld's end goal was to get from point a to point b and defend for some time. ACS seems more like a cultivation sandbox.

[h1]Difficulty scaling[/h1]
ACS scales based on your reputation. Reputation changes based on decisions you make. If you're too active, or you piss off a sect (faction) due to an action you took, it may become difficult quickly.

[h1]Character types[/h1]
All characters start out as outer disciples in ACS. They perform all of the chump labor such as cooking, cleaning, hauling, farming, mining, general crafting, hunting, etc. You can choose to promote the outer disciples to inner disciple whenever you want once they have trained enough and built their foundation. Once they are inner disciple, they won't be able to perform any of the activities that the outer disciples performed. They will have gained new cultivation options as well as access to artifact crafting, alchemy, miracles, traveling in the world map, etc. They will also start flying around and start attacking with artifacts which they control in the air like magic. Almost every item in the game can be transformed into an artifact including poop.

[h1]Recruiting disciples[/h1]
There is a final cap of 36 disciples max in ACS. It is A LOT easier to get new people in ACS, but hard to find someone with really good stats.

[h1]Mood[/h1]
Less demanding compared to Rimworld and can affect a characters cultivation speed. If an outer disciple's mood is too low, they will start slacking, but they don't have a breaking point. You don't have to bury enemy corpse in this game as they have no effect on the mood.

[h1]World Map[/h1]
The world map is not a grid like Rimworld. You just select points of interest on the map. You don't form caravans in ACS. You don't really take stuff with you, but you can put items in one of your 6 equip slots per character which you can offer another character to gain their favor. Food is not an issue when travelling. 
When you select an area of interest on the map, you have options to adventure, camp, and enter. 
Adventure will send an inner disciple to an area, and you will get a text event. You will either get resources or a stat/RNG check for other rewards.
Camp will keep your character there until you manually recall them, and they will receive a random event every couple of days. Camp is also the easiest way to actually enter a map.
You can perform trades instantly from the world map as well without sending someone out, but you may need a good relationship with them to get higher tier items from them.		

[h1]Cultivation[/h1]
Cultivation is the crux of the game, but its huge and complex. There isn't enough room in this review to cover it.

[h1]Feng Shui[/h1]
Most items, walls, objects, and buildings will emit a feng shui aura within a certain range. The aura emitted can be wood, fire, water, earth, and metal. Then there are specific feng shui buildings/objects (like a bed) which will receive that aura. If you build a room with wood walls, then you want the the bed that you place next to that wall to be built with fire material, because fire overcomes wood. If you choose the wrong element, the bed can become ominous. If it is a fully established room, then that bed also affects the feng shui of the entire room. If you have a disciple living in a very ominous room, it will affect their mood, and they can randomly die. On the other hand, if the room has good feng shui (they use the term auspicious), it can increase the rate that you gain cultivation exp in that room.

[h1]Establishing Power[/h1]
There are spots on the world map where you can send an outer disciple to establish a type of base, which the game refers to as power. You only interact with these established powers using menus. If it is established in a field, it can harvest resources which you can collect daily. Powers established in cities can recruit disciples and influence ""believers"", which generate inspiration (skill exp) daily. Power also generate random text events which involve stat checks of the disciples at that power. Correctly addressing the issue will generate believers or resources.

[h1]Annoyances[/h1]
[list]
[*]Assigning work is difficult. You can tell them to be a logger and cut trees, but after that, they do whatever you allow them to.
[*]You cannot restrict areas where you don't want them to be
[*]Item filters are not as granular as Rimworld
[*]Hard to manually control characters. They will immediately go back to what they were doing.
[*]The music is good, but for 90% of the game, I am sitting in silence
[*]You can't really hear sound effects unless you are fully zoomed in
[*]Your character stops attacking enemies once they are unconscious. There is no reason not to kill them as far as I know.
[*]Cannot force an outer disciple to work on a specific task
[*]Too much trial and error in this game and requires you to seek the community for answers. For example, there is an event where an elf shows up, and you would never know what to do with it unless ask or look it up.
[*]Majority of the money you make comes from selling stuff for 1 at high quantity. This needs to be reworked. Too many items sell for just 1.
[*]A lot of RNG and stat checks in the world map events
[*]If you have an iron item in queue to be crafted but you have no iron, that queue is stuck until you get iron. It will not attempt to craft the next item in queue.",1603487166,1603507515,True,74,3,0.841652154922485352,1,True,False,True

This game could be categorized under this genre but different even better in some aspects.

首先，我很喜欢休闲模拟器的玩法，也认为他的游戏世界广度惊人。

我想如果可以在建造门派时可以改变地形例如，例如墙可以累高建造多层建筑或者在矿石上建筑会使得游戏的门派建造方面深度及游戏寿命大大增加。

然后如果可以在在世仙人和元神，金丹之间多一些境界感觉也会好玩很多。毕竟我相信很多玩家汇集那个自己代入自创的第一个角色，一个在世真仙然后人就没了，让人很没有动力。
有时哪怕游戏设计很好，玩家也看到了也觉得哦，有新的事情可以做，哦，这还有一个高端玩法，但是因为自己代入得角色没了大大减少了代入感所以可能就不去触发了。
还有如果说金丹期以下的弟子也可以转入外门也可以怎多很多游戏的玩法，尤其是后期，来的敌人动不动就元神期买一个不注意工具人都没了。
作为一个模拟器如果可以让玩家代入的角色和世界产生更多互动可能会比以为增加现在已经很广的游戏世界广度更加重要。",1598892619,1598893976,True,1,1,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,True

The learning curve of this game is long and hard to climb,you will need help from community. I'm not sure how well the English community of this game is. If you can't find one, good luck.
But when you learn how to manage your sect after early-game(after you have first golden core realm character), an entire brave new world is open to you. 
The first hour of the game is very much like Rimworld, don't let that fool you. In this game, your purpose is to build a strong sect and (at least let some of your character) achieve immortality,not survive. To do so you need carefully build strong characters depends on their various functions, travel through distant bizarre territory to look for rare material and medicine which you character needs to break through the next realm. You also need to build better equipment, research their function and make sure they fit your need(this game's equipment system follows a very different logic compares to other games).
 There are much more.  This game has a system depth I rarely see through my years of game experience. And they all works, unlike many other early stage games on steam.

It didn't take much to get sucked into this game. At first I felt like this was a more decorated rimworld and then found myself taken aback when I saw some of the interactions -- you are essentially building a ""sect"", which is made up of mundane laborers called outer disciples and esoteric, mystical characters called inner disciples which you can promote characters who have been cultivating their qi sufficiently to.

Building your village feels very similar to other colony sim style games, albeit with slightly worse interaction ui. (It would be nice to be able to select a character and then click-command them instead of selecting the items directly and assigning the character.) This is a minor nuisance however and the feng shui system makes base building very fun, rewarding clever placement of objects within their respective places. To cultivate qi efficiently and safely, your disciples need to be somewhere they are compatible with. The five elements help you determine what is needed in a room for it to be both balanced and geared towards the type of cultivation being done.

I am still learning but from what I see so far, this game has spectacular potential and with an official english localization coming, I expect this will have a huge mod community on the EN side of things. The workshop already looks well populated by the home community for this game.

这个游戏有很多地方可圈可点。首先题材真的是中国非常火爆的题材。修仙游戏的潜力真的是难以估量，但是同时在这个庞大的题材里面如何的把游戏做好，做细，做完善  也是一个很大的挑战。

首先说一下跟rimworld相似的问题。确实太相似了，所以才引起很多人的质疑。不过这并不影响“修模” 成为一个好的游戏。这点其实可以多玩玩rimworld来吸取一些经验。实在是太多细节上的东西做的不完善。比如水放在冷的地方低于-1度为什么不结冰？ 高于100度为什么不蒸发？ 衣服放在寒冰锭旁边为什么还会466天腐烂？ 为什么明明有水缸，却说你缺水，而且有人会快要渴死？工作的安排为什么在小人怠工的时候不能改变？出门历练为什么必须要回到老家才能再出发去另一个地方？历练的事件为什么那么少？内门不能干粗活饿死渴死这种大部分人提过的，就不一一列出了。 简单的来讲，就是细节做的太粗糙甚至完全没有，需要很多的时间去慢慢的打磨。

如果没有对rimworld的代入感的话，这个游戏做的就完全不扣题了。修仙模拟器，为什么更多的是在种田 伐木 挖矿？ 12/24/36给小人想必有些人永远都无法变成内门？ 目前来看，游戏如果以修仙为核心的话，那就要更多的去做修仙的内容，而现在修仙的内容就只有1 置放调心情，2置放修行，3置放历练。 这能叫游戏核心吗？ 你说风水系统有意思，这个我同意，可现在这系统能当核心玩吗？你说炼丹炼宝有意思，可是炼出来以后是用来做什么的？ 还是修行， 防老家被打， 历练---可这些内容太缺乏了。 整体游戏内容还是集中在生存上。核心不正确这就是一个很大的问题了，当初设计的时候，是想着以修仙为主的话，就不要往经营类去拱。搞得这玩的是修仙，还是生存？

必须要吐槽的是，最初18刀真的是血贵啊！可是下载的时候才233mb！真的是坑爹啊！而且那个新手模式还贼浪费时间，还说什么后期有两点。 分明就是想混过前两个小时，然后不退款吧。
真的，可以吐槽的点简直太多了。所以我并不认为你们是被坏人刷屏了。 群众的眼睛是雪亮的。 是好游戏群众肯定是会认可的，相反不是好游戏大家肯定也会猛喷。。。 与在没有凭据的情况下其抱怨什么被刷屏，不如做好自己本分的东西把后面的更新做好，做细。

不退款也罢，这个游戏还是可以继续做下去的，我很期待后面的补救。 毕竟rimworld刚开始也是烂泥一滩来来回回更新了2，3年，经历了将近20个大的更新今年才开始正式出售出售。太污，河洛刚开始也都是很坎坷。 不过真的要好好想明白这个游戏的核心在哪里，然后再去补救和开发。 好好的去做上3年更新吧，只要用心去做，一定会得到认可的！",1547515100,1547515100,False,108,15,0.477220118045806885,0,True,False,True

例如
1）经典模式创建人物时，随机性太高，我能理解属性随机可增加游戏趣味，但是建议增加人物捏脸系统，还有一些属性调度的系统（这里说的属性是年龄）。因为当你要创建你所想要的角色时，只能在那边按随机roll到你想要的角色为止，但是属性和人物的建造不能分开，当你终于roll到你想要的属性可是，角色的模板不是你想要的，比如说我想要个很有仙气味道的角色模板，但系统就给个肥胖的矮子我，不然就是年龄已经过半40几岁开局，然后有完美情节的玩家就会像我一样，重新roll角色直到roll到想要的人物模板/年龄/属性为止，roll了半天就开始觉得枯燥不想玩了。
-- 属性随机没问题，但是请把捏脸系统和年龄调度分开

2）建筑系统说真的已经几乎接近完美无可挑剔，但是希望后期增加建设方向旋转模式，因为所有工作台等等全部都是向北边，感觉很别扭。对不起以上都是强迫症玩家的意见。

3）食物系统，耕田等等的系统已经完美了，但是动物打猎就差一点，除非你是大地图。不然动物很快被你打完，就没食物了，要到隔壁村拿真的很麻烦，还有游戏里有湖畔河流，但是角色却不能钓鱼。。。。

但是作者一直认为这个一个全新的游戏，可为什么连这个游戏的重点都没有关注呢？仅仅的抄袭是没有用的。
我认为这个应该是一个武侠＋修仙的游戏，那这个的游戏重点应该是在“江湖”以及“修仙”上，而不是“建造”及“生存”，从进游戏的那一刻我就觉得这个还是一个“减肉”版的环世界，而不是修仙，我不想整天在修仙武侠里造房子，采集材料这个统统不是重点。
我想看到的是一个模拟的“江湖”，更多的应该在探索，修炼，交互及事件上下功夫。从弱小到强大，可以成为一派之主号令众多弟子，也能成为一人走江湖等等。。对不起这个和我想象的相差太多，无论这个游戏是否“抄袭”“借鉴”统统都不是问题，但是在模式上请不要和环世界一样，为什么经典模式一定要３个人呢？为什么一定模式一样呢？
这个游戏却根本没有带给玩家那种感觉。可能作者觉得骗骗玩家的钱太容易了吧。反正换换皮就有人买单的，毕竟玩家都不缺钱。（不然还会在STEAM上买游戏）",1547214379,1547223586,False,139,11,0.479289650917053223,5,True,False,True
