However, that's precisely what makes this game so captivating to me.

The game begins with your character arriving in a city that soon gets destroyed. It's easy to wander off without a quest, but if you do pick up the main quest—to find a secret human settlement—you're on your own. There are no waypoints or modern conveniences to guide you; it's all about your exploration skills and interactions with other characters. You can even betray the human settlement to an orc, effectively sabotaging your main quest line.

The game doesn't hold your hand. If you're tasked with finding crates on the coast, you might have to search the entire coastline, as there are no markers to pinpoint their location. Similarly, if you're sent to retrieve sacks of grain and one is missing, you have to figure out what happened to it, whether it was stolen by a bandit or something else. This old-school charm is a huge reason why I recommend this game.

You're a nobody in this world, and you carve out your own story and alliances. You can kill anyone, even main characters, without the game stopping you because they're ""too important."" As time goes on, I believe this game has aged like fine wine, becoming better rather than worse.

I give it a solid 8/10. It's a refreshing departure from the hand-holding of modern titles and offers a truly immersive experience.

For those experiencing issues with their mouse not working, it seems to be a Windows 10 problem.

Some people say that this game is trash and not worth enough to be a gothic chapter. But i want you to change your mind. This piece of art is better than any existing game, and you will see why.
1) graphics. Literally the best looking game ever. You can look at characters for hours, the mighty cities of Myrtana can blow your brains out. 
2) combat. If anyone asks you what game has the best combat system you insta reply: GOTHIC 3. You will enjoy every encounter, every battle is unique expirience. Cast magic, shoot enemies or cut them in melee combat - you decide.
3) Story. Right here we have the most interesting realisting and long story in the history of videogames. Quests in towns can keep you entertained for months of gameplay, and main story can make you cry... becasue it's beautiful...
4) Bugs and glithces... there are none if them... just install game and play...
So we see that Gothic 3 is masterpiece. unfortunately this gem of coding got too many hate from gothic 1-2 fanatics...

I distinctly remember feeling that classic initial sense of awe and wonder. Khorinis was just a small island; we’re on a big continent now. So many locations to explore, so many things to do! And hot daymn, the music, the atmosphere! Just going to a city and sitting on a bench while rotating the camera around feels so fulfilling, somehow!

I also distinctly remember trudging along some snowy paths 50-60 hours later and getting struck by a thought: wait a sec, I’m not having fun anymore, at all. What’s with this feeling of diminishing returns? Why is the main story still almost non-existent? What’s the point of so many settlements when all of them are just siding with a faction to slaughter another faction? How come every new northern cave simply houses one more horde of orcs to mow down via a dumbed-down combat? When did this immersive world become so repetitive and shallow?

Looking back, that’s not nearly the worst thing an open-world RPG can do. At the very least, Gothic 3 had some strong cards; it just played them all at once and then sat with an empty hand awkwardly. It’s still a better Piranha Bytes effort than, say, Risen 2, where jank and mediocrity reigned supreme from the start. But after the pure brilliance of Gothic 2, which combined rewarding open-ended exploration with properly conclusive single-player experience so confidently, this was quite a party pooper.

Also, considering it’s been 15+ years, I hesitate to guess how Gothic 3 might feel to an average player today, especially with a number of community-made improvements that got released since then.

I constantly find myself having to look up something because the game doesn't tell me what I should do. For example, Ancient knowledge, i had no idea that i needed this to cast spells, so what I did was just spec everything into mana and then get confused as to why i cannot use any spells.

Do Gothica 3 usiadłam z powrotem po kilku latach przerwy. Nie odczuwałam ochoty ponownego ogrania tej części tak samo jak ma to miejsce w przypadku Gothica 1 i 2. Wracając po latach do Gothica 3 nie byłam w stanie grać w czystą wersje prosto ze Steama dłużej niż 5 godzin. Pobrałam więc i zainstalowałam Mod Packa, który polepszył mocno jakość rozgrywki, jednak nadal nie była to gra na miarę prawdziwego Gothica. Jestem mocno rozczarowana tą częścią z następujących powodów:
[list]
[*]Trzecia część zrywa z dorobkiem poprzedniczek, zarówno jeśli chodzi o konstrukcje rozgrywki jak i LORE. Tzw. fabuła główna jest dosyć znikoma i opiera się przede wszystkim na znalezieniu Xardasa i opowiedzeniem się za jednym z trzech Bogów: Innosa, Adanosa i Beliara. Poza tym mamy frakcje: buntownicy, orkowie, assasyni i nordmarczycy. Zdobywamy u nich punkty reputacji poprzez robienie powtarzalnych questów typu: przynieś, podaj pozamiataj. Zadania tego typu, których Gothic 3 jest pełen mocno mnie nużyły i miałam ochotę jak najszybciej je zrobić, aby mieć to z głowy. Zdecydowanie błędem było porzucenie podziału gry na rozdziały, brak wyraźnej i dobrze rozpisanej fabuły głównej oraz zwrotów akcji. Boli też to, że na całą grę jest tylko jedna cutscenka na początku, co jest sporą wadą dla gry rozpoznawalnej z epickich przerywników filmowych. 

[*]Spora niespójność w kwestii LORE względem dwóch poprzednich części. Beliar nie jest już niebezpiecznym Bogiem śmierci i zniszczenia. Ludzie i orkowie normalnie go wyznają nie tracąc przy tym rozumu i wolnej woli. Nawet nasz bohater może oddać się w jego służbę, co patrząc na dwie poprzednie części, gdzie walczyliśmy ze złem jest wyjątkowo nielogiczne. Do tego orkowie zachowują się jak ludzie. Możemy z nimi po ludzku rozmawiać, a ich głównym motywem są bogactwo i władza, a nie zniszczenie gatunku ludzkiego. To po prostu ludzie z orkową skórką. 

[*]Niestety nieodłączny element serii, czyli walka także nie należy do mocnych stron tej gry. Walka w zwarciu polega na ciągłym naciskaniu lewego przycisku myszy. Co potrafi dosyć szybko znużyć. Porzucono także genialny system magii z poprzednich części oparty na runach i magicznych kręgach na rzecz ""prastarej magii"" i generycznego rzucania wcześniej wyuczonych zaklęć. 

[*]Wyrzucenie do śmieci wątku czterech przyjaciół: Diego, Miltena, Gorna i Lestera. Nie przypominają siebie z poprzednich części ani w wygladzie ani w zachowaniu. Już na początku gry po wyzwoleniu Ardei każdy z nich idzie w swoją stronę. Można ich potem spotkać w różnych lokacjach, ale nie mają większej roli niż inne NPC w grze. Są bo są w danej lokacji, dają nam questa i po jego wykonaniu możemy ich ze sobą zabrać. Co można poczytać jako zaletę, ale przez całą naszą podróż chodzą za nami jak typowe generyczne NPC. Nie dodają nic od siebie do historii, ani nie reagują w jakiś wyjątkowy sposób na to co się dzieje. Nie ma też z nimi żadnych zapadających w pamięć questów. A wielka szkoda, bo wątek przyjaźni z Diegiem, Miltenem, Gornem i Lesterem jest jednym z najbardziej lubianych. To co zrobiono z nimi w Gothicu 3 smuci. 
[/list]
Podsumowując niestety Gothic 3 nie jest zwieńczeniem serii jakiej bym oczekiwała. Brakuje tu wyraźnie zarysowanej fabuły, za dużo jasnego i bajkowego klimatu oraz ciekawego przedstawienia postaci zarówno tych nowych i z poprzednich części. Gothic 3 zasługuje na pełny Reboot, którego jako wielka fanka serii mam nadzieje kiedyś doczekać. 


[h1]My opinion about Gothic 3[/h1]
After a break of several years, I Player Gothic 3 again. I don't feel the desire to play this game again like I do with Gothic 1 and 2. When I returned to Gothic 3 after a few years, I was unable to play the pure Steam version for more than 5 hours. So I installed Mod Pack for Gothic 3, which significantly improved the quality of the game, but it still wasn't the gameplay I expected from real Gothic game. I'm very disappinted with this game because of:
[list]
[*]The third part breaks with the achievements of its predecessors, both in terms of gameplay strukturę and LORE. The main plot is minimalistic and based only on finding Xardas and choosing the path one of the three Gods: Innos, Adanos or Beliar. Besides that, we have factions: rebels, orcs, assassins and nordmarians. We gain reputation points from them for completing repeatable questa such as: bring, serve, sweep. These types of tasks, which Gothic 3 is full of, were very boring to me and I wanted to complete them as quickly as possible to get it over with. It was definitely a mistake to abandon the division of the game into chapters, the lack of a clear and well-written main plot and no plot twists. It also hurts that there is only one cutscene at the beginning of entire game, which is a great disadvantage for a game recognizable from epic cutscenes that highlight the importance of memorable events in the game.

[*]A significant inconsistency in terms of LORE compared to the previous games. Beliar is no longer a dangerous God of death and destruction. Humans and orcs normally worship him without losing their reason and free will. Even our hero can put himself in his service, which is extremely illogical considering the two previous parts, where we fought against evil. Moreover orcs behave and speak like humans. Their main motivation is wealth and power, not the destruction of the human race. They're just people with orc skin.

[*]Unfortunately, an inherent element of the series, i.e. combat, is also not of this game's strong points. Melee combat involves constantly pressing the left mouse button. Which get boring quite quickly. The brilliant magic system from the previous parts based on runes and magic circles was also abandoned in favor of ancient magic and generic casting of previously learned spells.

[*]Throwing away the plot of four friends: Diego, Milten, Gorn and Lester. They don't resemble them selves from the previous parts, neither in appearance nor in behavior. At the beginning of the game, after the liberation of Ardea, each of them went his own way. They can be found in various locations, but they have no greater role to play than other NPCs in the game. They are there because they are there, they give us a quest and after completing it we can take them with us. Which I see as an advantage, but they follow us around like typical generic NPCs throughout our journey. They don't contribute anything of themselves to the story, nor do they react in a unique way to what's happening. There are no interesting tasks with them either. This is a huge waste of potential of the friendship thread with Diego, Milten, Gorn and Lester. What happened to them in Gothic 3 is very sad.
[/list]
To sum up, unfortunately Gothic 3 is not the culmination od the series that I would have expected. It lacks a clearly outlined plot, too bright, fairy-tale atmosphere and an uninteresting presentation of both new and old characters. Gothic 3 deserves a full Reboot, which, as a huge fan of the series, I hope to see someday.",1705271266,1705276212,False,9,1,0.55064237117767334,2,True,False,False

I had heard all the bad about this game years ago so I was prepared to take it for what it is, which did help make it a better experience for me, but it falls short in key aspects. It's not a good Gothic game. Gothic 1 and 2 were so good at having a compact but densely detailed map you got very familiar with, along with characters you got to know very well, and the story, locations, characters and quests were interconnected. This game is structured more like an MMORPG, where you run around a huge open world, doing checklist-style quests delivered by characters that rarely have more dialogue than just telling you about the wolf skins they want. You simply don't get to know or care about any characters in this game, not even the recurring ones that you knew very well in previous games. The story is also so thin that it's almost fitting how abrupt and unsatisfying the ending is. And then you have the awful combat. Melee combat feels so unresponsive and awkward, and makes you want to rip your hair out when your attacks are super slow while most monsters have instant attacks. It almost feels like the game tries to warn you it's bad when the intro instantly drops you into a large scale fight. The mistake the player could think here is that it probably gets better, but it doesn't really. You can bypass most of the combat frustration by playing as a mage, but it's barely viable early game due to a lack of mana and needing to frontload all your stats into the mage stats to even unlock the fireball spell. Oh, and you're gonna be using that fireball spell almost exclusively the entire game. 

Despite all of this I had a decent time with this game, largely in thanks to the open world of Gothic 3. Huge open worlds tend to be pretty bland and uninteresting, but the world in this game is very well designed and makes you want to explore it. You can tell that most of the hard work went into making the world, while everything else suffered when development issues arose. It's also wild to think about the fact that this game came out around the same time as Oblivion but this one has no loading screens whatsoever. I actually really like the setting with the orcs having conquered the towns, and that you need to gain their trust to overturn them later. There's a lot of untapped potential here of course, but this is still one of the most successful aspects of the game (until it isn't anymore lmao). The soundtrack is also sublime, though it suffers from tracks changing constantly. 

I recommend playing this game for what it does well, but at the same time I also recommend just skipping it to not experience the bad parts.",1705263749,1705263749,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gothic 3 was the first game I have ever played in the series. As a kid, I received this game via one of these CD´s with games they sometimes include in gaming magazines. Mind you I played an unpatched version of this game and had no clue about the previous instalments, so my enjoyment was rather limited. So, I thought I give it a go again after playing the previous games, knowing beforehand it’s not as good as them.

[u] Gameplay[/u] 
Contrary to previous instalments this one is a true open world rpg. The gist of the game is that you move to the next city searching for clues where Xardas is, while either supporting the rebels or the orcs. 
The idea of choosing one side wasn’t too bad initially I thought. Fighting over each city was fun while getting reputation to be able to get help for the final showdown of each city

This ends up in you trying to do as many quests as you can for both. Because more rewards and xp. It’s not like a lot of quests actually involve fighting directly against one faction but mostly giving you general quests that have no involvement with the other party whatsoever.

This game features a lot more quests than any of the previous games. Like a LOT more. I had dozens of quests in my backlog and not the fun kind. Some quests are alright, but others are just plain utter garbage. 
In the first two games it was rather rare for you to have you grind for anything, the game rarely wanted you to pick x amount of item. This time you not only have to collect 12 chalices as part for one of the three endings, but for every ending you at least need 5 artefact pieces ontop of that requiring you to free every city or destroy all rebel camps for two of the three endings. These items aren’t marked on the map and not often very apparent where they are. Oh, before I forget, in order to get two of the 5 artefacts you need to get 10 keys…

and so on and so on. Its okay if you have a simple task like collect 5 pieces that take up the entire game while leading you to new places with fun activities to do. But this game was later just a chore. It wasn’t too bad in the first half but especially in the desert I was just exhausted and forced myself to finish the game. I’m not the type of person who loves games that you can’t beat without looking up a guide.
It just feels like they made the map first then crammed in a lot of filler quests afterwards as they knew they didn’t have the time to properly write dialogue and script. 

That’s just the exploring. Combat is the worst it ever was. Playing a mage is the only real way to go, melee combat is less fun than it ever was. Upgrading weapon styles no longer adds new animations, the standard swing is just a laughable infinite spam attack. The easiest way to get trough the early game is, I kid you not, take your fists. 

Enemies (especially animals) spam attacks as fast as they can because they have no reset animation. It’s the worst combat I have ever seen in any game. Its just about who can stun lock someone first, enemies often randomly can punch you back despite being stun locked. 

On the other hand, I liked that they overhauled the ranged combat. Bow and crossbow now work very well via manual aiming and I found them that good that I used them a lot in early game to cheese stronger battles. You can also freely choose every class type you want which I disliked a lot, being a mage was always a lot of work and paid off very well, people even respected you more in gothic 2.

[u]Story[/u] 
It’s a complete mess. You start off in a city being enslaved by orcs, you fight against them and free the city but right after that you can choose to work for the orcs and defeat the rebellion if you want to. That makes no sense altogether. Back then you had factions that each had their own reason to exist and why you should join them. Now its plain good vs evil and do you want to be the first or latter.

Your hero now having lost all his old powers is also not explained. He does not start with 0 but still has problems fighting wild animals in the bushes but simple orcs are fine?

I found every ending complete garbage, the canon ending even more so. The main character is a zynical and sarcastic that will comment on most cases in one way or another. Most of his personality is gone. On every quest line he will mostly repeat the thing the guy asks for again, then afterwards your only option is to accept or not. Sometimes there are even decisions to be made, with almost no repercussions in the long run except sometimes getting favour with an opposing faction. Don’t let me even start how awful the dialogues are now.

[u]Aesthetics [/u] 
The one thing that stood out to me is the very orchestral OST. Now the soundtrack is loud, in the foreground all the time and could have been that you hear in the lord of the rings, especially the combat theme even samples something from there. Its totally not bad I actually really liked it. But due to the OST not being that ambient anymore, you notice it. Over a 40 hour long game.

The iconic scavengers don’t screech like a chicken anymore. For real? Also there is for some reason only a single woman that has any quests or dialogue with you. Weird.

Also the graphics didn’t age that well compared to its gothic 1 and 2. Everything looks very shiny and bright. Altough the forest is filled with lots of plants, houses have lots of furniture and various object lay around. Design wise its still pretty good, especially for people who like lots of detail.

[u]Conclusion/TL;DR [/u] 
The whole game became just a bland below average open world RPG, everything that stood out in the old games became worse or got completely removed. Especially the tedious fetch quests, awful and unfair combat, and most of all a very shallow and boring world to explore. I barely managed to get myself to finish the game, no less would I ever recommend it to anyone. Altough i must admit i did enjoy most of my time because the presentation is still as good as it always was. And if you insist on playing it for completionist sake like me, play without alternative balancing, tick the alternative ai and play it on medium difficulty as a mage and you will have a decent time.

PS: The german soundfiles are not aviable anymore, they need to be downloaded somewhere in the internet and then in the ini file you need to change the language to german. I have never seen in a game before that you cant get the soundfiles anymore via steam.

Broken RPG that is even with its patches a less than mediocre experience.",1641010965,1705145257,False,7,0,0.501284003257751465,0,True,False,False

The concept of this game is to freely roam an enormous world in which a player acquires reputations, completes fetch or kill quests, farms gold, and slaughters anything that moves. 

All of these activities are simple in design: monsters and quests award experience which advances a player’s level -- a level grants *learning points* which allow for acquisitions of new skills and investment into attributes such as strength, alchemy, or health and endurance. As even the most diligent players are unlikely to find enough resources to get past level 80, learning points are a rare commodity.

A prudent player thus ought to invest points into a singular build: that of a warrior, mage, or a hunter. While some builds are noticeably more powerful than others, all of them eventually become stale and boring. Why? Gothic 3’s combat is straightforward and simplistic. It involves no dodging or strategy other than utilising the Genome engine’s weak spots in order to cheat. *Melee* fights revolve either around stun-locking or abusing a weapon’s range, *archery* is all about releasing arrows while backpedalling, and while abound with lots of intriguing spells, *sorcerers* have little reason to use any spell other than a basic fireball.

Worse than the monotony is the script. The Gothic universe rests upon its world-building, which includes fantasy, politics, and psychology -- all of which come across as half-baked, vacuous, and underwhelming in Gothic 3. Dialogues are mostly dry and vapid; the few characters who happen to have personality are not given much space. Whatever interaction there is with others serves solely to advance quests or to obtain information about their objectives.

And yet, there is a -- to me -- unprecedented sense of freedom within this game’s world. Virtually everyone can be killed. At any time, any place is accessible. Quests can be completed in any order. Blind ventures bring about unexpected discoveries, even after multiple playthroughs.

Because of its flawed design, Gothic 3 is not a game I could recommend to everyone. But I *would* recommend it to someone who enjoys slow and steady progress, slow-paced combat, collecting items, and exploration. Those are the aspects which define this game.",1586987731,1704130652,True,3,0,0.571567654609680176,0,True,False,False

Memes aside. Time for an actual review...

So for context i'm not one of those who grew up with gothic, in england the game is non existent. But i learnt this series from a streamer and decided to give it a go because it was hilarious seeing him get screwed over by people in Khornis harbor.

Over 200 hours later i have beaten the trilogy, and my thoughts... Well i love this series, i can understand why the germans/polish adore it so much, with such great characters, world building, RPG elements and story. Gothic 3 has its fare share of issues but its still a decent and fun game. I was really invested in the world so i was excited to see Myertana for the first time after spending so much time in Khorinis. Seeing king Rhobar after all this time and visiting old friends from the colony.

Just a shame really after this game, PB don't really make a game to rival the first 3 gothic games, apart from Risen 1. I just pray the Gothic 1 remake turns out to be really good.",1695735614,1697676949,True,1,0,0.503672659397125244,0,True,False,False

Description:
An unofficial Update Pack for Gothic 3 Enhanced Edition v1.75 (a.k.a. Update Pack) is an attempt to fix various errors remaining after the release of the last official patch for Gothic 3 v1.75, as well as make some improvements for the players and innovations for modders.

For example, the Update Pack added the ability to block the attacks of various animals, expanded quick loot feature, improved alternative camera, hero and NPCs can say more SVM phrases, etc. For those who don't like the added by Community Patch Team in v1.75 armor textures and materials from the ""Forsaken Gods"" add-on, it is possible to bring back the original armor textures and materials. For owners of the Russian version of the game is also available Russian speech update and a replacement for the unoptimized for Windows x64 Gothic3.ttf font to the default Comic Sans MS.

A complete list of changes made by this Update Pack described in detail in the Gothic_3_v1.75_Update_Pack_v1.04_Changelog_En.txt file.

Installation Notes:
Update Pack should be installed after installing the official patch for Gothic 3 v1.75.14 and before the installation of any modifications. You should start a new game to activate all the changes.

Compatibility:
Update Pack is fully compatible with the majority of known modifications such as Questpaket, Content Mod, Consequences, LCTM and others.

Note: Some fixes may not be available in modifications, because they are overwritten by the modification, especially fixes in info-files and stringtable. Therefore it is recommended to install the ""UpdatePack_SupportMod"" (which you may find in the installed Update Pack folder) with Mod-Starter over other modifications.

I've just finished (again) Gothic 2 in Gold Classic Edition and it's still as good (in terms of story telling and overall rpg-experience) and as bad (in terms of tech, ergonomy, bugs) than it was 12 or so years ago. After that, I guess I wanted more of this revival from my old days of RPG gaming;) Then, I saw the editor just making sales on the Gothic serie as they are announcing the revamped version of Gothic 1. A good opportunity to purchase the steam version of Gothic 3, so I thought. 

But, BEWARE. The last 3 hours after donwloading the game, I didn't spend on gaming. Nope. I spent it on launching a faulty game, visiting forums, downloading patches, uninstalling, reinstalling, tweaking the settings, restarting the game over and over again. Just how can the Editor allow himself to promote a game on Steam for which clearly nothing, absolutely nothing has been done to make the game even playable without the help of the Community. Shame on you. The Gothic serie deserves clearly better than that even after a generation of gaming.

So, let's make this clear, PyranhaBites did some of the best RPGs in terms of immersion and story-telling with the Gothic serie. Despite for all its sins (and there are many) there's some magic going on I can not really explain, that makes you want to continue. Something very addictive that made the serie cult.

Want to enjoy Gothic 3 ? Is it possible at all in 2023 ? I'd say 'YES' or 'MAY BE'. Let me give you a few tips from my experience to (may be) have this magic happen for you also... before you simply get frustrated and ask for a refund.

MAKE THIS GAME WORK ON WINDOWS 10 (TESTED) - Step-by-step procedure:
1) LANGUAGE: As briefly exposed above, the Steam version is a scam. There's no real steam-support apart from the launcher in this game. The game does not update correctly languages packs. So, to put this short, the language you download is the language you will use. Twisting the ini files of the game after downloading will give you a headhache and simply create bugs, so read me here:

To download the version language you want to play, FIRST set your steam-client (interface) to this language. Of course, a language supported by the game;) Then, restart Steam.
Then download Gothic 3 which will install in this language by default.

2) APPLY COMMUNITY PATCH
Yes, you did read well. Without the help of the Community this game would never have seen the post-2015 Internet. Based on the last official patch from 2015, the latest community update will allow you to simply play the game at all. Fixing loads of issues starting with simple key bindings, And the (long) list you can figure by yourself when visiting own of the adepts community forums.
The patch you are looking for is called 'Gothic_3_EE_Patch_v1.75.14_Int_Full'. I don't want to share external links here but look for the official community forum. The language might be german, but the patch is INTL and will work for all languages of the game. It will keep with the default language installed (please refer to point 1)

3) KEY BINDINGS
The default Key bindings are broken in this game. Don't ask me, I didn't investigate further. Fact is the default assignement of key don't trigger anything (at least for all code execution - read character controls). So, in order to fix this, after having gone through steps 1 and 2 above, the next thing to do is to go to the key bindings. Select custom and click on the 'custom' text in GUI to edit. Then, one by one, edit all keys controlling the character (move, attack, jump, run, select ability, etc...). Realize that when doing this, the app eventually tells you that the key is already in use, despite the fact that it is the same key for the same action. That sort of gives you a clue to how much this thing has been f***ed with;)
Save your custom KB and to make sure they are applied and kept, quit the game and restart.

4) GRAPHICS
Let's make this clear. Performance, optimization and the handling of memory resources has never been a strength of the dev studio. That's an understatement. When you first start the game today even with a medium setting, the game lags like shit. The main reason for that is a weird choice made in the defaults to push a fancy post-process that soaks-up all resources and doesn't even look good. Read 'BLOOM' This useless piece of PP causes to double all drawcalls that are already too high and is simply a killer for performance, Absolutely remove this. From the profiles, choose 'CUSTOM'. Then, same as for key bindings, click on the 'custom' text to edit the profile. Where 'BLOOM' either disable or push the slider to the far right to enable 'HDR'. Although, to be honest (I didn't investigate) but I don't think there are many PBR textures in this old game that would take advantage of HDR. In which case, HDR would simply brighten the texture. I chose to disable it.

Also, make some tests with viewing objects details and distance. Given how some objects are done, I prefer to show a longer distance (less clipping and blur) and a less detailed object (barely noticeable). But that's for you to try and find the best balance.

With that, you should be good to go. At least, you should be able to have your controls working, complete quests and experience the game more or less as it should be.
One more thing, as I said the game is technically a piece of s**t. While uncovering the environment, textures and other stuff pile-up in the memory eventually leading to a memory-leak after a couple or a few hours of gaming. When you feel the game starts to lag a bit too much, make a save, quit and restart.

Also, for the saves and loaded save games. Make saves often but DON'T DIE;) Loading a save game takes ages. It's as it would load new the entire environment!!! Loading save games in Gothic 2 takes mere seconds. Here, in Gothic 3, I usually get myself a drink or a smoke;)

Now, if you manage to go through all this, you will eventually be rewarded with one of the best RPG-gaming experience in the history of gaming. Of course, my opinion only.",1692105993,1692106583,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Bugs and performance issues are crippling for sure, but they are not even the reason I am not recommending this; the story is simplistic and presented to you in a boring unsatisfying manner; the combat is mostly mindless and annoying, the animations are sluggish, the progression of your character feels stunted by the constant barriers in skill level that serve no other purpose than to slow the game down.
The music is good, I guess, and the world LOOKS good, but it does NOT feel alive.

Positives:
- A fantastic soundtrack, that whilst sometimes being repetitive (the combat music!!) helps immerse the player in the world
- A very unique game, it feels completely different to other RPGs 
- Nameless hero makes immersive narrative easy as you can put yourself in his shoes
- A huge amount of quests to complete, whilst many quests are similar I loved pretty much all of them regardless
- Easy to learn levelling system complete with perk points and a trainer feature where you need to use your gold to pay people to teach you the skills, which makes sense as how can you learn them by yourself
- Fully voiced dialogue that, whilst being very cheesy, is an achivement in itself
- A pretty good variety of weapons, spells and shields. You have bows, crossbows, axes, swords, fireball, lightning etc
- Faction system that adds some depth to the story
- The graphics are brilliant for its time and still just about hold up today
- No loading screens in the world at all, unless you die you won't have to see a loading screen
- Massive variety of enemies and enemy types
- Like with previous Gothic games enemies do not scale to your level and you really feel like you're improving throughout the game
- Literally about 60-90 hours of playtime if you want to finish it all

Mixed:
- The story is average, and whilst can be seen as exciting in parts is not wholly fleshed out. We focus more on individual cities than on the overarching story and the main antagonists and heroes do not have much screen time
- The combat can be frustrating at times, but no where near as awful as some have claimed
- Lack of quest direction can be seen as a negative for some and a positive for others who want full immersion 
- The world does not feel as alive as it could be, however there are some events that change the environment of the game such as capturing cities for either the orcs or humans 

Negatives:
- The world is so huge it becomes a problem navigating, if you want to find something or even somewhere you have previously been it can be very difficult to do so
- Some areas feel very barren and dull, such as the desert faction
- Characters we haven't seen before in the previous Gothic games have barely any personality or distinguishing features, aside from a few notables who have a unique characteristic and personality most of the characters are boring, but this is what comes of creating a world so huge instead of focusing
- Xp requirements for levelling up eventually becomes so high it's near impossible to max out

Первый раз играл в Готику 3 в 2006 году на ноутбуке Fujitsu Simens. 10 ФПС и бесконечне лаги. Тогда проходил игру целый год и так и не смог найти Ксардаса) 

Сегодня же расскажу о своем 2-х недельном прохождении игры в 2023. 

NOTA BENE: 
Играл с установленным Community Patch 1.75, Сборкой Union +, Последствиями 2.0, ВГЛ, Контент Модом и Фиксом Боевки.
+ Сложность средняя ( Высокая сложность не предполагает возможности вообще пройти игру)
+ Без альтернатвиного баланса
+ Без альтернативной боевки

Резюме:

Геймплей:
Это одна из лучших, на равне с The Elder Scrolls РПГ. Здесь есть все, что нужно РПГ в СВОБОДНОМ мире. 9 классов: Лучник, Арбалетчик, 2 Меча, Меч и Щит, Тяжелое Оружие, Копья и Посохи, Маг Света, Маг Тьмы, Друид. 

Игра вынуждает смешивать классы и качать много веток. В начале игры проще бегать с мечом и луком, но в середине уже маг самый сильный билд. Под конец выясняется, что тяжелое оружие и 2 Меча решают, а магия идет приятным бонусом к билду за мечника или бронированного тяжеловеса. 

Высокое разнообразие и самое главное ОТСУТСТВИЕ АВТОЛЕВЕЛИНГА. В конце игры становишься, действительно, легендарным бойцом. 

Графика: 
Для 2023 года выглядит нисколько не устаревшей, наоборот, смотрится очень солидно и красиво. Гамма шикарная. Моды позволяют еще лучше раскрыть мир и добавить массу приятных деталей. Очень красивая игра. 

Музыка:
Шедевр. Напомните мне игру с музыкой хотя бы на уровне Готики? Огромное число композиций. Мод добавляет музыку из 1 и 2 частей. 

Сюжет:
Контент мод и последствия + ВГЛ повышают разнообразие квестов и глубину сюжета, вводят множество новых квестов и отдельных веток. Игру можно играть и после завершения всех основных сюжетных линий. Lively Towns Mod делает это возможным. 

Оригинальный сюжет тоже крайне интересен и умело обыгран. Есть 3 основных концовки. Твой выбор каждый раз влияет на будущее. Для игры 2006 года это сильно. 

Оценка: 
Да ностальгическая, да с учетом множества модификаций и доработок, но заслуженная 10/10 в жанре РПГ + Фентези и 8/10 в целом как игра. В этой игре есть душа. Прошла проверку временем, а с годами стала только лучше, нисколько не растеряв первоначального шарма. Очень надеюсь когда-нибудь сыграть в Настоящую Готику 4 от Пираний.

I will never forget the first moments when I walked the plains of Ardea, entered the first rebel hideout cave to see battle weary rebels in dire need of help and support. Then night came while I was approaching Cape Dun and the wolves start howling making it a bit scary. The moonlight was also wonderful with a slight blueish color and shadowing most of the  objects. I think the most important factor in creating this atmosphere was the music. Kai Rosenkranz is not given enough credit imo.
Around the time when it was released, I went to  college but couldn't wait for vacations to get home and play the game. I even preferred it over Oblivion (which may not make sense for some of you). Since then, I played it several times like crazy.
To write a whole review here would be long and redundant because I will say what most of other reviewers have said.

Gothic 3 is a classic RPG that has been around for quite some time. After spending a decent amount of time with it, I have a mixed opinion about the game.

On the positive side, the game has a massive open world with plenty of exploration opportunities. The world is diverse and well-designed, with unique landscapes and towns that feel alive. The character customization options are also impressive, giving players the freedom to choose their stats, skills, and gear.

The combat mechanics are decent, but they do feel clunky and sluggish at times. It takes some time to get used to the game's combat mechanics, which can be frustrating for players looking for an easy-to-learn combat system.

However, the game's biggest flaw is its bugs and technical issues. The game is notorious for its glitches and crashes, which can break the immersion and frustrate the player. Some of these issues can be fixed with mods, but it's still a hassle to install and configure them.

Another issue with the game is its lack of quest variety. Most of the quests boil down to fetch quests or kill quests, which can make the game feel repetitive after a while.

Despite these flaws, I still found myself invested in the game's story and lore. The world-building is fantastic, with interesting factions and characters that add depth to the game's lore. The game's atmosphere is also worth noting, with a dark and gritty tone that immerses the player in the game's world.

Overall, Gothic 3 is a flawed but immersive RPG experience that is worth checking out for fans of the genre. The game's world-building and atmosphere make up for its technical issues and lack of quest variety. However, players should be prepared to deal with the game's bugs and clunky combat system.",1680623846,1680623846,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But I just can't give this one a positive review. It definitely has some things to like, but really... even with community-made patches & mods, this one struggles to function.

First of all, you can't even play this game anymore unless you download community-made patches beforehand. This ""little detail"" alone should speak for itself. And I get it, it's an old game now, so developers may not be obliged to update it, but if it still costs money to buy, and it doesn't even work unless you yourself work around it(You, and the modding community), that just doesn't seem like a good game or too fair of a deal. (not to mention there are many much older games that work just fine to this day. That, or they got a patch from game creators to work. Not this one tho.).

And speaking of old or new, since day 1 this game had many, never fixed problems. Again, developers may not feel obligated to update a game if it's old, but before it ""got old"", it wasn't patched either! And there sure are things to work on and update.

To bring out a few specific examples:

-Pathfinding (And there are escort missions to do... that, and the fact that the player may want to have a companion traveling with them... And you sure can tell that it's not good, when an NPC has troubles following you whenever the terrain barely differs from a flat and empty road.)
-Also, I had multiple occurances where some NPCs glitched trough the world and I had to load the save in order to complete a quest.

-[b]Terrible optimalization[/b]. Even on today's generation of computer components, there are numerous performance issues. Crashes, stutters - regular stutters, freezes. Memory leaks. Rendering issues.
Even at its time, ""wielding"" the best gaming gear one could buy, it was awful, so it's not the software/system incompacity being the issue here. It was the problem day 1, and nothing was done about it.

-Sometimes you may get stuck initiating a conversation with an NPC, and the only way to proceed is to load your previous save (command console or F8 doesn't help either. Even if manage to 'break out' of the ""conversation freeze"" of this bug, you can't save your game anymore or talk to NPCs unless you reload the game).

-Many enemies can and will stunlock and insta-kill you. Got caught in one of the hits? = Got caught in a combo of blows that deals so much damage that you are really unlikely to survive without cheats.

-Monster hitboxes. Sometimes arrows/bolts or magic projectiles fly trough the enemy...

-From less ""bug""-oriented topic and more ""poor design choice"" oriented issues - ""Difficulty settings"". 
From what I read online, the only thing difficulty settings change is amount of damage you deal and take. 
At least in my opinion that's one of the easiest, laziest and dumbest ways to go about things. Smarter AI? Some new moves/equipment provided to NPCs? Different prices or requirements for certain things? No, just either turn enemies into total damage sponges that one-shot you, make it somewhat balanced, or basically insta-kill all enemies yourself. Sick option selection...

-NPC targeting and toggling from one to another. You try to switch targets and use a spell on the enemy to the right? Or someone inbetween them? ""How about we 'glue' your selection to just one of them even though you didn't used the ""focus mode on"", we'll act like you did so you don't have to use it""? Seriously, you can look so far to the side to try to select someone else, but the game is like ""This one? Are you sure? No I know better, you don't want to select the other, I'm not gonna swap targets! Are you crazy? Nu-uh! No swapping for you!"" Epic, especially when you try to weaken several targets from distance with one or two spell blasts to each of them, to then easily finish them off in melee... You want to swap to weaken multiple of them? How about we don't allow you to swap. Another great 'feature'.",1676220729,1676221922,False,9,0,0.635729491710662842,4,True,False,False

The game starts with you right in the middle of a grand battle, it showers you with textboxes with ""tips"" without pausing the game so you can get killed while you're still reading how to play the game, the enemies you're up against kill you in 3 hits, when they kill you you would need to quit the game to try again if you hadn't had enough foresight to save immediately after the first cutscene because the New Game option is grayed out, and the loading takes quite a while.

This is basicailly Janky german fable.The story is pretty good, but the map is too largem your stamia bar, slows down traveling, fast travel is a option if you find the travel stones, but otherwise slowly walking between towns is tedious, reminds of  lotr shadow of mordor tbh with liberating towns from the orcs. Overall its 6/10, kinda good lore, kinda intresting world, vengard is stuck under a portal to defend in from orcs, and orcs are overwhelming the humans. but combat system, just ruins it for me, too jank, too broken. i hate it.,, so broken and wonky, its dark souls like. The lore is great and gothic games are good. But this game one of major aspects is liberating towns. you either do this high level or hit and run skirmish /gorilla tactics, its so tedious, even on easy/ altertive combat turned off, its so frustating because if you get stun locked you wull get stun mobed and die, within senconds, clearly too dated to handle 1v3+ combat. I hate so deeply. its just frustating to play. This reminds of morrowind in sense of how dated it is, if you have sheer pateince to play to this, go ahead. otherwise i'd skip gothic series due to that feels right out of early 2000's with worst features of it, there a fun game to be found, but lack of mounts, limited cutscens, dull unskippable dailogue, fetch and side quests buffering out the game, wild goose chase for the iconic mage",1675616690,1675616756,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is the first game in my favorite open world fantasy genre that I played in principle, only after it I already played TES 3: Morrowind and the previous parts of Gothic.
This is the first game of this scale, the game world is simply huge even for the modern level, and back in 2006-2007 it could be explored just endlessly, the game world is incredibly beautiful and diverse, the creators of the same TES V: Skyrim were inspired by many things from this part in the future and other games on this topic. Never before have I seen such a bright and beautiful world in games, as before this game, so, in principle, until now. You just find yourself in the middle of a huge map (without, initially, the map itself) and you can go absolutely anywhere you want, explore a completely seamless world, which, in turn, with the size of this world on 2006 technologies, is still amazing, there are no loading screens in principle, even when teleporting from one end of the map to the other. You can move anywhere, climb with a thousand jumps with a quick keystroke on any almost impregnable looking mountain, I managed to bypass the guards who did not let me into the northern mountains of Nordmar simply by jumping on the mountain, although this required considerable effort, while the guards could react if on the way back you went through them.
Also in this game it was possible to kill any character at all completely and there is a special quest for this, which is also an unheard of freedom in the game, especially now. Also, many quests were passed in different ways, well, no marks on the map, they said to go to the northwest - follow the compass to the northwest.
Indescribable sensations in the forest, in the snowy mountains and in my wildly beloved wilderness. It is because of Gothic 3 that I fell in love with the desert and the desert theme, it is simply beautiful there - with oases, desert towns made of sandstone, desert animals and ancient dinosaur bones sticking out of the sand. There were moments when I just occupied one of the houses in the desert city of Mora Sul (I had to get rid of the owner, though), and just lived there, walked around the city, I liked to pretend that I really live in such a city.
Of course, my impressions should have been influenced by both the fact that I had not played such games before, and the fact that I had not played the previous parts of Gothic, which many fans had some kind of established ideas about the series, which this game does not matches. But since then, not a single game has been able to convey for me the impressions similar to those that Gothic 3 gave me. Of course, after it I went through the first 2 parts, which are excellent at the level of role-playing (although visually outdated, but it didn’t really bother me), and generally great games of their time in every sense, but they were still not so grandiose for me and didn’t capture the imagination so much with the beautiful, bright and magical world in them.
Yes, of course, there were a lot of technical problems in the 3rd part at the start. Why, even after 10 years, I could not call this game not demanding on hardware, a game without problems with frame rate (with all the community patches at that time, which, by the way, are still being released). It was almost impossible to play it, only to take a terrible problem with a crash when saving, when the save just completely broke down and no longer loaded, after which I had to start over (and this is a very long game that I played for months). But it was worth it, no matter what, I just started making two saves in different slots in turn, so that in the event of a breakdown of one, boot into the older one, and continue to enjoy it, despite bugs, crashes, friezes, no matter how many there are - they were not able to spoil my pleasure from this game.
Now, when all the bugs of the community have been painstakingly patched, this game is beautiful, even in 2023, when it is already 17 years old, even visually it looks very good. It has simply amazing music that conveys its fantasy atmosphere like no other. can no longer.
Of course, there are newer role-playing games, where the quests are deeper, with better graphics at the moment, where there were fewer bugs at the start, great music and a good atmosphere. But I have not seen where all this is found in the same aggregate as in the 3rd part of Gothic, for me, not a single game after, unfortunately, has been able to convey such an atmosphere to this day. That's why it's on the shelf in a frame.

Pros:
Great game (after to get used to it), but it's so different from gothic 1,2 and risen 1, feels more like a prequel to risen 3.
I recommend it to anyone who likes PB games and play RPG's as a puzzle rather than a on-rails adventure. 
Something to be beat with save-scumming, exploiting and hard work instead of being a well-balanced game.

Cons:
It's very buggy and janky, everything from targeting systems (I've team killed too many times), to flying enemies that you cant hit, sometimes the 'lore' dumps/expositions can get boring. The melee combat is in some aspects garbage and too punishing. The music is draining/annoying so I turned it off completely as it ruined the atmosphere. The sound balancing is garbage, by default sometimes I cant hear people talking over other sounds, the death screams are too loud etcetc.

Because my internet was out I played this for 16 hours - this was enough to get level 66 and finish the game, skipping about 40% of what the game had to offer because I was so tired of it by that point. I rushed the final sections just to get on with it.

I couldn't get enough of it either. I was willing to forgive a lot. There's a *lot* to forgive. Sadly recently I found a youtube channel showcasing how bad Gothic 3 Forsaken Gods is. The writing there is atrocious. I was like ""haha, man Gothic 3 base game was so much better, haha"". Right? . . . Right?

Well no. Actually no. Let's start with the good things because the list is shorter than I would like. The world looked rather neat on release and still kinda does. The draw distance is the biggest downside of the game but it is so poorly written it would probably make modern PCs choke and die.

I especially like the forests, the flora is rather neatly put together and some sights are neat to see. Their 'wow' factor has certainly diminished over the years and the dated graphics don't help, but Nordmar area is still pretty cool! 

Music is amazing, it gives you a sense of calm or the sense of the frigid frosts that ravage the northern part of the map. It is a great adventure and that's very neat!

Let's jump into the bad stuff. 
You know the best thing about the game is music, undoubtedly. Well what if I told you there's enemies that aggro you from leagues away and change your neat, very atmospheric moment that's just dripping with awesomeness into a brass concert followed by heavy drums. It sounds as if whole army of darkness descends upon your location. You turn around and see this shitty, annoying mob that you can kill with one shot. Eh... And it happens. Every. Single. Time. When you find the moment to enjoy yourself between the bad stuff that the game has.

It lacks any depth. It is extremely vapid in everything it does. Do you want examples? Well.
I know I have complained about writing in Gothic 3 Forsaken Gods. And it is absolutely valid complaint. But what if I told you that all quests in Gothic 3 feel like they were written by interns. The immersions just don't exist at all. Everyone in the world of Gothic suddenly became so inexcusably stupid and dense that only our Hero can save them. Dialogues are full of one lines that can be summed up like: 
""Hey you don't look like a lumberjack. You look like a warrior."" 
""Our warriors aren't interested in the tasks of lumberjacks and we've trouble with wild boars."" 
""Can you help me? You are a warrior.""

To build on this I'll tell you that; vast majority of the game side quests and even main quests are the dreaded fetch quests in the pure, MMO style. Here you go, we need you to kill TEN wolves. You go out into the open and indeed you see a specially named type of wolf. Sometimes they have just a different name, sometimes they give you a decent experience because they tweaked colors on the textures a bit. Bring Seven Rings. Bring Ten Plates. Bring 10 figurines and 8 scrolls and 7 vases and 3 urns and whatever. You get the picture. On top of that it is chock full of terrible writing to boot. It is just a pain to go through those dialogues because they feel insulting.

So you start skipping the dialogues. They are equally vapid as the content they hide. Sometimes due to how camera positions itself the voice lines don't get any voice over whatsoever. Sometimes you want to check up on your journal because all of this and then what? Well, journal is just . . . word for word your talk with the NPC. It is by all means useless. It doesn't offer you concrete and only needed info after the chat with the NPC.

Let's say you engage in combat. Melee feels very disadvantaged with all those multi-attack enemies who - without the patches, can stunlock you and kill you while you are unable to move. With the patches the situation can still happen when you have two or three or more of such enemies to attack you at once. The hard working community who made countless patches (because it wasn't Piranha Bytes, forget about them) could only fix the issue happening when it is one on one. 

Let's say you enjoy the game as normal, one of the most prevalent bugs that you will encounter in the game is the dreadful NPC phasing through terrain. They can clip through caves creating unknown shortcuts, in some key moments they can clip behind your back creating this pincer attack - glorious addition by the way, who wouldn't want an AI to cheat. Sometimes NPCs have enough range to attack you from underneath the terrain. I will drop a reminder, you cannot physically affect them in any way in that state unless you get them to crawl out of the ground. Sadly the community is incapable of ever fixing that bug fully so it is here to stay. Thanks Piranha Bytes.

Let's talk further, about the things that this game does *worse* than previous two installments.
All the QoL that's missing and is missing and/or was added by the community:
• The towns feel dead. They are tiny. Nothing ever happens in them. Your actions feel like they've no impact whatsoever on what goes in those places either way. The only significant change is when you choose to liberate a city. So you can, you know, lose all the 'significant' NPCs and replace them with Generic NPC named Trader or Alchemist or Freed Slave. Ha. Oh my.
• The combat is weird? Some things are better, some are much worse. For instance, the draw weapon sound is the same one as in 1st and 2nd game - added by community in patches, because Piranhas didn't thing about it. The ranged weapons are interesting because they allow you to aim freely and this allows you for interesting scenarios. This makes ranged NPCs that aren't mages far less deadly. Skilling up in weapon skills doesn't affect you in any way though. Your character always holds the weapon in the very same way, waving it like he was an absolute amateur with a stick. Two handed weapons or single handed weapons. Complete novice or master, it all looks the same.
• They added a stat that scales your damage with magic and the magic itself  . . . It's okay? But if you decide for a magic build you will just finish the game with the first fireball spell you learn because it will be one of the most powerful tools at your disposal. Sadly most big spells take ages to cast and NPCs make damn sure you won't be able to cast them in vicinity.
• Little QoL that is lacking is the fact that whenever you use a shovel tool or pickaxe tool your main weapon or side weapon or staff unequips. And it doesn't equip back again after you're done. 
• Economy is out of whack. By the end of my 16hour play through I've had 300k gold and nothing to do with it. All the weapons sold are garbage. And the only real money drain are the armors you can buy.
• Sadly all the NPCs' weapons you can find are always 'used' which means, they deal only half of their original damage. This kinda feels sense of already non-existent sense of progression. The only thing that truly tracks your merit are the armors you can wear.
• Do you remember iconic warnings animals used to bark, squeal or otherwise announce to you in the first two games? You know exactly what has taken interest in you or what is in your vicinity based on sounds alone. There's near none of that in Gothic 3.
• Even when it comes to difficulty. Sure melee is at a huge disadvantage but any other build just storms through the content like crazy. Why is that you ask? Well, everything is very generic. There's very little threats in the game. Animals that used to be fast are slow. The cutesy furry shadowbeasts that bounce towards you as if they were on a bouncy castle are hum. How to put it, not only not threatening but also absolutely useless. This is true for a lot of other enemies.

Let's sum it up though, compared to Gothic 1 or 2 this feels like a drastic downgrade in all but few departments.",1671934907,1671934907,False,7,1,0.52542489767074585,1,True,False,False

Gothic 1 and 2 were fantastic in a very unique way. They had their problems - particularly NOTR Gothic 2 - but you wanted to keep at it and see what happens. World progression, questing and design was just phenomenal all round.

Gothic 3 is clearly an unfinished game and a shell of what PB actually wanted to craft. There's a huge open world which is quite nice to look at and explore, but everything is empty and the questing is all fetch quests. It feels like an MMO.

Not to mention the combat is absolutely atrocious. Even with community patch alternate AI settings, it still just sucks. There's zero impact to the weapon hits, sounds are a whisper so it's difficult to know if a block or hit has registered and it's essentially just using one or two moves that completely break it. The only playable way to go in this game is either archery or magic. It sucks.

This is the only game I give a thumbs down to in their portfolio, and it's not because it's a ""bad"" game, technically. It's just completely unfinished and empty. Real bummer.",1671707281,1671707281,False,2,0,0.522368371486663818,0,True,False,False

You may hear a lot of indie game or classic old game recommendations for a ""game that doesn't hold your hand"", but this is the one I recommend for such an aspect. There is no minimap, the menu map is static and neither you nor your quests are marked on it. You have to use your intuition to progress in the game. The world spawns are static so everything you kill stays dead and doesn't repopulate. NPC's live on a day/night schedule and do it better than Skyrim. There are 3 areas with 5-6 cities each and lots of wilderness in-between. It is very interesting to get lost in these wildernesses. Each area has two factions within it's cities and you can side with either one of them or play as some sort of anarchist, exterminating everyone. There are also different character builds to shoot for. With these two factors, I'd say the replay value is high in the long term.

I estimate anywhere between 500 to 1000 hours in game. However, the hours logged here on Steam only reflect my full playthrough of Gothic 3 Content Mod 3.1 with all the underlying mods like Consequences, Alternative A.I. and Alternative Balance, Community Patch, Quest Packet etc.[/i][/b] 

[b] This is a review of Gothic 3 Content Mod 3.1[/b]

When I was installing Content Mod 3.1 I made sure to change as much as it was possible to mimic previous Gothic games, especially Gothic 2, so I installed Gothic 2 creature skins. I also took part in selecting key moments of Gothic 2. 

I have to say that new skins look pretty amazing, true to lore and make the game darker, more serious and overall look of the game seems to be more serious too compared to vanilla. 

[b][Faction Armor][/b]
I also enabled armors sold with reputation checks which altered the game balance a little bit as it was no longer possible to easily farm gold and go to the best vendor right away to get the best armor. You either had to find non faction armors somehow or you had to earn them by farming reputation but because I wanted to play long game and beat as many quests as possible before I started taking out key NPCs and taking over cities (besides consequences mod can make certain things impossible to do if you burn bridges), I had to stay away from best faction armors. 

[b][New Items][/b]
Luckily, the mod adds plethora of new items with new textures to the game. That includes weapons, armors and even a couple of magic relics like the shadow scepter which in essence allows you to cast Fog spell without learning it or using scrolls. Those rewards are evenly distributed through out the world. Some are hidden as blueprints, some carried by newly added and old NPCs, some are put for sale on some npcs. some lie in chests and hidden places and others are given for completion of certain quests, old and new. Sometimes buffing lacklustre rewards of some of the old quest line endings. So it was always interesting to complete quests and see what I'd get. 

Mod also adds a few misc items like scrolls, I believe large health and mana potions were not a part of vanilla Gothic 3 but it has been some time since i played it so I might be mistaken and I never really paid much attention to it before. Oh and it also adds many crafting recipes for new potions, including permanent. transformation effect ones. 

[b][Key Gothic 2 Events and Beliar's Claw][/b]
So during installation you can select some key events that happened in Gothic 2 that were players choice. I believe there were 3. One of them was which apprenticeship you took. They only slightly affect starting stats and skills, I chose smith so I had a little more strength and I believe one smithing ability learned.

Another one was which faction you joined in G2. And the final one was in regards to what you did with Beliar's Claw which if you played G2 you know is a special Beliar's Sword that you can feed with your maximum health to make it deal more damage. And Beliar's Sword can change between 1 handed or 2 handed. And depending on which skill was higher in G2 you'd get the corresponding copy. Not sure if you could alter it later at the shrine. 

Anyway, what I do not understand is that even though you have an option to keep Beliar's Claw in game as a sword and possibly a rune but I chose it as a sword, you cannot choose what kind of a sword it will be in the check boxes. It is by default a 2 handed sword. And I did not really like using 2 handed weapons, I felt they were kind of weak in Alternative Balance on Hard. 

It would be nice if they coded it so that you could feed it your life energy and make it deal more damage as well as switch between 1H and 2H at Beliar's Shrines. I did not like how they ported the sword in game and it was useless to me. 

[b][Quest Packet][/b]
I played in English. Quest pack comes in English too but some of the lines are badly translated. Some are translated very well. Most of lore books in Fire Monastery are not translated at all because life is too short to spend it on translating Gothic lore apparently, well I get it. 

I could tell which quest was from vanilla and which line was from vanilla and which was a new quest and a new dialogue because the new content is not voiced. So I could read it instead. I did not mind it and it allowed me to really understand what's different. The subtitle change speed is adequate. Mostly I did not have to read too fast but there were cases I had to speed up and sometimes I did not manage to read the full line. I used Nvidia Shadowplay when I was really curious to save a replay and read it. 

As for the quests themselves, they seem to be alright. Lore friendly, some of them are even interesting in terms of what's going to happen. They can provide some of the best rewards in game and they still feel balanced compared to how hard the quests can be. There are some choices to be made here. 

Some quests require you to cover a lot of ground in a search for something so you can't really complete them at the start of the game. Some quests require you going back and forth between NPCs in different cities so you need teleporter stones. Some of the quests you pick up at the start of the game and gradually complete them as you explore and some serve as riddles. I have to admit I even googled completion of one or two of them. 

In the process of beating those quests you can earn a lot of extra experience points as many small tasks in these quests give you adequate amount of EXP. But I guess they tried to balance it out with an option to reduce the amount of EXP you get from monsters (available on install). Otherwise, if you beat all content this mod has, including new enemies etc. without even farming animals which respawn btw, you are looking to reach a higher level than in Vanilla. I was level 79 by the time I beat all the quests I cared to beat (I admit I skipped some boring quests like killing 5 undead commanders in Varant), however I beat all the new quests and freed Varant, Myrtana, Nordmar and also destroyed all Rebel camps. 

[b][Alternative Balance][/b]
In Vanilla Gothic 3 it is apparently easier to learn many skills and spells, many of them require fewer points and fewer pre-questies skills and spells to learn. 

However, I did not notice Alternative Balance (which mostly refers to pure numerical changes) to affect my gameplay much. And I played Forsaken Gods with Community Patch shortly before. Some of the community patch changes made in into Alternative Balance. 

Anyway, as there are a lot of new balanced armors and weapons, a lot of new EXP and quests, I did not feel like I was ever in need of skill points so I did not feel the AB to be taxing at all. In fact, most of those spells and skills felt rather cheap to acquire and others that I needed also required a skill or a spell that I wanted so I would get it anyway.

For instance I was able to both master thievery, have warrior skills, and some magic. Knockout skill at 40 thievery is an essential skill for insta kills or knockouts, for robbing cities and taking out hard humanoid targets if you sneak up from behind. If you have green reputation in a city you can knock out anyone you like and rob them all, right in front of other people's eyes. 

By the end game I became a real paladin, I had over 700 health that I started investing into in the End Game for sieges, I had over 230 mana, not too much hunting but I was able to wield an Orc Ripper and extract all trophies. Smithing went to nearly a 100 when you really need 60 to get armor buffs, 159 ancient knowledge, over 400 strength [b]

- degraded user experience compared to previous games in the series - 
no climbing, 
awful UI without keyboard support in dialogues and inventory (means good luck pixel hunting with cursor on everything - no more flawless support for controller), no looting keybinding (added only in community patch from beta branch), no keybinding for torch

- same lame mechanics carried over from previous games such as clunky magic casting and long time to draw your weapon or change to magic. by the time you start casting something enemy will kill you. in previous games we had archery to snipe enemies from far away. in this game you will be dead after first shot unless you shot and run for your life. archery now uses some kind of crosshair to show if you hit the target, by the time you'll find the right spot on enemy you'll be dead. 

- combat is not bearable because everything kills you by stunlocking and carrying 2-3 hits per second till you die. death scream is annoying and too loud, like someone is being tortured. prepare to hear it every few minutes because you can die withing few seconds even to weakest critter, even scavenger can run you down and peck to death without letting you to recover from its pecks. someone who created this combat should never touch game development again. this is worst combat known in RPG games. 

-steam version of the game by default is 1.60 and that's whole new reason to give this game negative rating. this version is defunct, full of game breaking bugs, has loading times for saves around few minutes (every time you reload your save), awful performance and constant FPS spikes (one big world turned out to be one big slow and ugly world). I've got less FPS in this ugly beast than I had in ESO. there is new community patch in beta branch that improves load times, FPS and adds few QoL features to UI but it also changes things it shouldn't (monster respawn times, lockpicks availability - it's getting even harder to progress). if you decide to play it you'll have a hard choice - original unplayable mess or community version with their own take on all skills, items, combat etc. no option to play original game.

- community patch is an awful thing, targeted at power players who want to get max levels, therefore it added annoying feature no one asked for - immediate respawn of mosters in the area you just cleared out. I'll give you one example of a quest I had to complete. need to kill 7 shy deers for a hunter, in the starting area of the game near first town. I went there and had to kill ~20 bloodflies, ~20 wolves, ~10 boars just because I teleported back to town to sleep and replentish my mana almost all critters I've killed respawned. pack of 8 wolves when destroyed respawned as pack of 5, then 3, and in same manner with other critters. I just had no mana to continue with my initial quest because every time I went in the area it was full of hostiles, again. I condemn this patch and people who thought it was good idea to add respawn. you ruined my game. this is no longer Gothic, just community shovelware, single player MMO.

- quality of graphics, NPC animations are appalling. prepare to watch how your toon repeatedly scratches his butt or pretends he's swimming during dialogues. LOD on maxed setting is so bad that I can't see enemies and far landmass without triggering enemy into attack. previous games had this issue as well, but it had 4 quality presets so you can switch between it depending on FPS you wanted. or cheat to see all land (and it worked like a charm). despite having a lot of free RAM and CPU power, game uses only 1.6Gb of RAM and ~50% of CPU (even with beta patch).

- brewing potions is a mockery. not only it costs arm and leg to buy recipes, LP on skill itself, but then you can't brew anything because you can't find wine or any other retrded ingredient. after being to 3 towns I purchased 7 bottles of wine, found some in chests so created only 16 mana potions. one potions will help you to kill 2-3 enemies in the beginning. you have to sleep or use potions. same thing with cooking. you can buy 1 recipe for mediocre food but it needs milk and no one sells it. go kill cows on the farm for 1-2 bottles. 

- weapon and armor choices are meh. for armor you have few variations, just need money. for weapon you have nothing but useless junk. I wanted to play as a mage. with staff. not a single enemy or crate dropped me a staff. shtload of swords. you can't buy robes at the beginning, have to travel naked half the map to find some mage or druid.

- weapon usability is even worse. get a spear or halbert and that's your weapon for whole game. spam right mouse button because if you use normal attack enemy retreats and you're hitting air. 

- armor in general makes very little difference in your defense. naked - 3 hits from a wolf within a second and you die. 25 levels later with more health and +100 in armor - 4 hits from a wolf in a second and you die. once enemy stunlocked you it does not matter how many hits they have to make to kill you on the ground. don't expect ever to feel comfortable fighting low level creatures, leave alone packs of them.

- there are not many beds in the world. don't expect camps or cave to have it (only rarely) and if you're trying to sleep in town at night chances are you won't find empty bed. 

- lockpicking and stealing from chests is another example of unfair system: even if no one saw you stealing once you emptied enough they will start to attack you. not to mention that chests content in this game is another letdown. risking your standing in the city for couple of empty bottles and torch isn't the best idea. 

- questing and factions in game are sad. you can play for orcs or for rebels who often has insane ideas like kill cows to stir the revolt of orcs. I'd prefer to kill both of them because they are annoyingly bad as NPCs I'm supposed to support. 

- can't bring up steam overlay to see FPS or interactive map.

main version isn't DRM free (packed with steam stub, has to be unpacked to play without steam). however beta version 1.75 is DRM free and can be played without steam. with performance it had I'd advice to play it offline without steam, probably it can save you from some freezes and FPS drops.

not recommended under any circumstances. this game is better suited for masochist fans who can take any humiliation and pain from their beloved game. most important thing - it is not fun playing it, painful chore and loading screen sim. they wanted to create one big world without loading screens but instead you will be wasting your time by reloading your last save every few minutes.",1666759015,1666933028,False,14,1,0.587732136249542236,4,True,False,False

For me, Gothic 3 has the strongest implementation of an open world fantasy environment for its time.

Gothic 3 came out in 2006, the same year as Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion (Skyrim was released 5 years later).  In comparison to Oblivion, it has a larger open world that feels lush, diverse, and interesting, whereas Oblivion's environments often felt cut/paste replicated to me.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2045894808

I've applied the community patch, had a first look at the game on Easy mode, then turned on Alternative Balancing -- which makes some aspects more difficult, such as making permanent skill bonuses less strong -- and played at Medium difficulty till the end at level 70. I've missed a few side-quests here and there, but overall playtime as a powerful fire mage is around 80-90 hours, if you explore carefully and collect loot and items. Skilling is more straight-forward as in the predecessor. Plants that give permanent bonuses tell that in the item description.

Don't be irritated by the battle at the beginning. It's only a tutorial style fight. Simply click-through the enemies. The real game starts after the battle.

Melee combat is sort of broken in this game, because with each hit you interrupt an enemy, and basically that means as a weak fighter you can eliminate even many strong opponents with clicking the right or left mouse-button rapidly - however, an opponent can do the same to you, especially if landing a first quick hit. Gothic 1 and 2 are much better in this area.

Ranged combat is great, however, and if becoming a mage, which is highly recommended for these games, starting with a bow is a fine choice for many levels.

There doesn't seem to be target locking though, so if encountering multiple enemies at the same time, be careful. If you like hit'n'run fighting and ranged combat, this game is for you. Charged spells hit a target like a seeking missile, which is a bonus to becoming a mage.

There are different paths through the game. Different factions to cooperate with. Different endings. 

It's a large open world, where you may choose to swim over the sea and visit another land, completely ignoring your early quests. Exploration and hunting is very entertaining. There are loads of NPCs to interact with. I've enjoyed the voice-acting in this game a lot. Be sure to pay a visit to Renwik in the city of Geldern!

Be warned that a merchant's inventory is generated when talking to a merchant for the first time. This may influence whether a shop contains special items that give permanent bonuses, such as Ancient Knowledge stone tablets for spell casters. Decide yourself whether to save and reload before talking to merchants for the first time.

Those games are masterpieces,especially Gothic 1. But is it a fun time? Yeah it is. The faction system is honestly better than what gothic 2 has to offer, and there's much more room for experimentation on how you want to go about playing the game. The combat is broken, no doubt about that, humans and orcs are very easy and creatures are impossible to kill with melee. Either spec into magic or ranged.
Don't go straight into Gothic 3 like you did Gothic 2. Gothic 2 is an almost perfect continuation to the legendary Gothic 1, whilst Gothic 3 is a massive departure for the series. You will be disappointed. It is nowhere near as good as its predessecors, but that's an extraordinarily high bar to live up to, and this game still soars above the likes of skyrim.

The biggest issues that there are with the game are its optimization in which it is not uncommon to have big stutters every now and then either because there are a lot of things going on or a big chunk of the map is loading in, I have played this on both a low end laptop and a decent computer and I have had stutters on both machines.
The other big issue is the melee combat system which is quite a big downgrade from the other games in the series in which the melee combat was quite fast and required you to learn the attack patterns of specific enemies and mastery of the mechanics that were available which included blocking and dodging by dashing back and timing your attacks properly so that you could perform a combo that allowed you to land quite a few hits before needing to counter their attack. In Gothic 3 the melee combat is a bit slower and simpler as there is no way to dash backwards like in the previous games meaning that the only way to avoid enemy attacks is either to keep strafing backwards or sideways or blocking, blocking will not stop power attacks the stab attack or animal attacks meaning that strafing is the only way to avoid these other attacks which is not ideal as strafing is quite slow. As well as quite a few of the animals that are in the game can be quite relentless as well as humanoid enemies (orks, skeletons etc) as they do a series of quick attacks practically stun locking you for a few seconds while you get dealt a large amount of damage.
All in all the levelling system is very similar to the previous games with the biggest changes being the new skills that are added alongside their own perks and the way the magic system works in which the damaging spells now scale with ancient knowledge.
I would still recommend this game despite these flaws as it is still quite enjoyable and is quite cheap with the bundle when it is on sale",1614503430,1661060779,True,3,0,0.530900955200195313,0,True,False,False

I don't recommend the raw G3, but with community patches it's really solid game with (imo) still one of the best open worlds in game history. Exploration is rewarding, you feel how you grow in strength with levels and items, multiple builds available yet if you're dedicated enough you can become jack-of-all-trades in both weapons and magic. Difficulty level is fair, easy for experienced players but if you're new you will fear the boars :)

Overall good game, I've finished it like 4 times and still like to come back from time to time.

Edit: OOOH I FORGOT ONE INSANE SH1T! You better take your calm lessons when fight against animals - especially in Nordmar.

With the shy deer quest make sure to not to run for the deer - it will end up going under the map. Instead save before attempting, and wait. If other deers dont come back in two minutes - load.

Also I would suggest to try this game play style: avoid the bow, because with the x2 speed your character has compared to most other creatures it incentivizes bad play style - run and shoot. That is quite unrealistic. Instead try crossbow. It is almost the same, but much slower shots and more damage per shot, but less dps. This makes it impossible to run and shoot at the same time, making you think about what to do. And try easy difficulty. Even if you used to play on hard, in this game hard just makes it so that you have to hit many-many times, to the point of opponents turning into hedgehogs from your arrows. With easy opponents have low hp, so you can kill them quickly. To balance out the difficulty, try instead to avoid increasing your hp, so that opponents can somewhat easy kill you. And make it so that if you are dead, you avoid playing for lets say a week. This way you will have realistic play style, few shots are needed per enemy, which also adds realism. And opponents still can kill you in just a few blows. And you dont just load all the time, because after death you just wait and do something else. Just dont forget to save anyway, because bugs will get you anyway, that is an acceptable reason to load.

Usually I prefer to play on hard only. But this way I find it nice too. Hope this helps you with an idea about how to play.",1656123644,1656123644,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Melee Combat: awful
Range Magic: kinda ok but oh my... just the masses of enemies they stacked together... 30 skeletons in one grave,... and in every direction you find another troll or 5 ogres, 10 wolves... It's just plain annoying sometimes.

On a technical level it's awful... how often a spell didn't connect because I stood on a molehill and the spell just went above an enemies head!

And then we didn't spoke about the 'optimization'... every 2 minutes the framerate just tanks. On a system build 15 years after release of the game. How on earth is this acceptable?!

Even the lootsystem is terrible. How often I cleared a Dungeon to find two metal chests with some spellscrolls I allready had 20 of, two torches and three flasks of water.

the story of gothic 3 continues right after the ending of gothic 2. Our nameless hero returns to the mainland of Myrtana, only to find his fellow humans enslaved by the Orcs. Now it’s up to him and his friends to either side with the Orcs and help them wipe away the last remaining resistance, or support the human rebellion to overthrow the orcish reign again.

first time i played this was around 2011, half a decade after release and by that time the numerous community patches had already turned the game into a mostly bug-free, perfectly playable and highly enjoyable experience. gothic 3 still has some balancing issues and the combat is pretty dull, but overall it developed into a game that delivers a very solid and atmospheric fantasy rpg experience not just for gothic fans. when you directly compare it to its immediate competitor elder scrolls 4 oblivion (which was released half a year earlier) nowadays, gothic 3 looks better, plays better, is more atmospheric, has fewer bugs and overall is just the better game by todays standards. Gothic 3 might have lost against Oblivion in 2006, but it has aged much more gracefully.

in the end gothic 3 doesn’t reach the high mark set by its predecessor, but it is an excellent game in its own right that improves upon many aspects of the first two gothic games and brings the trilogy to a somewhat clumsy and abrupt, yet satisfying and consistent closure (Mass Effect 3, i‘m looking at you: Take note of Gothic 3‘s ending cutscenes). 
A 7/8 may be a bit controversial, but the only Fantasy RPGs that i enjoy more than Gothic 3 are its own predecessor and Diablo 2. Maybe it was a buggy piece of sh*t 15 years ago, but today it’s my game of the year 2006.

Gothic 3 is one of the biggest rpgs out there (I said biggest that doesnt mean its one of the best) and while it has an OK story and a completely ugly and messy combat system, its worth to play like any other piranha bytes game for its world, the world-building here is excellent and is the biggest in the whole series, while it brings new things to the gothic formula theres still a more flexible faction system here too that adds some depth into the game's mechanics, exploring is fun and rewarding, theres tons of hidden caves, dungeons, ruins filled with enemies and other features, soundtrack is among one of the best in any game ever, sadly voice acting and sound effects suck, enemies when hit sounds like they're having orgasms, this game is full of jank, but as far eurojank games with limited budgets go, this one tries so hard to be big and ambitious that it failed hard in its release because of how buggy and how hard to run it was, it is a beautiful game on many aspects, the world is big, theres no loading screens, graphics were much better than oblivion back in the day, but the sad truth is that this game is still broken, ironically, this is a game inside a bug.

 Ff you really want to explore and feel this beautiful world PB has made, its is obligatory to get the community patch, so the game can be playable and its combat tweaked a little to be ''more functional'', if you have no patience and is intolerant to frustration, then, find a better RPG that suits you because G3 while being good and especial to its fans, is a very problematic game that can be very hard to get into, If you never played a gothic game before and want to try this one, I recommend you this only if you're a hardcore rpg fan with enough patience to endure its flaws, also avoid its expansion forsaken gods its really bad.",1528996162,1653529055,True,16,1,0.611783325672149658,0,True,False,False

By far the game's best quality is its ability to create a sense of immersion and adventure. You can just walk in a direction and stumble upon quests/loot/monsters

Pros:
- Great Immersion
- Graphics are great for the time and have aged well
- Interesting world to explore
- Fun -if janky- combat
- The lack of hand-holding in quests (ie. quest markers) made it so that I had to keep a journal to help me along which was great for the immersion I keep raving about. Some people may dislike this lack of help, which is understandable
- Good variety of spells, a lot of which make you feel really powerful when you cast them

Cons:
- Only con that comes to mind is that the game does not work as is. You need to go online and download/install the Community Patch in order to get the game to work on modern systems. 

Tips:
- You effectively get paid twice for quests. Once automatically when you complete the objective, and a second time when you talk to the person who gave you the quest.
For example. Guy: "" Go kill 5 goblins"". You kill 5 goblins. The game gives you experience on the spot. But when you return to the Guy, he will be like ""thanks for killing those goblins, here's some money"".
- Try to learn the ""Learner"" skill ASAP, as it provides you with an additional skill point upon levelling up
- Even if you know what faction you are going to side with, do the opposing faction's quests too. This will provide you with more experience/money (and experience more of the game) than if you only did your preferred faction's quests",1652060361,1652060361,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's lacking something that Gothic 1, 2 or Risen 1 has.

Pardon me, not release, but flush it to the toilet BECAUSE IT'S LITERALLY CRAP! 

The only reason why we still haven't seen anything good from Piranha Bytes is simple. Community... The fact that people are willingly to sweat their hot dogs fingers aol over an keyboard to try to convice any CHAD OG Gothic fan before G3 or brand new players, that G3 is not garbage it's a long sad story on this planet. Gothic 3, Risen 1/2/3 and Ellex 1/2 it's just same crap over and over...

 I completed Got Hic numbered three in just under thirty minutes. It has quite plausibly the most notable nameless hero in gaming who became a legend ever. It is mostly all baron squalor were sickly pleb npcs wander and idle amongst their disgusting structures mostly.

 I am old now, but remember archaic boxes of forgotten wonders, the technology of the past I treasure fondly. An imperfect gem such as this sits in the diadem of the goughfick trilogy shining proudly with its unique flaws.

Another inredible installment for the Gothic franchise, I have truly enjoyed playing this game over and over and will continue to do so when I am able. The open world makes exploring and leveling a lot of fun and the atmosphere and music is absolutely beautiful in most of the game. Having multiple ways to play and different story lines and quests to do each time makes it even more exciting to replay and what I love most about Gothic 3 is just how wonderful it is to spend hours just roaming around and collecting items in my unlimited inventory. There are some good characters to interact with and really fun side quests to do as well. I do not feel like Gothic 3 is as good RPG wise as gothic 1 and gothic 2 are, but the atmosphere and environments alone, with updated graphics,  make it a very enjoyable and fun game. I wish Varant offered more variety but there is also something so lonely about roaming there that makes it stick with you long after you have played. And even though Nordmar is the smallest section, it feels like the largest and is very easy to get lost in which makes exploring it fun for me. Myrtana is breathtakingly beautiful both scenery and music wise. For it's time, like the previous two entries in the gothic franchise, this game is simply amazing.

This game would probably be good in a vacuum, unfortunately Gothic 1 & 2 exist, and to me it fails to live up to their gameplay systems and mechanics. Gothic to me is all about scaling, starting from a humble criminal to eventually becoming a hero who banishes greater demons and undead dragons. Gothic 3 does not have that and to me that disqualifies it from being a Gothic game.

You never feel like you are getting stronger fundamentally, at level 39 than I did at 29, or 19, or 9. There was never a point where enemies that had given me trouble in the past seemed trivial. Instead of getting jumped by a pack of wolves in the woods, now I'm getting jumped by a pack of wolves in the snow except this time I'm wearing much fancier armor and carrying a much shinier sword than before.

The way damage is calculated has changed so that now armor, before a symbol of status and a true sign of character progression, is a fashion statement aligning you with a specific race. Armor before flat out subtracted damage from enemy attacks, now it only mitigates a percentage of it. As a result even weak enemies will always be threatening, especially since leveling does not increase your health. Health may only be increased by investing a sizeable portion of your learning points into alchemy, then into potions of permanent effects, and then they must be brewed by gathering rare ingredients. So it's really out of the way and convoluted. 

The world is well crafted and extensive, but largely isolated. While doing quests for factions will increase your overall relations with them, there seems to be no tangible impacts to the hero's actions through the story, aside from a throwaway line from an Orc chief stating that ""Some Morra has been attacking our cities, just wait till we get out hands on him!"" There are numerous caves and mines filled with literal hordes of enemies to fight (bad for it's own reasons see below) but the treasure inside is garbage, same as what the enemies are carrying.

All the loot in this game is either randomly generated (i.e. generic garbage) or ""worn"" having half the stats it should. I never feel any incentive to look for better items, because I'm quite positive I won't find any. There is no point in fighting a strong NPC for their weapon like in previous games, because their weapon is a piece of shit that won't help you either. Can you imagine, a Gothic game without any worthwhile loot to find or steal?

The combat sucks. It just does. The hitboxes for a lot of the weapons are not properly aligned with the animations. A single enemy in the group blocking cancels your attack, allowing the others in the mob to beat the shit out of you. Weapon range is really the name of the game so that you can effectively stunlock your enemies before they stunlock you. Not a bad system, the original games had it as well, but at least there you had to learn combos with the weapons and the related weapon skills, now all you have to do is repeatedly click LMB, mixing RMB in there every once and a while for flavor.

I had fun in the beginning, but once I realized that nothing was changing, no progress was being made, no matter how many armors or weapons I got, or quests were being completed, the game just became a chore. Show up, grind it out for awhile, come back and repeat. Gothic 1 & 2 may have also shared this in terms of it's leveling, where you were incentivized to kill every living thing on Khorinis, but Gothic 3 drip feeds you meaningful progression at such a snail's pace it barely feels like it's happening at all. In Gothic 1 & 2, you feel every level and your character becoming stronger. It's really an amazing feeling to beat the shit out of a shadowbeast and rip it's skin and teeth out after getting mauled to death by it several times at low levels. In Gothic 3, that same shadow beast will kill you in two hits at low levels, and three hits at higher levels. P R O G R E S S I O N.

I'm sure some may dismiss my claims as being pedantic but I came in expecting one thing and got another. I only wish I could have realized it sooner. The game is a great time sink, I barely realized how deep I had sunk into the trap until the sudden realization came upon me, but there are better uses of my time and better games to play. Don't be like me, get fooled into thinking that a cave filled with dragons near the beginning of the game will have good stuff in it, come back later with better gear to slay the dragons, only to discover the same water bottle, scroll of transfer disease, and fire nettle that's in every chest, in every cave, on the entire god-forsaken continent.",1646980620,1646980620,False,25,5,0.575153112411499023,3,True,False,False

That being said, it's a blast from the past -- it chews bubblegum and kicks ass -- and it's all out of bubblegum -- which means that you're gonna get your ass kicked or you're doing the ass kicking along the way. I highly recommend it if you've got ample time and you don't shy away from a challenge, or two. Even after all these years it still holds up from the graphics to the gameplay.

However, you have to have the latest community patch 1.75.14* installed, which you can download freely from the internet. Doing so updates the game to its most glorious form which you can enjoy on modern day hardware.*

This patch also comes with the Alternative Balancing** in short AB. It's a mode which you can toggle on or off in the main menu. OFF means old balancing, meaning the protagonist isn't throttled in learning everything there is -- from casting spells as a mage to picking pockets as a thief. ON means the learning points are steeper the more you go down one specific path of knowledge, meaning you can't become a jack-of-all-trades anymore. Be advised, once you've chosen you can't switch mid-game and have to start anew if you want to experience it the other way around.

+Gorgeous graphics which still hold up today (thanks to the community patch)
+No handholding, total freedom in roaming around and doing things your way
+Become a melee warrior, or a ranged hunter, a spellcasting mage or a thieving scoundrel.
+Cooking, smithing and brewing potions, yay!
+Aiming with bow  or crossbow is fun!
+Beautiful soundtrack which you can instantly recognize as G3
+All dialogue lines are fully voiced
+Kicking ass feels rewarding (since it's tough to do)

Game world is truly open - you can go wherever you want from the very start, only limitation is your ability to defeat monsters in the area. And you don't even have to kill monsters - you can avoid them, send them to sleep with a spell, animals can be tamed. This game really rewards exploration.

There is no predefined class for your character - you can learn any combination of available skills. You can build a pure fighter, hunter, mage, thief or alchemist, but you will most likely create a crossover character like for example mighty warrior that also wields bow, can brew healing potions and can cast Tame Animal spell.

In Gothic you can really feel the power that your character is slowly building. You start as a weakling that is scared by every animal howl, because anything stronger than a squirrel can kill you. Then you level up, learn new fighting techniques and spells, find good sword and purchase an armor. Suddenly you realize that the very same monster that was giving you creeps before is now an easy opponent because you improved. This game gives you this satisfying feeling a lot.

Graphics are little outdated for today's standards, but I think it still looks pretty nice, I especially like forests in Myrtana, there the game looks the best in my opinion.

Story is nothing special, actually it is pretty generic, but it doesn't matter because most fun is in side quests and random exploration. There are at least three different endings of the main quest.

Warning: Unfair Crititicisms Ahead

There were few weird design choices that I didn't like and were breaking my immersion. I don't know anybody who would listen to my ranting about flaws in Gothic 3 game design so I put it here.

Mushrooms growing in the desert - sometimes they just grow on the plain sand. And you don't even need those mushrooms. It is not like they were super vital ingredient so I don't understand why they put them in the desert.

Next weird thing are treasure chests that are sometimes placed in the most improbable of places like in the middle of wilderness or in animal cave. On top of it, majority of chests has boring random loot with few things appearing over and over. It was a strange decision to put these generic treasure chests in places like the middle of the forest or the top of the mountain. Who in the world would take a heavy wooden or metal chest, walk with it to his favorite spot in the wolf infested woods just to place a few fire arrows and an endurance potion inside?

Same thing applies to burning torches and campfires - very often they appear in places where they doesn't make any sense. Not only it is hard to imagine that anyone would place a burning torch on a wall in a cave that is only inhabited by lions, but most of all - it would be soon burnt out. Campfires out in the wilderness are more probable as some traveler could have had lit them, but that doesn't explain why are they still burning even when there is nobody around.

I played an illegal copy of the game more than 10 years ago and I don't remember it having any significant  bugs so it is beyond my understanding why Steam version purchased in 2021 can't be even played without community patch (player controls doesn't work).

Edit: I think I should elaborate on the recommendation and my comment from April. I am a huge Gothic fan, played and completed both the first and second Gothic back in the 2000s before Steam was a thing and games came on these round, shiny discs. ;-) Gothic 3 came and I immediately bought it, expecting more of the same. Sadly, as has been documented well enough by now, the game did not live up to expectations because the development team tried to do too much in too little time. The outcry in German gaming news and player circles was huge back in 2006 and deservedly so.

Now, 15 years later, the game has received a numerous amount of patches, fan-made enhancements and even a steam beta release to allow it to be the best version it can ever hope to be. And that version is STILL a huge pile of hot steaming garbage barely held together by nostalgia and a moderately fun open world. The gameplay is so ridiculously broken that fights usually have only two outcomes: you die because you get stunlocked or you managed to stunlock your opponent and spam the mouse until they die. No in between, ever. After about 40 hours I was powerful enough to kill my way through all three game worlds and ""free"" the people from all threats that have ever existed in the world. Not because it was fun, but it was the only way to achieve that particular goal.

The story is barely existent and not fleshed out at all, especially compared to the tight and dense predecessors that had great characters, heart and a memorable progression. Gothic 3 has zero interesting characters and those that could be interesting are barely talking to you.

The best part about the game is the music. The graphics, as nice as they were in 2006, are still servicable but the game is unstable as can be with ini tweaks that result in a good draw distance, so fog and pop-in a few hundred meters away it is. Speaking of crashes, the game was obviously never meant to be finished, as after 20+ hours there are so many states and variables to keep track of in the world that the engine just gives up at random points and dies. Hard crashes to desktop were a thing ""back in those days"" and Gothic 3 has got your nostalgia covered there.

Now, all that being said, why do I still recommend it? Is it because of nostalgia and me feeling like I finally conquered a game from my past? Is it because of the predecessors? Is it because  I am just glad it is over? Is it because of the love for the community that made the game better and actually kept it from being complete dog shit? Is it because, despite everything they did wrong here, I still have a soft spot for Piranha Bytes and their style of RPGs, all of which (except Gothic 4, argh) I have played now? -- To be honest, I do not know and I feel it is a mixture of all of these.

To someone young and new looking for great RPGs to play, Gothic 3 is very, very low on my list of recommendations regardless of what you are looking for. But for an old gamer like me who remembers gaming without constantly being online, I guess this is a notch in your belt that you may want to punch at some point.

The first 10-15 hours can be quite fun, finding out the game mechanics and passive skills, exploring the various towns, etc. But once youve seen everything you start to notice what a low quality, slow-burning grind this game is and thats when it stops being fun.

Pro:
-great soundtrack
-lots to explore
-decent quests
-lots of quests are doable early on or cheesable, inviting min-maxing
-some of the dialogue and voice acting is pretty solid
-3 different biomes, midlands with forests, the nord with frost and ice, and the south with deserts and exotic people

Con:
-not nearly as good as Gothic 1&2
-too far stretched - its big, theres lots to do, but you dont feel like doing it all because the average quality is a lot lower compared to the prequels. its less ""condensed"", it feels watered down.
-boring two-faction system: do you help the rebels or the orcs? you have to help one or the other in the end, and you have to do it over and over again. yes, you can do quests for both a little bit to profit more, but in the end you always have to choose one or the other, and it gets boring fast
-reputation system. no one likes reputation systems
-questionable graphics: it already didnt look good back then. it looks even worse today. on top of that the performance even on a modern-day PCs is pretty bad, theres lots of lag whenever the engine tries to load in new things
-terrible hitboxes: you dont really know when something outranges the enemy and when they outrange you, it mostly comes down to feeling and experience, and even then it feels random and frustrating as fuck
-disappointing scaling: whether its melee or magic, the damage you do in the middle to late part of the game barely feels any different to the start of the game. magic is especially bad, because 95% of spells are underpowered and useless. the best thing to do with 90% of your skillpoints is literally to just boringly dump them all into HP points, because thats the only thing that scales well (and a few lategame spells you only get for the last 1% of the game and cannot unlock earlier)
-inconsistencies: sometimes the game does a terrible job of teaching you things, like how you need to get magic by praying at statues. other times you can walk into a questgiver without having heard any of the previous info related to the quest or the place, leaving you very confused
-terribly buggy: I had to install an optional patch just to get this game running on 1080p. even then, I could not alt tab the game ever, because alt tabbing back greets me with a black screen. I had several crashes to desktop over the playtime, though I wouldnt call the frequency unplayable, its about once every 5-10 hours. Finally, I had a game breaking bug where an enemy mage would glitch into a wall and be outside the map. I had to load older saves (thank god I saved often) to solve this problem. finally, during the end credits, you cannot: skip the credits, alt f4, alt tab, or switch to task manager because the game keeps overwriting window priorities. I had to log out of windows to get out of the game.
-terrible ending: they tried to do an Arcanum style ending, where short cutscenes play out that change depending on your actions in the world. The result is pretty awful and feels incredibly random; to give you an example, I finished my playthrough this time as a dark mage serving the evil god Beliar, but the cutscene didnt even mention this. Instead it focused on a lot of stuff I didnt even do much during my playthrough. It also hints at a lot of future events, probably to play up to its shitty addon, but that doesnt change the fact that this ending feels very anticlimatic, unsatisfying and unresolved. They probably wanted to give the player a lot of choices in this, and instead all the choices feel meaningless and weightless. Sure, there was only ever one way to fnish the prequels, but at least you had a somewhat satisfying endresult + cutscene that way.",1634864801,1635057503,False,1,1,0.476190507411956787,0,True,False,False

What's wrong with it?  Combat.  Melee Combat in this game is all about selecting the proper weapon type for a particular type of enemy, picking terrain on which you can attack from downslope (this will typically make your attacks reach them faster while theirs reach you slower) and then mashing the attack button and stun-locking your opponent to death.  Fighting groups of enemies feels very silly because, as long as you are mashing the attack button, they will usually politely wait their turn while you mangle your current target.  Simply put... combat is terrible.  It takes no skill and is very repetitive.  Ditto for ranged which is just about shooting down targets, retreating, and shooting some more.  There does exist an alternative AI which makes fighting more skill based, but I find this actually makes things worse because the game is not balanced for it.  It's ok to fight a handful of Orcs with the alternative AI, but the camps of 40+  become a real pain in the butt.
My second major complaint is the story.  This game feels like an MMO, with each new town providing you with a number of shallow side-quests with no gripping main storyline to make things cohesive.  It serves to emphasize the grindy repetitive nature of the game.
Yet despite these serious problems, I do enjoy it.  There is a junk ton of treasure to find and no carry limit, which makes my inner pack rat squeal with delight.  I also like that you are not only allowed but encouraged to play both sides of a conflict, enabling you to do most of the quests for both sides regardless of which you choose in the end.  All the grindy combat and questing rewards you with abundant exp and learning points that allow you to customize your character by purchasing skills, increasing their HP/MP/Endurance, or upgrading their primary attacking attributes (Str/Dex/Int).  The character development is not too complicated, and feels rewarding.
Overall I'd say it doesn't hold a candle to its predecessors, but it's certainly worth a look.  Especially if you can get it at a nice cheap sale price!",1634263446,1634263537,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I didn't like the constant stuttering of game play.  The combat was too easy even with the patch Alternative AI on.  Companions path finding sucks.  They constantly get lost or unable to follow you through some terrain and try to find a longer alternative route to you.  Learning and upgrading skills didn't seem very rewarding.  For example, learning to be more proficient with one handed weapons does nothing but give you a boost to damage.  No new combos, no new swings, nothing.

[h1] Story [/h1]
You get to Myrtana on your ship, that you got in Gothic 2. Your main quest is to find Xardas, who is leading orcs against kings Rhobars armies. Overall story is on the same level as in first two games, its not bad.

[h1] Combat [/h1]
Oh boy, it's trash. Melee is either too easy (original) or too annoying (Alternate AI from Community Patch). I have finished game with the second option, 2-handed build and until I got to orc halberd (which was broken-strong) it was pain. 
Ranged combat is meh, bot mostly works. Sometimes projectiles hit some invisible obstacles, but otherwise it can be entertaining.
I never liked magic in Gothic series and this one is not exception. Spells have long incantations, that can be interrupted by anything.

[h1] Graphics [/h1]
It's OK. I preferred dirty look of first two games, but this one is not that bad.

[h1] Music [/h1]
Pretty much the only thing I really liked about this game.

[h1] Bugs [/h1]
Even with Community Patch (that I think is must have if you want to play Gothic 3) it is really buggy. Flying archers, companions, that disappear in the escort quest (especially you Xardas!), falling off the map and constant frame drops (that's more of optimalization issue) will accompany you on your journey.

[h1] Final thoughts [/h1]
Overall it's not that bad game. It can be solid RPG if you like exploration, talking to NPCs and if you don't mind completing tons of fetch quests. For me it's like [b] 5/10 [/b]. Buy (on sale) if you really want to see, how this story ends.",1627730327,1634120280,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You need to add the community patch to even run the game on new systems and then after that because of how much the base game was lacking you need to add content mod and quest packet for the game to be decent.
Its around 5 gb of external data to fix and make the game good.
My major issue is that the game is that the combat is still broken and the world doesnt have any major landmarks that take your breath away like you would see in skyrim when seeing the dwarven dungeons , seeing the temples in morrowing , the imperial city of oblivion .

Gothic 3 may be a rough, painful experience at times. You're thrown into a brutal, unfair world and are constantly reminded of that. This game doesn't care if u can handle the enemies. You have to think how to get around seemingly impossible challanges. Level up, buy spells, find an ally or lure enemies one by one out of their camp?
I'm not sure if i'm the only one but for me it also meant taking advantage of (sometimes) broken pathfinding of enemies or finding ""sniping"" spots, buying thousands of arrows and shooting orcs for hour.
The game has some technichal issues, in which case animation/effect mismatch was the most frustrating to me. Many times the moment an enemie's attack lands is completle different form which the animation would indicate. Makes it harder to learn.
And this is all after installing a community patch, becouse the game was unplayable, without it (framerate)
Also for example: There's an entire late game path to choose, for which you need to talk to king Rhobar. In my playthrough king Rhobar never appeared on his throne and was under the map instead. I fixed it with the help of the interent and some cheating, but while he's not necessary to progress the game, it has costed me a great deal of confusion.
The pacing of the game may be too slow for some. It took me 120hrs to complete it, a lot of quickloading in it.
BUT
If you bear those flaws, if you endure the unfairness and persist through possibly hundreds of quests...
Then you're rewarded with the greatest ""from zero to hero"" experience I've seen. I, personally, love this motive. The feeling of defeating a fucking boar, then taking on stronger and stronger fighters on arenas, stronger beasts (wildlife), orc, bandits, more beasts, more bandits, more orcs, ending up on battling entire cities with few other NPCs is just such a delight. Some high staus orc mercenary mocks you in the first hours of your playthough, to later be oneshot by you when you decide to capture entire village he lives in.
There isn't a lot of story to uncover, becouse I think this game is more about experencing the world  and sort of write the story of your own (the ""zero to hero"" story), although I really liked some twists, especially at the end of the game. There are few paths you may follow, few groups you may join, although there's no single act of choosing a side. It's what you do and for who, which makes you one or the other.

In addition to the last official update, I used the community patch v1.75.14 and its Update Pack v1.04.11 hotfix, and here is my opinion:

(+)
- Lifespan: the game is long ... very long: count approximately between 100 and 150 hours (do not pay attention to the number of hours indicated on my Steam profile because I have played a lot outside of Steam) if you wish do everything 100%

- Music: the music is beautiful and goes well with the atmosphere of the game

- Graphics: graphics are outdated in 2021, but the atmosphere of nature and different environments is faithfully transcribed

- Scenario: until the end of the game we look for clues about a certain Xardas, but it is only at the end that we understand his goal

- Gameplay: it's an oldschool role-playing game with the associated difficulty and not much help in the game. You will have to do a lot of research on the Internet to unearth all the secrets of the game. You will need a lot of patience to, for example, walking for hours looking for NPCs and monsters from some quests lost in the middle of the wilderness on a gigantic map.

(-)
- Some quests are still impossible to complete without cheats: I have been forced a few times to use commands in the console to spawn items and NPCs to complete quests. There are also still a few bugs with NPCs that fit inside walls, and some quests that existed on older versions of the game no longer exist.

- The optimization of the game remains very bad: since 2006 I had to start over at least 5/6 times Gothic 3 with each time new patches (some of which made the old saves incompatible), telling me that it was going to be better with new Nvidia and ATI graphics cards with different models each time, by changing processors, switching to an SSD, etc… but that didn't change anything.
... In 2021 Gothic 3 is still lagging despite the latest patches on my PC which runs Cyberpunk 2077 in very high. :(

In short, in the end I recommend this game which is very nice and immersive. Because of its many bugs, poor optimization, and the old school RPG side that may stress some, you may be able to find better in newer games, but it's still a great adventure.",1630445884,1630445884,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game has many obvious flaws, It will never be as good as Gothic 2 when it comes to story or fighting (depending on person's opinion.) However every Gothic fan should try to play throughout it because it concludes the main story of your hero (Nameless) and the game has a multitude of many cool things that I became a fan of. 1. Many quests and reputation system which was amazing and actual choosing of factions locks many other quests and makes you choose between reputation to a faction and your morality. 2. The game is grindy and the grind shows as your character becomes the undisputed GOD being able to become virtually unkillable and being able to put skills points in every skill and become the master of every playstyle. I have finished the game of OG gothic 3 (No mods or enhancements) at Level 77 And i still failed to do ANY quests in 2 large towns and failed reputation by killing one too many cities so I could've easily got to Level 80+. I started as a one handed shield Paladyn and throughout the middle of the game switched to a incredibly heavy and strong two handed Paladyn and by the end of the game, I became the most powerful Mage, who is summoning Meteors, Balls of fire, stopping time and summoning the most powerful companions like Golems and Demons. I solely could wipe out all towns by myself just as a mage but had the experience as a two handed and single handed warrior If I simply choose to. This makes the gameplay less boring as switching playstyles is simply thrilling and being the mage in this game (Late game) Is the best. I do recommend the game but has many flaws such as the game not working and having to install community patches, VERY, VERY ANNOYING ATTACK SPAMMING ENEMIES LIKE WOLVES, WOLVES AND WOLVES.

Disappearing enemies, enemies attacking you from air (you may say that there are no flying enemies, well wolves and other should't be able to attack you through walls etc neither) or attacking you from below you even though you are standing on a tall tower and there is no way they can reach you from the ground (without bows).

Combat is okay once you get used to the mechanics and sometimes it is painful when there are many enemies to face.

And the combat, oh god the combat. The Gothic series has never had the most polished combat in my opinion but Gothic 3 is a new level. Melee consists of getting killed in seconds by a wolf lurching forward in rapid succession or the wolf rapidly backstepping to dodge your every attack regardless of your weapons range. The same is true for other monsters. Human enemies are better and more in line with previous games but the combat still feels more loose and floaty compared to Gothic 1 and 2. Ranged combat is better but ascends to ""fine"" instead of garbage. I played a mage during my playtime. The spell selection is fine but the most interesting spells - as I found out online - are locked behind a choice that you wont make until the endgame. Prior to that your main damage is three single target spells different elements. I don't feel very invested in continuing if the cool AOE spells are only unlocked in the last few hours.

Beyond that the graphics - in my opinion - are aging worse than the previous games. I know that sounds weird but I think the early 3D of Gothic 1 and 2 has more charm than the XBOX 360 era look of this. That and the way the game fades in textures/models. At least in my game I had what I can only describe as a ""seam"" of blurry textures slowly unraveling as I moved forward to reveal the nicer versions. It was very distracting. Also the vegetation mainly just gets in the way and makes everything harder to find than it needs to be. I'd suggest turning vegetation quality to low if you do decide to play this for some reason.

I enjoyed Gothic 1 and 2 and I wanted to give this one a shot. I knew it was the black sheep of the series and now I know why. I know that not all of the blame is on the developers (there were issues with the publisher releasing the game early) but I can't recommend what was released to anyone really.

Most unique thing in this game is that you play as double agent. You are not just killing enemy, but you work for them, gaining trust, infiltrating them and slowly preparing coups. and damn is rewarding when you achieve coups!
You can play as honorless mercenary, or loyalist which is masquarading as mersenary.

Quests are perfect, there are no stupid, ridicolous quests like in assasins creeds or other child oriented games.
There are no quest markers, you must listen and use your navigation skills to find quest goals, you can not skip convercation and follow marker.

Orcs are not stupid or vile, they respect power, they also respect rebels who fight them and they hate mercenaries and cowardly humans who does not oppose theyr ocupation. they are pretty noble and respected enemy in my view.

Characters are charismatic and different. Almost every NPC has different character, both orks and rebels: some are smart, some stupid, some cowardly, some hatefull, some unexperiensed.... it is so interesting to explore and speak with different people.

* Well-crafted world with solid worldbuilding, visuals and soundscape
* Soundtrack is non-obtrusive enough to be bearable when hearing it for...66 hours

Cons:
* Combat can be frustrating, arguably moreso with community patch (make sure to read guidance documentation that comes with the patch to fine tune it as you see fit)
* Does get a little repetitive toward the end
* (Arguably) an odd power curve, depending on use of the community patch - in my case, a constant uphill battle until lategame in which I began slapping the shit out of everything easily enough.
* Abrupt ending/s - must've been getting towards ""out of funds"" or a publishing deadline there, which isn't rare. Still polished enough for what it was.

I probably would continue this game if I didn't get so many technical problems with it. 
For me, this started with insanly long load times, ranging up to two minutes for loading a game, which I saw others has trouble with but didn't have any fix for it.

Could only rotate with my mouse.
Found soon out that I should use cpt_1.75_testbranch. Okey, switching. My savegame doesn't work with it, of course. Found another guide for converting savegames. Didn't work. And while I've only played an 18 hour, the game is really not fun enough to start over again.

But there's a community patch now, and IMO the original is not as broken as everyone made it seem anyway. 

G3 has a very similar feeling to G1 and G2. There's a beautiful, hand-crafted, huge world with no loading zones and plenty of meaningful choices to make, beasts to hunt, quests to do, locks to pick, caskets to steal and skills to learn. There's just slightly more of everything, compared to G1 and G2.

I didn't really like starting with stats at 100 and a decent sword (I preferred G2's thin excuse for why the hero 'starts over' as a weakling), and I didn't like being dropped right into a big orc battle with a pop-up tutorial that freezes time, but if it bothers you too, you'll forget all about it once you get past that part, because there's no more of that after the initial little tutorial, and there's definitely a feeling of starting fresh, with lots of progression ahead of you and lots of wildlife you're too weak to beat right away (on hard, anyway).

Just don't install all the mods in advance! Especially any mods that add content or quests. No need to spoil your experience with badly written English, a lack of voice acting and a bunch of ""bonus items"". Get the community patch and the update pack (and the mouse inventory fix if you're on windows 10, and maybe the 4GB patch if you've got a 64-bit system), then wait until you've beaten the game once to install anything else. And don't turn ""Alternative balancing"" on for your first playthrough unless you're sure you want to be forced to only pursue one skill tree. (Way more fun to be able to put points where you want to in the early-to-mid game, instead of having to spend every point strategically and forego all the ""nice to have"" skills.)

Now you're ready to try it and get closure on Gothic's story...I have so many mixed feelings about this game.
First I made a negative review because coming back to it after years reminded me what it's truly like so I couldn't recommend it these days to anyone with clear conscience. Then I continued to play with a blush because of course I am nostalgic masochist with pink glasses so big they could snap someone else's neck if I gave them away and scrapped the review. Now I've beaten it yet again and here I am...I cannot recommend this mess to anyone not nostalgia driven with clear conscience.

This game isn't like previous 2 Gothic games. Most importantly this entry is unfinished (thanks JoWood...) and it's visible in every aspect of it. All the patches mentioned above are absolute must to make it any functional but even with those game is severely bug ridden, has massive stability issues (lag is your new boyfriend) and community ideas bring their own annoyances as well - so it's far from perfect.

Technical issues aside, that is this game like? I think it's best compared to an MMO. We visit a town, do generic quests of fetch/purge/kill with mere scraps of any story or even atmosphere relevance attached to them for reputation points...it's pretty much like there is no Gothic-like quests in GOTHIC 3...then we move on to next town in the world and we repeat that until we ran out of towns. Then we will be strong enough to ""side"" with a faction and do their specific quest...which means to annihilate the other one. So we visit X towns and murder every single person in there for more respect points.
In fact this is entire gameplay loop and the factions only ""kind of"" exist because you can murder whole game world and still beat the game in all 3 possible ways. Story and world is so open (or unfinished) that you just need to collect all artifacts and do specific thing with them, it doesn't matter do you get them through cooperation or just going full Kratos.

On the big picture this is what is, a shallow checklist do-er kind of game. Yet there is something in it that just makes you do all this somehow, prolly the same one that makes us play through MMOs,
I should probably say that melee combat combo system is terrible but with the patches and correct difficulty setting it makes you learn it and use somewhat skillfully, alternative AI setting surely forbids the attack spamming. Magic here is pretty great although maybe don't try it on Hard. I did that and always felt weak, but it's on me for playing on Hard...you can change difficulty in options at any time.

Community patches try to balance and enchance the gameplay and add to the story and lore with extra dialogue lines but in the end no amount of patches will finish this game. For this game to be what it was supposed to be it should be remade from the ground up.
If you want to give a try or get some closure, go for it but manage your expectations and DO get all these patches! You can choose between ""easy game easy life"" by playing with all community patch balance features off or have it more like old Gothic experience by enabling alternative balance and AI (these should be on by default however) so there is that I guess.",1619281118,1619942594,False,17,0,0.619939327239990234,0,True,False,False

The game is not anything like Gothic I or II, but it is a pretty interesting game standalone. Its extremely unique at what it does, however it isnt great at it. The whole conquering concept revolves around fighting everyone on your own and it isn't pretty. Enemy ranged attacks (crossbows and bows) stagger you and make every battle simply annoying. Magic spells take away 40% of your hp even if you have 80% resistance to the element and you have 500hp (and that's a whole lot). While most of the enemies - mostly non-humanoid will have LITERALLY INFINITE stunlocks that have rediculous hitbox and will make you just hate the sight of anything living. You on the other hand will have to deal with enemies always backing away from your attacks or just not get hit by them entirely. Ranged weapons such as a bow just will go through the enemies 70% of the time, you will have to learn which body parts are transparent and which aren't and aim very carefully if you'd like to inflict ANY type of damage. 
The game has 3 different paths that you can take - good, bad and neutral with different endings and objectives. Interesting interactions, very poor optimization and an absolutely boundless open world to explore.
This game has more visual bugs than anything you've ever played.
I think it's worth trying out and giving it a chance to experience the entire concept of conquering cities all by yourself, but if you don't enjoy the game after a few hours do not force yourself to finish it - the combat gets only more stale and boring, while the challange only reduces with gametime. I put a bunch of hours into the game and i do not regret any, for I'm certain i will put even more in the future. What keeps ME going is how unique it is, how interesting it is to play different classes, siding with different factions and just enjoy becoming stronger than opponents of your level with each level up. The game is type of a love-hate relationship because it has a lot of charm and personality, but it just doesn't feel finished. I Honestly would love a remaster that would completely redo all the fighting system, all the attack patterns all the spells and how they work, everything balancewise, but keep the story, keep the characters, keep the quests.
Summary:
Visuals, bugs, mechanics - Bothersome, but ignorable
Gameplay - Entertaining but repetitive
Story - Mediocre
Charm - A whole lot.

Gothic 3 biggest problems: 
- I really don't like the soundtrack is obnoxious, I ended up playing without music. The music feels intrusive and annoying. Too much epicness. 
- The flora is beautiful but something it's really underwhelming to travel through Myrtana.
- The Combat is awful. Gothic 1, 2 have a clunky combat but Gothic 3 is simple awful. I'm glad that I played as a Mage, but at the same time I had to wait for a long time to get Mana regeneration. Before getting the regeneration, it was slow and painful.
- Most of the quest are fetch quest, in general I don't mind fetch quest if there is a good reason to do it. They are alright but the game does not have the same writing than Elex or Gothic 2 / 1.
- This is the PB's game that I have played with the weakest Dialogues. The best thing about PB's games are the dialogues, most of the time it feels natural, something that I would expect. If the main character is an asshole, well in PB's game, the NPC are going to make sure that you know that. I love that.

The good things:
I personally don't find the map big. The map it's the best thing about this game. The reason it's that the map is very well organize. Each city has their own ecosystem, so for example if you are in Silden, everything that's near Silden is connected with Silden's story, quest etc So the game don't force you go from one place to another, you can easily explore each city and finish most of the quest and then go the next city. I love how well it's done.
It's true that for example Nordmar, most of the tim you are going to kill enemies or Varant is just a desert. But a part from Nordmar's labyrinth, it's not a long travel to go from one city to another one.

In general, I really had a good experience. I would recommend play the three games, mostly because the main story isvery well connected. I'm glad that I had the guts to play them. I've become a huge fans of Pyranha Bytes!",1614969952,1614969952,True,0,0,0.467009425163269043,0,True,False,False

Note: I am reviewing the game with the community patch pre-installed as that is the only way this game should be played nowadays. Also, if you are looking to play Gothic 3, do yourself a favor and also install QuestPack and ContentMod as that will truly enhance the game and make it infinitely more enjoyable.

Ah, Gothic 3, how magnificent you could have been.... If only the developers had enough time and resources, Gothic 3 could have gone into the annals of history as one of the best games of all time, but alas this was not meant to be.

Gothic franchise is like that one girlfriend that, at the beginning, you had an incredible connection with, but overtime it withered and subsequently, she sold herself to somebody else who treats her like utter sh*te and does not care about her. Gothic 3 is the ""withered"" phase in this analogy.

I harbor a tremendous amount of love for the original Gothic and Gothic 2 and consider them to be two of the greates RPGs of all time and, along with many others, was expecting (or hoping for) Gothic 3 to be a worthy successor and top the previous installments. Unfortunately, that was and is not the case as Piranha Bytes ran out of resources and time and were under severe pressure from Jowood, their publisher at the time. This has translated itself into a product that is incredibly ambitious title that only achieves about half´of what was promised and that half is in a pitiful state.

Still, Gothic 3 does manage to accomplish a few things that very few games do - non-linear open world, intriguing skill tree, versatile combat system but most importantly  - sense of true freedom. The complete lack of handholding along with Piranha Bytes's signature brilliantly crafted open world with excellent environmental storytelling and questing system that is truly unique. Gothic 3 takes be, who you want to be, choose any playstyle and complete the game as YOU want to a whole new level. The ability to complete vast majority of quests in any desired order and to complete them before picking them up mixed with huge open world that is varied and has 3 major areas - Vast desert Varant, the lush and green Myrtana and snowy, cold and unforgiving Nordmar. All of this combined offers unparalled levels of freedom of exploration, questing and growing as a character. This is the main reason why I was able to overlook Gothic 3 being bad at being a Gothic sequel, botched main storyline, lousy endings, overall shoddy state of the game that needed to be patched by an external team of passionate fans and broken combat system. Gothic 3 simply offers, what very few games do and that is exactly, why I recommend you playing it, whether you are a long-time fan of a Gothic universe or a newcomer - everyone can find something enjoyable in this game.

[b] [i] Positives [/i] [/b]

+ Huge, varied, living and breathing open world that offers true freedom
+ Liberal questing system
+ Graphics
+ Effects
+ Magic system and variety of spells
+ Skill tree with many options when it comes to character building
+ Large amount of content that last for over 60 hours
+ Enemy and animal variety
+ Loot
+ Choices and consequences
+ Interesting factions
+ Voice acting of orcs
+ Improved ranged combat

[b] [i] Neutral [/i] [/b]

+- Soundtrack is really hit or miss - while on its own it is absolutely terrific and it is obvious that Kai Rosenkranz really outdid himself, the problem is that it fits perfectly in certain areas of the game (such as Ishtar or Welcome to Varant...) but in other parts it does not fit at all as it is too epic for the pace of the game (tracks like Explore Myrtana, Vista Point or that infamous combat theme that will keep ringing in your ears long after finishing the game). Nevertheless, the fact remains that it is another incredibly piece of music.

[b] [i] Negatives [/i] [/b]

- The game is incredibly broken from top to bottom and even community patch can not save the shoddy foundation of the game - bugs, glitches, persistent crashes, alt-tab issues are very common occurance
- Melee Combat system really does not feel good - it feels too smooth, like you are spreading butter instead of cutting and/or stabbing and the feedback is unsatisfying
- Poor storyline and dialogues in both main and side quests
- Disappointing and rushed endings
- Too many unanswered questions
- Character - both their models and personalities are botched
- Repetitiveness
- Totally abhorrent performace - the engine is so screwed even PC from NASA could not run it without hiccups
- Voice acting of humans
- Terrible crime system where the game keeps track of how many items you have stole and subsequently after certain amount of things have been stole people magically know when you pick up a singualar coin and will be hostile",1614886382,1614959670,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The best quick summary of the experience is that it's the polar opposite of Gothic 2. Where ""Gothic 2 : Kick in the nuts Simulator"", Gothic 3 is ""Gothc: The Ubisoft Experience"". Gothic 2 is suffering until the game gets great, while Gothic 3 is kindof fun throughout. 

All of the improvements Gothic 2 did in world building, storytelling, and roleplaying experience are not present here. Gothic 3 feels like a large chunk of terrain that was plopped together to give you places to go and hundreds of fetch quests to make you feel like a puppy. There is supposedly a plotline about the war between orcs and humans, the loss of magic to the world, and artifacts that you collect to restore it... but in actuality you will just be exploring random cities and getting nuggets and clues every few hours. 

But where Gothic 2 was a painful slog to reach the point where you can start playing the game, this is actually feels like a game.  Your hero is sufficiently powerful to kill enemies, quests reward large amounts of XP, money flows freely both in profits and spending (At least before you have great weapons/armor), and skills are cheap enough that you can experiment and enjoy the game from hour one on.

The skill system is worth mentioning as the first implementation that felt well thought out and what I think they intended all along. Instead of some skills awkwardly being percentile and some owned/not owned you now have 5 or so point based stats and specific skills can be purchased based on those stats. The base stats can be increased through items and quests so that you aren't only spending the hard earned learning points.

I've seen a number of complaints about it being poorly balanced and the need for the community patch, but for a first-time player I disagree. The game is balanced to be casual and rewarding for a player... not to be hardcore. The community patch makes you specialize your hero where the core game lets you eventually be strong across the board. There are strategies to get OP fast, but they are strict rules about rush to X, collect Y, Save-scum until it drops Z and requires a level of mastery that a new player doesn't have yet. For a newbie like me, the balance patch doesn't add to the experience as much as work as a band-aid on one massive gaping wound of the design, The Combat.

The combat is broken and I don't mean its flawed with exploit potential, but fundamentally not-functionally and actively hinders the game as a whole and directly leads to my opinion on the game balance.

It doesn't matter whether you kill the enemy in one blow or a hundred if they get locked in place. Your 500 HP doesn't matter if those two level one wolf enemies take turns biting you so that you can't act. 

The entire combat system revolves around stun lock and animation speeds. Despite functionality to attack and block, a stamina system, etc, the only functional combat strategy is ""Mash attack and reload if you get hit first"". 

But, honestly, with PB games I've always accepted the janky to broken combat as coming with the territory. I'm actually enjoying the game around it. The bad mindless combat system hurts the experience, but its more of a forgettable part of the game than active damage.

Which brings me to the final recommendation question and its pretty typical PB for me. There is fun to be had so long as you go in knowing what to expect. I genuinely enjoyed the game and probably have another 20 hours of fun before I'll actually quit. 

But, for the average player, there are better alternatives to play first. And for fans of the earlier Gothic players this is not going to fill that niche.  But once you've played the better alternatives this is a good lower-middle tier way to spend your time.",1613155243,1613155243,False,14,1,0.599612534046173096,0,True,False,False

Years later I found the CD again and installed the game. I played through the game in a single session, went over to my friend and got the CD for Gothic 2. After 36 hours of nothing but Gothic, my mother basically forced me to go to bed, so I had to go on playing the next day. You probably get the idea how much I liked both games.

Along came Gothic 3 and it was a complete mess at launch, so I stayed away from it. Years later I decided to give it a try with all the community patches and what not. It kind of runs but is still laggy. I did not encounter any gamebreaking bugs, though. However, that does not mean that the game is good in any way. And it absolutely is not Gothic.

I looked at the available skills and decided to go for a mage. Unfortunately that was a horrible idea. You need so many stats to even get going as a mage. Unless you plan on picking up a guide to all the books and stone tablets increasing your ancient knowledge und just touring the entire map once to be able to actually cast something more than thrice before having to rest, there is no way to become a somewhat proper mage before mid- to lategame. Same goes for alchemy. If you don't want to waste a ton of levels worth of learning points, you should tour the world once to read all the alchemy books, so you can at least craft mana potions.
I did not tour the world and decided to just play the game as it was intended, trying to get by with bow and sword until I could actually play a mage. Which worked incredibly well. All you need are enough arrows and then you shoot while slowly walking backwards, completely abusing the clunky combat system and avoiding pretty much every enemy melee hit due to horrible hitboxes. However, that is absolutely dull. Unfortunately melee combat was even worse, so I stuck with the only proper way to fight.

After 14 hours of running around doing boring kill/fetch/messenger quests for irrelevant characters without even a remotely meaningful story, I felt exhausted. I also began to wonder why there were more chests than living humans in this world and I really should not have looked it up. But I did, so I'll just put up that warning here. Those chests basically are the loot. You can get some food, coins and the equipped weapons of your enemies, but scrolls and all are placed in those chests. They are filled randomly, which makes opening them a mostly worthless gamble. Even worse are the metal chests, which are not random but have a strict loot order based on how many you opened before. It does not matter if you fight the hardest mobs to get to the chest, it only matters that you grind them all. At that moment I felt like I accidently bought a bad MMO that never made it to live servers. There was just no thought put into the loot placement and that made any kind of exploration disappointing.
Did I mention that you need to put a few levels worth of learning points into thief skills to even be able to open those metal chests which are basically a mandatory grind if you want endgame gear? Yeah, Gothic 3 really does not want you to be a mage ;)

I just don't feel it. The Gothic felling that gripped me for 36 hours straight across two games is completely missing in the third game. It's an open world quest hub grind with generic quests, lackluster story and miserable combat. The miserable combat was always there, but Gothic 3 falls flat in any other aspect that might be redeeming. It could still serve as a massive time sink for some, but if you are looking for that, you might as well play a proper mmo with good performance and fun combat.",1611442846,1611442846,False,15,0,0.526987969875335693,0,True,False,False

But now, even with all the comunity patches and upgrades the game stutters like creazy even on great rigs.
There is no autosave during entering and exiting towns, there is no autosave period. It will make you lose your mind when getting killed by the most unlikely of monsters after a short stroll outside any town.
The balancing like any other Gothic Game is allover the place, for example BloodFlies are as deadly and hard as Orcs or Humans. Makes sense?
The combat is boring, also upgrading to MASTER SWORDSMAN does pritty much nothing, same goes for Strenght and HUNTING (The new Dexterity). This leaves most of the perks complitly useless and unnecesery.
Dont get me into the dual wield perk.... just dont get it ok, go with the heavy weapons and magic...
Also why are all NPC's Mens? Seriously, Gothic 1 ok it was in a penal colony. Gothic 2 Had many females with actual dialogue and missions. Gothic 3 on the other hand is a freaking sausage fest and everyone is boring as hell.

Gothic 3 was the first RPG that I played and with time passing I finally decided to buy it, even though all the recommendations said it wasn't worth it 'cause of all the bugs... and I agree (on some topics).

I love this game, surely spent more then 120 hours with a few replays but I will go different routes, since there is so much open options. The game is difficult since the glitches and bugs get into the way of the enjoyable experience. I love the freedom you get with it, you get the main quest right off the bat and since then you play through side quests following with hints thwart the main story. It is never really clear and some side quests can be annoying as hell, but I don't mind it.

If I would divide into a pros and cons section I would say:

Pros:
- Old animations with satisfying third person
- Hours of playable content with lots of decisions based on the players choices
- Wide world with many hidden loot
- Various items and abilities meant for certain classes

Cons:
- Glitchy and tends to shut down if you alt+tab
- Few confusing side quests
- Monotone characters

I would recommend this game since it becomes greatly improved with the community patch found on web browsers.

The spells in this game are pretty awesome with the aggro system. The atmosphere in this game is so damn thick you could cut a slice of it and cook it over a campfire.

After all the differences, it was just fine with me. The fact of a story plot that takes us to a whole new territory, it was my sub-reason for the game to have all the new graphics, engine, and looks overall. Also got to mention that I was strongly addicted as well as entertained by game's new ragdoll physics. I remember fighting folks on a high grounds and cliffs just to watch their bodies fall down. And, again, as for back then, it was such a funny thing for me to do. :D
Gothic 3 is still gets recognized for it's soundtrack. For a reason, absolutely.
My memories for this part - is that i played Gothic 3 via low end PC, and every 'loading' screen took me up to 5 minutes to get through. So I know the main theme pretty well. To this day, this music track can just freeze me in tears and shivers. :x
My positive impression has a lot of 'nostalgic' in it. It is what it is. I knew first two games already. I was not any picky back then and I just wanted the story to go on.
The whole approach to Gothic 3 right now, takes back in time to winter of 2006. Christmas' Eve. Night time. And it's just me, stranding somewhere in Nordmar with buddy Gorn, fighting orcs.
There's so much about this game i'd really like just to talk about. Mostly, to remember. With a bitter feel of days long gone.
So let it be enough already to leave a positive review.
I see, just as i think of Gothic 2 as Terminator 2, a third game installation can be described as Terminator 3 of a movie franchise. It has lost a lot, such a step back from a first two. From their raw, pure art and integrity.. but it still has something. It is still our hero in his journey with his buddies from so d^mn long ago. It was still us in another part of a beautiful game to make us company in our moments of our lives. Through all good and bad. From wild boars to music and environments. From killing milk cows, to helping old Jack..
This game is full of bugs, disappearting objects that may ruin your gameplay. Doubtful quests. In-combat abuses, etc..
But one thing that always been a savior.. Remember Gothic 2 had a thing called a ""Nostalgia bonus""? I think it's that mysterious, unseen cloudy something, that Gothic 3 has carried well. Which ultimately, as to me, is one of a kind .. experience to get. From just a video game.
We can talk about it more. Just head to Cape Dun. You can find me there. Near the warehouse. By the campfire. I think I might find an extra bottle of booze with some fried meat pieces. :)
Well, now... Will you pardon me my grammar? We'll see. But may one thing to be certain. May all be well.",1606595879,1606595879,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gothic 3 is a good game in itself but not so great compared to Gothic 2 in my opinion.

Side quests are somewhat repetative and main missions aren't satisfying. You have to search for different items in order to achieve the goal...

Installing community patch is a must. Community patch solves most of the problems except stuttering and fps drops. (Yes, I also tried ge3.ini file tweaking.)

Some people say they have problems with a mouse but I didn't face any mouse problem with community patch 1.75.14.

I can easily recommend it to Gothic fanboys like me but when it comes to other people... I don't know.

The level of freedom is unprecedented in any other open world RPG I've played, I ended up completing the main story in comepletely the wrong order and locking myself out of some questlines after making the orcs hostile to me far too early... but you know what? I still got to beat the game and really get the feeling that not many people will experience the game in the same way I did. So that's really special.

It does have issues, The combat can be fun but is very often frustrating, especially when fighting certain wildlife that can interrupt your attacks constantly.  And I'll admit that I found myself playing just to beat the game rather than because I really enjoyed it, but this was like 70 hours in? up until that point I was just happy to be in the world. There's something about knowing that every action you take is permanent that makes being lost kind of fun. Every enemy you kill will stay dead, every plant you pick up will remain picked. So mindlessly wandering around means clearing out wildlife and enemies to make the place safer when you have to come back here for a quest. or better yet, maybe you'll stumble across a quest objective for a quest you haven't discovered yet, but will still be rewarded for completing it.

The key locations, where the main quests are revealed, are in isolated hard-to-reach areas and you'll have to develop your character dozens of hours to get those places (at least with the Community Patch's Alternative Balancing which is on by default). Until then, the game feels pointless and directionless.

Even with the latest Community Patch, the game is rather buggy and unbalanced. For example, my companions got lost from time to time, sometimes the camera acted weirdly during conversations and the default voice level of NPCs was way too loud. Earning wealth is also somewhat unbalanced - you can get rich very easily by selling deserted orc weapons after each battle.

What's more, I can't remember playing as confusing game as this. Especially the reputation system was quite difficult for me to understand as it was not explained well in the manual. The system is not very realistic, because you can freely do quests for all factions and your earned reputation points cannot decrease (even if you kill a chieftain of the faction!). Also, the quest mechanics were pretty odd; not only you'll get a reward once you complete a quest, but you'll also need to remember to return to the quest giver to get a second reward.

There are no map markers. This would be fine if NPCs would give you better directions to your targets and the map would be in higher quality. Also, for some reason the roads are invisible or very hard to see in Varant and Nordmar - travelling around, especially in the latter area, was a nightmare!

The game feels like a production milestone so here's some tips to play it and still experience the story and the end to the gothic series.

>First Download the Community Patch and Update Patch, remember there's NO VANILA GOTHIC 3, the game wasn't done and the devs were forced to make the game a TES clone so the community finished the game for the devs! So go on ahead and apply all their patches and features mods, UP and CP are the best and the ones officially endorsed by the original devs.

> CP = community patch, bug fix and AI fix
> UP = update patch, fixes more bugs and the AI even more, makes combat better by adding RISEN 1 features, which is good! Again, there's no vanila gothic 3, changes like this are ok!

Why should you play it if it's unfinished? well, cus the story is there, the characters and world are more or less working and you can see how an Orc dictatorship works in pretty good detail, mirroring the Nazi ocupation of many countries, where a police state was established but the locals would both become slaves and be adapted into the society of those who conquered them, great stuff!

Should you buy it? Maybe, only if you care about the gothic series, but it kinda sucks, so you've been warned  XD

You get to liberate cities for the rebels or conquer Myrtana for the orcs, same goes for the Varant with the rebels vs hashishins and finally liberating all of Nordmar from the orcs and subsequently helping the clans feel safe in their lands once more. 

The combat system is pretty clunky, you just mash LMB until your opponent dies preferably with the longest reach weapon you can get your hands on(if you're playing as a warrior that is), there's a faster RMB attack but you hardly even need it; this is one of the games that you do NOT want the high ground but the exact opposite to just stun-lock your enemy to death.

The story is mildly interesting so to say, you're the hero that the king needs to drive back the orcs from his land; you can however choose to side with the orcs or Xardas for one of the 3 potential endings. You also have your group of friends that you made along the way in gothic 1 & 2 but just briefly at the start of the game, then they just scatter into different parts of the map and you'll meet them eventually and you'll do some quests with/for them.

The graphics didn't age well but there's mods that solves that which are 1 google search away from you. There're many things that are subpar compared to the other gothics like voice acting, factions design and more but if there's 1 thing in this game that i can name and is on par with the other 2 gothic games : its the soundtrack. I love every bit and piece of it, its memorable and its a joy to listen to while exploring.

Even with its big errors caused by time constrain from publishers to finish the game, for me it still has that gothic feeling to it.

Gothic 1 & 2 being one of the best RPGs ever released engrossed me once again even if I completed them multiple times over a decade ago. Once again I had so much fun as with few other games. Then it became time for Gothic 3.

It's even worse than I remember it and I didn't finish it when I bought it on release, nor I am going to finish it now. It's extremely buggy, bland and boring. Even if you use Community Patch 1.75.

Remember how amazing storytelling and quests were in Gothics? How much attention to details was given? How even simplest tasks had a story you could recall and inscribed memories? Gothic 3 throws it all out the window for copy-pasted quests and locations.

I do not mean it figuratively. The entire world is filled with many towns. You can traverse through three different kingdoms/areas - from their farms to their capitals. The problem is: They all have the very same quests to get +++ reputation, so you can meet the leader, do a quest for him and get an artifact that you need to collect from another fed-ex quest (from Xardas/Rhobar). ALL quests are extremely simplistic and devoid of story. You meet many people, no matter if these are old friend NPCs, the king or just random people on the street - they all have only very few uninteresting lines that just tell you what to do for their fed-ex quest, and after you complete it you forget about them. There are no stories told. Have you seen the outro of Gothic 2 and you had many questions? Now when you meet Xardas he only says ""I devoured the power of dragons! Now bring me 6 artifacts"". The same if you meet the king himself: ""We lost the war, so now I need 6 artifacts!"". 

Instead of faction choice, now you get +++ points in factions by doing the same extremely basic tasks or freeing towns (where you just kill all orcs in a town). Mentioning orcs, I should also add that the terrifying orcs of Gothic 1/2 with their own language and tribal culture were replaced with ""intelligent"" orcs that are exactly like humans, but bigger and greener/more blue.

The main story I cannot criticize because it doesn't exist. You are just thrown into the world with copy-pasted everything repeating same quest over and over again. By chance you should gather all the artifacts at some point and bring them somewhere to finish the game, but I had no patience to do so. I endured through a lot of trashy games, but this one is too much. Except decent music it has no positive aspects. There is literally no motive to play it, MMOs are way more varied in quests and elaborate in their story. 

If only at least it was a decent walking simulator. However, all surroundings and environments are also just copy-paste and there is no reason for exploration. This game is the opus magnum of copy-paste. It is the embodiment of repeatability. I have never in my life played a game that is even half as protracting. Even for a fan of original Gothics this game is pure garbage.

I won't even go through trouble of describing how technically bad this game is and constantly sutters for 1-3 seconds even on a modern NVMe SSD with 4 core CPU and decently powerful GPU. 

Nor will I go into details of my confusion how are orcs and humans procreating... there are no children and practically no women in any of the available countries! All populations are solely male... I guess women only lived on the island where Gothic 1 and 2 took place. And ports? None whatsoever, apparently Khorinis had the only port in the known world.

I cannot recommend it to anyone. Not for any price, not for any time. Gothic 3 is just terrible game in practically every aspect and playing it feels like an unrewarding chore. It it beyond my grasp how people who made original Gothics could make this junk. It is one of the worst RPGs I have ever played.",1599331248,1599374363,False,33,2,0.651223361492156982,0,True,False,False

This is the game that I been waiting longer for than anything else...
This is the game that made me...
This is the game that have BROKEN MY NOSTALGIA!!!

When i get Gothic 3 for the first time I was 15, so hyped that i even didn't care what was that game about. Everybode including me, couldn't wait to see farther adventure of nameless hero and his... lets call them friends. And that day came. Gothic 3 arrived on shop shelves, where everybody was talking about it, soundtrack been already available which just increased need for the Title. The game itsels was beautiful. Basically there was no better graphics for next 2 years. However i never managed to finish it back then. Game crash with artifact didn't allowed me to. After that i was discouraged to start it all over again. But i tried many times. Sadly i was finding game boring, or there was any brand new title that I raplaced it or (last time) I had system crush forced me to format my hardrive. But when i decited to buy Gothic 3 on steam at winter sale it changed... pretty much.

First of all noticed that i was playing marathon. After finishing great gothic 1 and 2 RN, the time has come for third one. And i have to admit it was impressive even after 12 years.

Gothic 3 is direct seuqel to first 2 previoused games. It tells about fantasy world and nameless hero who's been trhown to prison - colony surrounded with magic barrier where you could only enter but you never would get out. Obviously our hero managed to do that and after many adventures. Leaved an Isle called Khorins and set of to main continent - Myrtana, where the new adventure begins.

I don't know if you can compare graphics with Witcher 3 or new Assassin's Creed. But Gothic's 3 desing still look nice to an eye and its quite rich. - Tree's, grasses, waterfalls, mountains full of snow and buring desert sunds. This is all impresive when its filled with different wild animals and lots of caves and other secret areas. Exploration is really enjoyable in gothic and to be honest you could spend hours for that, just to find another chest or whatever.

Another reason why I used to love this game is Soundtrack. Yes, i don't know if anybody care but Kai Rosenkranz' music is perhaps one of the best game soundtracks of all time. To me it's even the best. It is so good, that I could recomend the game only for the masterpiece. Strong, soft, emotional, climatic, sensitive... Just something that would be soundtrack also of your life. For many propably was...

I have to admit that voice acting isn't bad either, it isn't as good as music or graphics but still i finding it better than oblivion that time

But after these 2 aspects (Graphics and audio) now its getting only worse...

Gothic series been highly based on story, and even the world was open, there always was rich line that encaured us to meet farther actions of nameless hero. In this game you can't find anything like this. There is no more story line, the game has transformed in Single-Player MMO where the only think you do is to take something from someone and give that back, beat somebody's face, kill someone etc which gives us reputation. (Some sort of World of Warcraft) which I believe is good. But only for the begining. There is no any storyline so there isnt secound and third chapter where you leave all stupid quest behind and start doing something what really matters. It was really annoing where at 55 level you are collecting water for some idiot. And after that i wanted to finish game as fast as possible.

Apart that, Gothic 3 have broken mechanics. AI is really stupid, fighting sistem too character development broken some you cant complete some quests and what's worse, its very easy to get a game crush. 
For example: Developers are expected that we will be bouncing town and cities, which was a great idea. However very often in this towns there are important items carried with characters that would flee after the town is bounced. In other words it doesn't allow you to finish the game. Or you don't have teachers, therefore you cant learn new abalities etc...

Gothic 3 just been released two early. Game is lagging, no proper story, no ending, broken mechanics, it becoming dull later on. I was about to extremely happy because of ""beating this game"" however i got only pissed off.

----------------------------------
Gothic 3 is a game that somehow went under my radar when it came out all those years ago and now I finally found some time to make up for it. Unfortunately, I've had a frustrating and clunky experience that made me wish I was playing Gothic I or II instead. Gothic III is a case of wasted potential and a game ruined by the developers’ unrealistic ambitions. Everything is supposed to be bigger and better in this game but the lack of overall polish simply kills it. It’s a real shame, this game could have been so much more. 

What’s bad:
- frustrating and broken melee combat, 
- compared to I and II - weak story and writing,
- a barrage of repetitive, uninspired and unchallenging FedEx sidequests, 
- slow and unrewarding character progression, 
- ridiculous glitches that break immersion every 30 seconds, 
- the game is unoptimized and will lag on a modern gaming PC,
- overall lack of polish.

What’s good:
- beautiful soundtrack by Kai Rosenkranz,
- great visuals with many unique locations and varying environments, 
- magic and archery are pretty fun,
- interesting faction and reputation system with no emphasis on good or evil choices – it’s a shame the world is so shallow, the game could have shined here.

As much as nostalgia has a role to play on this title, Gothic 2 being my first real RPG on my own PC, it also reminds me why Elder Scrolls was always better. 
It was back when Oblivion and Gothic 3 both had to come out and they released Gothic too fast maybe, to compete with the other. It wasn't even close, the only thing that kept me from playing Oblivion immediately was the lack of a good GPU. Besides that there is no comparison. You have one broken game vs a legit jewel with tried and trusted combat from Morrowind, improved. 

I even have the community patch since apparently otherwise you can't play. And I have to say, I never got so mad at an RPG in my life. Dying to stupid combat mechanics, no autosave so you had to waste hours on loading previous saves, enemies that walk through the ground, losing your favorite weapon cause it fell through the ground, one of the best armors in the game and skill to double your resistances and you still take way too much damage. The pathfinding of the AI is something you see in old titles, enemies hit you through walls or stones or from a mile away (in melee) like in shit souls series, bugged quests, NPCs dying stupidly and losing you your quest.
Stuttering like I don't have a 1080ti and the game is from 2022. Horrible. Empty landscapes, tents or houses as empty as in Gothic 2, which was fine in Gothic 2, but you can't seriously do the same years later and expect people to say ""yes this is okay"".

The good: 
That being said and I can seriously say I had more fun and less bugs in Fallout 76 on release than I had with this game, 100 patches and community fixes later. 
At least there are NO CRASHES. I mean I can even alt tab and watch movies and the game rarely gets stuck. 
The world is huge and for those that never played it before it can hold many secrets, cool new places. A lot to explore. Teleporter stones to every location. 
It's a Gothic title, Gothic universe. You get closure on your story. Tho they made an expansion too, for money only.
Decent system for skills and such, even tho way too little spells.

the story is eh, and the beliar and innos endings are stupid, in the innos ending you gather some artifacts, place them down and get a cutscene. thats it. the adanos ending is the best and ends the series on a melancholy note whilst ending the story set up by the first 2 games nicely.

alot of the game lacks, especially the frozen northern area you reach at the end of the game. the main story is annoying because to act it out in order you are expected to go from the southernmost point of the map to the northenmost point, before getting your task and going back into the main world to complete it. if you choose instead to do the normal thing and side with a faction and do their quests you spend the game doing the same few things the whole game:

1: go to town
2: talk to people in town
3: (if you side with rebels/nomads) attack town, liberating it
4: (if you side with orcs/hashishin) attack rebel base, killing the rebellion

there are a few other sidequests that are ok too, but none of them reach the heights of the first 2 games.

To begin with, I finished the game the day I am writing this review, going for dexterity Archer build with Innos Path. 

And oh Innos, what was this waste of ~ 60 hours of my life. It got me to a point that I was wanting to abandon it, but it caught me later in game and I wanted to finish what I started. I didn't finished Arcania nor Forsaken Gods expansion, yet it was the worst Gothic game I played in the franchise. The game isn't even working nowadays ( I have Windows 10 on my gaming stuff ) and needs to download and install community patch. After that, what will stick you the most is A LOT OF everything. a lot of early stats, a lot of perks some which aren't even working properly, a lot of enemies and a lot of quests.

Game has a city structure which is monotic, you need to get 75% of reputation to progress and ""mark"" this place as completed. After finishing up all quests and tasks, you won't be coming to this place for the rest of the game so you move to the next place and repeat the process. Scaling is rather meaningless, you will get tons of stuff anyway. Between the cities, you will need to slay ~50 monsters if you want to travel, ~100 if you want to clear area. 

I'll skip about bullshit dialogues ( example: you pay guy 5k gold to be a better archer. He says you to become better archer and whoah, magic is done, you are better now ). You don't even remember names of ppl from previous city anyway. And oh, trailing missions, they are back and even worse than in Assassin's Creed. Your guy will walk in a straight line from A point to B point without paying attention of his surroundings and if he dies, quest is failed and unavailable to repeat. Prepare to spamming f5 key each minute if you want him to live long enough to finish it. 

And oh, combat. Dunno if I am a retard or I just didn't get the point of fighting systems, so listen from mine point of view as an archer. If you want to use ranged attack on group of enemies, all group will attack you and you'll slay at most 3 of a kind, depends on enemy. What that means is other ones from a group will get to you. Therefore, you will have to switch to melee attacks, since you can't kite them for eternity. And each character has it's own damage animation, which can be cancelled by another damage and prolonged the stunlock. Now imagine hunting 8 wolfs, taking down 3 of them and getting stunlocked to death no matter how strong you are, if you are unlucky enough. That's doable and learnable sooner or later, but at some point of the game, you will fight with humanoids, which fall into melee ones, ranged and mages. Getting stunlocked by ranged attacks and melee attacks to be finished by 1/2 spells by mages. 

I don't want to go through this anymore in my life, and I certainly don't want other people to suffer as I suffered. If you wish to give it a try, don't bother unless you want to take a Gothic fan test.",1590951033,1590951033,False,1,1,0.498806685209274292,0,True,False,False

When it originally came out, it was almost unplayable because of bugs and terrible performance. I worked 2 summers in a factory during school breaks just to have a PC that can handle this game, and it was absolutely worth it.
Despite the bugs and issues, and had tons and tons of fun with this game, and even though it is not as grey and dark as Gothic 1-2 (which are among my favourite games), the graphics, the story, the gameplay, the complexity and the whole atmosphere they created have blown my mind away. I spent lots of time exploring from snowy mountains to dry deserts and I enjoyed every moment of it.
Now I installed it again after so many years, and I am glad to see that thanks to the community patches, it still stands the test of time.

The mouse won't respond in game. it works on the menus but when you're actually playing, it doesn't work at all. you'll have to assign a bunch of keyboard shortcuts. So it doesn't even really work.

that's fair and well and all but this was released on a modern gaming service so the developers should have patched it themselves so it would work on modern machines.

39500,62251682,76561198338072999,127,22,4087,0,3731,1703109981,"As much as this game is a departure from the first 2 Gothic-games, it still is a good game, with great atmosphere, a large, immersive, detailed world to explore, really well-written dialogs with some tongue-in-cheek humor here and there. Growing up, this was the first RPG I've ever played and I have spent more than a few hundred hours with it in my lifetime, so after not having the CD anymore, I've bought it here without a second thought. In spite of all this, I'm going to try and write an unbiased review.

Positives:

+ Large open world, where the player is free to go wherever they want, without any artificial barrier (save for the upper district of cities and one city in particular)
+ Despite having lots of cities and villages (for its time), all of them feel different and look different from one another as well. You can tell if a city used to be a fort or an agricultural center just by its surroundings
+ In true PB fashion, there are lots of hidden pathways, items, caves and the like off the beaten path and exploration is worth it
+ Despite a lot of quests being fetch quests, they at least feel justified and fit into the game world
+ Even though I've played it through for the 6th time and knew almost everything by heart, it took me 40+ hours to complete the game (aimed to do all quests, though)
+ Some cheeky dialogues
+ Because of the world's size and general structure, exploration is highly encouraged and almost always rewarded accordingly
+ People and structures being where they are make sense, nothing feels out-of-place.
+ No character is immortal in the game, everyone is killable (except Beliar and Innos, who are not even proper characters, as the Nameless Hero communicates with them through their shrines)
+ Every dialogue is voice-acted.

Negatives:

- Even with the Community Patch, fighting animalc, especially wolves and boars can be a pain in the neck
- Two-Handed melee characters can get their hands on the best weapon in the game early, and having met its requirements, won't switch to another/more powerful weapon, so combat becomes repetitive and they won't get better weapons
- Summoning magic is still somewhat useless, as is at least a third of all spells, or at least very situational
- As much as the CP made the game better, it removed the mechanic where enemies/the player take damage while blocking if out of stamina and gave the enemies seemingly endless stamina, thus making melee combat more tedious and the spinning attacks borderline useless, because if it hits an enemy's block, the spin stops. This becomes very noticeable during freeing/annihilating towns
- No matter your class, combat will, at some point, become repetitive
- Main story is more loose, or even non-existent, compared to the first 2 installments (although this encourages more free shaping of your character from a role-playing perspective) and is basically a huge fetch quest, at the end of which you may decide who out of 3 people you give the collected stuff
- Due to NPC speed, the „Take X to Y!” or „Follow X to Y!” quests will get tedious and frustrating at some point.
- Some quests require an immense amount of backtracking, which is fine for the first playthrough or until you familiarize yourself with the map, but on subsequent playthroughs, you will get bored of them.
- Some skills are just not worth learning.
- Navigation in Nordmar. No, really, it's a negative. Believe me. Even a trained arctic search&rescue team equipped with GPS would get lost there.

Verdict:

If you love huge , sprawling RPG games, try it! This game is worth your money. Gothic 3 is by no means a perfect game, nor was it ever that. But it's a unique experience with that familiar PB feeling and love towards their own game and world.It has its fair share of problems, which mainly stem from it being a little bit too ambitious for its time, and it got torn a new one because of it's buggy mess of a launch, still, with the Community Patch thanks to these amazing guys, it's playable and represents more what it wanted to be at first. The best way to put it is this: Gothic 3 is a great RPG game, just not a great Gothic-game, at least not if you jump into it with expectations from the first 2 games. Still it deserves a place iamong the good and worthwhile RPG games because of its truly unique world, interesting and funny character roster and a lore/story that, albeit a bit basic, has only a few plot-holes, if at all. So jump into its world and have fun annihilating or saving it with the elements or with raw steel!",1579735059,1579735059,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To me, 14 years after playing it for the first time, this is still the best open world game ever created.
The freedom is absolute, you can waltz between factions doing anything that suits your fancy, and the game will still make sense somehow.
You can ignore factions, you can miss a lot of stuff, and yet craft your own adventure in the huge world of Myrtana.
This is one game that you can really play your way, no matter how crazy your way is.

The combat is quite bad, the animations are trash, the main character is so ugly its beautiful, and the voice acting is so silly that it becomes endearing.

The beauty of this game is not its combat system (which is bad-ish but quite rewarding), its not the production values (clumsy main character and clumsy/silly animations and voice acting), the beauty of this game is the freedom you have in exploring a vast world, and the unequaled freedom of choices at your disposal.
A complex world with hidden caves and NPCs and quests and treasure at every corner.

This is the only game i played where i actually liked the orcs more than i liked the humans, and the orcs are not ""humanized"" as in Two Worlds 2.
They have a distinct culture and code of honor and traits that make them so special.

Could write a huge wall of text describing this game, but the essential is this:
If you manage to see past the clumsy combat and animations and low production values, you will go down the rabbit hole into a free world full of wonders that no other game was able to re-create, not even the later (and superior) Piranha Bytes products, like the great Risen series or the outstanding Elex.

This game is one or the only game with a real feeling of freedom that you can get right now.
ALL NPC can be killed even some from the main quest's, everyone can die and will not respawn, even bandits will not respawn after being killed. 
ALL animals, monsters and creature can be killed and only respawn after 60 game days and not all at ones just 2 or 3 will respawn again to give the world a bit more life.
You will see animals/creatures respawning only after more or less 60 hours, the game respects your time, no bs respawning enemies every 5 minutes.

The game is from 2006 but undesrtood the importance of immersion and does not have any loading screen after loading in to the game.
Every building cave and town are open without any loading screen, something that even today many games are not capable to do and we are talking about 20 towns and 200 dungeons.

You can work for everyone, change your opinions every time in any moment, be loyal or betray, give or steal, help or kill, build or destroy. You can spy both sides, steal both sides make what ever you want and still get real consequences.

Orcs and humans feel real!
Guards don't kill you for stealing but they will punish you and then take your money and sword, they will even warn you if you don't respect them.
you can even conspire with the rebels and destroy towns.

Like many, I was monumentally disappointed by Gothic 3 when it first came out -- and not just due to the bugs. Its overall design is so different from Gothic 1 & 2 that it just doesn't sit well alongside them. On the surface it seems to lack something in character and soul compared to the first two games, since most of its quests amount to ""fetch this"" or ""kill those,"" and the story basically doesn't exist.

It continues to amaze and boggle me, then, that I return to this game more than I do Gothic 1 & 2. I replay this at least once every year. When it released I was a 17 year old boy going to school and living with my family. Now, I'm a 30 year old man living far away in my own home with my own new family. Gothic 3 has remained a sort of beacon of familiarity over the 13ish years since its release. 

Gothic 3 feels like home. It turns out that it very much has its own charm and character. Comparing it to Gothic 1 & 2 just isn't productive. Ultimately, they're different types of games. The expanse of the world in Gothic 3, coupled with its static predictability and entirely hand-crafted landscape, makes it a joy to return to. 

If the 1st playthrough of Gothic 3 is an overwhelming and mysterious adventure, the 20th is a sort of calming rote. Ticking off quests is somehow so satisfying, especially when you know where everything already is and you can try to cram a few in in a single trip out of town. Efficiency in organising your tasks becomes its own game. 

Every different little cave in the game, I remember, and look forward to. Every NPC's sassy dialogue, every hidden treasure chest, every monster around every corner,  every time I break through the ranks of orcs and enter the castle of Vengard.

Every time I enter the snowy region of Nordmar for the first time, I'm blown away again by its sheer size, complexity and the feeling of isolation and wilderness. To this date, no other game has captured this type of landscape so vividly. Try as I might, I simply can't find my way around Nordmar, even after all this time, even using a map. Every time I set foot out of a village, I'm finding something or somewhere new, and suddenly I'm lost, trying to retrace my steps. In some games I would call this bad level design, and if used everywhere I'd think that the case, but its used to great effect in Nordmar, whilst the rest of the world feels relatively easy to traverse.

Every time I make the journey south to the scorching desert of Varant for the first time, I'm likewise exhilarated. The change in music, the flat yellow sand as far as the eye can see, the culture of the people, the huge groups of monsters roaming the dunes, the abundant gold...

There's also something to be said for Gothic 3's difficulty level, which is at once ridiculously easy and brutally hard. It somehow defies categorisation. You can always find a way to win any fight in the game no matter what level you are, but you'll also die swearing 20 times trying to pull it off, likewise no matter what level you are. That's not to say levelling up doesn't making you far stronger... It's just easy to underestimate your opponents, and you'll find yourself taking on more and more at once.

The game also plays so differently depending on your build. As a warrior, you're focused on footwork and positioning, the timing of your swings, trying to hit multiple enemies in one shot. As a mage, the game becomes resource management: efficiently deciding when and how to use your spells, picking off enemies gradually with arrows, saving up and working towards earning the coveted Mana Regeneration skill later in the game, at which point you become a living god. 

I wouldn't trade Gothic 3 for anything. This game is a terrible, disastrous masterpiece.",1577567655,1577567655,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Thanks to JoWooD, the game was launched before was ready, so in order to have a good experience, i recommend to install the community path and play with AB(alternative balancing), the path fixes most bugs and the AB is to make the game harder. AB makes far harder to obtain town nuking spells like Fire Rain and raises his mana consumption, also adds diminishing returns from AK above 250 requiring 2 LP per AK point. If you wanna a power fantasy, play without AB, if you wanna challenge, play with AB.

This game has good graphics and the good of old school RPG's. - In other words, no cooldowns, no your boot determine your char's IQ or muscle mass, no ludicrous inflated numbers, no railroading, no assuming that the player is a idiot, no spells that would make no sense to exist, like the spell who transform iron ore into gold ore in skyrim. It would destroy any gold based economy, no carnavalesque bikini armor with 50kg paldrons and 100kg open helms only a immersive world to explore.

[h1]The BEST = Immersion & Progression [/h1]

Immersion on Gothic games is the main ""pro"". And the sense of progression is also amazing.  When i learned Ice Lance, i could cast it 6~3 times per rest(3 if charged - 6 normal) dealing almost no damage, had no mana regen or other amazing spells(in order to learn a water magic spell, you need money, a water mage who know the spell and is willing to teach you and enough ancient knowledge to learn the spell. AK is learned by reading books, by paying to mages teach you AK or reading stone tablets). At end game, i was able to nuke cities out of existence with deadly hailstorms, tame even shadowbeasts, conjure golems, make the time slower in a area of effect, etc.

I do love all the Gothic series. The improve graphic is a welcome change but not the combat system, it is a little blocky/clunky for my taste and sometimes, it can be downright difficult when you're playing it for the first time. It does give you a whole different feel to the third game, and I like how all the recurring characters are back in action. Of course, you play as the nameless hero who gets push aside every time he tries to mention his real name LOL The other issue which I have a HUGE problem is, from time to time, the game lags or stutters in random parts which affects the whole gameplay, it is such a mood killer and it can really REALLY frustrating especially you're in-combat (REALLY FRUSTRATING /FLIPSTABLE). Early in the game, they put you in battle with a horde of Orcs, but at least you get to fight alongside with other NPCs BUT it doesn't mean it get any easier. When I first started playing it I didn't know or understand the control at all, the other NPCs did most of the killing while I just stand there like an idiot dodging or swinging aimlessly.

As I mentioned before, the improved graphics are a huge welcome to the game. The scenery are beautiful and definitely breath- taking so I definitely recommend players to explore the environment or climb some hill/mountains. Who knows, you might find something interesting. Like how I found a skeleton in the middle of nowhere in the forest mountains and it will be surrounded with different loots. Or you might accidentally face a Dragon out of the blue lol A true adventure.

The soundtrack or music is not that bad, I always have like the Gothic series music but sometimes, it can get a little boring or it really makes you sleepy because how soothing it can get especially when you're travelling/adventuring to a far distant land. But it differs depending on the event or where you are at, like combat music is exciting AND it's a good way to know that you have been spotted(?) or somehow you're engage in battle with an Enemy. BUT it does get really repetitive though.

The quests/somewhat story/lores/NPCs are the highlights of the game because you get to meet different kind of NPCs and get to do all sorts of quests which are exciting and never boring (Some quests may  be generic). The Dialogues or Voice Acting can get a little cheesy/stereotypical (In a way, kinda racist LOL) but all in all, hilarious and I love it and they can be really good too. The NPCs makes the game immersive and makes you want to be that part of the World, role-play the living crap out of it. And furthermore, the adventures are never set in stone because you get to decide where to go or who to talk to or who to help. Sure, it does have some sort of storyline... (SORTA?) and my only advice for first timers, is explore, read all the lores, learn all of the available clans, factions, sides or even race because at one point, you are force to choose which sides (Either the Rebel or Orcs) and once you do pick a side, the other factions might try to attack you or downright KILL you in numbers. Literally, a horde of enemies.

I personally think that this game is worth playing and recommend to all my friends who are really into classic RPGs. This game is definitely far from perfect, I would even dare to say that this game is beyond that if it weren't for the Community Patch and other recommended mods such as Questpackets, Content Mod, etc etc. I would give this game a rating of 7 / 10 if it weren't the DAMN STUPID LAG/STUTTERS. If the Developers could fix it, I would rate it higher but the if the Developers could remade this with a better combat system and add more quests (With a better story-line), DAMN that would be too awesome but that's just me being a wishful thinker. *SIGH*",1576334241,1576334241,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Despite levelling up a lot, even the most basic enemies cause enough hassle to warrant quick saving every few minutes. You can defeat enemies in melee when you work out how they behave, but it's more a chore than a reward. You are constantly having to battle against the environment in the game behaving weirdly also. 

The music, atmosphere, npcs, side quests, main character, story, loot, etc etc, all fine, and some things like the music are very well done too, but the cons for this game are too huge for these things to keep me playing for much longer i expect. 

I've spent worse £2.99s that's for sure. But not being able to get through this game (whilst gritting my teeth even), is rather disappointing.

It is a lot of fun to discover new treasures, camps and other things.

Gladely, it has also quests that are easily to come by.
The world appeared very big to me, which calls for a lot of variety regarding making decisions.

On the negative side, the combat system is corrupt.
I went into a cave full of enemies armed to the teeth.
Instead of them all squashing me, a beginner with a starting weapon that feels like a wooden sword,
none of them interfered when I attacked one of them. I could hit each one of them as often as I wanted
until they would die, because the stun that they get after every hit lasts way too long.

So if you want to play it realistically, only swing your weapon every 2.5 seconds or so.

First of all the scenery... It is truly magnificent and breathtaking! Mountains, rivers, valleys, the sea, are blend in harmony together and make a very nice atmosphere all around! You will never get bored because each step is a new territory and never feels repetitive!

Second the music... The battle music can be a little annoying but all the other melodies are so magnificent that feels like Ennio Morricone was involved! Melodies similar to the ones you find in LotR!

Third and last is the people, quests and lore... You get into the shoes of the Nameless Hero for a third time! This time you start out more confident and arms-ready as never before! Free to roam the fields of Myrtana, the deserts of Varant or the snowy Nordmar from the moment you get ashore! Orcs, Rebels, Hashshins, Rangers, Nordmars, Mages, Druids and tons of creature to face throughout a massive map! Quests are many, immersive and will sometimes demand you to choose sides!

As a fan of PB's other offerings in the Gothic series as well as Risen and Elex, I find myself enjoying Gothic 3 the most. While it's the most unoptimized PB game, of their earlier works, it's the most technically impressive. From sound, visuals, and a refined combat system (which tbf is still basic as hell). If you can get this game running fine on your machine using the number of community made patches from WoG, it's an RPG experience you don't want to miss.

[h1]What's Good?[/h1]
Combat:
---
Well, as I've mentioned, a refined combat system helps change the gameplay up a great deal from Gothic 1 and 2. While Risen and even Elex has taken queues from Gothic 1/2, Gothic 3 is much more different

Visuals
---
While this game is by no means going to win graphics awards (and tbf not at the time of it's release either) it's still one gorgeous game to look at. And considering the extremely small development team, it's quite a feat.

Story
---
PB's Gothic series has an interesting story, complete with dragons, evil sorcerers, templar(like)s, etc. Humans are at war with Orcs, and they're fighting a losing battle. In Gothic 3, humans have lost. Orcs have taken over, with ease from a certain character met in the previous games. Story wise, it holds it's own.

Challenge
---
All PB games come with a steep challenge in it's odd difficulties. If you can get past this, you'll find PB games are (while not always well crafted) all crafted with love. Part of PB games is overcoming the challenge of the game itself, and investing yourself into the world and it's lore. Gothic 3 does this best, and is a must play for this point.

[h1]What's Bad?[/h1]
Voice Acting
---
It's a PB game, voice acting has always been a negative. This has held true from Gothic 1 all the way to Elex. This is a B-movie style game developer, expect the same in voice acting talent and delivery.

Combat
---
What? Why, yes. Previous Gothic titles had..let's say in interesting combat system. You're used to it by now. Gothic 3 changes this to more of a clicking hell. Click constantly till you drop your enemies health, then deal the killing blow. There's no real thought to it. While it's a refreshing and new system, it's clear why PB didn't continue with this in later titles.

Bugs/Optimization
---
By far, optimization and bugs have to be the biggest problems with this game. Even on amazing hardware, it runs like ass most of the time. And the numerous bugs and technical issues don't help. Often game breaking. Thanks to the community with their awesome patches, the game is playable. Still, the community shouldn't have to pick up a developers slack like this. (I'm looking at you Bethesda)

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
I love the Gothic series, and Gothic 3 is by far the best in my opinion. Great story, maybe not so great characters, but awesome and beautiful world with a good lore, and it's easy an RPG I can recommend. It must be said that the game has a beta option that includes the latest community patches, officially supported by Nordic Games.

I just uninstalled the game not long before writing this and I will explain why. This is going to be a mostly negative review but I'm recommending this game simply because it is a solid open-world RPG that is VERY rough around the edges. It has plenty of charm and the world design is on point. Like the previous Gothic games, you go from zero to hero and your actions have an actual impact on the world. For example, most enemies don't respawn so every beast you kill makes the roads safer for travelers. There is also a reputation system and different factions you can join. Your decisions will effect how they feel about you.

When I first started playing I got sucked in just like I did with the first two games. There are a ton of quests in this game. It got to the point where I was begging the game to stop throwing quests at me. Quest design is one the series strong points in my opinion and it initially shows in Gothic 3....but later the honeymoon wears off and you realized you're doing to same thing over and over; fetch quest after fetch quest, kill this guy, kill those beasts, clear out that cave, talk to this guy, etc. This all sounds like typical RPG stuff right? Well that's pretty much most of the game because the main quest severely lacking. Each town has their own 'quest line'  and they're almost identical. Aside from a few unique side quests they all lead to liberation or destruction of rebel camps. This is one of the reasons I stopped playing. I stopped caring. The story and the quests just weren't enough to keep me interested. Sadly many other open-world games like 'Far Cry' and Fallout 4 are guilty of this. 

The combat...I could probably write a 10-page essay on how bad the combat in this game is. I mean it's almost ruin the game bad. Even with the community patch it's atrocious. I can appreciate what Piranha Bytes was trying to do. They were trying to do what later games like Dark Souls and Kingdom Come: Deliverance did much better; tactical swordplay. You can't just mindlessly hack and slash. You have to know when to block and strike....though now that I think about it there are times in Gothic 3 where you could spam the attack button and succeed in battle. Other times it was a death sentence. The combat is terribly inconsistent and off-balance. A couple of Orcs? No problem! A couple of wolfs? RUN! After many hours of gameplay and even after I got stronger the combat was still frustrating. You have a stamina bar but your enemies seem to have infinite stamina seeing as they can block anything as long as they're in guard stance. The hitboxes are a joke and the targeting pretty doesn't work. Get ready to accidently 
strike your allies over and over!

Gothic 3 is the only Gothic game I couldn't finish. It's definitely worth checking out especially if you're into old-school ""hardcore"" RPGs but not really worth finishing. I'm glad I gave the series a shot but disappointed that I didn't dedicate those 80 hours into a better game or something more productive.",1571150565,1571150565,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was a bit unsure if I want to play this game and probably ruin my Gothic experience.
I'm glad that I can tell that I was wrong. 

The game is really fun to play, It does't have the dark atmo that the first two games have but you can still feel that it's Gothic game.
The combat system (mostly melee) is really stupid but you can still get used to it. 
The graphics are fine for the time of release and It can really drag you to the game.

If you are fan of Gothic games and you haven't play the 3rd game.... YES ! Play it and you will get draged to the game as me. 
Just be sure to download the community patch (otherwise the game has uncountable amount of bugs)

Now with the community patch (which is a requirement if you want to enjoy Gothic 3) this game is in a pretty good condition overall. Apart from some dumb AI issues (which is more like a feature in all Piranha Bytes games haha), a few soft-locks here and there and occasional stutters - this game is in a pretty good shape.

Gothic 3 is a good game if you really love Piranha Bytes games. I love this developer and I liked every single RPG game they made. Gothic 3 is the weakest and biggest in the Gothic series, but still fun to play. + it has amazing music, ambient sounds, humour and a sh|t ton of quests.

Biggest problems with this game are:

1. Map is too big and some areas feel underdeveloped/unfinished. If you are like me and you want to search all areas, hills, caves, open every single chest, complete every side-quest and kill every single beast (even tho some of them respawn after some time =/) - it will gonna take a lot of time to do this. Took me more than 100h to completely finish everything this game has to offer on a single playthrough. I finished this game with a lvl 84 pure mage character.

2. Some areas are a big pain in the ass to explore (Yes, I'm talking about you Nordmar!). There are a lot of hills, woods with different paths leading to different areas and so on. You can get lost pretty quickly and miss some interesting stuff. I remember the first time I played it - it was so confusing and hard to remember where you've already been and which areas were still unexplored. That's why killing all the beasts and collecting all plants helps to diminish this problem a little bit. If you see a dead body - you know you've been there before ^^.

3. Telekinesis spell is a must (you have to equip it, but never use it) if you don't want to miss rare herbs and other valuables lying on the ground. All Gothic and Risen games had this problem, and this spell always helped to quickly scan the area for items. BUT in this game telekinesis is so weak. Its range is pretty minimal compared to other games, so you need to do a lot of walking back and forth to completely search an area. The same thing can be said about spotting your enemies, but ranged weapons do much better job in showing your enemies from far better distance.

4. Ranged combat is easier, quicker and more efficient. So building an archer or a mage is a good strategy. And overall the best strategy to play this game.

5. Main Quest is just not interesting. The story is told through side quests and other activities, but the main quest is just very shallow compared to the previous Gothic games.

Other than this - it's a fun role playing game. You choose who you want to become (good or evil) every single action can have some repercussions and most of the time it's all about thinking outside the box in order to achieve your goal. Every single Gothic game requires several playthroughs to completely explore the content (because it's easy to mess things up ^^) and that's the fun part.

One more thing, community patch is awesome, because not only it fixes tons of bugs and other things, but it also made it possible to collect things with your right mouse button without needing to see the slow animation every single time you pick up an item - this thing alone saved me probably more than 20h of my life. You can even loot open chests this way with just one click! Love it.",1559079354,1560681012,True,10,0,0.635191082954406738,0,True,False,False

I loved Gothic 1 and 2 for their atmosphere, the characters, the difficulty, the dialogues (one reason it failed outside german speaking territories i guess...overdubs suck most of the time) and just the general feel of it being a old-school RPG with no hand-holding but a whole lot of freedom. 


Needles to say after Gothic 2 and it's add-on i couldn't wait for a sequel, which was released in October 2006 and it gave me some flashbacks to Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, a game i highly anticipated only to find it in a utterly broken, unfinished state. Sadly, Gothic 3 was just like that and as a german PC Users i wasn't even surprised, after suffering through historically broken games like F1 Manager 96 and Bundesliga Manager 97 (so unfinished that even the CD had no label printed on!) i guess with german developers you always just expected the worst. Gothic 1 and 2 had their bugs and issues and famously the G2 Addon Night of the Raven had a release day patch but they at least were somewhat playable compared to Gothic 3. It's amazing how greed from publishers can ruin games, franchises and ultimately developers. 
But just like with Vampire the community was big and strong like Orcs (thankfully not dumb like them) so they worked on Patches, nowadays companies like Bethesda now that they have a fanbase that will fix the game for them so they can release broken shit but back then it was really sad to see Gothic go down as it did until the Community Patch (and the Quest Pack and the Consequences Mod) came into existance. Needless to say i played it with all those mods and more than once, so the 9 hours here aren't my total playtime, i have the game as  (and that's hilarious!) Game of the Year edition on DVD. 

Anyway, we continue from Gothic 2 onwards: We kicked that big ass of the equally big dragon and set sail for the main land, where we are greeted by Orcs ruining what otherwise would've been a nice day in a small village. As the, still nameless, hero we grab our sword and along with our merry band of lovely outcasts (Diego, Lares, Gorn, Lester) we kick some Orc Ass, kill them all and be welcomed as the heroes in that small village (which we instantly plunder because there's a reason why in Gothic 1 we were thrown into the colony, right? Yarrr!) 
After that...Gothic 3 becomes vastly different to most modern RPG's because there's no arrow to follow, no quest that leads you to the next auto-saving spot and not even a lot of help outside your friends saying ""Go and find Xardas"". Xardas was always a shady figure so his heel turn toward an Orc lover is not surprising at first but you still wanna know why and how he helped them take over like the nWo and since there's no marker, no arrow and no other help you just explore the world. Where do you go? What do you do? Gothic 3 gives you that freedom. Wanna help the Orcs to destroy even the last few rebels? Go ahead and do it. Wanna help the Rebels to fight back and help humanity? Do it! Wanna stay neutral until the very end and then decide? Yup, that's possible. The game has several different endings and several sub-endings, leading to a total of like 30 or so different ending scenes, depending on how you act, react and what you do. Telltale and all those other ""Your decisions matter!"" Interactive movie studios could learn a thing or two form this game i think. 

Compared to Gothic 2 not a lot has changed. You're the nameless hero but since it continues the story you don't start like a total noob but with some skills, some higher HP, SP, MP and equipment to help you get around (No charater creation again, but you can decide what you want to learn, be it sword fighting, rogue with bows, magicians or a combination, it's all possible)....not that it really makes a lot of difference, the Orcs will fuck you hard in the beginning and even a pack of wolf or the dreaded Lurkers will send you running toward the starting village in hope of some help. So you take baby steps in a overwhelmingly large world that actually consists of basically 3 different zones: The middle part, where you start is your generic forest and hills europe fantasy zone, with a bunch of villages, the rebel hideouts and you being lost in a sea of decisions. The south is the ancient arab/north african influenced desert world with tanned Lurkers (yes, you can't escape them!) and cliche arabian bandits straight from any Ali Baba tale. The north is the equally (but no Lurkers! I guess they would just freeze there) cliche world of the northmen, vikings basically, with mighty white wolves and druids. Exploring the world, which was hand-crafted unlike Bethesda's ""Let's just copy the same few set pieces over and over, nobody will notice"" is actually amazing. Each town is full of life, outside you have bandit camps, rebels, orc troops and animals roaming (and fighting with each other) a round and you really feel that you're just part of the world and not that the world revolves around you. NPCs do their own business, attacks on Orcs happen, attacks on Rebels happen and you can either just watch or join, again, your choice. 

And that's just what makes Gothic 3 so much fun. You're not the hero in shining armor with god-mode who will just do everything. You're just a guy, you join a side, you live with the consequences. 
As i said, once again, the difficulty is pretty challenging. There is no re-spawn. You die...you're dead. There is no auto-save. You last saved an hour ago and now a Ogre got you? Too bad, go back...all the way back. I like that, it gives a certain danger feel to a World that is dangerous, where death waits around every corner. 

Technically of course the game is antiquated though with the CP Patch that adds more drawing distance as well as Nvidia's SDR (and whatever AMD's equivalent is) it actually still looks ok, some places are still full of atmosphere like the first time you walk into Montera at night, with torches, Orc guards and slaves working hard it is quite nice. 
Adding to the atmosphere is once again a epic orchestral soundtrack by Kai Rosenkranz, that dynamically changes from peaceful music to aggressive tunes for battles and captures the atmosphere of all 3 landscapes just perfectly. It might actually be his best work and considering all his work for the Gothic series and Risen 1 is amazing that says a lot. 
The voice actors, at least in the german version are good once again. Even some of the Orcs come across sympathetic like Kadok, when you bring him back his Hammer so he can be a smith again. 
The english overdub is a lot worse, sadly, really low budget. So if you understand at least some german, do yourself a favor and switch the language. 

In its original state Gothic 3 was dreadful but thanks to the community some great patches were produced that fixes most problems and make the game playable. While i still prefer Gothic 2 overall, i would rank it second behind since the large open world and the non-linear gameplay are just a lot of fun while you listen to a great soundtrack and doing a wide variety of quests that go beyond the usualy ""Go there, grab this, kill that guy, come back"" trope most modern RPGs seem to love so much.",1547603218,1547603237,True,24,2,0.638633966445922852,0,True,False,False

Although this game has a bad reputation, it is still a lot of fun.
Definitely install the latest community patch, otherwise this game is WAY too easy. Even with the community patch it is still a bit too easy, but atleast balanced.

Played as a melee without the patch and mage with the patch. First one was very easy, I can imagine it is harder with the improved AI through the patch. Without the patch the enemies don't even block. Hardest enemies then were animals/monsters.

Pros:
- It is a classic Gothic game, nostalgia factor
- Meet known fellows from Gothic 1 & 2, again nostalgia factor
- Graphics are average I'd say, it is getting old though
- Fast progress, questing and hunting feels rewarding
- Good balancing in gold income, sometimes you have to farm to get items you wish
- After all it is fun to play

Cons:
- Very bad combat balancing, as a mage this game was a joke (played on medium)
- Characters feel very unrecognizable, not like in Gothic 1 & 2
- Poor spell variety, feels like you just have 2 spells which are worth using, maybe 3 with heal, at the end I had like 300 healing pots though
- [Minor spoiler] You get your 'best' 2 spells just before the end of the game. And I mean the very end, like 1 enemy before the end.
- [Minor spoiler] Want to play the good way? Liberate this city. And this city. And this city, oh yea this city aswell. Got to the desert? Liberate more cities. Kill people. Who needs diversity?
- Poor weapon variety aswell. Feels like only 1-2 weapons are really worth using. On top of that every weapon has the same moveset if I'm not mistaken.

All in all, I'd only recommend this game if you played Gothic 1 & 2 when you were small for the nostalgia factor. Otherwise you would probably think this game is trash. I won't say you're wrong.",1547241119,1547241119,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First, i wanna say i completed the game before to write this review....
Only my love for the Gothic serie forced me to give a positive vote to this review cause the overall experience was more negative and i'm going to explain why....
The game itself is pretty nice, the questline is interesting and amusing (great longevity as always) but the technical part of the game is one of worst i ever experienced, a lot of crashing toggled my fun out, also there is a terrible stuttering issue happening really too often cause of no optimizations in this game, to end the negative things, altough the first 2 i already mentioned were the worst, is also a really bad and not user-friendly combat system making sometime like impossible to dodge or parry the attacks of some of the enemies, just to make an example, i start the attack and the mob dodge 10 times in a row my attacks then he hit me and keep hitting me for like 7 bites in a row not giving me any chance to avoid his attack, this with me using the best weapons and having high skills and after mastered to the max...
In conclusion, i have to say that this is a sad example of a nice game ruined by bad programming, with a little of more effort on beta testing and with some better ideas this could have been 100 times better....
I was able to complete this game just because i've the patience of a Saint, but not everyone could have the same...
Without the crash problems this could have been even the best Gothic of the trilogy, such a pity :(
Gothic 2 remains, in my opinion, the best of the Gothic trilogy !

You never know was it the publisher, who rushed the development or actual Piranha struggling to implement something new. However, Jowood is now long defunct, while Piranha is still there. That probably gives a hint.

Anyway. The game is rushed. Which means the game is bugged beyond repair. The awesome work put into the game in the Community Patch is greatly appreciated, however it doesn't polish it to a perfect state.

The major complaint is the AI. It is awfully dumb, its pathfinding sucks and due to the fact that the engine doesn't calculate anything beyond like 100 meters away from you, you still can randomly loose your companions in a plain field. Or inside some hill. Literally.

The other complaint is the stability of the game itself. First of all it won't really let you have decent FPS rates even with modern hardware due to the single core design. Alt-tabbing will send you in a black screen once in a while. With CP installed I experienced random ingame crashes once in a while, but it wasn't so often.

There was a lot of bugged quests in the original. Some are fixed in the CP (like 12 chalices), but believe it or not, the last Liberate Myrtana quest actually bugged. I believe the game still thought Silden is not liberated, since I still had some orc quests active, while not a single orc was in the area. So I had to use marvin. Really disappointing.

What's good is the atmosphere they managed to deliver. While the map is quite small, it gives you the illusion of scale. In fact you can see the starting location from the most northern side of the map. Nature looks awesome, especially comparing to the competitors.

Despite the main quest being really short, simple, and practically undeveloped until the end of the game, the road to Xardas with all the small stories all around the country was a nice experience.

3rd and last child of JoWood and Piranha Bytes. Last nail in the coffin of their cooperation.
The game starts you off in a very peculiar position, You're in a fight straight from the start. Why do i mention it?
In previous games there always was feint smell of choice. You dont have this in 3rd, you're forced to fight from the start and later it stems into a bigger issue. Choosing path. Good, evil or in the middle. To follow good or mid path, you need little effort, while evil path will require you effort and time. Nice.
Storywise its bad. The orcs won, the humans lost blah blah blah. First big quest is to find Xardas. Where? Gotta spend some time till you find out that. Game have no sense of direction whatsoever. Quests are bland, boring and unoriginal. Guess PB ran out of ideas on this one.
New combat system requires you to spam left mouse button like this is a Gothic Clicker or something. You dont need to block, you dont need to parry or dodge, just mash.
AI is stupid. Animals stunlock you. Magic is really overpowered. Talents mean nothing. Weapons and armour are irrelevant. Abudance of bugs and glitches. Graphically game is a step up from 2nd, but nothing special.
Community patch that you can install in beta option on steam fixes little to nothing.
People often blame only JoWood. I think PB should also take 50% of blame, since even not rushed things just do not work at all.

It starts out nice enough, with nice enviroments, its cool mechanics, the freedom, exploration and what not, but it is after a while that you realise that under the surface lies a horendously broken game. If you try to veer off the beaten path you will break the game. Gothic 3 literally alows you to break it.

One such instance is when I tried to assasinate the varant emperor. I just transformed myself into a meatbug and entered the city, and into the treasury. I hit from the inside and exploiting the games broken combat system and silly AI, I killed the emperor. The game acted as if he was alive giving quests that could never be completed.

BTW, Did I say broken combat system? Yeah, its fair when you want to fight lesser enemies. At least thats what it seemed at the start. Your enemies can leave you in a stunned state permanently until they kill you. Going over to fighting greater enemies it does not feel great. Its drab and boring and enemies take a hell of a lot of time to beat. Needless to say, fighting bosses is not exciting or fun. Theres also a noticable lack of complexity to the combat mechanics

Other gripes with this are that theres not many models and voices for NPCs and you can tolerate seeing the same NPC with the same voice so many times. Theres also a problem with the anachronistic names and the fact you can wake up people while on meatbug form.

The first two games are emphasized on its brilliant combat system which requires you to perform your attack wisely and carefully while Gothic 3 is focused more on the freedom of open world exploration and the character building. You will feel there is a huge stepdown from the previous game in term of melee combat.

Beautiful World, Graphic and Soundtrack
If you’ve played the previous gothic games, you will know that majority of gameplay is wandering the wild and killing the wildlifes. Gothic 3 has a huge world. It is much bigger world (about 3 ~5 times bigger) than Gothic 1 and 2. And it is truly open which you can travel from one side to another without a single loading screen. You will go through different areas such as grass land, dense forest, desert, etc in your playthrough while each area has landscapes which make your exploration feeling fun and worthy. Graphic is another shinning part of Gothic 3. Although the game was released on 2006, the graphic is still good by today standards and it is definitely one of the top graphic game during its time. Soundtracks are considerably improved from the previous games. Much more impressive music can be found in the game such as the first music ‘Vista point’ in the game which is so beautiful. 

Varying Style Gameplay, Variety Enemies and Character Building
As mentioned above, the melee combat is a huge stepdown. There are two features of the melee combat which make the combat pretty boring and annoying for new players. First, you can swing infinitely and the enemy will be staggered when got hit. Basically, you can just button smashing to kill 90% of enemies for the entire game. Second, the enemy will perform a backward jump/move when you swing and the enemy will be pushed backward when got hit. You can perform another forward attack by using the right click attack. Still, you will find yourself keep swing and pushing the enemy to the some walls or obstacles in order to finish him. Overall, the melee combat is just simple and repetitive. 

Not like the previously game, you don’t need to stick with one type of combat style. The gane wont punishing you for the long changing weapon time as the previous game. You can change your weapon and magic smoothly during the battles. In my playthrough, I was a mainly melee warrior in the first 3 hours due to the limitation of arrows I can afford in the beginning. Then I was a combination hunter and warrior, and little bit magic sometimes depending on the enemy type and situation. I enjoyed the gameplay most of the time. Trying and using different strategies to kill the enimes in the different wilds to find out the way you want, never get bored. Also Gothic 3 has large number and different type of wildlifes amongst the three gothic games. More important, the game will show you all skills you can learnt from start, so you can decide your path at quite early stage and work for the build.  You can really feel the progression of the character building and the change of combat during different stages. 


Story and Quests
The story of Gothic 3 is a sequel to the previous games. This is the story to explain everything in the previous game. I love the story personally if I consider three gothic games as a whole story. However, the story presentation in this game is not good. There are no cutsenses after intro cutsense. Main quests are barely existed. Instead learning the story form the quest, I have to explore different places, talk to different people, filter majority of the meaningless dialogue, and link the few dialogues with the dialogue of the main quest giver to understand the whole story. Due to the barely existence of the main quest, side quests become your main quests in game. And most side quests are not related to your story. And majority of quests are fetch quests such as gather number of somethings or kill number of somethings. You will feel those quests are a way to earn money rather than learning the story. Moreover, no quest markers in this game.

Poor Optimization
If you want me to give you one reason I don’t recommend this game, then it is the poor optimization of this game. You will encounter choppy gameplay frequently. Both saving time (5~8 sec) and loading time (10~15 sec) are very long even for modern computer. 

Final Score: 7.8
I recommend this game to people who love old classic RPG. 
It may not be the best RPG or best game and It  has flaws in many aspects. 
However, it is definitely a type of RPG I want to see more in the game industry.

People who have already played in 2006 will probably have heard of it,
because of the amount of bugs which nearly destroyed the game and
the problems between the publisher(Jowood) and the producer(Piranha Bytes).
In the end fans and community came together and made patches,
(there are still fans who make new mods today to improve grafik, story and more) 
so you could enjoy the game how it should be and it is awesome.
The grafik isn't the best anymore but still good and the  
soundtrack is like in the other Gothic games unbelievable.
The world is really big, contains a lot of enemies, weapons, NPCs, cities 
and is diversified(there are some eastereggs, 
additional loot and enemies ""hidden"" in the world).
The story could have been better and, in my opinion,
kind of vanishes in the background while playing the game.

I'm deeply disappointed in Gothic 3, having played 1 and 2 a long time ago. 

First off, the story is broken. I often find myself google-ing what to do next. Cape Dun, Okara, Nemora, Trelis, you name it. This wasn't an issue in 1 and 2.
Secondly, there is no progress. I got paladin armor at ~ level 20! 
At level 40:
I'm still using Bastard sword, which I got at level 17-18. 2H's are useless. With more than 3 enemies, you won't ever swing your weapon. 
I'm still using the same shield I was using at level ~20.
I'm still using the same helmet I was using at level 5.

Thirdly, builds are not balanced well, if at all. A mage rocks the world, then tank build, then hunter. 
Problems from Gothic 1 and 2 still persist in part 3. I know of no one that ever played a 'necromancer' build, summoning things, because it's really weak. 

The closure is also rather stupid. I mean, a dialog with a rock as an ending? Really? 

I wasted a week on this game.",1523643022,1523643022,False,3,0,0.429112017154693604,1,True,False,False

Dropping score to 5/10, no longer recommended. I can't believe this game has such high ratings. Moving and turning feels more like swimming than it does walking or running. Blech.



Update 1: After a few more hours in, I may be rethinking my review...still gonna keep playing to see what happens, but the game moves very slowly, and the clunky combat controls and physics are a huge problem. It really makes the game irritating to play for more than an hour at a time, and that really isn't a good thing at all. I really hope this gets going. I just unlocked two-handed weapons, and crossbows, hoping that the extra damage would help, but two-handed weapons are so ungodly slow that you literally cannot hit an enemy with them unless you get extremely lucky. The crossbow is nice, but it is also, in some ways, broken. I can shoot enemies from far enough away that they cannot see me, and thus do not attack me...

At this point, 7.0/10.

If it doesn't start gaining points soon, it is going to be another title I never complete, and I'll eventually have to give it the thumbs down.

Original: Seems pretty decent so far...only played a few hours at this point. I do have beef with the controls, though. This game isn't particularly difficult at this point, at least in terms of the strength of the opponents this early on, but the controls make it way too easy to die against fairly low-ranking mobs.

The community patch 1.75 is necessary -- game was 100% unplayable before getting that patch. Pre-patch, my character wouldn't even stand up after being knocked down, the mouse did not function -- as in turning the view required either using Q and E, or wildly swinging the mouse back and forth a dozen times before the game realized it existed. Those issues were fixed with the community patch.

As to my current disappointment with the controls -- really, it is just the combat controls. First thing, it takes this dude about 4 seconds to swing a sword for a power attack, and about two seconds for a regular attack. Even a small child can swing a sword toward an object faster than that. Second, blocking does nothing against mobs, only against opponents who also have weapons. Third, it takes this dude FOREVER to draw a bowstring. I have only shot a bow a couple times, and it ain't that hard. You'd think someone with combat experience could do it faster. Fourth, and last, you can't swing down at something below you if you are on a hill -- essentially, anything that is on a portion of ground where the plane is a foot or two below yours can only be hit with a bow...or probably spells. Only have two spells right now, and neither do damage, so I'm not sure about that.

So, my call at this point is that it would have been awesome had they made the combat more ""realistic,"" and had the difficulty of the game come through in the intelligence of the enemies, instead of it simply being difficult because the combat controls and physics are somewhat sub-par. Granted, it is a slightly older game, but that isn't a very good excuse. As it is, ""tricking"" your opponents makes killing them incredibly easy. All you have to do is find an object that they can't climb, which is anything since none of them appear to have the ability to jump, and pelt them with arrows until they die. If they have a bow and are shooting at you, you just have to strafe back and forth as they shoot at you. They never hit you.

I do recommend it at this point, because it seems like it is going to develop into a really good game, but I will always dislike the combat and AI systems.

The whole system is slightly wonky with stunlocks galore, the ability to trap enemies against objects where they can't fight back (which can also happen to you) and very basic, clunky animations. It would be nice if you could customize your character's appearance more, but there are many different types of gear to wear. Getting the Gothic 3 community patch is a necessity, as it overhauls the graphics, fixes a lot of combat querks, makes the AI smarter, and many other much needed things.

The looks and the combat have changed a lot, so naturally it won't feel like its predecessors. And the writing is different, together with the voice actors. Feels a bit bland to be honest, but you get used to it.

Other than that it still is a Gothic game, the world has no virtual, immersionbreaking boundaries and if you venture forth on your own, you'll most likely get beaten up or eaten. As in previous titles it's all about getting to know your enemies' weaknesses and playing around them. The NPCs are quite indifferent towards you, you're just a nobody who happens to be talking to them, just as one would expect from a Gothic game. 

What annoyed me the most (personally) was the scope of the game. Liberating towns really is a nuisance early in the game, especially in Myrtana and it seems to have no effect other than humans are inhabiting the towns instead of orcs and tthe game even punishes you, if you liberate too many towns too early. That's what broke the game for me to be honest.
I am not gonna say what happens, because spoilers, but it just sucks if you have invested 15-ish hours into the game and have no safety save for that occasion.

tl;dr
gameplay is okay ( neither groundbreaking nor gamebreaking), writin and voiceacting is worse than in previous titles, but you get used to it, world is quite big (the scope is okay) but it is not really storydriven, so doing stuff will most likely not push the narrative.

Wouldn't recommend it for most players.

Stealth/Stealing was a fun feature in the first two games.
In Gothic 3 you get fined after stealing more than a certain threshold. If you steal again, the whole citiy attacks you.
The npc s dont need to see you stealing. The City just KNOWS that it was you.
And get used to the same 20 dull Faces, you will see them a lot, paired with the same 15 voice actors.
Mobs and Enemys look worse then they did in the first game(2001) , and they recycled some Sounds from the Second.
Ai pathing is just broken. Enemys will move away sideways sometimes, while trying to get to you.
Melee Combat is no fun. You end up avoiding and using Magic or a Bow instead.
The gameworld feels alive and looks lovely, with lush Forests, Deserts and a snowy Region, however Assets get copypasted a lot(Buildings, Houses and Stuff).

I feel cheated for paying 3 Dollars for that.

While the release version was pushed out long before it was ready, the community managed to finish the job, in what I would call an unprecendented effort. The end result is great in some aspects and painfully lacking in others. Overall a decent package, but not for everyone.

First off: any of the following statements are based on the community-patched build, which is not included in Steam by default. In order to enjoy this game, I strongly recommend downloading the Community Patch 1.75 and the Humanforce Quest Pack 4. Without these, you will have a significantly worse time.

If you played the previous games in the series and are expecting a compelling story, you will be disappointed. The main story of Gothic 3 is simplistic, has little to no dialogue, and barely any depth. A lot of the side quest content also feels like standard MMO fare, with lots of generic fetch and kill tasks. The Quest Pack improves this somewhat, but since the new quests are not voice-acted by the original actors (or not at all, based on your language choice), you may have to suspend your disbelief more than a bit. Still, in terms of quantity, the game does not disappoint. Expect around sixty hours of content for an average playthrough.

Apart from the writing, the game's world feels remarkably organic, and in many ways ahead of its time. Draw your weapon in public, steal, sneak around or trespass, and NPCs will react in mostly believable ways. Show up in a rebel base wearing the armor of a hostile faction, and people will beat you up for it. Steal too much in one town, or assassinate people, and the inhabitants will become skeptical. Go too far, and the entire town will permanently turn against you. Unlike many competing titles nowadays, none of the above are scripted. And while the logic behind them is not overly sophisticated, it is functional and does wonders for immersion.

And since the continent is at war, all-out city battles can and will happen, and the player can take a side. While your character won't be in the middle of two armies clashing, it still feels more like a war than, say, most parts of Skyrim's civil war. Especially in terms of consequences, Gothic 3 is far from shy. Questgivers on both sides will die, often by your hand. Based on your quest success, local slaves and resistance forces may join you in battle. You can even do preparation runs by assassinating mages and other key figures beforehand, which can end with you being caught and the city turning on you early. The writing may not back this up, but the gameplay allows for more nuance than one would expect. 
Especially when more than ten people on both sides do clash, which many RPGs fail at, the game shows a surprising amount of strength. Battle lines form, mages and archers get involved in credible ways, and the player can flit in and out between allies and enemies, supporting whenever it makes sense. Or things can go horribly wrong: allies can die to friendly fire, and if you struck the killing blow, both sides will turn on you.

In general, however, the gameplay is a bit patchy. Combat, balancing and item progression are fine, and clearly where most of the effort from the Community Patch Team went, since the base game was abysmal in this regard. Other aspects, AI pathfinding in particular, leave a lot to be desired. They result in the pursuit patterns of opponents being all too predictable, and ranged combat is easily exploitable because of this. In addition, magic spells vary wildly in their usefulness. The simple elemental spells are more powerful than anything else in most situations, making large parts of the magic skill tree questionable. Thankfully, this doesn't apply to melee and ranged combat, which have a large amount of sensible unlockable skills. Overall, the progression system is one of the game's strongest sides, allowing for a fair bit of replayability with the above caveats.

Finally, the production values are also a bit of a mix. The music is great, although the few combat tracks get repetitive quickly, and the sound effects and voice acting are decent. The close-range visuals have aged surprisingly well, with a bright and pleasant color scheme. Anything beyond 50 meters of distance, however, looks horrible, with incredibly low-quality LOD models and textures. Expanding the view distance through the .ini files leads to severe performance drops, even on modern hardware. If you can live with the low view distance, however, the performance is as good as you would expect. Even a laptop with an onboard graphics chip can run this game performancewise, with only mild visual glitching. The latter probably stem from the fact that Gothic 3 was released years before the first Intel HD Graphics. On nVidia and AMD GPUs, the game runs flawlessly, including 4K resolutions.

To sum up, Gothic 3 is a title that, while its age is clearly visible, has aged better than a lot of its competition, at least when you include the Community patch. If you can live with the problems listed above, and some general jank and bugginess, it is well worth its current price in my opinion.",1515862553,1515862553,True,13,0,0.676234662532806396,0,True,False,False

[b]Review[/b]

[i]Story[/i] - After Gothic 2 you and your merry band find yourselves in a orc run village. It is orc run because [spoiler] Xardas [/spoiler] betrayed you all, disrupted the rune magic, and partialy commands the orcs with unclear motives. It is up to you to stop him and the orcs in any way, that means you could befriend the orcs as a mercenary who captures slave and hunts man or beast. Or you could join the rebels and slay them to reclaim the cities and towns in a uprising.

Gameplay

Sneak, Thieving, and Lockpicking- Loot chests (owned or unowned) with lockpicks! Hold your bind to sneak and pickpocket man and orc alike, or gut them while they are none the wiser.

Melee Combat- Wield powerful 1h or 2h swords, spears, axes, staves, etc. to devestating effect. Rmouse hold is to block/parry Rmouse tap is a light atk Lmouse is a Heavy atk Rmouse hold then Lmouse is a stab attack. Combine these with diffrent patterns and weapons to do sick combos and spin moves etc.

Ranged Combat- Wield bows and crossbows like a true ranger. Just point and fire! After a few shots of your weapon you will get the range and drop of the arrow or bolt.

Magic- Use scrolls and your mana to cast any spell like the good o'l fireball or transform into the monsters of Gothic and more! Find a shrine to buy spells permanently from a god and get yourself a teach to learn the magic skills to cast them. (ancient knowledge)
 
Crafting- Get the skillz, get the recipe, get the ingredients, then you have the (insert weapon, potion, food, etc)

Leveling- The ComPac gives you 2 options, a normal mode with a some balaced extra  learn points (LP) from the original Gothic 3, and the new hard mode of Gothic 3 called Alternative Balancing. When AltBalancing is ON you get fewer LP when leveling so make sure its ON or OFF depending on what game you want.

Leveling Addendum- you need to find a shrine or teacher like in past Gothics but now all skills cost LP AND gold.

Conclusion- Gothic 3 Origonal is a decent game but with the ComPat it makes the game live up to the Gothic name. Is it better than the legendary Gothic 2? No not really but with this patch the combat is fun, bugs are fixed, and we still get that Gothic dialog.

After the battle, you get to choose among 3 factions to help, which are Rebels (against slavery) Orcs (Rulers of the majority of the midland) and Hashishin (artifact collectors)

PRO:

~This game looks extremely impressive for 2006, and by a company thats not very big

~The music is quite delightful, if looping after a long while

~The locations are very unique, with lots of caves as dungeons filled with bandits, monsters, and beasts, to the varied cities and settlements

~The voice acting isnt really good, but its so bland, it makes you laugh either way

CONS

~Fighting in general is the worst thing about this game. Beasts (like wolves) are harder than they should, combo-ing you even while you're on the ground, instantly killing you or taking too much uneeded damage. Humans and Orcs are generally dumb, with them basically watching you kill theit comrades until you kill them, and the ranged enemies almost always hit you, destroying your constant flow of stunning them, having them insta kill you.

~to level up your traits in the game, you have to BUY THEM WITH YOUR GOLD! This wouldnt be a problem if you were able to buy special traits and get basic traits as you level up, but you have to buy ANYTHING you need, whether it be strength, the ability to use large weapons, the ability to lockpick harder locks, and upgrading your swords skill. Yes, you can get your own strengh, hunting, and thievery up, but out of the 10 hours of gameplay, I got, like, 3 strengh that I didnt buy, out of the 100 or so I bought from trainers

~At first, the game doesnt exactly warn you what's a crime and what isnt. For example: After I eliminated the first town of orcs, I looted the entire place filled with slaves without any problems. I go to the local rebel camp, known as Reddock, and just assume I could open a chest, but nope, I was instantly killed, I didnt save, which meant I had to do the first 15 minutes AGAIN!

~this game is EXTREMELY HARD! You'll want to save often after you do a slightly tough battle, because chances are that there's an equally strong monster waiting just around the corner. It was so hard, I had to put the game from Medium to Easy when liberating the 2nd city due to how frusterated I was reloading my last time. I counted TWENTY TWO times I reloaded in the 2nd city during the liberation against orcs!

~Companions are completely useless, theres no weight limit, they can only wait anf go home, and when they fight, they dont attack like you, they barely fight at all!

I've tried so hard to like it, but it's hard... The graphics is ok and not the main downer. The mechanics are decent as it makes combat actually hard and calculating, but it simply suffers from bugs and lack of prediction. 
While the combat with other humanoids is decently predictable, as long as you read the opponent (see if he does short attack, side step, heavy attack etc). Humanoids are fine, but a lot of beasts are crazy and weird. After killing Ogres giving 320xp, and orcs at 160xp, I still struggle with wolves at 40xp and lurkers at 40xp.

So this is the first Gothic game I have played so keep in mind I am not fan-boying this game. I have always been a huge fan of elder scrolls, witcher, fable, dragon age etc. This game is nothing like those. Maybe a few similarities here and there after all it is an RPG. 

The atmosphere of Gothic 3 is amazing! Bright vibrant scenery, awesome/relaxing soundtrack, and NPCs act like real people. 

The story isnt the best in the world but its by no means terrible.

 The combat.....The combat is usually the focus point of many of the reviews. Some call it clunky, random, broken. But I will tell you that the combat isnt as bad as people make it seem. It is a bit more tactical than most current gen RPGs but it only takes a few fights to get used to. At least for me.

 The quests in this game are very rewarding and seem to actually reflect on the world! For example, there is a quest where you might need to clear out some wolves in an area. When you go and kill those wolves you ACTUALLY kill them and then there are no more wolves in that area! Enemies and NPCs alike will NOT respawn when dead! 

All in all I highly recommend you give this game a go! I think you will be just as surprised as I was about how fun it is! And REALLY try at the game. Dont just toss it aside after you die once. Take time to take in the world around you. Go explore! Dont always follow a linear path through the game.

The voice acting is also a bit silly, and the story is lackluster. This is more than made up for in the gameplay. Just you classic, orc-killing RPG.

My main complaint is that combat is very broken, and combat makes up a very large part of the game.
- Watch in dismay as every enemy skillfully backsteps away from your every attack
- Some creatures like wolves will just hammer at you repeatedly until you are dead without any chance to break the 'stun lock'
- Blocking/parrying seems to be completely useless
- Magic is overpowered, Shamans or Mages will one- or two- shot you when wearing the best armour
- There doesn't seem to be any better strategy other than spam attack on something until you back it up against an object and it can't backstep any more. If that fails just reload and try again.

Beyond that, there are a huge number of quests to do and a very large map to explore but towards the end it just felt like a grind.

Here's what I enjoyed about Gothic 3:

- Freedom of going wherever you want, whenever you want. No quest markers - if they say you ""Far north"", you just go north and think ""Am I far enough? Where's that damn white ripper?"" Also, freedom of doing whatever you want - you can kill an NPC that's needed for some quest, and that will be only your fault
- Freedom of character development. There are intuitive str/dex/int paths, but you can grab any perks you want
- Soundtrack, it's just majestic
- The liberation system. You can liberate towns!

Here's what I can't categorize as good or bad:

- Graphics are okay-ish. Beautiful landscapes, but plastic faces of characters, plastic weapons and armor.
- There's nothing special about the story
- The loot system is made in such way that in the beginning you only get crappy things, but the more chests you open, the better your loot

Here's what spoils the fun:

- Bugs. A huge lot of bugs
- Voice acting is poor and emotionless
- Almost no armor diversity. Both rebel and orc armors have the same model with a little different colors
- Melee combat. It goes in two possible ways - either you stunlock the enemy and kill them, or you get stunlocked and killed. Especially dangerous against groups of enemies

In comparison with Gothic 2:

I can't really explain why, but G2 seemed way more cozy. Characters in G2 had pesonalities, there was way more depth to the whole world, even melee combat was more fun than here. 

A couple of advices:

Finish Gothic 1 and 2 before you play Gothic 3. Find and install the community patches for G3 that will spare you a big deal of bugs. Use alternative balancing if you want, but I played without it. You can use a bow to kill enemies from a safe spot since they can't jump, or kite them, or pick them one by one to stunlock and kill with melee. 

This game is a step back from G2, but it isn't as bad as most of the people think.",1505033312,1505033335,True,39,1,0.79593271017074585,2,True,False,False

Gothic 3 is much different from Skyrim, and I find myself preferring this game over Bethesda's regardless incredible installment. And I believe it's because Gothic 3 is untethered in ways Skyrim really is bound. The world in Gothic 3 is fully open, no level-based restrictions. You can literally kill anyone you desire in the game, unlike Skyrim, where you can kill maybe half of the people. In Gothic, you can accidentally kill people important to your questline, and it teaches you to kill sparingly. The world itself is gorgeous, despite less-than-mindblowing graphics. It was a rushed game, so glitches and bugs are still present. But in my opinion, these glitches are simply hilarious, and make the game so much more of a wild romp and adventure than Skyrim ever was for me. The soundtrack is gorgeous too. I just find myself getting emersed in the world every time I play.

-my favourite people kinda lost their character, 
-really small amount of dialogues to chose while conversating, 
-voice acting
-main plot is not intersting...find Xardas? and? why? oh hes bad? and? not really intersting for me, there was lack of twists in plot, just walk get, kill, bring...a lot. 
-STUNLOCK,GODDAMN STUNLOCK. You get hit? fall? well gl for youwith potions, cuz your enemy will run to you starightaway and do it again,and again,and again,and again. First half hour was horrible.

Stability - this game is rock solid, runs perfectly on Windows 10.
Graphics - still looks good.

Gameplay - good except for the ""arena battle"" code which allows the loser to get back up afterwards. It was intended just for arenas (where getting back up makes sense) but the developers used it everywhere - in places which made no sense at all. You cannot tell whether the person you are fighting is in arena-battle mode or not, so it gets very confusing.

Example - an early quest to kill orcs at a farm seems impossible because no matter how many times you kill them, they get back up again. [The solution is hold right-click + left-click when standing over an orc, but I had search the internet because the game doesn't tell you].

Apart from that, and the ridiculous sight of Orcs behaving the same way as humans, this is a great game.

Incredibly underrated and overlooked which makes me sad since this game is a real masterpiece after you look past the flaws of this UNFINISHED game (Piranha Bytes was forced to release this game very early).
This game is breathtaking with atmosphere and charm and i loved it to the last moment.

Even tho this game is unfinished and not optimized please, please give it a try...the first few hours sure can be frustrating but i assure you that after that its just a great experience.
Also do yourself a favor and install the latest patch from the beta tab of the game :)

This is a wonderful game, very interactive realism mixed with necessary unrealistic events to balance situations. The only problem is without the community patch the game is buggy glitchy and annoying. The graphics at the time are great and today to my standards are pretty darn good, you have to love the open world, and the fact that anyone can die. The combat is fun and great, there could be better animations but with the time it was created I guess that could cause more problems I guess, not so sure. And I’ve played mash key combat games and it’s not fun. This is the type of RPG I like compared to others, I've tried another game from the same developer Spell force it's alright but not my style. To today's standard this game would not be appreciated but you have to keep in mind the time. What makes this game so much better is the large community that worked together to create patches and additional features for the game. 
The fact of choosing your side is great, you can choose any action but there is a cost. The player can benefit one faction or just go fuck everyone over and kill as many as he can. Voice acting is well done, not too crappy or just text reading or too emotional, thou there are a lack of women and other people. As well as horses, but I guess they don’t exist in the World of Gothic for some reason or another. Now the music is great I was surprised at how well it is, thou particular areas the music can be really loud and annoying especially with headphones, but that’s so common anymore makes no difference other than I hate it, balance please I like my ears.",1484326633,1486858644,True,5,0,0.565336108207702637,0,True,False,False

First thing first, I want to clear up some things: 

[b] 1) I'm using the Community Patch 1.75 mod, also known as the ""Enhanced Edition"", without it, it's a definite thumbs down, it's a buggy, unplayable mess. A pure trainwreck.

2) I've never played Gothic 1 & 2, which I heard is better than Gothic 3 + the latest patch. Better story, mechanic, especially Gothic 2, I'd definitely love to play G2 some day.

3) I've played 30 hours or so, Steam doesn't detect my custom launcher. [/b]

With that said, let's get straight to the review.

[h1]Brutally Immersive [/h1]

Gothic 3 is a game that achieves the immersion through its grounded, and ""realistic"" world. You are a random nobody, and the game, its world, its people, its entire mechanic treat you like such. You are not a ""chosen one"" or a ""child of prophecy"", you don't have any special power that grants you an immediate advantage to other people, just a guy passing by, doing  whatever he could to survive. If you are expecting a power fantasy where you could bulldoze everything in front of you, you should back off. You need to project yourself into the game. Like when you see a pack of wolf, and you are in low level, with low grade equipments, you'll extremely likely to be killed off right away, even in higher level with better equipment, they're still rather intimidating. 

As for the combat. It works, for the most part. Let's stick to the positive part first. It term of mechanic it flows smoothly. The combat is much slower than other action RPGs. It's not only about who has the best equipment, it's more on how you make every block, movement, and attacks counts, mix and match the weapon and armor in order to suit your playstyle, and learning their advantages and disadvantages. 

Gothic 3 have an interesting quest system. All the quests are already active from the very start, but it's just remain hidden until you know it. Finest early example is the quest where you have to kill a pack of wolf near the first town. You can kill them first without knowing that its a quest, go to the quest giver, and he'll be pleased that you already kill it when he ask you about it. And if you not then, you'll be given that quest, and it appeared in your journal, and there is no quest marker or anything. You are just told that there is a pack of wolf somewhere outside of the town and it's your job to find them, it applies to all quest, 

[h1] Gameplay Is Worldbuilding [/h1]

The combat and quest mechanic that I mention above is a bold statement that the world of Gothic is filled with dangerous creatures and sillful warriors, and you're not a special snowflake, and for me that is Gothic's biggest strength, ""show, don't tell"". Aside of that there are these little details, that while individually seems insignificant but when it combines, it contributes a lot to my fascination of this game like the no respawn mechanic, everyone/thing stays dead, you (and enemies) can choosee to kill or spare the enemies, guards don't like seeing you in a fighting stance and a house owner will watch you if they notice you entering their house, and yes, you can enter any house given that you have the key and skills, without a single loading screen! 

One aspect that I want to touch here is the enemy level scaling system. The system that Gothic 3 use isn't special or anything, but its some kind of a lost design choice when it comes to action RPG especially AAA ones, and that is enemy that didn't scalle along with your level. It might seem like a tiny thing, but it actually helps with the enviromental storytelling, you feel the tension and danger when you come to a high level area, you can't get an ultra-awesome anceint weapon early on, you have to work hard for it, it's a high risk high reward system. A perfect balance between freedom and subtle storytelling.

Because of the things that I mention above: Enemies don't  respawn, you need to go to a trainer to level up (at least that's one way to do it) and that really makes you to really plan out your character build because you won't be a level 80 OP hybrid mage-swordsman-thief character at the end of the game. The skill system is built around realism, there is no skill that grants you an obvious superhuman abilities, it only makes you better at what you are doing.

[h1] The Color of Chaos  [/h1]

The land of Myrtana is a colorful, vibrant, calming, albeit a bit generic medieval fantasy landscape, contrasting a dark storyline within it. Gothic 3's story is more grounded and ""believable"", its about a revolution of humans against the conquering orcs, and Gothic 3 is more focused on learning the politc, view and lore of each factions. The contrasting visual works beautifully with the context of the story, balancing the dark nature of the story and the calming and breathtaking long trips in between, and also it did a fine job to cover its otherwise average at best textures and models. 

Myrtana is divided into 3 different regions: The plains, desert, and snowy area, with their own unique creatures, ""cultures"", and architectures, making it much more than a change of landscape. There is no fast travel, or at least it is really well hidden, so you have to travel for minutes to hours even, if you want to travel to a major city, but man was it doesn't bore me at all, accompanied with awesome soundtracks, ambient tracks, and beautiful landscape, also a lively land where lore and quests awaits you if you want to explore.

Talking about the soundtrack, it''s a 2 hours of worth of amazing soundtracks. Every major place and event has its own soundtracks that  really help to strengthen the overall feeling, coupled with a really  nice ambient sounds. 
And for the story, you can choose to side with the orcs, rebels, minor factions, independent, or work for everyone, each with their own distinct questline, and lead to different events and conclusions, with their own advantages and disadvantages, and it's always interesting to see each of their views and ideas, and that's a sign of well made RPG, I'll leave it at that.

[h1] A Rough Diamond  [/h1]

Even with the  patch, that basically salvage a trainwreck, make it fully functional, and giving it fresh coat of paint. It's still not all sunshine and rainbows. Some of it is due to design flaws, terrible production value, and well.. the patch, as great as it might be can't hide the fact that it's an unfinished and unpolished game.

Below average models and textures, bad to mediocre voice acting, somewhat ""rigid"" animation, below average dialogue translation, and an underwhelming sound and visual effects. The voice acting and dialogue, when combined together can create a laughably bad moments, that really hurts the otherwise great storoyline. Sound and visual effect doesn't pack enough punch when it hits the enemy, sometimes I feel like that I'm swinging  a toy sword.

Some gameplay mechanic that I found kinda irritating is that you can't pick up enemy's armor, even if they are humans, and that you, at times is given too little information on what you should do on a given quest. Also, I'd love to see more variety of weapons and armors.

[h1] Conclusion  [/h1]

Gothic 3 is a really great game if you have a keen eyes of the little things, if you interested to the details, and have the patience to discover it, and even greater patience to go through the obivously low  production value and the cracks it shows even with the patch. It's no power fantasy, and so don't expect it to holds your hand, at the same time, it's a highly rewarding game, there is no better feeling of overcoming a seemingly impossible battle and turn the tide. Gothic 3 is all about a high stake high reward exploration, discovery, choice, and consequences. And when I look at it, it is, in a way, is a game ahead of its time.",1484891618,1484891910,True,25,0,0.732072412967681885,0,True,False,False

39500,27756955,76561198045226937,0,144,2894,0,2780,1705247749,"I'll start by saying that this game, in its most basic form, is not Gothic, which is partially expected. It's a different engine, In fact, I find that this game has far more in common with Two Worlds than with Gothic, which is a mixed bag for me, because I don't consider TW to be a terrible game. However:
1) This game seems to make all of the mistakes TW made, with none of the redeeming factors.
2) This game is not TW. It's Gothic. I've played the other games and had some expectations going in on both the style of the series and its pedigree.

	From a technical standpoint, the game is below average. The music, while obviously still professional, isn't as memorable as previous games. The graphics are glitchy. Many of the plants pop in and out of existence, some surfaces on buildings are missing, there are a lot of crappy ragdolls, and models for ""unique"" characters are shamelessly repeated. The controls are either laggy or bugged; Even jumping doesn't work most of the time, and enemies phase through objects.

	On the normal difficulty, it's far too easy. Where before it was all about recognizing patterns, this game resorts to button mashing. While the combat system of the previous games made crowd combat impossible, the idiotic AI here finds it acceptable to maintain a reasonable distance and stare menacingly while I run straight into the thick of the group and chop them all down. Most will block attacks, but since blocking doesn't block all damage, it just takes longer to deal with enemies who are constantly on the defense, and does make them any more of a threat. The only real threats are baddies who are too strong or fast to be dealt with in one long-ass combo, and mages who just wreck everybody's shit.

	Like so many RPGs, the game tries to feel like an breathing, living world, but it falls short in many aspects by not going into nearly enough depth to be believable. The reputation system, for example, is just an arbitrary number that keeps track of who I've done quests for (like one of the shoddier features of TW). It's not a dynamic system that actually reflects my behavior with the characters who make up the factions. Say, if I got my rep with the orcs up to 10, and then I murder a stronghold full of civilized orcs, my rep will still be 10. Sure, I'll get questioned about it, but my reputation will remain intact... unless I do it twice.

	The flow of the game is what seriously damages it. Being able to accomplish most of the main quest in whatever order I please is nice, but every part is the same exact thing: Go to a settlement that has a quest item, be denied access until I complete a bunch of smaller quests to be allowed entry, get a bit further in, get blocked again by someone who tells me my reputation isn't high enough, and go through the same stupid stuff until I finally get to the quest item. Then I have to do that like ten more times. Only towards the end does it get interesting.

	There are a boatload of problems with this structure. For one thing, it just isn't fun. Hiding the primary objectives behind layers of samey, repetitive bitch work makes me feel like I'm never making any real progress, even when I am. Of course, the game's freedom provides the means to simply slaughter everyone in my path, but the only time I do that is when I'm frustrated by the mind-bogglingly slow pace of adhering to the quest structure, and even then, the populations of entire cities will just be replaced by generic NPCs who provide less depth than its original inhabitants.

	I wanted to like this game, and it did at least pull off an open-world RPG, but the established functions of the first two games should have been refined, not wiped off the table in an attempt to reinvent the wheel. It almost feels like it was one of those things where a valuable franchise is passed onto an owner who doesn't know or care about what made it great. The incredibly sloppy execution made this game far more frustrating than fun. Also, fuck that ending.",1480209189,1480209189,False,27,0,0.638822674751281738,0,True,False,False

The beginning is ok, and after some hours it is fine, but after you play many more you already figured out the  game.
There are  like all those cities in the game many of them , you have to go into every single one to do quests,
 and to be trusted whit Orks, then you have to kill them and take back the city
And do that like 30 times,whit all of the cities as many as there are cities, but gets boring after like 3-4 cities 
And from like first minute you no where the last guy is .... Really no brainer game  
All quests are boring and really stupid and no point, go get that, fight that ,pick up that ,bring back ,no point for the future game enemies are not getting stronger only I am,worst systam i ever so i a RPG ,
 so now I am level 30, and if a im going into a BIG city ,i easy kill  EVERYONE there, no challenge what so ever any more. 
I was really really expecting so much more from this from what I heard from all this year, but it ended up disappointed :/ overall, will recommend this game only if you really like gothic games, 
I only played the 4 one, that was amazing, so mutch bether than this one

Graphics are still decent, even though the game is 10 years old as I write this review. Voice acting is decent (nothing stellar) and the maps are good. The woods really give a forest feeling, and not just some random trees in a location feeling.
Combat is hard in the beginning, and very unforgiving. Friendly fire is a thing, so when you have companions, careful. Archery is my favourite part, since you have to aim yourself, and judge the tracectory as well as movement speed of your intended target.

The map consists of 3 parts, north of ice and snow, center of lush forests and south of desert. All with their own people, with their own problems, fauna and issues.

Also, gone is the overall ""creepy"" feel from 1 and 2. 3 is very colorful and bright. Those things being said, this still ends up being a great game for lovers of the gothic story line. While the combat is simplistic and there is no need to choose a faction(which may be a turnoff for many gothic purists), the story and player interactions carry this game.

You start the game with you’re 4 companions and kill  some orcs, after that they all leave and give you a total of one quest each when you find them, if you did not play Gothic 1 and 2 you would be asking yourself why are they so important that they get a ending resolution.
And pretty much applies for the rest of the game, you go to a city,  you talk to anyone that has a name, then you go to the rebels that have names, you do all the quests that are neutral and move one to the next city. You lack any care for most of the tasks you are given. because they are mostly a source of XP and money. The hero is the only interesting character because he does not take anything seriously and comments about repeating cliches you have to go through.
Leveling up is a costly business, every attribute, skill or spell costs a fortune, and makes it so that at certain points in the game I had over 200LP but because I was saving money, they ware useless, nobody gives you skills for free. When you actually manage to get that much money and actually have some fun, the game is great, it’s a shame it has to be such a chore to get there.
The game looks graphically better than G1 and G2, however it has stutter issues that might even freeze your game. The game does not close properly sometimes.  Beasts and NPCs may clip through the terrain during combat, a few times a beast was stuck below the ground but kept fallowing me and NPC ware reacting to a beast nearby, but could not attack it.

Combat: Range is not auto-lock you actually have to aim, melee and magic are auto-lock making it difficult when fighting more than one enemy.
Melee, a difficult task that boils down to who can stun-lock the other first unless they block.
Range, get a rock and hope they lack range weapons.
Magic, this time I actually played mostly as a mage and it was a lot of fun, mostly because you can get regenerating mana(eventually), it was the only combat that made the game reasonable and satisfying.

Community has made the patch that fixes and balances almost everything. Although I dont understand why Piranha Bytes did not patch their game themsleves after a few months, instead the community had to do it. I guess JoWood screw them up so hard that it probably had the effect on that as well. Also I would recommend you downloading the Conted Mod too. It brings back that old ""Gothic"" feel that was kinda missing from the vanilla game. Soundtrack is spectacular, one of the best soundtracks if not the best I have ever heard for any video game. Its so atmospheric and it fits the mood perfectly. Quests are kinda boring and the combat sux (I would recommend playing as a mage or archer), but the overall exploration and the beautiful world the game has with the great soundtrack just makes you play more. You have deserty and snowy areas also, each one with their sort of people and their story behind them. The developers paid so much attention to the details, it brings the immersion to whole another level. Gameplay is fun, but the main story not so much. Its a typical story you find in many games, movies, books you name it. Overall Gothic 3 is not as good as G1 and 2, but its a very underrated game and the graphics are very nice considering this was made in 2006. Very demanding for PCs back then tho lol. If you like to play games for pure fun, atmosphere, exploration etc. this is the game for you. But dont play this first or even worse only. Buy Gothic 1 and 2 NotR. Those games are a must play. You can also try Risen 1. With that game they proved that JoWood screwed them up  with Gothic 3, because Risen 1 feels more like a Gothic game then Gothic 3. Dont bother with the rest of the Risen franchise tho. Below avarage games. Gothic 3 gets a score of 7.5/10 from me. 

FYI Dont look at my playtime, I had this game on a disc (still have it, just like all PB games) but I decided to buy it on this steam summer sale just to support the developers even more.

Even though this game was made in 2006, graphics, audio and story are unforgetable even now, in 2016, nearly 10 years after release (13 October 2006). For those who played [i]Gothic 1 and 2[/i], 3rd part can be completely different, I mean, bigger map, more NPCs, more quests, other fighting style, more... definitely MORE SKILLS, and the most important thing - This game is finally hard, but only when you'll install [b]Community Patch 1.75 in connection with Quest Pack 4 + Content Mod 2.6, and before starting the game you'll turn on the [u]Alternative AI and Alternative Balance[/u], this will make enemies don't stand like idiots and waiting for dead, they will be harder, they need some sort of tactic to kill, and if you'll spam LMB, you'll die in 90% of time[/b]
Game itself have 3 endings[list]
[*]Innos Ending - Good ending, humans win, orcs are minority
[*]Adanos Ending - Neutral ending
[*]Beliar Ending - Bad ending, orcs win, most of humans are slaves, Paladins are dead[/list]
For players of [i]Gothic 1 and 2[/i], you'll meet many of your lovely friends, for example[b][spoiler]Gorn, Milten, Diego, Lester, Saturas, Xardas and more![/spoiler][/b]
In game we have few ""factions"" to choose[list]
[*]Rebels - if we are going to Innos Ending, we are helping them, if not - killing them
[*]Orcs - Same as above, but with Beliar Ending, we are helping them
[*]Paladins - Only a few of them survived when Magic of Runes was destroyed
[*]Assassins - Same as Orcs
[*]Nomads - Same as Rebels
[*]Fire/Water Mages/Druids - Nothing special, they just are
[*]Barbarians - Neutral, they hate Orcs for invading their Ancestors' Tombs.[/list]
Remember in [i]Gothic 1 and 2[/i] you had only 1 land? [i]Gothic 1 - The Khorinis Penal Colony ; Gothic 2 - Khorinis and Irdorath for a moment[/i]. In [i]G3[/i] you have 3 lands and you can wander through them loosely[list]
[*][u]Varant[/u] - Land of desert, Nomads, Assassins, Ruins, Water Mages, Cursed Temples, Beliar and everything what's funny!
[*][u]Nordmar[/u] - Land of snow, Barbarians, Fire Mages, Innos, and everything that wants to kill you (Yes, even snow)
[*][u]Myrtana[/u] - The biggest land, of hiding Rebels, dominating Orcs, slavery, and thousands of quests[/list]
But even though there is bulk of side quests, we have only few Main[list]
[*][b]Find Xardas[/b] - Main Quest for 75% of the game
[*][b]Find 5 Adanos Artifacts[/b] - Main Quest for 85% of the game (Until you find Xardas, the quest is hidden)

I tried again but apparently my character decided it was a good time take a nap. 

Eventually I was able through some inscrutable arcane means able to get back up. Noticing I had a ranged weapon option I drew that. Success! And we're back to drooling so I ran around pretending to shoot things while going pewpewpew. This was not very satisfying. I think my character might have died of boredom if I had continued to play much longer. 

Then it dawned on me. It's a cleverly designed punching bag simulator! Starring your character as the punching bag. 

I noticed from the screenshots the game has dinosaurs in it. Alas, I will not be able to recreate that scene from Jurassic Park where everyone is being chased by the T-Rex. 

The camera controls worked but they were as clunky as the rest of the game.

The awful stun-lock disaster: you can't block animals' attacks, only human/orc/skeleton weapons. If an animal bites you, it stun you momentailly (like for half a second), before you can do nuthing but wince from the bite. The problem is, that most animals can bite you again before that hallf-second is over. And that means a single wolf can nibble you health away (quite literally), even if you're an end-game badass with the best armor.

Most die-hard fans of the Gothic series (Gothic 1,2 and Risen 1) wouldn't include Gothic 3 as a legitimate successor to the throne of Gothic.   Then again, there are fans who love and swear by it, offering mods to make up for the many bugs found in the original.  

My comments here are strictly on playing the game.  It tries, is the best I can say.  I've played and beaten Gothic 3 at least four times, so I have an educated opinion to share.   The story is long and drawn out, the world huge, and the time it takes to discover new places for quests can be frustrating, like transversing endless desert sand dunes with a crummy map that doesn't offer much help.   Fighting doesn't have the same gritty feel as this game's predecessors.   When even a whimpy enemy knocks you down, you can die trying to regain footing.  I found that frustrating.   

SPOILER ALERT:

Perhaps my greatest gripe, apart from the many bugs, is the meaningless quests you are sent on.  Quests to free cities of Myrtana and neighboring regions, quests to reclaim the twelve chalices, quests to obtain the relics of Adonos, to open the five temples, on and on.  You could easily spend a hundred hours racing around jumping through all these hoops--but in terms of beating the game, they really have no meaning and are useless!  I saw a youtube video that you can forget all those quests and simply kill the two kings who represent Innos and Beliar, take their magic staffs, and escape into the unknown with Xardas.  I did that myself.  Which turns my hundreds of hours wasted into maybe 60 minutes of gameplay.   All for what?    Whenever I'm tempted to play the game, I quit, recalling the countless hours it takes running from here to there, following the tasks whatever faction you choose to allign with.  Gothic 1, 2 and Risen 1 were definitely made so the quests meant something: at least you were advancing to the end.  With Gothic 3, gameplay is mostly smoke and mirrors.",1467081778,1467081866,False,0,0,0.443940043449401855,0,True,False,False

I'm baffled how the reviews are so positive when you can't even start playing the game.  After dying about 20 times in the first fight, right out of the gate, without so much as a decent story of why I'm fighting a band of orcs, I figure out two things.  One, blocking does nothing.  Two, whoever in a fight starts swinging first wins.  So, combat goes like this.  Ease in, wait for the right moment MASH THE CRAP OUT OF THE MOUSE BUTTON UNTIL TARGET IS DEAD.  If you fail, you get killed because they did the same to you, AI speaking.  But no fear, death only lasts a couple seconds then you stand up again with 15% health.  Of course you dropped your sword, so you have to go find that and pick it up, open inventory, put in quickslot, close inventory, press key to draw sword, and of course because the game at no point pauses in all this you likely die as soon as you get the sword back out again if not before.

I spotted flickering and lagging in game, though I have better computer than ever, seems like the game is not compatible well and the performance jumps from smooth to laggy.
To rate Gothic 3 I will give it 4 of 5 stars. Open world with many beasts to kill, many quests, towns and hideouts. Dialogues are somehow all right, enemy fights are sometimes frustrating, sometimes they get stuck on some object so you can snipe them off. I recommend to play this on easy, as hard is only different in spending more time with more HP pool of enemies but the play style does not change, you only need to put more exp into skills before going in battle with some enemies.
To add, the game is worth the money (10€), though its downfalls do not make it best game, but I can still enjoy it more than most trash games just grabbing money and no content whatsoever. G3 has a lot of content in it, though sometimes seems not finished.
It is really open world, I tried to travel to far edges of map, but there are no plants, beasts or chests, sometimes not even trees and flora. So the game is kind of linear in that way, you will gain very little by travelling all over the map. But sometimes you find the strong beasts nearer to edges hidden before humans and one very important character. Look for the edge of n. 3 on the map and you will find him.

There are 3 landscapes to explore, each with new enemies (despite Orcs) and complete new locations, you can cooperate or fight with 6 factions, gather raw materials for smithing and brew potions and there is hidden treasure everywhere. The overall story is quite generic sometimes, but it keeps you looking for answers.

This is a gem.  It's an old school fantasy RPG that doesn't do a ton of hand holding and is difficult enough that you actually feel like you've achieved something.

It's a large non-linear world that rewards exploration and has quests involving slaughtering entire towns--towns full of fleshed out NPC's that have been giving you quests, etc.

For a 2006 game, the graphics have held up well, and are something along the lines of the first Witcher or Morrowind.

It has some quirks, like a quest to forge the most powerful weapon in the world resulting in something about half as effective as the standard weapon carried by every orc--but if you step back from trying to power game and just enjoy the world and what you're doing to change it--and you have choice about how you want to change it--it is fun.

I've really enjoyed it more than any of the Witcher or Elder Scrolls games.

Tonight I was killing off a town that I had decided needed to be killed off.  I was using a pole arm as I was fighting 50+ opponents at once, and the reach helps with defense in that case while side swipes can hit 4-5 opponents in front of you.  I had taken up a position in a doorway so I couldn't be flanked, and the dead were piling up in front of me, and I started to get the feeling I was being buried underneath the dead.  I paused the game to figure out what was causing that impression, and discovered, there were around 15 corpses in front of me trying to fall down, but they couldn't because I and the walls around me blocked them on the front and the waves of enemies behind them blocked them from the back. So neither I nor my live opponents could reach each other through the corpses pressed too tightly between us to fall.

Corpse physics that affects combat.  In a 2006 game.  Not something I'd heard anyone even mention about the game--just one of those little details you notice playing it.

I have played 100+ hours without Steam.


Gameplay:
This game can be compared to Skyrim. It has quests, from killing wolves to finding underground agents.
Some people say the fighting is bad and that it's too easy, but it's actually good when fighting dozens of enemies at once because you stand a chance.

Story and quests:
You arrive on a land named Myrthana. It was conquered by the orcs and humans still try to recapture their cities. There are 3 paths: You can either side with the humans and try to take back the kingdom, side with the orcs and your friend Xardas and set on a secret mission (I won't spoil it,  but it's really interesting) or you can choose to destroy everyone, but this is a path I haven't tried myself. The game has a complex reputation system which shows what different factions think about you. You will eventually have to travel to Varant (a desert land) to complete your secret mission or to Nordmar (an Icy continent) to help the humans. You can travel to both continents and do the quests there without following any path.

Sound: 
In my opinion, the soundtrack is very good, but the orcs make a weird and repetitive sound when you hit them. (AAH, AAH, AAAAH)

Graphics:
The graphics are good for a game of its time. Install the community patch and the game won't lag.

But installing Comunity Patch is strongly advised, also modding might be interesting for some (more info on both can be found in the discussions).

Pros:

+ Great story line, that continues the adventures of our nameless hero from Gothic 1 and Gothic 2, but the game has dialogs for people who are not fammiliar with the first two games. If you meet someone  from the previous games, they will remember you, but you can ask them who tey are and usually with a whitty remark, they will remind you how you know them.

+ It's an RPG, so you have your standart RPG elements:

          * You do quests, kill monsters, gain experience, level up, earn learning points and use them to learn a bunch of skills, like Hunting, Blacksmithing, Thievery, Alchemy, Magic (Anchient knowledge). 

          * Each set of skills has it's own attributes, like Hunting has archery, improved archery and master archery. Learning points can also be used to increase your hitpoints, stamina or mana.

          * Wide vierity of weapons, also magic can be used in combat.

          * You can make your own weapons, potions and food.

+ Fantastic soundtrack.

+ Open world. You can go where ever you want and do what ever you want (be ware of consequenses, some monsters are strong as hell and will kick your beginer ass). 

+ Three different lands with different climate, different people, different culture and seperate stories that in one way or another intertwine.

+ You can beat up who ever you want (assuming you are skilled enough) and you can kill who ever you want (if you can beat them up or if you've learned Assasination).

+ If you start a fight in a town that doesn't know you and isn't friendly, others will kick your ass (unless you can kick all of their ases :D ). Towns have rules - no fighting (unless you are well known :D)

+ After you've beaten up someone and knocked them down, you can take their weapon and rob them.

+ If you steal something in a town people will start to suspect you, You can try to talk your way out, but they might or might not fall for that. IF they see you stealing, be prepared to fight.

+ If someone sees you killing someone in a town - be prepared to fight. If only one person saw you, you can kill him and get away with it, though others might suspect you're to blame, but just as with stealing, you can try to talk your way out of it. If a lot of people saw you, then you'll have to fight all the people in town.

+ Friends will join your fights and will support you. If you fight a friend, however, others will cheer. :D

+ You can pick sides. What will you choose. Who will you help. - it's up to you.

+ There are a lot of quests and a lot of different mods.

+ The moment you start a revolution...

+ Open ending. The main story gives you a choice on how you'll end the game. And your choice along with your other actions and choices, will determan what future will look like.

+ The game has one of the best gaming community and a Community Patch Team that has releaset the latest and final patch 1.75 that makes the game work and look a lot better. With the patch, you won't be able to tell that the game is so old. (More info on the patch can be found in discussions)

+ The game has mods.

+ The game has some surpises, like hidden diaries that tell a story no NPC knows.


Cons:

- Your decisions have consequences. This is a good thing, but it can actually ruin the game for you, if you did something and you don't know how it will impact the game. For example if you liberate too many towns before you do all the quests  for them, the town head will attack you and you'll loose dialogs and some quests.

- It's a massive game and if you wan't to play it as best as you possibly can, you need to know a lot of stuff. This includes who to kill and who to spare and when, where to look for items etc.

- Dialogs are important. This is nothing new and should be a norm, but sometimes gamers just like to skip dialogs and go kill beasts for no reason, but still get paid for it :D and in oh so many cases dialogs explain what and where you must do to finnish the quest, so skipping dialogs is unadwised. Luckily Quest log shows you the important parts of the dialog.

- At times you will need google to help you with quests. There are quests that conterdict each other and you'll have to choose who's side will you take.

- Some english voice acting is not the best. Other languages have it better.",1452300706,1460207340,True,92,2,0.861626684665679932,7,True,False,False

Other times I experienced that quest items did not spawn, or questgivers that had gone missing when I got back.

the combat system of the game is not one I would call great, its quite simple and a bit dull in the longer run.

at one playthrough I I came to the part where I had to chose sides, and I had pretty much only helped one side and decided to go with the other, big mistake, I had basically killed off most of the questgivers and vendors and could not progress at all.

I had no experience of the series, but it drew me in with its atmosphere and skill based sword-and-shield combat.

As a standalone-experience from the Gothic series I quite enjoyed the game's progression, taking my time to explore the map and liberating towns after raising my level, moving through weaker enemies with ease. At higher levels it feels satisfying to take on a crowd of enemies that you could only barely defeat at the beginning of the game. The game is long but you find yourself traveling around, not getting bored of the same locations. Gaining new skills and abilities in the game is handled exclusively through various tutors thorough the game world, and this system is brilliant in its simplicity.

The melee combat system consist of strong, slow attacks and weaker but faster attacks mixed with power attacks and thrusts. To get anywhere with using melee weapons rhytm and timing of movements need to be perfect, and after learning the behaviour of the different enemies the combat became my favourite part of the game. I can't really judge the other combat styles however.

As for negatives, even with the available community patch enemies may sometimes deal unexpectedly high damage out of a sudden, leaving you to continue from your last quicksave. The game's story is also up to the player to piece together, leading to a rather sudden start for the game. The game has crashed for me two or three times during 70+ hours. There is a lot to nickpick about the game, for which if you really want to read about check the negative reviews on steam.

For a discounted price at least (2,99 € for me) the game is worth a try for anyone interested in trying an interesting RPG classic.

All in all a great, old rpg. If you liked Gothic1+2, you´ll also love this part. Lots of swearing, nice dialogues, diversified quests, character building. Still got its old Gothic spirit.

The only thing I hated (and I REALLY hated it) was the combat system. Either become a mage or some ranger, don´t focus too much on melee, because fighting is really clunky and even in endgame, when you got used to it all, not really that great. I spent 80% of my fights either running away and shooting the enemy with my bow or standing on some plateau/wall/stone where they couldn´t get me and shoot em down from there. Heck, even the enemies often have massive problems attacking you: a lot of enemies can be beaten by simply walking backwards and shooting them. They´ll catch up to you, swing their weapon, walk up to you again, swing their weapon...without hitting you. Not to mention that sometimes the arrows just fly through the enemies (especially snappers, damn beasts...).
IN A NUTSHELL: Focus on ranged attacks and you´ll be fine.

•	Immense world to explore;
•	Beautiful vistas as every location has its purpose;
•	Nonlinear – do it your own way;
•	Freedom of creating any character you desire.

Weaknesses:
•	Quests tends to be repetitive;
•	Quests logs / maps needs a lot of improvement;
•	Brutal system requirements;
•	World not as ‘alive’ as in Gothic 1 and 2;
•	Buggy state if not using the community patch (1.75).

To those who haven’t played any of the Gothic games, you are missing out on a RPG treat – a vast and open world where abundance of exploration filled with non-player characters (NPCs) doing their own things thus making the Gothic series a living and breathing world. Filled with quests galore, its only mishaps is the combat system and extremely high system requirements. The journey now continues with Gothic 3 that improves some of the mishaps from the previous two however added a few more. That’s not to say to ride is game off as the world is massive, filled with some of the most gorgeous vistas I have ever seen in a long while thus making it an explorer’s heaven to boot.

Because of the massive open ended world, to complete the game wholly depends upon what you do. If you are aiming just to finish of the main quest, then don’t play this. This game is designed to be explored from top to bottom and from left to right. It’s a huge world with plenty of things to discover and accomplish. The unfortunate thing is that some quests tends to be repetitive (there’s so much that I can take when ask to defeat so-and-so during those arena quests) however don’t let that deter you. So if you are planning to complete this game the way it’s designed, it can take easily close to 100 hours. For me, at the time of this review recorded close to 120 hours and I still got a quarter of the map to discover and then revisit  the world again to finish off the main quest line.

Granted at the time of release, the game was a buggy mess. Maybe the dispute between publisher JoWood and developer Piranha Bytes have something to do with this. Piranha Bytes ‘left’ the game with version 1.12 (still in a buggy state) however the community, yet again, saved the day. April 2012 saw the latest version 1.75. It’s a sad state of affairs though as if the game ended at version 1.12, we will never get to see the game in its fullest glory. Version 1.75 still have minor issues however, and thankfully so, we get the see the game for what it was meant to be. An ambitious game in term of size however the world, whilst beautiful to explore, it still felt not as ‘alive’ as in Gothic 2. A definite explorer’s paradise to boot though.

7.5 / 10 (basing on community patch 1.75 – without it, it will be a dismal 4).

I have to say if you install the 1.75 ""beta"" test patch its moreorless bug free to a point that it feels like the game it should have been when it was released. 
The game has a lot of merits which are sadly lost mostly in time due to its terrible launch, the story is interesting and the content is massive. I was impressed with just how many quests and towns there was. 

However like every game there was a couple of things that still annoyed me, the usual voice changes (Not as drastic as Forsaken Gods thankfully). Also the rebranding of your friends Gorn is now White so is Vatras, also it felt like Vatras was talking to you like he had only just met you when in reality he sailed in on your ship lol. 

But if we put them minor points aside I think this game is a lot of fun and very much worth buying (If you install the 1.75 patch).

My first impression with the game is that combat wasn't going to be fun at all.  You are dropped off in the middle of a orc invasion with almost no tutorial or guidance.  No ""dodge"", blocking that only partially works, and no ""Game Over, Reload from last saved game?"" prompt after you die.  As guessed, after almost two hours of game time on record, I can definitely say that you will not play this game for the combat mechanics.  Some ennemies are ridiculously hard (small green goblins, really?!) and others are ridiculously easy (group of large orcs with axe, large lizards, mantis, birds, lurkers, ...), walk backward and swing your sword should kill 95% of your foes.

On other fronts, luckily it gets better.  You can go about playing this game in whichever way you want.  You can complete a quest before speaking to quest givers, you can kill the guy you were supposed to rescue, you can make friends or ennemies of different factions, your actions have a true impact on your surrounding world.  The world feels amply big yet filled with nooks to explore and always another chest or plant/flower to pick up after the next road bend.

I've had limited exposure in my time to crafting, having only dealt with Alchemy; be ready to be severly limited in how much you can craft, vials seems to be in limited quantities and required for most potions. Its a good thing you can sleep off your pains and wake up with a full HP bar.

First of all you need to download the latest community patch (i think it's 1.7.5) otherwise the game will crash (Where is the Guru? error) and the mobs will simply one-shot you. Unfortunately the game was forcedly released before is was complete so the base version is full of bugs.
After you have installed both the game and the CP you can play.



G1 G2 comparison:

Differs from Gothic 1 and Gothic 2, you still play as the nameless hero but:
No chapters. You have a few main quest to complete. There are 6 reputation in the game and you have to choose who you want to support. There are 3 different way you can end the game based on your decisions.
Attributes: Strength, Mana, Dexterity, HP (no longer increase with lvl up, you can raise them by using ability points), Stamina (NEW, for combat and sprint) Ancient Knowledge (NEW, for magic), Thief skill (NEW), Smith skill (NEW),  Alchemy (NEW).
The ability points can now be spent in talents. In order to learn a talent you need a specific amount of points in its attribute (ex: 1h sword II req. 150 str. ex: crafting mana pots req. 20 alchemy).
The combat mechanics is completly different. You can now dual wield 1h swords or using 1h sword and a shield. There are different attack types (it's not just left click spam all game long, unless you play on ""very easy"")  but the main difference is that you now have a stamina bar. If you are low on stamina your attaks will be slower, you can't parry/block properly, you can't perform some power attack,  you can't sprint.



Final Judge:

Even if the G2 NotR storyline is the best by far, in terms of pure gameplay i thinks G3 is better thanks to the new talents system. The map is really huge and filled with secret areas.There are a lots of different quests and even an easter-egg like the G1's. A single play can last 100h+ (i'm at 64h doing less than 2/3 of the map). The interface is more user friendly, you have a 10 item slot bar where you can put weapons, foods, magics and bind them with hotkeys (1->0). Now you can cook/craft huge quantity with just one click (it ask how many instead of left clicking on the fire 50 times) and also loot easly with the ""pick all"" button (or rightclick on corpes with CP). Pots and foods now restore a % of you max health/mana instead of a flat number.



Game Mode:

With the CP you can choose 2 different play style. The base mode and the advanced mode. The advanced mode rebalances the talent trees, so it's harder (probably impossible) to build a balanced hero that can do everything by unlocking all the talents.



I played as:

- 1h sword + shield warrior, both easy and boring since you can win any 1v1 duel but it's really hard when you're surrounded by enemies and so you have to do some cheesy pull to avoid that.
- mage, really funny. A bit hard in the beginning since you have to hit and run to regen you mana pool and the staffs deal less dmg than swords (obv.) but when you've learned the mana reg. talent and you have a decent mana pool it's really enjoyable. It's not broken as the G2 mage that one-shots anything or deals no dmg at all.


Others:

I know there are mods but i never tried them.
Good Soundtrack



Tips:

I do not recommend the highest difficulty for your first run since you need to learn the combat system first. If you really want to start with the hard mode, just save after the inizial cutscene becouse you're going to die a lot of times :P

Since the decisions you make can really impact the game, if you want to do the most quest possibile don't rush things, just talk with every one and accept as many quest as you can. Even if killing everyone is fun it may have bad consequence on your game plan.

You can open the inventory during a fight and the game just pause. So you can regen your hp by drinking pots or eating foods without getting attacked. I know this mechanic sounds really lame and it wasn't possibile in G1 and G2 but the game is almost impossibile sometimes without using it.",1454423213,1454423638,True,23,3,0.674059092998504639,2,True,False,False

Pros:
-good voice work for character
-graphically still playable (although on the lower end of acceptable in 2015/16)
-lots of skills, spells, and reputation/experience systems athat are really neat in contrast to my recent ARPGs of late (Witcher3 and DarkSouls 2), getting spells requires certain skills and learning points, and praying to gods.
-big and attractive world to explore freely
-no lack of quests and gear

Cons:
-no crosshair or frame of refrence when in 3rd person... I never know if I'm aimed at someone to talk or not. and grabbing items off ground is very hard to tell what you're grabbing for/if you miss something
-requires a community patch to be playable at all
-inventory/UI is fairly lackluster in means of RPG-standards (still havent found an 'equiped items' or character screen)
-the story so far is generic as all heck


Overall I'd reccomend if you're looking for a new RPG and have drained the available pool of fantasy RPGs that've come out in recent years. But be ready for some 'getting used to' if you're not familiar with gothic games",1450911970,1450911970,True,4,1,0.538643062114715576,0,True,False,False

The game is actually fun at times, but I wouldn't recommend it because the game is fricken long and there are much better games out there for someone to play first.  I only recommend playing this game if you are out of games to play.

The problem with Gothic 3 is that the game maker ran out of creative ideas.  They took their old ideas from gothic 1 & 2 and apply to gothic 3 and by doing so makes the game long and repetitive.  You basically do some chores and killing some monsters for every town and every faction to get reputation points until you reach a certain reputation, and you do it again again again again again again again......

The main story is subpar.  The chores you do are not tied to the main story.  The characters you met in story are shallow comparing to gothic 1 and 2.  The voice acting is boring comparing to gothic 1 and 2.

What I liked about gothic 1 back then is the immersion.  When I got into old camp, I really liked the whole atmosphere.  Gothic 1's world had an awesome atmophere, and the game is like a combination of adventure and survival horror.  Gothic 1 made me want to explore more and fed my curiosity about what is gonna happen next.  Gothic 2 is less so.  The world of Gothic 3 is just stupid.  The world is boring.  The atmosphere sucks.  There is hardly dungeon like gothic 1 and 2.  Also there is no point exploring because there is also nothing up in the mountain and underwater.  

The combat system sucks monkey balls.  When you attack, you have to make sure you are on low ground and not high ground because you would swing over monster's head and no hit anything if you are on high ground.  The main character is always under-armored against monsters which kill you easily in horde unless you keep spamming spin moves.  The magic is overpowered.  Once you get mana regeneration, the game is pretty much over.  Archer is under powered.  Basically, the game is not balanced.  Anyone playing this game is forced to play a melee fighter because magic and archery are repetitive, and most of the cool items are for melee path.

Also it is stupid that the good stuff you get in this game are not from quests but from opening chests which are predetermined.  

I spent about 180 hours and I am about half way done.  I actually wasted 50 hours in another game until I found out I don't really like alternative balancing of the community patch, and I had to start all over.  Right now I am about 2/3 done, and I don't feel like finishing it because this game has become repetitive and tedius.  I don't feel like doing any more chores, escorting any more people, delivering any more stuff, and killing any more bandits.  

Overall, if you have never played this kind of game, you might enjoy it, but if you have played every open world RPG's and gothic 1 and 2, this game is very underwelming.",1449984031,1449984031,False,4,1,0.492350280284881592,3,True,False,False

The combat isn't the best, but I found that it was tolerable after the initial hour of awkwardness. I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of hardcore RPG's, and for the game to be played with the community patch v1.75. Be warned; if you play the game in windowed, the windows cursor will appear in the game and can get annoying for some players. Finally, the draw distance / land streaming could be a lot better, but it's an old game so I think it's tolerable, considering that the game is free of loading screens, allowing you to seamlessly travel from town to town.

My favourite thing about Gothic 3 is that every item is animated when you use it. You don't just gulp down 5 health potions in an instant, rather you have to stand still and visibly take out a potion to drink from (modern day counterpart would be Dark Souls estus flask usage, though if you drink it via inventory then enemies ignore you. Inventory is real time, but stops all combat; enemies that are targeting you seem to stand in place and wait until you are done). Another interesting thing to note would be that there are lots of choices in the game. Help the orcs or help the rebels, turn in a captured slave or help him escape, etc. Each with its own rewards, from simple gold and xp to unlocking trainers that can teach you special skills, or to acquire unique items.

Every skill has to be learned from some trainer, such as skinning animals for certain parts, how to smith certain weapons, etc. and these can be taught by doing favours for trainers and then paying for their knowledge provided that you have learning points (gained from levelling up). This leads to some interesting levelling choices, where you can specialise (at least early on) into certain professions, whether you want to craft lots of useful potions or create your own swords (but using them requires other skills, depending on what you craft).

The biggest thing I've noticed is a lack of a quest marker, as well as easy to read status effects. You'll have to listen to dialogue (thankfully logged in a journal) for clues as to where to find certain things and or what to do for your quest. Every NPC is voiced, though the voice acting becomes fairly bland after a while so it's better to turn on subtitles and skip through boring sentences. 

Fast travel is a thing, though you'll need to find teleportation runes associated with each town (typically found in the corrosponding town) to be able to teleport freely back to it whenever you want by using it, as it's an actual item that sits in your inventory. The game rewards exploration as well as providing some dungeons that can be quite a challenge to clear.

I had played the first two in the series and always wanted to finish the story of the nameless hero, but I had heard what a buggy mess Gothic 3 was. I played this on version 1.75.14 of the community patch. Even with the patch and playing on a modern computer, the game still lags. The good news is that when I wasn't hitting those lag spikes, the frame rate was mostly very smooth at high settings. The game was also pretty stable, it only crashed maybe five times the whole time I played, and always when I created a bunch of mayhem in a town. And this was in 120 hours of playing. There were some other noticeable bugs, though. On a couple of occasions, npc's somehow got ten feet in the air, or disappeared under the ground. When sneaking sometimes the camera would switch from my character to a nearby npc and I couldn't get it back. When standing on a boulder to shoot at animals attacking me, they sometimes clipped inside the boulder and actually bit me through the rock from below. And I had to spawn King Rhobar with a console command because he did not appear in his throne room. None of this made the game unplayable, but it's very noticeable after playing much more polished games like Skyrim.

Gothic 3 differs from the first two in that it follows the open world model of Elder Scrolls. Personally, I prefer the narrative structure of the first two games to the sandbox approach. There is a story that slowly reveals itself as you travel across Myrtana, and you meet several old friends from the earlier games like Diego, Milten, Lares, Vatras, and Lester. The short of it is, the orcs rule Myrtana, the remaining free human settlements are in the mountains of Nordmar, and the Hashishin rule the desert in Varant. You have the freedom to choose who you want to side with: orcs, humans, Hashishin, nomads. Or you can just ally yourself with your old friend Xardas, who is squirreled away in a tower in the mountains. One thing I've always liked about the Gothic series, similar to Witcher, is that character and plot development is driven by actions and consequences over the abstract concept of good versus evil. That said, the weak narrative structure of Gothic 3 makes it hard to get really invested in the story. I literally only had one meaningful interaction with Xardas in my whole game that lasted all of two minutes. And the ending of the main story was completely underwhelming. No epic final boss battle, just perform a certain task and report back. The End. When you play a game for over a hundred hours, you expect something a little grander.

The world of Gothic 3 is great. It's huge, and varied, and visually it still looks good nine years after its release. It's also very much alive, with wildlife that behaves like wildlife. They sleep, they hunt, they even leave you alone if you keep your distance or move past them quickly without loitering. Humans and orcs live their daily lives, eating, drinking, reveling. The game has tons of dialogue, and while the voice acting has been criticized, I enjoyed that pretty much everyone you meet in the game actually talks. Characters are believable as well. No black-and-white good or evil like in other games. The orcs are occupiers, but have a complex working relationship with the enslaved humans. They are for the most part noble and honorable. I even came to like them, though ultimately I betrayed them.

Playing with auto balancing turned on in the community patch version made character development choices much more meaningful. With a limited number of learning points to spend, I made my guy a hunter/fighter with absolutely no magic abilities. He also was skilled as a thief and an alchemist, with a little bit of smithing. This made the game much more enjoyable from a role play aspect, and made it challenging throughout versus having some uber god character at the end. The combat itself was horrible, and I didn't even bother swinging my sword until I finally saved up for some paladin armor. My character's movement and reaction time in melee combat was so slow and clunky that taking on more than one enemy at a time was serious trouble. Even in the later levels, my master duel wield swordsman still had to resort to whittling enemies down with arrows before moving in with his swords.

All-in-all, I had a lot of fun with Gothic 3, but the bugs, weak narrative, and combat keep it from being great.",1437179115,1437179115,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

today was my first 2 hours in gothic 3, it was cheap so i figured why not buy it and give it a try, i now want to buy all of the gothic games !

the combat seems very strange but also very challenging, attacking and hitting befor your opponent does, wich usually means exploting the AI.

this game is like a REAL adventure, you don't know where you are, whats going on and every single encounter i've had so far has been exilerating and full of just blasing adventure. for example ''i enter a cave at the beach guarded by white creatures, once inside the cave i find a band of goblins, took them out from range with my trusty bow, some of them with my staff, i found a chest with amazing loot ! spells and potions and gold ! i was observing my surroundings when i suddenly heard spider noises, i was hesitant to continue my exploring through the cave but curiousity got the better of me, ten i saw a spider like creature, like a minotaur but with a spider body, i got so spooked i backed up and unleashed arrows on it, but then the moment came i backpelled off of a cliff in the cave, that was the end of my life, my first death''
something that would definately happen to someone in  real life encountering such a hazard i reckon, and that just sealed the stamp for me, this game is awesome.

you find interesting characters all over the place, incredibly immersive structures, new monsters, so so much to explore.

The gameplay was better in the second game but I guess It could be worse so we'll do with it.
The game can be really confusing sometimes, the quests, the map, pretty much everything but the game itself is good.
Just 2 things I do not like which are the freeroam and the ending.
Do not except  The Elder Scrolls or even a Fallout game, it's open world but at the same time it's linear.
You cannot continue after the ending, not even a new game plus.

Those are 2 big flaws that are common in the games made by Piranha – Bytes.
For some, it could be positive but for a gamer like me, they are both flaws.
It's pretty much the same for every Gothic and Risen games, just that some have a better story, gameplay, items etc than the others.

If it was truly open world with unlimited freeroam and we would be able to continue playing after the end, I would probably give it a 8/10 but since it is not the case I'm giving it a 7.5/10


My favorite list:

1. Gothic II
2. Gothic
3. Risen
4. Gothic III
5. Risen 2: Dark Water
6. Arcania: Gothic 4 (I wouldn't consider this one as a Gothic game though)

They are all good In my opinion, but some are more worth than the others, of course, they all have their good and bad.
If only they would have a true freeroam and no ending.

The mage build is a bit grindy at times but a hunter (my personal choise) is amazing. Skin your own prey, get trophies like glands, teeth, claws and much more. The main quest is engaging and makes you want to explore the entire map. By the way, the map is humongous and has its own climate zones. But, I think the combat system is not the best for example fighting a pack of wolves with a sword is the worst idea, you can't block attacks from animals even with a shield. But when you get a bow or get training in crossbows and get one. They are easy to handle.

Finally decided to pick it up last sale as I figured both Skyrim and Witcher 3 are well known for their bugs too. (I needed to console hack Skyrim in order to keep the thief quest line from bugging and resetting). Just like Skyrim needs community patches, so does Gothic 3 and in my experience I had no major issues here like I did with Skyrim.

I also have to say Gothic 3 is a better PC experience out of the box than Skyrim; which needs SkyUI to come close to functioning as a PC game as well as a hotbar addon which none of them worked quite right. Gothic 3 has a hotbar built in so you never need to be bothered by constantly going in and out of menus. For instance, towards the end of my play I'd throw out some ice spears, freeze people, pull out my bow and finish them off, kite away, toss back some healing and mana pots, throw some more ice spears, take out my sword and hack away the rest. In both Skyrim and Witcher series (which are console experience games) you'd be constantly be going in and out of menus to get all of that done. Gothic is a very seamless experience that I really appreciate.

It's a shame that the game was rushed out of release and never received the polish it deserved. At it's core is a really great game, but there are annoying issues. I think I ran into two instances where voice audio was missing from the dialog and one or two other instances where the dialog was spoken by the wrong person. Also it's pretty annoying that if you've got a sword and shield equipped, then use your pickaxe, that your shield doesn't get re-equiped. Still, I'd take that bug anyday over going in and out of pause menus just for a single fight.

I got over 70hrs of gameplay out of it which is what you'd expect and I really rushed the end of the game.

Morrowind is my all-time favorite game and although I love TES to bits, Gothic succeeds in many areas that TES is lacking.  For example, it is fully voice acted and done very well.  The city and castle designs are a bit more... real.  NPCs behave like real people, going to bed at night and lounging in predictable areas during the day- they don't run all over the place so that it's a pain to track them down.  Quest givers are very straightforward and clear about what you need to do and there is an excellent quest tracking system which records the dialog so you can reread all of the details and sorts quests by town it was given in.

Gothic 3 does have some AI issues- like NPCs getting stuck and just standing there while you kill them- but for the most part the AI is quite good.  Animals roam together in packs and will attack you if one of their members is attacked.  When fighting a large group of enemies (which is all the time in this game) they will usually circle around you while you attack 1v1 with one of them, and then another will move in after that one dies, although they also randomly jab you in the back often.  It may not be completely realistic, but it does feel pretty cinematic to be encircled by enemies without being ganged up on by all of them at once.

One of my favorite things about Gothic is the dueling system.  When you win a fight with an NPC they are not dead, just knocked out, and you must perform a kill move to actually kill them.  Winning fights with the most seasoned warriors of every village is actually a good way to build reputation (and make money in the arena.) It also allows you to get away with things like attacking someone and robbing them without being murdered by NPCs in response.

Gothic is a COMPLETELY open world.  You can go anywhere and do anything, although you are subtly urged to see certain areas first in order to progress the story.  But for the most part the story can work regardless of what you do or see first.  The setting is absolutely fantastic, with 3 distinct countries to visit, many large towns populating them, with lots of forests, caves, rivers, mountains and grasslands to explore in between.  And the diversity of animals and enemies is very good too.

Like Gothic 1 and 2, Gothic 3 does not have a strong plot.  It's orcs vs humans as usual, with pretty much no character growth or moral messages or anything like that.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's probably one of the reasons Gothic isn't more popular- it doesn't pull on people's heartstrings or get you emotionally invested at all.  The world is incredibly detailed and immersive, but there is not very much lore.  Gothic 3 expands a little bit on the story of the 3 gods, but it only scratches the surface.  Although the 3 distinct human cultures are very fleshed out in details such as architecture, clothing styles, manner of speaking, etc we never get to learn their history which is really a missed opportunity.

Plot-wise, one of Gothic's strongest points is that your actions REALLY do matter and have a real effect on the progression of the story, and this is even more apparent in Gothic 3.  You can choose which side of a war to support, and a great deal of the game is about you earning the respect of different factions, either to fight beside them or later betray them.  You may find that something you did earlier screwed you over.  Personally I make a new save every play session and don't overwrite it just in case.

Now, here is what I don't like about Gothic.  It's hard as hell, and sometimes not in a fun way.  Gothic 3 is a lot better than the older ones in this regard, but sometimes the amount of enemies is excessive.  You will be ganged up on by packs of wolves whose attacks are unblockable.  (I've heard the community patches fix the wolf issue, among other things.) You often have to battle an entire town of enemies, either by yourself or with a couple NPCs who aren't much help.  I absolutely love the feeling of participating in a war this game gives me, but you should have a bit more help on your side.  

In conclusion, I rate this game 9/10.  If the combat was less frustrating it would be a 10.  I would recommend this game to anyone who likes RPGs, and I would definitely say play Gothic 1 and 2 first if you haven't-- both great games and Gothic 3's story is a direct continuation from those.",1434355429,1434355429,True,0,2,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

[b]Allow me to explain:[/b]

I love Gothic 3. I come back to it over and over even though by now the graphics are seriously dated (I had originally reviewed the game many years ago and called it beautiful) and I have discovered pretty much everything in the world that there is to discover. There are hours upon hours of quests and content in the game to keep you busy and most of them are pretty easy to figure out. Rarely do you have to trek across an entire continent (like in some other open world RPG's out there) in order to pick up item x and then walk all the way back to drop it off. It happens... but it's rare. 

Allow me to first address the number one thing anybody will ever criticize about any Pirhana Bytes game: The combat [b]SUCKS[/b]! Even after official and community patches it's still one of the worst combat systems I've ever experienced and without a doubt [i]the[/i] worst in an RPG. Let me save you some frustration though:
[list]
[*] If you're fighting near a hill, ALWAYS make sure you're below the enemy; if you're fighting downhill you can't hit them for some reason.
[*] Trying to use any offensive spell other than fireball will most likely get you killed; don't invest any of your learning points into magic. In fact just use archery and you'll be a lot happier with combat once you get the better bows.
[*] If you do have to fight in melee, just mash the attack button. Never block, it's useless. If the enemy backs up out of range and you can't close the distance, stop attacking for a second and right when they're about to strike, spam attack again.
[*] Two handed weapons are super strong but while your character is powering up his swing, you will be murdered. With enough points in strenth a one handed sword can one-hit almost every enemy in the game.
[/list]
Like I said, combat is extremely unbalanced and poorly executed but once you get used to it, it's actually kind of funny. Near the very beginning of the game there is a literal army of orcs camped outside a castle and with very little training and the starting weapon I was able to single handedly kill every last one of them because for some reason they all wait for you to kill the guy you're attacking before another one attacks you. The only exception to that is with archers; they'll shoot you while you're fighting someone else.

The world is huge and unfortunately either due to how old the game is or simply poor design choices (a common theme with Pirhana Bytes' games) the quick travel system is horrible. You have to first find teleporter stones to a town or (very rarely) another location and then use them like an item. A neat idea but it just doesn't work well. For one thing, the cities are in some cases so far apart that even if you use a teleporter stone you still have to walk for 20 minutes to where you're trying to go. Since enemies and items never respawn this gets pretty boring in the mid-game. But on the plus side there [i]is[/i] a lot to see and discover in the world; obviously not as much as say, Oblivion, but it gets relatively close (it has absolutely nothing on Skyrim, though).

As with all of the Gothic and Risen titles, the voice acting is a joke. In Gothic 3 this is compounded by the script also being a joke. I don't think it was given to a native English speaker for proofreading; if it was he just phoned it in that day. I would love to see a Gothic 3 movie that uses the actual game script. That would be comedy gold.

There isn't a WIDE variety of weapons but there are plenty to keep you progressing. Unfortunately theyre's always one obvious choice that's better than what you have, no real reason to experiment with other weapons. For example: I have never used an axe or a quarterstaff. There's no point. That would be really annoying in any other RPG but since, as I mentioned above, combat was little more than an afterthought by the developers of this game... you don't really notice. You just buy the next better weapon so that you can kill faster.

Magic system is broken and they never bothered to fix it, don't even waste your time. Some of the spells have such a long ""power-up"" (super saiyan) time that you'll be dead before you ever get to see what they do. Having fireball scrolls can be useful in a pinch but they do about the same damage as a strong bow unless you waste a bunch of learning points strengthening your magic (and ultimately losing the game unless you're fairly experienced).

Speaking of learning points, in the Gothic games (and the first Risen) you level up differently than in other RPGs. You gain experience and gain a level like in other games but you don't get anything but learning points when this happens. You then have to find trainers to either increase attributes or teach you new skills. In the beginning of the game you level up super-fast but levelling eventually slows down and then stops so make sure you have a plan on where you want your character to go before you start spending learning points willy-nilly. I like this system, I just wish there were more levels in the game so that you could customize your character a bit more. You can really only MASTER one combat art which is why I say magic is useless... if there were more learning points available it'd be fun to play around with but it stunts your strength in melee or ranged combat.

Reagents for potions never grow back like they do in, say, The Elder Scrolls. On the surface this seems wrong but the fact that there are potions you can make that permanently increase one of your attributes or skills shows you why they did this. If you could just keep making those over and over again there would be no need to ever spend learning points. There are plenty of reagents in the world to make more healing potions than you will ever need, anyway. Honestly come to think of it I don't think I've ever made a healing potion. You find a ton just by fighting and opening chests.

I could go on forever. It's difficult to explain what makes Gothic 3 a good time because, especially as a new player, you will rage quit a few times. You will hear some dialogue exchanges that make you think ""why the hell am I playing this?"". You will notice some of the skills or crafting recipes never got finished (only 2 or 3) and if you spend money to learn them you basically just wasted your money. Quests will break and you'll have to load a save (and in a couple rare cases I've found, completely start the game over).

But I love it.

The game is really something i tell you, i even played the game for about 50 + hours despite of all the bugs and i still havent completed it 100 %. There are so many hidden areas to uncover, treasure chests to open, temples to open and explore. There are temples and many other buildings to uncover in each area. Every part of map has its on unique structures and landscape.

I could write so many more but i dont want to one of those guys that writes down a whole novel :)

People say it's the best RPG in the world, even better than Skyrim because it has such an amazing, large and deep world to play with. That may be! Except the combat mechanics are literally the worst I've ever had to endure in a video game. Melee combat is horrific. When you try to block an attack it's 50/50 whether it'll actually block it or not. It's not supposed to be 50/50 - if you block it's supposed to block - but the game is so buggy it doesn't always register. You can't tell when an enemy is going to attack because animations are so stiff and poorly done, so it's almost impossible to know when to block. The enemy, on the other hand, will block all your attacks with total efficiency. If you want to play as a melee character, this leaves you with no choice but to approach an enemy and furiously mash the left mouse button to attack over and over and hope you win, which is 50/50. Quite often the enemy will hit you and make you stumble, putting you in what I call a ""death spin"" which you can't get out of. This is where the enemy keeps stunning you with each hit, meaning you can't retaliate and eventually die.

Furthermore, the game is buggy as hell. Even with the community patch this game is horrendously buggy. I had to restart 3 or 4 times to get past the first part because after I had killed all the enemies in the little village (by furiously mashing the left mouse button because there's nothing else you can do) because you have to talk to this guy to advance the story afterwards, except when I tried to talk him he just said ""talk later"". After 3 or 4 restarts he finally talked to me.

Archery is even worse. All you have to do is stand on a spot that breaks the enemy AI (which is basically on any kind of rock or tree stump because the AI is awful) and the enemies will begin slowly walking away from you because they have no way of getting to you. So you can wipe out nests of 100 goblins by standing on a rock, even though under normal circumstances 2 or 3 at once would be a challenge.

I can't recommend this game. It's absolutely awful.",1426508637,1426508637,False,3,4,0.437831699848175049,0,True,False,False

Other than that, cheap death after cheap death will remind you of the era of nintendo gaming that caused the invention of the rage-quit.  The combat system is one of the worst I've ever seen, bad guys back up constantly and frustratingly with every swing, the best way to engage anyone is to attack them against a wall.  You may see your arrow hit dead center, but don't worry, you didn't hit them.  Potions take a lifetime to drink if you're fighting someone.  If you face two of anything and there is a hill or other obstacle there is a good chance that you should run or at least position yourself in a way that nothing is at your back, as a cheap death may be in your future.  Some chests are completely off limits and important, maybe one of a kind shopkeepers will attack you to the death over touching them with no warning, most others have no consequences for taking their contents, there is no way to tell the difference.  Selling things to shopkeepers is even annoying, I put all the junk I wanted to sell in the window, pressed sell, it instantly gave the guy everything for free.  My first sales experience in Gothic 3.  It was probably my fault, I guess you have to move the coins you want over manually from the shopkeeper, but it was not something that added to the charm of the game after being murdered by a pair of THE WEAKEST OPPONENTS IN THE GAME against a hill in a way that made me unable to swing my sword once.

Gothic series has always had its problems. Sure, it has a cult following and it does have its moments, but for the most part, it's mediocre at best. The dialogue in all 4 games is insufferable, the controls are base, the combat is painful to the point where the way your character handles himself in combat situations is why you fail rather than because you were bested, the quests are confusing and the character animations look like they were done for a highschool project. The main character you play as is just some forgettable average bearded muscle-bound man. He's bland. The end of his description.

I received a quest to kill bandits along the coast. Great, sounds pretty normal, right? No. The area on the map I was pointed to confused me. It made it look like I had to go along the coast but the coast ends into a cave with goblins. Wrong area. So I figure I should swim around. Nope. Okay, backtrack and go inland, maybe there's a path to the edge of the cliff on the coast. Never found it. I get into fights with wolves along the way. They just NON-STOP lunge at me until I die. You have to wait for your hit animation to play out before you can react (Dark Souls...) which leaves you open to attack for a ridiculous amount of time. During that time, they repeat their attacks until you are dead. You have to cheese EVERY ENEMY in the game. There is no strategy to be had. Even when I turned on the Community Patch Alternative AI, it didn't change anything. Blocking became more effective but the claims in the patch notes that it made combat more sensible were false. None of the enemies behaved any differently. I switched back and forth with the AA and it did nothing that made a difference.

It makes no sense that combat is basically me slamming the left mouse button and my character swishes his sword left and right like a dainty ballerina - some effeminate clown that is afraid of the sword he's wielding. You just move forward slightly, barely swinging the sword over and over. That's combat. It also gets you stuck inside obstacles if you're not careful.

The game is also insanely unstable. I'm using a machine that can run Watch Dogs in its terribly unstable state on ultra settings with 60 fps and Gothic 3 saw me running at 40 fps with constant drops and hitching. The entire world is exposed so you have to dynamically load static objects, scripts and textures on the move. Every 2-3 minutes of walking leads to a pause for about 3-5 seconds where the game is trying to load the new area. Even when I am walking around a small area, I still get framerate hiccups that make me feel like I'm back on my Dell Dimension 2400. 

Gothic 2 didn't have these performance problems which means they didn't learn anything between that game and 3. Even Arcania: Gothic 4 has the same performance problems! I had to force Vsync in Gothic 3 and 4. What the hell is going through a game designers head when they decide a game DOESN'T need vsync?...

Gothic 3 is unplayable. The story is dumb, the character names make me cringe, the quests make no sense, the performance is upsetting, the combat is painful and the entire experience made me feel like I wasted the $2.49 the game cost on sale when I got it. It's so bad, I feel like I wasted 2 and a half dollars. I feel like this game has put a dent in my mental stability. Do NOT buy this game, it's a dreadful experience. The only positive thing I can say about it is the concept. The idea of being able to go anywhere, talk to anyone, kill anyone, take anything and have real consequences that the player will have to deal with is great.

[h1]Basic Infos[/h1]
Gameplay lengh: About 300-500 hours if you want to level high and see everything. 150 if you play through most content quickly.
Required skill level: Experience with RPG games and knowledge in oldschool RPGs. Studing how the game mechanics work but also keeping a cool head for hours.

Please note even if I'm merely clocking about 50 hours of it on Steam as of this review, I've already played through the game with the DRM-free version of it and it took me over a month of playing this game daily without any rushing through.

Furthermore this review has been written considering the following [i]essential[/i] mod, depending on how you see it. It is about as detrimental for the game as the game itself.

- Gothic 3 Enhanced Edition Patch v1.75 International release

It is [b]highly recommended[/b] that you install this patch before you play this game.

There are a couple of other mods out there that enhance this game, like the ""Questpaket"" version 4.2, which has English subtitles available.

[h1]About Gothic 3[/h1]
A lot of negative things can be said for a game like Gothic 3. It was released, as all releases of the Gothic series as a catastrophe. In 2006 at the time of release it was such a crash prone, bug ridden mess that almost nobody liked it, not even hardcore fans. Very similar to Gothic 1 it even was unbeatable because of the many bugs and problems. But since Piranha Bytes has a strong bond between them and the fanbase, they dicided to handle things over to the community. While some might argue that this is a rather lazy way of developing a game, a lot of others believe that the fans certainly knew for the best, sonsidering the unreasonably strict timeline publisher JoWood inflicted on Pyranha Bytes. After over 3 years of patching and care-taking, this game was finally able to become the greatness as envisioned by the developers but also the fans. It's considered the definite version of the game.

You also don't need to play through Gothic 1 and 2 in order to understand this games backstory. However, it can answer a lot of questions regarding the world, the Hero himself and his way to handle prople. Still, if you take your time reading through hundreds of pages of dialogues alone you can quickly grasps what happened around you.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1] 
Gameplay-wise this game has the typical Hack and Slash action formula with the twist of also adding role playing elements in a different way as people knew already from previous Gothic games. Imagine a Game like Diablo with the freedom from games like Fallout but in third person, and you get what Gothic 3 is supposed to be. That might be the best way to describe this game.

The main theme of this game can also be considered its main gameplay aspect, and that is the theme of freedom both in the storyline and gameplay-wise you'll find yourself in a world that doesn't explain much to you. Because of that you should properly always think about focusing your skills so you can live an easy life and Gothic typicaly this game is anything but easy.

For instance and without spoilering of course there are quests in which the player has to defeat hundreds upon hundreds of enemies with the help of maybe one Non Player Character. Quests can range from simple ""Kill this Person or this Monster"" and fetch quests, to whole adventures based on exploration. Even non Gothic fans know about the infamous ""Where is the Guro?"" questline that only people who truely enjoy exploration found as it's entirely optional regarding the entire game itself and the reward is to travel throughout the game while finding interesting and secret things. This doesn't mean that this game is boring, as Hacking and Slashing is the main focus and leveling up itself offers so many options to choose from.

To give a few examples, there are 39 spells to choose from, and there are 23 passive skills to learn just for doing physical attacks or to defend yourself and there are much more different skills ranging from smithing, to stealing from someones pocket. All of them need learning points and you get 10 of them with each level up and while this sounds simple it merely gives you free room so you tackle the immense hordes of hundreds of enemies in the middle game.

The Gothic series is known to be very challenging and hardcore games and the third incarnation is no exception from this. Almost all of the several hundred Quests are available from the start of the game where the only true requirement is to find them if the player chooses to wander around looking for important ""named"" Non Player Characters. It has to be noted that this game is totally MASSIVE. Apart from MMORPGs, most single player games don't come close to this in scale. This can be intimidating for newcomers of the genre, as there is no fast travel or any form of help other than a compass. It takes about an hour to walk from the lower left to the upper right corner of the entire game. About 40 minutes if you choose to run (about twice as fast as walking) and wait for the stamina to replenish.

As you can walk to almost every place right after the start of the game and due to the freedom of this game it's totally up to you on how to handle things entriely your own way. However, with this freedom a lot of mistakes are bound to happen. As the Hero shapens the way you can desire to choose whatever you want so it's recommended to always think about your next step, like what you would like to skill next or if you really want to follow a specific quest.

I haven't yet tackeled the general setting, but thats just because that this game is focusing on hardcore hack and slash gameplay that even hundreds of quests aren't exactly this eye-catching. The premise goes like this, you either join up with either the Orcs or Humans and kill those who are in charge of this entire ordeal. As every NPC is killable right from the start it's up to you to kill EVERYONE or follow the rules as set up in the beginning of the game. This may sound simple on paper but believe me its far from it, as you need lots of carefully planning to archive the main goals of this game.

[h1]Graphics and Sound[/h1]
Graphically this game was amongst the prettiest in 2006 and as it actually stood the test of time says a lot about its graphical fidelity. To be honest the grass landscape of Myrtana alone looks almost as good as Skyrims and considering the age and budget gap of both games I believe thats surely an achievement.

In terms of sound however, this is one of the best games for the PC, ever. Seriously, if you even just enjoy good music you have to get this game right now. Kai Rozenkranz is a genius when it comes to creating atmospheric music that fits spot on into the game. However, there is one song that stands out negatively and thats the Battle music. It's always the same theme when you're fighting a usual enemy and after a few hundred hours this may get on your nerves. This is forgotten when the player finally reaches the city of Ishtar, where argueably the best music in the entire game plays and you'll find yourself again after spending hours upon hours of your free time into this game without noticing that it's dark outside already, in the real world of course. 

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Gothic 3 is a very ambitioned game and I believe that its too bad the project was cut short for release due to the old publisher. With the user created patches and mods mentioned above however I believe that this might be one of those games that will stay fun even after decades to come. I highly recommend everyone to buy this game when a Steamsale comes along if you're still not sure if this game might be of interest to you. If you think this game is interesting and you enjoy huge in scale RPGs with an oldschool soul, get this now.

39500,13316754,76561197996031175,0,91,4395,0,4395,1418509892,"Gothic 3 is my great, white whale.

I bought it when it first came, but gave up on it due to balance issues and frustration. Basically, Gothic 3 was another victim of a publisher (JoWood) forcing a developer (Pirahna Bytes) into puppy-milling out a game before it was ready for prime time. G3 lingered as that one game I wanted to play and finish to get closure on the series, but the infuration of playing it was not worth it.

Until ...

Over the years a Community Patch was created that fixed most of the nut-kicking issues. Folks said it was better once the patch was applied. So, I decided to take the plunge. I wasn't expecting stellar GOTY game play or awesome balance. I just wanted to grind through it to get the story and slay my great, white whale. Or, at the very least, come to terms with it over a nice cup of tea at the cafe while talking about old times.

For the most part, the patch makes G3 better. Much better.

But ... now we just get to the ""normal"" annoynaces that may put gamers off of it:

* The Gothic universe is not for everyone. Dinosaurs are running around your savage, medival land. Factions and politics are abundant. Everyone cops an attitude with you (even your allies). It's not your prancy, elf-laden world of high-fantasy. It's like the Land of the Lost, The Lord of the Rings, Mobsters and the Elder Scrolls got together and had an illegitimate love-child.

* There's obvious moral high/low ground, but it's up to you to decide how to go. Orcs hate humans (you're human), but you don't get auto-attacked in Orc towns. This may throw some folks for a loop when they first play, them pulling out a weapon to assault an Orc town without realizing you can just walk in and talk to folks instead. If you like to shoot first and ask questions later, Gothic may not be the series for you.

* The story just picks up where G2 left off. And I'm not talking vanilla G2, I'm talking the Night of the Raven (?) add-on / expansion. If you've never played G1 or G2, you're going to be lost. There's bits and pieces of back-story thrown at you, but you'll still be lost. Even reading an overview online will leave you lost. You can play it as a stand-alone game / story, but you'll get reminders here and there that you're missing a part of the back-story.

* Per Gothic's SOP, you start out as a wuss-bag, and slowly, desperately, try to claw your way up. Even with the patch's combat / AI balancing, combat is still a brutal affair. Every Gothic has been that way, so fair warning. However, G3 (pre-patch) was notorious for having low-level wolves gang-r@ping your high-level character with machine-gun-like lunge attacks en masse while a low-level character was able to use a polearm to easily dispatch high-level trolls. So... yes, the patch did balance combat ... a LOT. But, combat is still brutal. Upgrades to armor are majorly expensive. Upgrades to weapons come slowly. The skill progression system is a slow grind, having to spend points to raise skill levels just as points of entry to unlock actual skills you want. (EG: you have to spend skill points to learn an arbitrary level of alchemy skill to unlock your ability to learn to craft mana potions, or transformation potions, or permanant potions. Does a higher alchemy skill level help you? No. It just acts as a gate-keeper to unlock those skills. So, you'll feel like you wasted a lot of skill points raising skill levels that ultimately did nothing but act as gatekeepers.) You will have to very carefully pick-n-choose your combats, because you will get your rear handed to you over and over... even on easy mode!

* Load times still suck a big one ... I'm not kidding. One reason I gave up G3 back when was because the load times from a HDD took like a minute or two! And saving took time, too. This is the kind of game you want to quick-save and reload, because you will bork things up time and again. Getting punished with a 2 minute reload time EVERY time you did somethign stupid or found out some wuss-creature was able to own you was just torture. If you have an SSD, then they are manageable, but still expect to wait 10-20 seconds.

* Combat is still a tad glitchy post-patch. Making special note of this, because you will still find some animals that seem to lean back and magically avoid all of your attacks even though you see your stupid weapon going right through them. Then they lunge in and nail you. It's not as bad post-patch, but it still happens.

* Quests are banal sometimes ... you will get the usual ""go here, kill this, fetch this, deliver that"" junk. But, you grind those for xp and levels. The real merit of the game is when you get to decide how to overall play it. Will you side with the humans or the orcs? Is it time to liberate a town? If so, how? (Will you side with some rebels to take it over, or go in solo?) Each move you make impacts your rating with factions, so if you liberate enough towns your rating with the orcs will go down and they will attack you on site going forward. Or, you can go wipe out those nasty rebels for the orcs.

* Walking ... so ... much ... walking.  The game world is overly huge, and you'll get stuck aimlessly wandering about. It can be fun exploring, and they try to coax you into hitting the cities in a certain order. But, you can go and do whatever you want. They try to cordone off certain areas by putting harder monsters in your way, but you can run past them or jump up mountains to get around. You can go places you ""shouldn't"" early on as you please. You'll get your rear handed to you, but it can be fun. But, the game world is flipping huge, and trotting every where will waste hours of your time. Fortunately they put in teleporter stones you can carry to help you get from town to town faster, but you have to find the stone for each town. That can be tricky sometimes (especially when it's hidden in a place that's restricted until you win the town leader's favor). So, break out your walking shoes.


Overall...

Would I recommend G3? Yes, but only if you played G1 & G2 and liked them.

Would I recommend G3 without the Community Patch? No. Heck no. You have to go to a separate web-site to get the community patch, and once it's installed it's installed. And, if you already started a save game you'll need to restart the game (it invalidates pre-patch save games). So, install G3, install the Community Patch, then play the game. Don't even open or play G3 without the community path.",1418307219,1418307219,True,82,5,0.877643287181854248,2,True,False,False

PB delivered to us what anguished us all along. Nordmar, the northern land inhabited by rough warriors and blacksmiths, the legendary smiths that you read and hear about all along. Varant, the last place where Lee fought against the 2 Varantian warlords. Myrthana, your homeland, goverened by King Rhobar himself. The one, who convicted you to the Penal Colony.

And while the main storyline is not completely dull, what kills the most important aspect of the game is the faction system. No matter what you are, Orc Mercenary, Hashishin, Paladin, Druid..no one will greet you or remark about those things. Gothic 2 did it right and for that it will always be my favourite.

All of these factions, quests, places are laid out in a non-linear environment  waiting for you to explore it. Accompanied by majestic soundtracks. Make sure you install the last Community Patch from WorldofGothic.com and enjoy it to the fullest.

Pros:
-Beautiful world, lots to explore
-Everything is voice acted, but  very poorly compared to g1 & 2

cons:
-Very simple dull combat 
-Armor just docent look or make you feel badass compared to G1 & 2 
-Really buggy 
-Voice acting is shit (is gorn voice acted by a white guy?)
-The changed all the characters that got on the boat with you at the end of G2, the voice acting is no were near what they were and they changed the armor of them so much that if their name was not above their heads you could not tell it was them.
-Character models just look plain silly, some character's heads just look way to small for their body. 

This game would be playable an enjoyable if they combat was not so damn boring and simple. 
If you liked G1 & 2 you will probably be disappointed with this game.

The next 3 hours contained running away from giant trolls with large sticks and orcs that you can only see from 6 metres away because of the game's render distance system.

I ran into a giant city with a forcefield around it and killed myself accidentally because I didn't realize I couldn't enter the city at all.

In this game, the deer equivalent are packs of wolves roaming together in lofting green fields, and the wolf equivalent are small pigs that can kill you in groups of 3. The wolves jump through the fields gracefully, chewing on the grass happily with their kin. The pigs however, are meat eating, campfire starting, forest lurking beasts that are an unwreckable force when there are more than 5 or 6 of them in a group.

I played Gothic 3 the same time Oblivion was released. My motive for trying/buying it again was purely that it was on sale and decided to give it another crack (and that i had lost my previous CD). I thought i might choose another way to end the game (3 different yet similar endings). For those who seek a game of exploration and 'liberation' of cities without loading everytime you enter into a door, this could be the game for you (1 time game loading). 
The bad.
- Story is predictable with same generic quests
- Combat gets repetitive, left click the mouse and let the monsters just die
- Characters look like tomb raider 1
The good.
- HUGE WORLD with a lot places to go and explore... some being quests others just having some epic loot
- Day and night cycles, when NPC's go to sleep and move around
- Music is actually very good.

Well, for the year this game was made it has great graphics, i think the best graphics for that time, please don't forget it is made in 2006 and don't forget they were forced to relase the game sooner. It is an inimaginable game for that time and I strongly suggest you to play it.

In Gothic3 you can be whatever you want, you can fight for the Orcs or for the Humans, you can be from a full thief to a hero, from a strong warrior to a smart age, you can end it in different ways, it's all about you. You have all the freedom you want, but you explore it at your own risk. You have a lot of side quests and a great main quest line. It is more action-orientated than other Gothic games because you will fight with your own army (yes, your own army!) for saving cities from enemies, etc.

I suggest you to play it's predecessors to see how much the game evolved and because the storyline continues from the end of Gothic2. For all of those saying: ""I am a Gothic fan, but I don't like Gothic3!"" well, then you are not a Gothic fan, why could you say something like that? Same storyline, same characters, same awesome hero, it is not Arcania, it is Gothic3, it is really good and unlike Arcania they really keep the storyline.

About the Community Patch, yes, you need it for the game to run well, but if you can play a better game, why should you complain about the Community Patch? Don't forget that the game was forced to be released sooner

I know I have a low gameplay time, because I have a really weak laptop, but I still love the game because it is simply awesome! :D

I actually got the game on a CD first(saddly the CD broke and lost all my saves >.<), and I've clocked well over 60 hours on that. I don't know my exact time but i've seen and played a lot of this game. 

Much like the Gothic series, this games boasts a HUGE landscape to explore. Even if you look on the top world view(main map) That is about half the map as their is a whole other level to the game, the amount of caves and tunnel you have to explore is huge as well. The areas you have to explore are beautiful and some scenes you can just stand there watching it for awhile. The map is huge for a game that doesn't give your a great fast-travel system, but that is the fun of an open world game, them forcing you to explore.

This game, is unfinished though, even the developers came out saying that the people who put them up to it, rushed the game to be released long before it was ready. So you will find caves that are completely empty, pockets of pitch blackness even with a torch. Grass and trees that don't match the landscape. Even some areas that are just empty of anything. Anyone who has played through and explored the map has seen this, it does mark the game as not completed. Now, if they had completed the game, it might have been THE best game of that time, but, who knows, they never did.

Comabt wise, the game is very simplistic, it goes on a 'duel' system, so you'll rarely have 2 or more people gang up on you, so it is mostly 1v1, even if you are surrounded by an army. Your moves consist of the same thing and it's very easy to kill the enemies. Saying that though, any archers or magic users are not afraid to cast their spells at you, even when your already fighting someone, and spells in this game are VERY unforgiving, some even doing a 1 or 2 hit on you. What makes this game all the harder, is that there is no auto-save feature. So you will have to manually save. It's smart to save every time you enter and leave a town, this game will make you a spastic saver. Getting killed with a sword or axe though, is just as easy, as the computer gets the exact same attack patterns you do, and if your not careful, you can be quickly killed off. (Basicly, once they start a combo and you can't break it, your dead.). Archery works fantasic and forces you to aim and be accurate, shields actually do their job, I.E. stopping arrows from hurting you and magic... magic is a bitch sometimes. Overall, the combat is wonky and unforgiving sometimes, but workable.

The quests, although quite simple at times, range wide, towns usually consist in the same but you'll find that the game does follow the progress so, killing off an orc town, well, that means going into any other orc towns wont be easy. This game also has quest that spans the continants. For instance, one quest, for you to get a boat skimatic, which is roughly the middle of hte map, well, to get said skimatic you have to go to the south, into the varrent, a desert, well, sorry, the guy wants ice wolf pelts, and those, can only be found in the north in nordmar. The game makes you travel to this fantastic areas to grab something, it is truely amazing the amount of work was put into this game that wasn't even finish.

This game lacks polish, that is evident in the fact they got rushed to release it, I don't blame the dev's for that, you can only do so much in a certain amount of time and your not allowed to push over. If you can look past it's flaws the game is great, the story is lacking somewhat and isn't that straight forward, but, it makes you take your time and explore.  Overall, it is a good game for those who don't mind the lack of polish and the sometimes wonky gameplay. I've loved playing it and I think many others will too.

Quick tip to anyone wanting to get this. Focus on leveling up and getting lots of quests done before truely picking a side. You'll get twice the amount of quests.",1411986566,1411986566,True,17,0,0.611171543598175049,0,True,False,False

Gothic 1, while still rather clunky in its mechanics and controls, is still very enjoyable, thanks to the great world, characters and story. Gothic 2 took everything good from Gothic 1 and made it even better. Less clunky controls, smoothed out mechanics, bigger world, better story, more characters to like. It was pure Action RPG bliss. 
While Gothic 2 from a technical standpoint was just a more polished Gothic 1, Gothic 3 has nothing in common with it's prequels, technically speaking. And it just shits over everything that made the original 2 games so great. The World is bigger? Sure, but it's also got less stuff to do in. The graphics have more polygons and stuff? Sure, but it looks so goddamn ugly and somewhere between plastic and rubber. The story? What story? You move from town to town, decide if you root out the rebels or the orcs, goto next town, repeat. Same for the Desert, except the factions names are different. In Gothic 1 and 2, stuff happened, there was tension, there was drama. In Gothic 3, nothing happens. Sure you liberate some cities and stuff, but it doesn't really tell a story, you just grind through progression. 
The Combat in this game is one of the most hillariously broken messes I've ever seen. First of all, go full one handed melee in this. Archery or even magic is just not worth it. Which is ironic, considering how fucking overpowered enemy mages are. You'd think your level 20 hero would have no problem fighting a measly goblin mage. Fuck that noise, he deals an insane amount of damage. My only strategy left was to basically circle around him so that his fireballs miss me and hope I get close enough to pummel him into the ground before he incinerates me. And there was that one time I fought an Orc Shaman. He got stuck in a doorway and spammed fireballs at the nearby wall. So I just pulled out my bow and slowly chipped away his health from afar. As he was almost dead, he quickly pulled out a healing spell, fully healed himself and switched back to the fireball. That took him just a second. All my effort worthless.
It's unbalanced beyond believe. Wanna kill almost every humanoid in close quarters combat? Spam light attacks. Everytime you hit an enemy, they will flinch and then reset to normal combat stance, before they can strike. Flinching+striking takes more time than a light swing. You'll cut through anything with that. And as cool as poisoning your blade sounds, it's useless. In order to apply the poison to your enemies, you have to stab them by holding the attack button and pressing down. Normal strikes don't poison your enemy. But why would you do that, the stab takes way too long. Also dualwielding Swords is only usefull, because it allows you to attack with two swords at once with heavy swings, but not with light swings.

Overall: This game is shit. Be glad you don't have to play Version 1.0, that taught me to fear boars. They were able to bite faster than I could counter, so I was locked in an endless flinching frenzy, which only ended once I was dead.",1408813070,1408813070,False,28,3,0.569117844104766846,0,True,False,False

	The best feature of the game is the fact that you can do everything pretty much as you want, there is no real guidance through the quests and the main story line. Some people find this daunting, but when you get into it you realise it gives you a real opportunity to experience the game world.
	If you want to get to a specific area, the only thing that stops you is either the enemies are too dangerous or it's a stronghold and the faction that owns it doesn't know or trust you. To get through these blockades you have to either train, sneak, do favours, or find a loophole (i.e. getting into an area by doing a job for a farmer).

I sniped 4 of the 5 cows and angered the farmers. So, I ran away to free the slaves. Ended up running back to the farmers, followed by the slavers, and then to the city, where the fight alerted the orcs. So, I then had the orcs, the farmers and the slavers all chasing me, and the last cow had disappeared. 

Who could blame it?

So, I ran away into the woods, with the whole bunch following me, where they began fighting with the local wildlife. The woods were alive with the sounds of battle. Hiding, I stumbled across some grain thieves camped beside a cave filled with gigantic ants. The giant ants attacked everything, the grain theives attacked the orcs, the slavers and the orcs attacked the grain thieves, and in amongst it the wildlife had a go at whatever crossed its path.

I sneaked away but ran into a pack of wolves and led them back to the ongoing epic confrontation in the woods via a bridge, whcih they then fell off one by one into a gully below. Some grain thieves arrived and I led them back across the bridge. They too failed to negotiate the bridge and fell into the gully with the wolves.

I never did find the last cow.

I suspect it fell out of the world with the shock of it all.

It's the original Piranha Bytes and not Jowood's repurposed attached naming Arcania, nor their butchered works of Gothic 3 Forsaken Gods.

For that reason, I still use it for testing systems max volume decibel level on fans of gpus.

Gothic 3- A fantastic and underrated gem. A great RPG for anyone looking for freedom in just about every aspect of the game. A TRUE open world RPG, open character developement and free choice. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves RPGs with a more action oriented combat system and is willing to take the time to patch the game with the community patch and is looking to scratch that itch that comes with an open world RPG; endless hours of exploration, quest, crafting, character development, factions to join and fight, a world to shape the way you see fit, gaining new powers and seeing new sights. Gothic 3 is a very buggy game by itself admittedly but, for $10 and a loving community who is AWESOME and has worked out most of the bugs and revamped the game to be more balanced and run smoother, it is easily worth the time and effort and frustrations that may come with it..

There's nothing ""gothic"" about it, except that you're still playing as the nameless hero, and old friends make small cameos. The combat is clunky, the animations suck, it lags alot (even if your computer is amazing). The story is non-existent; you start off looking for Lester, which is fine with me, if I actually found him within the first 2 hours of gameplay. The story revolves around nothing: either liberating cities from orcs, or destroying rebel camps. Same thing happens in the desert region: liberating cities from the hassashin, or destroying the nomads. The only part with an actual story is when you venture into the cold mountains of Nordmar. And for an ending, there is no epic bossfight, or talk with the main characters. You get 3 ""mass effect 3"" endings, depending on what god you choose to follow. 

The most offensive part, to me, was the interaction between the hero and Xardas. As someone who grew up with the Gothic Series, Xardas is one of the most interesting characters I have ever seen. He walks a blurred line between anti-hero and villain, by using the nameless hero for his own nefarious purposes. I won't spoil what exactly he does, but his role in Gothic 3 is awful. There is a 6 hour goose-chase through the myrtanian continent to find Xardas, and when you finally find him, all he does is give the hero some pointless information. This happens to every character, with a few exceptions. Diego, the master thief and cunning rogue, turned into a laughable traveling mercinary. Gorn, the ruthless warrior, is captured by orcs. ORCS! Lester becomes a slave for the orcs in varant. Milten is the only one who retains his prior credability. This is unacceptable. These are the characters who made the first and second Gothic feel immersive and memorable, and they have been reduced to nothing more than laughable shadows of their pasts. 

The game only becomes playable with the Enhanced Edition Community Patch, which you can download for free. This patch adds performance tweaks, and a much needed price overhaul.

In conclusion, fuck this game. If you played the 1st and 2nd gothic, then give this one a shot just for the continuation of the story. But if you didn't...

Gothic 3 is one of my favorite games.  Though the initial release was quite buggy, the community patch available these days turns it into a very playable game.  This review will assume you are playing with the patch installed, as described in my instructions here:

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=155304006]Gothic 3 Optimization Steps[/url]

Gothic 3 is a classic open world first/third person RPG like Elder Scrolls, so there are many similarities between them.  In a way it is a mix of many of the good parts of both Morrowind and Oblivion, though there are also some general differences from Elder Scrolls that should be covered first.

There is no character creation: you will play as the male human nameless hero, period.

There is no respawning of creatures or flora; once you clear an area, it will remain clear.

There are basically no books of lore or other reading material for people who like to spend hours reading about the history and culture of the world.  That said, I think the Gothic 3 world often has more detail than what is found in Elder Scrolls games and does a good job using those details to flesh it out.  Every detail of the world often feels carefully hand-placed, such as this screenshot of the entrance to Montera, with individual stones spread around from the broken walls after war with the Orcs:

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=94141644]Ruins of Montera[/url]

Gothic 3's world is also completely seamless: there is no loading between areas, not going into houses, into caves, between the different major regions, never.  This has a huge positive impact on the overall experience, since it really feels like a completely open world, and in practice you can take advantage of this with tricks to get to places you aren't yet ready to go.  You will often find yourself in this kind of situation, looking on an open city thinking about the ways you can go about exploring and exploiting it:

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=94973771]Looking down on Bakaresh[/url]

Gothic 3 is more ""gamey"" than Elder Scrolls games.  The Elder Scrolls games try for a certain sense of realism, as a way I think to try to make them more ""immersive.""  Gothic 3 in contrast tends to wear being a game on its sleeve: character progression is very numeric with learning points you use to raise stats and gain skills along with gold needed to pay to do so; tactics you use for success in the world are often based on playing it as a game (rather than what is ""realistic"").  Even the main character's voice acting often makes me feel like he is self-aware of being in a game and giving another sarcastic comment about another freaking fetch quest.

If immersive realism is something you find really important, that isn't Gothic 3's style.  However, its gamey-ness has benefits: not being realistic allows the art design to be much more interesting (I often say I feel like I am wandering around a beautiful painting), allows it to have a more exaggerated scale compared to how Elder Scrolls games try hard to hide their gamey world scale, and it can just be fun to figure out all kinds of tricks and ideas to take advantage of Gothic 3's more visible game systems.

Maybe Gothic 3's world isn't as immersive, but in many ways I find it more interesting and engrossing.

Those differences asside, there are many more similarities between Gothic 3 and Morrowind/Oblivion.

In many ways, Gothic 3 sits somewhere between Morrowind and Oblivion in experience.  It came out soon after Oblivion, and has many of the improvements that one would expect from that generation of games, yet still has many of aspects of Morrowind that were lost in Oblivion.  That isn't to say that it the best of both games, but it has a nice combination that may appeal to people who loved Morrowind but found Oblivion lacking.

Gothic 3's graphics are in the same class as Oblivion.  It has a lush, dynamic world (with moving grass and trees), dynamic shadows and lighting, fairly high resolution textures, and is comparably rich, detailed, and complex.

The world is a more traditional fantasy environment compared to Morrowind's interesting alien world, but doesn't suffer from the blandness of Oblivion.  It has three unique environments: the central lush wilderness region, southern desert, and northern snowy area; the world also feels much more hand-crafted, with little details everywhere you look and very little repetition.

All of the dialog in Gothic 3 is spoken -- both NPCs and your own character.  This results in quests and dialog being along the lines of Oblivion: more simplistic than Morrowind.  However the world is huge, with a lot going on, and is much more connected together than in Oblivion, adding more complexity that way.  Even most of the side quests (including simple fetch quests) are fairly connected to the larger picture, since they will impact the feelings of the factions towards you and how you can further interact with them and decide how the game will progress.

The music in Gothic 3 is fantastic.  The sheer quantity of it is at the level of Oblivion if not more, but it is not in the background and bland.  The quality is much more like Morrowind: strong melodic pieces that will transport you back to the world when you hear them again.  It is also much more connected to the world, with very distinctive themes for the three different regions and even sub-regions of those.  The first time you walk over a desert hill to view some ruinfields stretching out away from you, with their theme playing along, is not something you will forget.

Gothic 3's world has a lot of verticallity, much like Morrowing and something I found lacking in Oblivion.  It doesn't go so far as to have a levitation spell, but the world itself is filled with interesting use of height which you can use to your advantage or can get in your way.  You will often find yourself looking up at something and trying to figure out how you can get up to it.  For example, this huge hill in the distance that begs you to figure out how to get up there to check it out:

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=94142227]New goal in life: get up there[/url]

Or this view after trekking up a high mountain pass down on to the open castle and city below:

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=94944893]Looking down on Faring[/url]

In these games I tend to prefer bows over swords, and for that I find Gothic 3's combat to be far better than Morrowind and a bit lesser than Oblivion.  It doesn't have the physical presence that Oblivion was able to create, such as the satisfaction of sneak attacks with bows and physicality of swords and shields, but does have fairly fun interactions for aiming and shooting bows, blocking with shields, etc.  Sword and shield play is maybe a bit more tactically interesting than Oblivion, since there are different moves you can make and you need to watch the moves of humanoid characters to determine when they are going to make themselves vulnerable.  Fighting creatures I find to be much less satisfying, with them easily getting past your defense; in fact I seem to often find myself looking for high ground I can take to shoot arrows or bolts at them while they can't reach me, much like using a levitation spell to the same effect in Morrowind.  (I have also not been above leading some creatures back to a city for the guards there to help me take them out.)

Finally, there are basically no physics in Gothic 3, which is a negative compared to Oblivion...  but then again compared to how little of interest Oblivion did with physics, maybe not.  Characters do have rag dolls when you kill them and the equipment in their hand will go flying.",1344920109,1385943608,True,12,0,0.643303930759429932,3,True,False,False
