It was a profoundly real moment amids the wackyness and chaos.

On a serious note: Though I love the mindless fun, friend who join seem to time out after a while, and going back to title screen to re invite my screen goes black and I have to force close and restart completely. No idea what could be the issue, or if it differs for others and with split screens, settings or IP adresses etc. I hope they look into some of the tech issues. The game works okay single player (you can always respawn if stuck or bugged utterly), but of course it is even more fun to share w friends.

Also, have to say, so much of the NPC dialouge is soo incredibly Swedish: ""I have no strong feelings whatsoever"", ""I have severe anger issues and you're not helping"", ""I'm sorry I just zoned out, what were you saying?"", ""I wish I was happy, because then I woulndn't be sad""...",1708376055,1708910080,True,7,0,0.576017796993255615,0,True,False,False

I thought the continual telling us to do something with the voices' ass was too much.  Sort of distatsteful.  Typical of Europeans who have a weird sense of humor and can't speak English very well.

I lost my previous edit, but I had a lot of things to say about the old goat sim.  I think the lack of a map was actually a plus for that game.  I also enjoyed the large number score that flashed on the screen.  We liked the goat that could fly with the halo, and the other animals in payday.  This goat sim is a good new one, but there are some things that are just lame like items on the ground that do nothing.  Also there is not enough dynamite to explode everywhere and other things that explode.  Chemical tanks, fireworks.  Haven't seen it all yet.  Definitely a great game.  WOULD RECOMMEND TO BUY IT.

Below are the things I hope the game can improve:
- The map is much bigger, however it still has only two theme: the rural and the modern urban. Basically, it's just a bigger Goatville and Goat City Bay from 1. I hope there will be more DLC with totally different setting like the MMO and Space. 
- There are only about, like, 10 dialogues for all the NPCs, except the Farmer. I know it's part of the joke, and NPCs aren't much important, but hearing the same dialogue again and again throughout the entire game makes me feel so boring. It will be better if outside of the general dialogues, we have some different NPCs' dialogues for each area of the map. 
- A lot of collectibles require climbing high and/or flying to get. It makes more challenge, yes, but it's overused and sometimes frustrated to get. I don't mind doing a long quest, or finding in a hidden, surprised area for the collectibles. But put them just very high and require multi times jumping/ flying is meh.",1708230293,1708230293,True,1,0,0.499044895172119141,0,True,False,False

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside her. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Daughter for help and she hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Daughter since my hamster had died.
