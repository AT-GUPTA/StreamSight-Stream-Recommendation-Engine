I've suffered through Planescape: Torment for the story, Pillars of Eternity was quite painful but had some good QoL features. After finishing BG3, I finally found the motivation to try the originals. 130 hours later I've finally beaten them, and that's on Easy difficulty and running the game at a higher speed because the game's original speed is bafflingly slow. Was it worth it? Not really.

These games are 25 years old and it shows. The interface is fucking terrible. You'll have no idea how long it will take to cast a spell. There are roughly 100 stats effects, and you get limited spell casts to dispel them. The spells have miniscule icons that are difficult to tell apart, and the toolbar only displays a small number of them at a time. No terms are explained, you'll be Googling plenty. It must be so much fun for those who've bothered to memorize the 150-page manual. So hardcore!

The pathfinding is infuriating. You'd think moving 6 characters from one location to another is straightforward, but half of your party will start running in the opposite direction if you're anywhere near a door. If you try to rotate your formation by 180 degrees while staying still, your characters will run into each other, getting stuck.

There are still, somehow, massive bugs 25 years after release. The game has an ENHANCED EDITION where I'm spending hours searching for console commands to fix broken quests.

BG1 did little noteworthy, BG2 was a significant upgrade in the quality of the writing, but late on the difficulty comes from irritating status effect spamming monsters. Who finds pre-buffing 6 characters with multiple protections fun? It doesn't matter how powerful your party gets, a single buff from an enemy makes it completely immune to damage, have fun digging your bags for the correct dispelling effect.

If you desperately want to play a RTwP game, play Tyranny, it's the only RTwP I've played that had tolerable combat. If you want to play older RPGs, try Fallout 1&2 instead. They have terrible interfaces too, but at least you don't need to learn what Negative Plane Protection is.

If you're considering playing BG1&2 just because you enjoyed BG3, do not bother. You do not owe it to anyone. Play Divinity: Original Sin 2 or Underrail or Disco Elysium instead. The original Baldur Gates waste way too much of your time.",1708553637,1708553637,False,7,0,0.520467817783355713,4,True,False,False

It’s jam-packed with annoying enemies and status effects that result in death on any but the easiest difficulty. Such as level drain and petrification in places you never expect them. Not to mention, tons of hard-to-counter effects such as group-wide confusion.

In short, it’s a pain to play this game, especially when you’re up against mind flayers and the like. As such, I’ve never had a good time trying to make it through to the end. Even so, I keep coming back because I want to experience the story at least once, but I can’t do it. Without fun, there’s nothing to keep you playing long-term.

Lazy publisher that profits off of other modders efforts and doesn't take the time to actually care about anything they add content wise. For example, the audio for new characters in BG1ee sounds fine, but BG2ee? Sounds like they have frogs in their throats. The new characters for their custom expansion in BG1? Don't expect to see them in BG2. Any new expansions or content that is actually from Beamdog and not the OG or from modders is pretty meh at best. They got lucky buying a license and are now cashing in with a quick buck, hoping you'll spend $19.99 to see where BG3 came from or embrace some nostalgia from years gone by.

In fact anything that involves writing from Beamdog is pretty cringe. The few moments where it shined doesn't matter...it won't follow to later games. Other titles like Icewind Dale 1 were just lazy as well. Hell, they didn't have the motivation to even touch Icewind Dale 2...claimed it would be impossible due to lack of source code. Years later the modding community Beamdog loves to steal from got the job done and got it done right. If you must revisit this amazing game, I don't blame you for opening your wallet. But I recommend no more than half since Beamdog wants to halfass it. I wouldn't recommend it for more than $10.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happineass of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

So....**Shadows of Amn** is the base game. The story is a classic. While it is comical that all your companions not captured by *Jon Irenicus* somehow had business in *Athkatla*, it is pretty convenient since that is where you are being held prisoner to begin the game lol. Beyond that though, this story is an amazing continuation of the Bhaalspawn campaign.

You can also really see *Beamdog's* hand in this updated version. The UI is cleaner, loading screens are gone, some new quests are added, some NPCs are rewritten a bit to make more sense, camera zoom, enhanced graphics, a lot of bug patches (there are still a couple quest bugs, but not nearly as many), and continued addition of a few new series characters. Plus a new expansion of course.

*Shadows of Amn* took me about 70 hours to complete being fairly thorough AND doing *Watcher's Keep*, but I would think that if you're less familiar with the game and the **2nd Edition AD&D ruleset**, you could probably add another twenty-ish hours to this (or more).

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3027153968

------‐----------------

**Throne of Bhaal** is the conclusion to the *Bhaalspawn* story, and it's quite the epic conclusion. You do not want to skip this if you played *Shadows of Amn*. It took about seventeen hours for me to complete, but again, I'm very familiar with this expansion.

------------------------

**The Black Pits II** is a continuation of Beamdog's **The Black Pits** from the *Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition**, but standalone from the BG campaign. It takes place in **Thay** and actually has some legitimate side quests and story to go along with the arena battler. The first entry explored this a little, but this second entry really added depth to the arena. Still, at their core, *The Black Pits I and II* are there to teach you the AD&D ruleset, and if you're unfamiliar with these rules, you should play these expansions before diving into the base campaign. For me, it took roughly four hours to play through this with the story additions.

As far as Steam Deck compatibility is concerned, it functions the same as BG1. You will want to switch out of the recommended controller layout in favor of a community layout or your own custom settings. I personally found ""Baldur's Gate EE with character swap"" to be perfect for Steam Deck play.

I did also try out the *Legacy of Bhaal* difficulty setting for about seven hours before starting my main playthrough. Definitely doable, but you really need to be familiar with both the game and the ruleset to play this way IMO.

Anyway, this entire *Enhanced Edition* was fantastic and a definite must play. With different party and character builds, you could easily log in hundreds and hundreds of hours of gameplay. Cost vs value is some of the best in gaming.

Here's an outline of my experience to hopefully help new starters, or people still confused about getting into the admittedly extremely strange mechanical elements of this game. Full disclosure, I have not yet finished Throne of Bhaal (I think I'm about halfway through it), so this review only encompasses the main game.

First and foremost, do not play the game on any difficulty higher than Normal if you've never played ADnD before. Easy or Story mode are the ideal play styles for new players if you want my opinion, though story mode's combat leans a little on the boring side because it basically automates all but the most intense encounters. Think of choosing modes as negotiating with a DM, if you were a DM you would probably do your best to shelter new players from the game's most dangerous elements, at least to start with. It's no different here, and there's no shame in giving yourself that bit of control. Choosing a difficulty that suits you is especially important in this game, even more so than the first one, because the monsters you encounter here are much more varied and all of them have specific hard counters the player is expected to just know from having played ADnD in the past and therefore having engaged pretty intensely with its ruleset prior to playing. Don't give yourself the headache of trying to learn all their weaknesses and various hyper specific strategies on a first playthrough, that difficulty slider is there to make things comfortable and manageable, use it at your leisure.

The second point to make is about the story, which is incredibly enjoyable but requires a certain mindset that I think modern games tend not to exercise that much. Baldur's Gate 2 works on classic DnD systems of Gods and moral alignment. Modern games, especially modern fantasy CRPGs like Tyranny, Pillars of Eternity, and even Baldur's Gate 3 are a bit more skeptical of Godly powers and concepts like 'Good aligned' and 'Bad Aligned' and all things in between. Baldur's Gate 2 takes these concepts at face value, it is generally accepted that some people are good, some people are bad, and Gods are real and their whims should be respected, even if you don't necessarily like them. The straightforwardness with which these concepts are tackled can feel strange, but they are absolutely solid mediums for storytelling if you let yourself take them at their word, and Baldur's Gate 2 wields them with grace and creativity to create conflicted heroes and delightful villains (all my compliments to the writing and performance of the character Jon Irenicus by the way, the sadly departed David Warner's contributions as a voice actor really help to make him shine as a villain). That aside the style and format of this game will feel extremely familiar to anyone who has played a Bioware RPG, this game feels like an interesting first attempt at that style of storytelling and it absolutely works here. I don't think it will feel as strange and quiet as the first game's somewhat ambient, low stakes story was, so if you didn't like that about the first one I would say don't brush this game off completely just yet.

Final point, and it is a small one, but I feel a mighty need to talk about it, I tend to play as a woman in these kinds of games to match my own gender, and let me tell you the romance options for women in this are slight. If you are sticking to non-enhanced edition story content, like I was broadly trying to do, then the only option you get is Anomen which, like, come on. Not to be rude to the poor guy, but I removed him from my party basically the moment he started talking, couldn't stand the man. Normally when I play games with romance options I tend to feel like I am missing out in a sense if I skip them, but I took one look at my options here and just shook my head. I felt nothing for any of them. Male player characters seem to fair a little better in the romance department, and the folks at Beamdog did add a few extra options as part of the enhanced edition, but it is still pretty sparse and the characters available to you are broadly the least interesting of the cast. Wake me up when I can marry Yoshimo, not to spoil too much but that would at least end interestingly.

So, broad summary; like the first game, Baldur's Gate 2 is filled with esoteric mechanical elements and somewhat unfamiliar narrative beats when compared to modern sensibilities, although it's story is much more active than its predecessor. If you can let yourself be swept up in it however, then there is nothing so classically fantasy as this. It's got all the stops, lively companions, shocking twists, grand environments, unique villains, the works. I only wish the friends it offered me were more kissable, but that's a minor problem. As with a lot of old games you just have to cross the prerequisite mental hurdles to engage with it properly, but I'm sure you can do it!

This is an incredibly good CRPG, and widely considered a masterpiece for good reasons. I don't recommend jumping in here without first playing Baldur's Gate I, as this is a direct sequel whose story is fairly dependent on familiarity with that game's. You can (and should) import your save from BG:EE. I even recommend playing the Beamdog expansion Siege of Dragonspear first, though that is less necessary and somewhat less universally loved by fans of the series. If you tried and didn't care for BG1, then this title isn't going to change your mind.

Like the first game, BG2 uses the archaic D&D 2nd Ed. rules in real-time with pause combat, and doesn't take the time to explain those systems. This has the unfortunate result of leading to a sink-or-swim outcome; there's not much feedback for WHY your spells aren't affecting targets in cases where you're up against creatures with magical protection. Even as someone who played 2E back in ye olden dayes, I still found it helpful to read forums discussing the finer points of magic when fighting dragons and liches. Since you are much higher level in this game than in the first, high level magic combat is especially prevalent, and can definitely be confusing at first. It would have really helped this game's longevity to add an optional primer for such fights to the Enhanced Edition, and a in-game bestiary would definitely have been an easy improvement.

Nevertheless, if you can get yourself comfortable you're in for a thrilling high fantasy journey. The writing is top-notch even in most optional quests, and the companions are definitely a step up from the first outing. While there are fewer options than in the original, nearly every potential party member has a quest that further fleshes them out as a character and gives you a feel for the world of the Forgotten Realms. There are even romance options, though I personally didn't pursue them as I was too busy saving the Sword Coast.

There is much less undirected exploration in this game than in the previous one, for better and worse. While some people really loved the map of the first game, I felt like it led to far too much time spent combing through empty wilderness maps. Yes, there were small side quests sprinkled in, but a lot of those maps felt like filler to me. BG2 doesn't let you wander in the wild, instead only unlocking specific areas of interest after you have real reasons to seek them out. This is primarily done by talking with NPCs throughout the sprawling city of Athkatla, where you find yourself after the opening chapter of the game. It felt more curated and special knowing why I was exploring an area rather than just hoping to run into adventure accidentally, and the vast city that serves as the game's hub still provides plenty of opportunity for exploration and roleplay.

Included in the Enhanced Edition is the official expansion Throne of Bhaal, which brings your player character's arc to a satisfying conclusion. As much as I loved BG2, ToB is perhaps even better, letting you reach truly legendary levels and face commensurate threats. You'll want to play it anyway upon reaching BG2's conclusion, but if for any reason you're on the fence I can only say that it is indispensable.

There is also a Beamdog original mini-expansion set around a gladiatorial arena, The Black Pits II. The less said of this, the better. It forsakes the rules entirely in places, and I found it frustrating to the point where I didn't bother completing it. Where the first Black Pits (in BG:EE) was okay, and served as a succinct setting to try out different party comps, this one was just... not great. Too sprawling, unfair, and unfun.

Finally, achievements. I liked this game enough to hunt down all the achievements, but I personally wouldn't recommend it. The Legacy of Bhaal difficulty setting (extra-hard mode that you must beat for an achievement) is just a slog, with EVERY enemy you face having stupidly high magic resistance, insane buffs to armor class, and more than triple HP. From what I've read, if you really want to make the game more difficult there are mods that do this SO much better by tweaking enemy AI in ways that bring it more in line with the rules of the game. Also, some other achievements require a lot of mindless speed-running through chapter 1 over and over with different classes in order to unlock different bases. It wasn't fun, and you just wind up doing the same quests that you can do on any character, only with slightly different outcomes. The class-specific strongholds themselves are really cool, each with their own unique quests and opportunities to further develop your character. Having to get them ALL for achievements was less than thrilling.

Despite ending this review on the lackluster points, overall this game is easily worth picking up if you're a fan of other real-time with pause CRPGs, like Pillars of Eternity. You'll be hard-pressed to find a better example of what this game is doing, and it is almost always firing on all cylinders.",1703990096,1703990096,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Similar to BG3:

- Rich storytelling. I'd say it's even better than BG3 as it is a bit more personal on some levels, and also because there weren't many games like that before this one came out. There are great twists throughout. Your journey will make you travel across many different lands.

- Deep, complex companion characters with different opinions, motives and backgrounds. Sometimes the good answer isn't the good answer. Sometimes you may argue with your companions, you may have to shake them up a bit at times, maybe sometimes you may have to lie to them or be blunt and honest a few days later, sometimes you may have to be more gentle and understanding and sometimes not. Pay attention to their personalities and adapt your answers accordingly. You may have to deal with party conflicts or else they may harm each other!

- Fantastic romances with many layers. Some have a shell you need to crack open. Some hide their true nature for a long time before they trust you enough. This is the game that truly introduced the concept romances in RPG video games and it became a benchmark for the Dragon Age and Mass Effect franchises. Unfortunately the number of characters you can romance is small, especially for females ( there's only one guy you can romance ). However, there are mods that can remedy that of course!

- The DnD universe is the same, albeit slightly different since some character appearances and attributes may have changed over time. There are some races and classes that are missing, of course, because they hadn't been invented back then! But there is enough diversity within the game for you to forget about that.

- Challenging and fun dungeons and encounters. Great bosses. Classic dungeons and more ethereal ones are waiting for you.

- Breathtaking sceneries. Arguably, the game has aged, but visually it's a game that's very difficult to forget for those who are fans of isometric RPGs. There are many areas that have you stop and just look at them for a while and you admire the time spent to create them - both lore-wise and game development-wise. You will visit beaches, ruins, the underdark, mindflayer, dragon and beholder lairs and many more visually stimulating areas.

- Engaging and atmospheric music. BG2, just like BG3, has some of the catchiest battle music ever made. The music in this game is very visual - it accompanies the areas you visit really well. Some are more cinematic than others, depending on the setting.

- Top tier antagonists, I'd say iconic even for the DnD franchise. Irenicus is literally your party's Magneto and make BG1's Sarevok so unidimensional and simple in comparison. There are many other great evil characters for you to clash with. Dragon battles are super exciting and epic, clearly a high point in anyone's campaign when they are encountered. BG2 will unleash some of the most powerful foes the DnD universe has to offer.

- Choices matter. If you make a decision, it will have an impact on the area and may have an impact on your companions or even in the main quest. You can be good, neutral or evil when making decisions.

Not similar to BG3:

- Combat. Combat uses older DnD rules. Some aspects may feel familiar, other aspects may be totally alien to you. However, if you have moderate knowledge of the 5th edition, you are halfway there. Not gonna lie, learning how DnD works with this game with no prior knowledge of DnD is going to be difficult. It's not really turn-based although you can make it somewhat like that through settings and in the background the games does roll dice everytime you make actions. It's more chaotic, but in a good way I believe, and when it gets too chaotic you hit the pause button and reorganize your strategy. It's a lot of pause-and-play, but it gives you more control on the fight and also makes its pace faster than in BG3. You'll get used to it.

- Interactions. There are less things you can pick up, no candles to light, no crates you can destroy or move. However there are containers, secret areas and secret treasures, traps - including traps you can set yourself - and a few other things.

- No camp. In this game, if you want a party member to take some time away from your group, they will go to a given location. You will have to go and find them there if you want them back. Do not let them alone in the underdark or some other perilous area because you may never see them again! However, you will get a camp-like area in Throne of Bhaal, so there's that.

Overall this game is a cornerstone in the fantasy RPG genre. I highly recommend it, even if you haven't played the first Baldur's Gate - there is enough of it told to you for you to pick up right from the second installment and understand the entire story without playing the first game, and BG2 is by far the better of the two games.",1703903083,1703903083,True,165,1,0.932927131652832031,0,True,False,False

Not only does it expect the player to practically have a manual just to understand how it's basic system works, the moment one manages to bumble their way out of the wizards dungeon, they have one of their party members taken away from them and are told 'welp, you figure it out now'.
Left in a massive city with little indication on where to go next might be something neat if it was a table top game being lovingly orchestrated by a dungeon master who has a plan in mind, but this is a video game where the same feeling doesn't apply. You don't even have other players to bandy about ideas with, so it feels about as sad as trying to play on your own by rolling four more dice than your own.

It was about there that I decided that I ultimately didn't have the interest to keep playing. And looking at the percentage of people who didn't even make it out of the wizard's dungeon (only about 30% of people did make it out) according to the most gotten achievement, it seems I wasn't the only one to think so.
Basing this on whether I would rather play a ttrpg or this, I'd ultimately pick the former time and time again.

The second game builds up on the quality established by the first with a highly interactive roleplaying environment with hilarious dialogue choices, absolute psycho moments and those moments of clarity where you stay sane and noble when surrounded by the madness of Faerun.
The companions are the strong point of this game, they all have their own stories and interests to solve while adventuring with you, some can be lovers and others will be your greatest allies, few video game companions can compare to Minsc or Boo or Jaheira for example.

The side quests put most games to shame, I spent at least half of my playtime working on side quests from the first few chapters where you can freely explore the map at your leisure, and even when you are put on rails there are still some side quests sprinkled in there to further add to the absolute unit of content that's in this game. Whether you are fighting cults of blind people or exposing Amnian psycho or just helping forest spirits escape slavery, there is a multitude of stories to hear from people who are desperate for your help and it is just an experience you must see for yourself to truly understand.

Even the class you choose to play has its own myriad of roleplaying to it, some side quests are unavailable entirely to some, while others get unique dialogue from people you otherwise wouldn't hear, some items you are not even allowed to equip so it is wise to keep a diverse team that can cover everything since you alone can't perform all tasks. Not only do you have the basic classes like mage or fighter or thief but you can further add to the roleplaying element by picking a kit to specialise in a specific part of that class, whether you are into necromancy or living your martial artist fantasy.

The main story is a beast too, I laughed and felt sadness and genuine shock at events that unravel both in the main game and the Throne of Bhaal expansion, it just keeps a tight grip on you and you feel compelled to see the story through so you can get a sense of closure on your adventures throughout the sword coast. The new black pits sequel in the expanded edition is built upon and way more fun compared to the original, same basic ideas but with more characters and moments of hilarity and shock that make it feel more real instead of an on the rails wave challenge.
One other noteworthy part of this game is how alive the world feels, the ambient noise ranges from people shouting and having fun to beautiful temple bells ringing, amazing how an old game feels so authentic.

What can I say? BGI was buggy and not terribly great. I played the entire main quest and looked around for more, but the story wasn't my favorite and I don't really care for Final Fantasy-like random combat games. 

BGII? Definitely in the same vein, but ooh so much better! The story here and adventure paths are considerably more interesting. And the combats progress the story more often than not, rather than simply being hostile minions. The scope is enormous, far bigger than BGI, and I can remember now that I've been through the initial dungeon breakout and some of the starting city, this - this is the game my friends raved about. 

BG I & II recreate Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition in videogame form. No, it's not a perfect recreation. There is a great deal more sleeping in dungeons to heal. And, so far, not as much NPC interaction. But what is here is smart, and cutting edge of for the time. 

== SPOILERS == 
The initial dungeon is old school with plenty of tricky trap and puzzle rooms along side the baseline combats. The monster selection is all new for the time, but still has the sensibility to throw some goblins and common creatures in the mix. The dungeon environment is unique, yes linear, it is a bit like Half-Life in that vein, but this is just the start ""how to"" for BGII. From there on I find Baldur's Gate games are nicely ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" in style - and SO MANY adventures - while they can be a bit questy (at least BG I was). 

-- Summary --
Like the original, BGII has a lot of narrative elements and many, many secrets you will learn simply by following the main quest. An epic of a tale, it comes highly recommended for anyone who is a fan of old school Dungeons & Dragons.

The game is designed to be a ""yellow brick road"" adventure with very little ability to deviate away from the path in which the developers have designed for the player to follow. For example, the story will hang or leave you at an impasse if you spot the ruse early, and attack the villain before they get to tell you their master plan.  Lots of back saving at different stages in your game is always a good idea to fix this without starting over again.  It's nice to see the developers tried to implement AD&D (2nd edition) here, but I feel it fell short by only using the THACO system for the most part. This THACO system just gets ""flipped"" or ""reworked"" some may say with no AC cap in 3rd edition D&D anyway.  I don't understand why they used the THACO system here at all.  It would have been better to see a complete package of only 2nd edition AD&D or 3rd edition D&D. After many hours playing, I found the developers integrated a lot of 3rd edition D&D ideas, especially seen through the character class choices made available for the player. (e.g. the Black guard - not introduced as a playable class until 3rd edition D&D).  

For players who might find some of the NPC's irritating or unnecessary in your character party. The character party creation option I found in this game to be quite useful. NOTE: It can only be used during the setup of a new game! The first character added to this party becomes your main character, and every other character you have made and add to the party thereafter becomes support. It is very easy to drop any of these ""support characters"" in different places throughout your game, and pick back up at a later time if you remember where you leave them. I did find a lot of the NPC's provided within the game, with quest lines attached to them worth doing though. So you may want to pick and choose which of these NPC's you want to add to your party at different times, if not at the beginning. Be mindful of NPC's though with ""time sensitive quests"". You will lose the opportunity if your not careful. 

I found this game complete, fun to play, especially at the discounted price you can find it at now. It does not hold the same level of value though (imo) as a real D&D game can with a good group of friends. The real RPG will always be better.",1698963548,1701141590,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Using the same engine as the original Baldur's Gate, this adventure compromises that groundbreaking game's openness in favour of more in-depth interactions and detail in conversations and atmosphere, and in my opinion is the better for it. Anyone interested in deep adventure gaming, D&D or CRPGs should have this in their collection.

Despite its intricate detail, it works great as a ""background"" game while doing something else, e.g. watching TV, having a nifty drink or doing real work. One of my favourites and still brilliant in 2023.",1606559192,1700598926,True,2,0,0.507808804512023926,0,True,False,False

One of the original loading screen tips even said ""while your character doesn't need to eat, remember that you do"".

You can feel empathy or antipathy for each one of the characters, their pasts and their personalities, and this can actually be one of the determining factors for who you're going to let into or to kick out of your party. Even common people may have interesting things to say, or just something to make you laugh. Quests may be only waiting for you to talk to someone in a corner.

The locations, though particularly small by today's standards, are many, well designed and diverse, which gives a real sense of travel, exploration and adventure. The game also features a nice day/night cycle, and not only the sceneries change, but some monsters, animals and NPCs may appear only at night or during daytime, as well as some quests. Oh, and party members get sleepy, so be sure to find an inn or another safe place to spend the night sometimes.

All these things, in conjunction with the game's substantial lore, help build up an incredibly immersive atmosphere. Have no doubt that a lot of characters and places will stay in your memory forever.

On top of that, from the menus to the spell effects, every corner of Baldur's Gate II has impeccable art (besides those awful character miniatures in your inventory xD), as far as the Infinity Engine goes. In my opinion, to this day, the environments are very beautiful and pleasing (this statement MAY be nostalgia-driven, but reviews are kind of personal, so... :P). Also, an extremely nice and beautiful feature is the fact that every item has its own hand drawn sketch scroll to go along with its written description.

Dialogues go from the trivial ""g'day!"" to the most philosophical questions about who you are in the story and what you'll do with your life and with the ones around you. The voice acting is impressive! Besides, you have the liberty to answer a ""good day"" with a sword in the throat, as well as a ""will you save their lives?"" with a heroic action. The answer alternatives are really well thought and have true impact on the quests – it's not an illusional free choice, as we see in other RPGs. This allows you to fully and faithfully roleplay your character all the way, by the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition's rules.

The freedom you possess to determine your party's reputation is absolutely amazing too. Your doings may have good or bad consequences not only to the story and to the world (for example, people in towns will react differently to your presence, depending on your reputation), but to the integrity of the party itself, as all members will have their own points of view about your actions. Yes, you can end up losing party members because they don't agree with what you're doing or with the time you're taking to do something, or simply because they don't get along well with each other.

The combat system is ""real-time with pause"", and the variety of actions you can take is almost infinite, from a myriad of spells (coming from your character, scrolls or magical items) to a brutal two-handed sword reckless attack – or maybe by sneaking through and simply avoiding the situation. This allows you to approach the same battle in many different ways, creating your own unique strategies, which means that, even if a player can't handle a certain combat at a certain time in the game, another player could end up sorting it out, making the combat skill-rewarding, intelligent and exciting.

You can follow the main storyline straight to the end or you can take your time to do side quests (lots of them). And, by the way, it's not uncommon to find yourself bumping into ultra powerful enemies when you're just not even a little bit prepared for the fight. You have to really work your way to strengthen your party before being ready for some of these quests. And the harder ones are trully rewarding. So, if you face and kill a dragon, for example, know that (besides feeling like a boss) the loot will be fantastic.

The soundtrack will stay with you forever (nostalgia hits me every time I open the main menu), and all tracks fit every scenario like a glove, finishing the immersion with a flourish. The orchestration is a true masterpiece. Just listen to the first trailer's opening in the store page. That's the fantastic Viconia's Romance Theme.

If that's not enough, rest assured no playthrough will be the same as the previous one. The replayability is infinite (specially with friends, if you have the chance).

Baldur's Gate II is a game you will want to dive into.

I dare say I didn't play it. I lived it!

NOTE: I don't think the Enhanced Edition ruined the game at all, as stated in other reviews. I play Baldur's Gate II since 2000 and I can say that the content is all there, the game still feels the same all the way and the enhancements are really nice and practical (if you don't like the visual ones, most of them are optional, so you don't have to get angry about changing the way the original game looked like). Finally, I must say I didn't experience any bugs at all.

The removal of Shapeshifter+Dispel Magic ""bug"" was annoying, but can now be re-added with mods. The rebalances are somewhat annoying.

First of all, old games were not all fuzzy and turd-smeared looking or full of pixels.
A lot of games were very crisp, clear, ""high-res"" looking in the day. There seems to be the popular idea of ""ret-conning"" that reality. BGII ""Gaslight Edition"" is a perfect example of that.


The original game was perfect, beautiful main menu screen, UI, look and feel.
This ""new"" version completely revamps it and it looks tacky and disjointed. The ""scroll-esque"" pop-ups over names looks out of place and doesn't fit the graphic style. It looks really bad. What's up with the ""health bars"" over characters during combat? This isn't an RTS. It looks really bad and tacky here. The default font on the gameplay screen looks cheap too, like they didn't even use the original and didn't bother to try and marry it to the screen. 

The UI is too small. And default main screen is too small, the characters you can barely see. There is no ""classic mode"" or resolution controls either! UGH.  Instead, you can...""zoom in"". So you basically zoom in and everything becomes fuzzier, muddier looking just to see things normally. It's like walking up closer to a painting where your face/eyes are inches away. Why would you fricken do that? That's not even how the original game looked when it filled the screen. 

Anyways, this not even as good as the original looked but worse. How can it be called ""enhanced"". I would expect something even more polished and refined, modern high-res, but instead it looks like they went backwards. According to the Oxford dictionary, the definition of ""ENHANCE"" is: ""the act of increasing or further improving the good quality, value or status of somebody/something"". Instead, this isn't the BGII you remember and newfans thinking this is how it was...well, it's not.

It feels more like a modded version. The screenshots promoted for the game look fake, it doesn't even look like that in my opinion. My guess is possibly a copy/paste of the original into the new UI? /shrug

Find a copy of the original BG2 out there, somewhere, and you might be moderately surprised how much better it looks. 

Is anything good about this version? Yes, there are a handful of take-aways. They're pretty major that might even justify sucking up the changes and plunking down your hard-earned cash. 1) It's stable 2) It runs well on modern systems 3) they added some helpful changes to character creation 4) some additional portraits 5) zooming is actually really cool I wish games like Diablo III allowed that. In contrast, the original has issues with multiple monitors where your mouse can ""leave the screen"" and you inadvertently click into another monitor and it ""alt-tabs you out""; or, you might find the mouse/key-scrolling difficult as a result. Yet, the BGII cinematics play better and ""enhanced"" version seems to struggle and try to nerf that and other things. 

Why thumbs down? Because anyone advertising an ""enhanced"" version, the expectation is something actually enhanced. Take for example Skyrim vs. Skyrim Special Edition. Huge improvement. And I'm sure many other games can be brought up for comparison. In fairness, this ""enhanced"" version was from 2013. So that's 10 years ago. But games 10 years ago better than this, they weren't all muddy and crap (Diablo III came out in 2012, for example). Even if one could say ""they're using the original graphics/art"", I respect that, but what did they do to enhance that? It looks dis-enhanced and not what awe'd everyone back then, and they DID change graphics in areas at their own liberty that make the style/look diminished and degraded compared to the original, IMO. Diablo II (not III) that came out in 2000 looks better IMO.

I've played the games/series since originals on CD but also digital form from 2011 Anthology that had: BG1, BG2, IW1, IW2, Planescape Torment, Temple of Elemental Evil; all expansions. Too bad that isn't available anymore. I still have the original BGII and played it again. Definitely, unfortunately Enhanced, while I appreciate the efforts and the areas it does win at, just doesn't live up to expectations.

Ultimately, you will probably enjoy how much more stable and complimentary to systems with multiple monitors, the zoom feature, and all makes it relevant. That's fair. On that alone might make it the ""better version"". But ""Enhanced""? Noooo. ""Strange Tacky Alternative Version?""

to give you perspective, I have learned that the first 2 games uses mechanics that not even dnd use right now. it is that old... 

In no way would I ever suggest anyone to try to play the first 2 games in any other mode than story. I am sure there will be people who will enjoy it but it will be too tiresome for most. 

also this game contained way too many bugs that I did not encounter in bg 1 EE. 

graphics wise the game does not progress one but but in terms of map design and art design it regressed. in most maps you won't know where you can go till you open the map to show you. tree of life being a major example. also the open world felt way too restrictive in this game. there were a lot of maps that contained way too many bullshit secrets such as the person we need to talk to progress the quest is hidden behind a secret wall IN HIS OWN HOME. I get that he is a thief but I found it to be very stupid. my 100% ass was not satisfied till I discovered every blackness of the screen so even in those levels I struggled... 

there are also way too many linked quests that a first timer can never understand. such as the cult in the sewers. it is said to be in the sewers but I walked every inch of the sewers to not find a trace of them. then I looked online as I did with most quests and realized it was closed right now and even when the time comes when I can do it I shouldn't because I block way more content for myself by DOING THE QUEST... it is a no brainer. I just can't fathom these design decisions. I didn't realize till I got to act 3 that even though I saved jaheira, I would neet recruit her to have her quests available. there was no tips given in game how could I? so I could have played the whole game not even knowing her husband died...

I don't know what thought went into these parts but it hella bothered me. I would suggest anyone to play this game for the lore to not get disappointed.

All my hours are just in one playthrough, so you know I liked it.

First, although I and many others think BG2 is great, you need to know that it's an older game (main game 'Shadows of Amn' came out in 2000, 'Throne of Bhaal' in 2001), and even though it was fixed up (enhanced edition came out 2013), that is quite old too, and it's not like they made year 2000 graphics into 2020 ones.

On saying that, if you can get over the older graphics and sometimes clunky fighting (especially with spells), then you'll really enjoy it.  The story is fantastic; extremely well-made and genuinely fun to discover.  There are a lot of side quests, monsters, and many different people you meet throughout the game.  Your companions really enhance the experience.  I've played many rpg games and the companions are generally good, but something about Minsc, Khalid, Rasaad, and the others just really add a lot of flavor to the game.  There are almost 30 potential companions, and you can have up to 6 in a party, so there's lots of mixing and matching, and it gives the opportunity for multiple playthroughs.

To sum it up:

Good:  Storyline
            Your companions, their personalities and the various parties you can make up.
            Content-rich game.
            The many fun and interesting quests that abound in the world.

Ok:     Graphics (it will depend on how picky you are with graphics; I tolerate it because of the game's age).
           THACo and the old 2nd edition format for DnD.  I was ok with it, some people might love/hate it.

Not so good:  Spell usage and storage (UI is not the best here, and some spells ""make a mistake"" sometimes)

The story: the pacing is just right, and the way the events unfold flows perfectly. There's plenty of extra lore to find around the world, but you can disregard all of it if you so wish, and just go into the dungeons to smash monsters' skulls.  

The gameplay: Real time with pause fits perfectly with the game's mechanics. Fights are rarely unfair (though Demi Liches cheat a wee bit). They get a little goofy come late ToB, and mages can feel too powerful at times, but everything is doable at every difficulty. Even cheesing battles is fun. 

The writing: It's 99% as good as Planescape: Torment's writing. Plenty of serious dialogue and a few silly moments level up the game from excellent to masterpiece.

After playing BG 3 recently I realized I'd forgotten so much of the story that I needed to play it again. I can see where Larian made so many UI, audio and graphical improvements on the old game with the 3rd sequel. This game, for example, doesn't have the modern turn based style as turns are run through in automated rounds and the user must either pause or have it set to pause each round, which doesn't work as well. I could swear it worked differently before, but my memory is wrong I guess. It's fine though, it's still an incredible game that is just as addicting as any other great fantasy series story. Maybe it doesn't have the dice throws like BG 3 but it has everything BG 3 has at its core. I hope one day Larian comes in to remake this game on the new engine while interweaving the two original expansions into the story, I would 100% buy it and be excited to play it. I am not sure why they didn't start with just remaking the original BG1 instead of just making a sequel but maybe they will?

CONS: 

1. The game has bugs where some quests just won't complete and were marked as a so called ""non issue"" on the forums when clearly they are an issue. Lazy support. You cannot charge money for a game and not support it.
2. If your first Baldur's Gate game is the third most recent game you will be disappointed to find out that it is not turn based and hardly any encounters can be won on the first try, more like the 32nd reload, maybe, if you're lucky, unless you have it on easy or even default mode.",1696429442,1699026477,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I've yet to discover any party-based isometric RPG game that rivals the scale and greatness of Baldurs Gate 2... although Shadowrun Returns was pretty damn close (just let down by how short it was).

Don't get me wrong - Baldurs Gate 1 was good - but, in my opinion, Baldurs Gate 2 took what made the original great and magnified it 100 times. The story, characters, quality of voice acting, humour and simple old school D&D rules make this one of the finest games of all time.

I'm giving this game a thumbs up, because it is a grand experience filled with tons of content. If a player comes with the right set of expectations, they can have an amazing time playing it. Personally, I wasn't impressed by the Shadows Of Amn main-quest, but enjoyed Throne Of Bhaal Expansion. This game shines with its individual story companions that you can recruit to your party & the side-quests! 

Indeed, one's expectations should be should be directed at the adventure itself. This game is about rising from an experienced rag-tag group of adventurers, fighting to overcome bandits. To eventually felling umber hulks, mindflayers, beholders & dragons! For me, it's not about the story, but the journey itself!

This game is also very hard. Having a proper party & tactics is crucial! And picking right quests. Accepting a too demanding quest means you're going to be having a bad time with the game. This game is an epic classic, for sure - when taken in its own context. I just loved Baldur's Gate 1 too much, which made this such a disappointment to me on my first playthrough. I wanted the continuation of the Bhaalspawn saga, which I eventually got with the Throne Of Bhaal, but it should've been its own game. Shadows Of Amn shouldn't have been about Gorion's Ward or the Bhaalspawn. It felt like the developers wanted to tell a different story with the Bhaalspawn characters & which made the whole Irenicus plot feel like a wild goose chase instead of doing something more important than stopping some random villain of the week.",1698346918,1698346918,True,2,0,0.505660355091094971,0,True,False,False

- Great incentive to explore, beautiful 2D graphics.

There are so many quests and side-quests that you can lose yourself in this world for hundreds of hours, and emerge still wanting more!  Everything is extremely well done: the world, the combat, the characters, the monsters and NPCs you meet along the way.

Party composition is key if you want to be successful, and you need to apply tactics to combat to overcome your foes.

I just completed BG1 and am only about 10 hours into BG2, but WOW did they do a magnificent job with this one. Plus, Bioware was ahead of its time in allowing you to import you character from the first game! As someone who loves RPG's, it is so cool being able to see where the best of the best got their influence from. And although some of the mechanics still show their age (particularly the choice system, although they improved this system in BG2, and it ultimately paved the way for the entire industry) BG2 was still eons ahead of the curve.
Since BG2 starts at the point where you left off in the first game (experience/level-wise), you start with all of the top-tier spells you had from the original game. This makes the combat exhilarating from the start, since you don't have to start from ""0"" again. I do wish that my companions would have transferred as well, but given certain events in the story, that would be impossible in many cases.
This game is a must-play for anyone who loves RPG's or CRPG's. It is a beloved classic that will always be remembered as the Gold Standard for RPG games-- one that paved the way for all modern RPG's-- and as one of the greatest video-games ever created.

I am very glad I didn't, the game shows it's age, and in my opinion is utterly unplayable with the base settings out of the box, but i can mostly look past all that because this game is extremely charming where it counts. Party banter is good, the player has pretty decent agency from what I've seen so far, and the story starts off strong. Now the biggest gripe I have is the real time with pause combat, it has in my experience not aged very well, and can be pretty annoying to manage. I'd personally turn auto pause on turn end as your default setting plus turn off superfluous combat animations i find them to be a bit much and makes it hard to keep track of attacks. To wrap things up, I think the game is more than worth your time if your a fan of CRPGS, but the learning curve can be steep for a new player especially if they know nothing about AD&D, character creation can be brutal.

As for the changes and additions by Beamdog. I find the UI to be a real improvement over the original game and there are a lot of little quality of life fixes that I like (like being able to zoom in and out, etc., but the added companions like Neera, Dorn, Rasaad and others are sort of take it or leave it as far as I'm concerned. Their companion quests are pretty blah and you're not missing a lot if you skip them in my opinion. The biggest boon is not having to install a ton of mods to get it to work on a modern gaming rig, and that had gotten increasingly frustrating in recent years, with resolutions that just didn't work all that well, even with things like the widescreen mod, etc.

The single quality that makes Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn a top contender is simply the amount of quality content there is. When I am saying ""quality content"" I actually mean big questlines that are unique, and where there barely are any low effort fetch quests. In fact, I think I only encountered a couple of fetch quests in my whole playthrough. This immensely complements the exploration, where, if you simply wander off to god knows where, you may encounter quests upon quests. Now, some may find this overwhelming, and I understand that; however, for me, it was simply addicting. Addicting in such a way where time just flew by while playing this. In fact, when I was done with the main story, I was sort of like, ""that's it? I want MORE"".

Another quality aspect of Baldur's Gate II is the companions. Now, I wouldn't say they are the best out of the best—unparalleled. That said, they are still great, and that is partially due to the banter, but also because of their own stories. I do wish there was more ""meat"" to them though, as in, I wish they had more to say, and more specifically I wish there was a way to talk to them whenever. This feature is sorely lacking in this game, and it's a feature that you can find in plenty of modern RPGs.

On to the other side of the coin.

This game also has severe flaws. It can be clunky just moving around, and because it's just point & click, some may be turned off by that. In addition, the pathfinding is atrocious, in such a way where sometimes your characters don't move where you order them to, or sometimes they get stuck on one another. This whole interaction is just clunky and awkward.

This game seemingly hides critical information from players as well. Now, some may consider this a good thing, but in this case it would have been really handy to have information about the enemies' buffs and other statistics. Players unfamiliar with DnD will not understand a thing, and I believe there could have been a way to improve this. I often find that in some battles, I end up guessing what spells could work well against the enemy.

The way this game deals with resurrection is poor design, in my honest opinion. For a beginner, early on they might find it difficult, or even outright impossible, to resurrect their party members. In this game you have to go to the temple to resurrect, or have the spells or the wand of resurrection to do it. The temple can be so out of the way sometimes, and the wand of resurrection and relevant spells might not be available for you early on. So, what ends up happening? Many reloads. Or that's my experience at least.

To conclude, it might sound like this game has many faults, and for a gamer with modern taste that might actually be true. However, I can't stress it enough: I think this game is a masterpiece. This would be too long to list all the good—and bad—things about this title, but on a final note something else that I immensely appreciate is how they did the quest journal system, because in my opinion it's the best I have ever seen in a game; there are no quest markers at all, but it's still giving you just enough hints to make it through.

This is a must-play for anyone that loves RPGs. However, due to the old and sometimes archaic design, I find it difficult to recommend to gamers with modern taste.

[h2]Baldurs Gate II Enhanced Edition Review[/h2]

[h1]Why does playing this game feel great?[/h1]
This is a great RPG and it is a big improvement over Baldur's Gate 2 and Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition. There is just something in letting players to get to high levels and being able to get powerful weapons and spells that is extremely satisfying. It is great to be able to see different classes at high levels and use different powerful spells and epic level abilities. And it is great that with time while your power grows your enemies become stronger and stronger from act to act – that way you feel powerful but you also have to work harder and use more buffs and better strategies to earn your win in big combat encounters. It feels great to start as someone that has problems defeating just an evil group of adventurers and end up as someone that kills beholders and dragons and liches. It also feels great when you meet enemies that you would have had trouble defeating a few hours ago but now you just cast some spells and use proper tactics and they all lie on the ground dead.

This game is a great power fantasy and it gives you all the spells and weapons and items that you really need to solve any combat encounter. The game forces you to learn how different spells work and to adapt your strategies so you can change a hard combat encounter into an easy one with quick thinking and some good placed control spells and buffs. It also feels great when you can just solve a combat encounter with a good placed fireball or a time stop that gives you so many options. There is nothing more satisfying than blasting 10 enemies with one fireball making you win the combat before it even starts or casting time stop to nuke an enemy mage or cleric before they can do anything.

Playing as Fighter/Thief and having Jan Jansen and Valygar in your party and making all 3 hide in shadows to place them close to all enemy spell casters and backstabbing them at the exact same time making them all die hugely weakening the rest of the enemies is also a ton of fun especially when you crit and the enemy mage explodes into bloody bits. It is also nice that in this game you can really use rogue traps like a true rogue – place them somewhere and aggro the enemy so the traps can do a lot of damage killing powerful enemies making it a viable strategy and not just something that you should never waste your time on. You can even later use traps that stop time giving you free back stabs on enemies! Too many games give rogues no ways of setting traps or the traps they can set are not worth it because they do almost nothing – thankfully this is not the case in this game!

It is great that all classes and kits have a way of being useful in some way and while there are some that would be stronger than others it is just a D&D thing. Still it feels great that whatever you pick to roleplay as will work so you can just play whatever class you enjoy instead of searching the internet for “best class” and “best builds” that people still argue about to this day.

[h3][u]Gameplay[/u][/h3]
Baldur's Gate II Enhanced Edition retains the same core gameplay mechanics as its Prequel, with the new clean gameplay UI, and a customizable font size of the text. The graphics have been seriously worked upon as well, delivering a good appeal visually, most of the other things like the party system, the open-ended quest system, and the isometric CRPG system remain unchanged. You can read further about the gameplay in my previous review on Baldurs Gate I Enhanced Edition [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/UnitedCritics/discussions/0/3051735285575088594/] [b]here[/b][/url]. The Story is set in the Forgotten Realms of Continent of Faerun, now I don’t want to spoil any more details about it, but it certainly is imbued with strong fantasy writing albeit at times not as strong as its prequel nonetheless it's certain to get you hooked, that is if you manage to get a break from doing all the side quests.

[h1]Important changes:[/h1]
First of all the graphics are much better and animations also look better and everything runs smoother. This makes everything in the game look better but it is mostly noticeable with spells that now look better than ever. Scroll wheel now lets you quickly zoom in and out making the whole gaming more enjoyable when you want to take a closer look at something or when you want to see the whole combat area to strategically place traps and cast spells etc.
There are almost no bugs because during all the time I played I found only one that appeared a few times – a few party members standing together on the same spot making them unable to move – thankfully it is easy to fix by ordering them to stop their movement and just moving them one by one so they will no longer be stuck together in the same place.

I love that they updated the game interface and that now things like character screen gives much more detailed information about your character divided into different tabs and inventory screen now even shows you if the item you click and hold with your cursor will be an improvement or a downgrade compared to the items your hero has already equipped – you no longer have to sit down with a piece of paper to compare 2 weapons and count the damage you will do with them. There are just many quality of life improvements in the Enhanced Edition that really make the difference.

The Enhanced Edition also added new items and if you import your hero from Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition after finishing Siege of Dragonspear some of the items that you found in that DLC will appear in Baldur's Gate 2: Enhanced Edition in a few different places. You will even be able to find some items from the original Baldur's Gate and some items that were in Baldur's Gate 2 have been upgraded to better fit the time when you get them in game and to be more useful like Kundane, Mace of Disruption, Defender of Easthaven etc.

[h2][u]Final Thoughts[/u][/h2]
To sum it up, Baldur's Gate II Enhanced Edition is a great RPG game and still lives up to all its praises. Both Games Baldurs Gate I and II redefined the RPG genre when they first came out back in the day, and the enhanced edition ports just solidify the thought. Granting you countless hours of true RPG exploration with your own specifically designed character, a well-rounded party, and an open-end quest system, this is something nobody wants to sleep upon. So what are you waiting for, go out there and live out this entertaining yet iconic Bhaalspawn Saga !

There were some issues though: I felt companions to be a bit lackluster, and while some were memorable, it was more-so they were fun interesting ideas, action figures, without many quests or dialogue behind them. I loved the vibrant and pretty world full of quests and adventure! But due to the low levels of early Baldur's Gate you would have to reload an area often because you and your party kept dying. I loved questing and doing dungeons! But many quests were simple fetch this, fetch that. Etc. Etc. Baldur's Gate 2 does all of the things I loved better, and does all the things I had issues with SIGNIFICANTLY better. 

The story and companions here are mwah, we went from barebones companions to full fledged questlines, romance, and tons of unique dialogue. A lot of the companions here are solidified as my favorites now in the genre, up there with Dragon Age: Origins companions (which I personally consider the crown jewel and example all other CRPG companions have to be compared to.) The romances are fun as well. And the addition of the majority of companions having a unique companion quest is great. 

The higher DnD level play here is also just way more fun and interesting with more variety of enemies, loot, locations, spells, etc. Combat and dungeon exploration is so fun and far superior to the first game. I dreaded dungeon diving or large combats in 1, much preferring the hub-based content which was usually more interesting. But now in 2 I actively seek them out here! Also loot... This and Morrowind I think are tied for my favorite handling of loot in RPGs now. Never has it been so satisfying to haul back an inventory full of items to identify, sell, keep, compare. Watching gold increase and get more powerful items, and spend that gold on items you've been ogling... So fun. If ever I want the feeling of just wealth amassing in an RPG this is a great one for it. 

The environments and locations in 1 were fun and pretty but oh my goodness here in 2 the world is just completely and utterly gorgeous. I love my hubs and cities in games and the main city, Athkatla, is even more impressive and interesting than the titular Baldur's Gate in 1. And the many other settlements like Trademeet are also just so aesthetically pleasing, interesting, and fun to explore and get quests in! Not to mention aesthetically diverse! From a fantasy medieval Istanbul to a traditional Medieval European trading town by a Druid's Grove to a picturesque sun-stained Greek island town overrun by pirates to even more I shan't spoil, not even naming the different dungeons and outdoors environments!

The sound and music is excellent too, the voice acting ranging from campy but fun to outright amazing, some famous voice actors here too like Grey DeLisle who I mostly know as Azula from Avatar: The Last Airbender. In this she plays a Drow Death Cleric, excellently I might add... And is a romance option for those similarly messed up people who had an unreasonable crush on Azula when we were young. The voice barks NPCs give are charming as well, there are a few reused ones from 1 that I didn't mind. The music is beautiful, I already adored the tracks in 1 but here it is even better. More melancholic I'd say, for an example of one of my favorite tracks, look up Viconia's Theme!

The quests though are the biggest improvement after companions. They are almost entirely always memorable and fun. Gone are the constant boring fetch quests, replaced instead with whimsical and fun stories. It feels like they amassed a large group of DnD DMs and just told them to recount their best adventures. These may be my favorite side-quests in RPGs ever, maybe? They just breathe the fun DnD flair for interesting quirky quests. There is also the addition of player-housing in the Stronghold system! Which is a very fun system that adds even more replayability to the game! Every set of classes get their own unique questline and home, a thieves guild, a fighter castle, a druid grove, etc! The one weak point of the quests is the content added by Beamdog, as others have said the writing... leaves a lot to be desired. From a questline where the false evidence of a murder is the innocent person's name written in blood framing them... (Really?) To literally herding 8 cats in a boring fetchquest, to outright bad dialogue with modern slang that doesn't fit the tone at all, one companion is so bad I genuinely out loud muttered, ""SHUT UP!"" during their questline. The combat encounters too are the least balanced and most poorly planned of the entire game. Luckily all of the Beamdog added content is optional and I will probably skip on replays. There are also some bugs, mainly those related to dialogue and romances, romances especially are very bugged.

I recommend it wholeheartedly for RPG fans, it is possible to skip 1 and play here since there is a built in roleplay option to choose to be an amnesiac and thus not remember the characters and events of 1! Though I do recommend personally that people play 1 first and import a character as going from a weakling to a god from BG1 to BG2/ToB is such a satisfying experience across the whole series. It's not completely needed though. Just play it!",1688920621,1694245769,True,8,0,0.583633065223693848,0,True,False,False

I'm not saying 'don't play it' because you absolutely will get a kick out of the story and the feel of D&D, if you're a fan of the universe, there's a lot to love, just play it on Story Mode and save yourself the frustration of cake-walking some fights, only to be obliterated in one hit during the next one.",1693335571,1693335571,True,6,1,0.57223665714263916,0,True,False,False

Armors, weapons, item icons, spell fx, UI, it's all uglier. In the case of armors & weapons, they decide to use the icons and models from BG1, which look so much worse than the BG2 art.

I'd be ok with this if there was a legitimate reason for the change, but no such thing exists. They were too lazy to upscale & port the original art, and since modders already had working mods to port BG1 art to BG2, Beamdog just stole other people's work.

Baldur's Gate 2: Enhanced Edition represents a classic role-playing game (RPG), originally developed by the company BioWare and published by the company Black Isle Studios in 2000. This remake (2013) has been developed by Overhaul Games, a division of Beamdog, and published by Atari. Further notable remakes of the development studio are Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, and Planescape: Torment.

[i] Pros & cons: [/i]

++ Gather your loyal followers once more and lead the charge against the mad mage Jon Irenicus. Subjugate the remaining Bhaalspawn and complete your journey, for there can be only one. Claim your birthright, let the hate flow through you, and arise as the Lord of Murder!

++ The companions are much better fleshed out and you get to see some character development happen, including several romance options. At this point I have to confess that Aerie was my first digital crush when I played the game for the first time as a teenager. Also, the various interactions between the characters are a shining example for creative group dynamics.

+ Solid side quests and optimized map exploration. Basically, everything that was wrong with the predecessor has been corrected in this game.

+ The fun begins on the Legacy of Bhaal difficulty, where every enemy looks like a clown, hits like a truck, and tanks like a boss. Best encounter: the party of six freaks on the 5th level of Watcher’s Keep.

[i] Summary: [/i]

An epic story, interesting characters, and remarkable group dynamics throughout the game. To this day it remains one of the best Dungeon & Dragons adventures you can play. One of my all-time favourites.

Recommended for fans of classic RPGs, and people who fetishize a particular hamster.

If you've never played Baldur's Gate 2 and don't want to faff about with mods then this should be a fine way to play the game. If you've played BG2 and think this will be an improvement, I think you will be disappointed.

The UI has been changed, and I think for the most part it's a downgrade. The text is clearer on a modern display, but the look and feel is not as polished. Tool tips are no longer an animated scroll, the journal while more functional looks ugly and unfinished, health bars and other graphical tweaks look ugly and it's better to turn them off, the icons for items have all been redone and look flat and uninspired compared to the original game.

Do these changes add up and make the game vastly inferior to the original? Not really.

The original BG2 is being patched by dedicated fans with mutual help from Beamdog, still releasing updates to this day at (gibberlings3 dot net), and if you don't mind doing a little tinkering I think this is a better option. Ontop of that, the game purchased on Steam does not come with a copy of the original game unlike when you purchase it on gog.

Beamdog are a company, and unlike the dedicated fan base the infinity engine games have, they need to continue on to other projects, fixing up games that really don't need fixing up and doing a poorer job at it than the fans. I don't find these releases worthwhile. You might if you're lazy and just want to get playing but I think there are better ways to enjoy BG2.",1560335105,1692451291,False,9,0,0.498104959726333618,0,True,False,False

The difficulty here and especially in ToB is something else than in the first game or its Enhanced Edition expansion. It's not impossible by any means but you'll really need to dive into deep end of the archaic 2nd edition rules to survive it or reduce difficulty to its lowest. I also have no clue how or who could pull off anything harder than Normal (which is easier than Core rules) in multiplayer, but some have obviously done that too.

Overall, as an RPG, the game holds its own against most modern titles, but not all. The plot of the game and the narrative carries through the more aged parts and features, and the battle system is still, at least in Enhanced Edition, robust enough to enjoy and be challenged by. But I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who don't think of themselves as ""hardcore"" fan of RPGs. The sheer effort of wading through not just the staggering amount content but the gameplay systems and interfaces is at times numbing, even after familiarizing with the first game.

If you're thinking of playing BG1EE first; don't, just read a single paragraph of its plot and play the sequel as your first experience of the Bhaalspawn saga, trust me, you even start beyond the awful hurdle of 2e's early-levels.

I believe this sequel is what people think of when they truly think of Baldur's Gate. It provides interesting locales and dungeons that are well designed with a lot of puzzles, fun companions to take you through its story and has beautiful pre-rendered graphics. I think my favourite part of the game is that it puts you in a situation that you need to make money and provides most of its world to explore from the get-go, so you don't have to be bogged down with aimlessly wandering. Actually, no, my favourite thing about the game is the villain, named Jon Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition. Jon's got a great motive and very entertaining dialogue that makes you want to keep seeing him again and again. The expansion is a fun final act and on-rails in a good way, with interesting or obnoxious fights to suffer through to conclude the saga.

That all said the game is dated and not a must-play, it pales to its Western and Eastern CRPG peers older and newer than it, but I stress it's still a solid game. It's clear from this game that there's no confusion why Bioware became a favoured developer, and this is where their patented ""talk to a person and they'd sleep with you"" romance originated from, which I don't miss.

If you're still reading this drivel the Enhanced Edition is by far the best way to play this game. I had previously played the old version during the COVID pandemic and it just wasn't that fun to play and spent almost a year playing it and BG1, note this is when we had a lot more free-time. This has less problems than BG1EE in regards to quality of new content but it's still the weakest part of the game, you just want this for the quality of life this port provides.",1689775875,1691473287,True,37,0,0.690170526504516602,4,True,False,False

Owners of the original may post comments like this is the same game repackaged and they already did all of this with free mods....... Well they would be correct mostly however there are a few notable improvements, mainly the new introduction of multiple new characters each with there own areas and quests thrown in which does provide quite a few extra hours of interesting places to explore. The other note I will make on people who owned the previous game is that not everyone is into messing around with mods and tweaking the game, what this does is pretty much give you all those tweaks in a nice easy to use bundle which suits me just fine. 

For those of you that have never played baldurs gate 2 or the first one I would suggest getting that one first and then playing through. The reason why is because this in my opinion is simply Bioware's story telling at it's absolute finest, you know the good stuff before EA came along and basically raped the companies games  like they did so many other's ""cough mass effect"". ""cough dragon age 2"". Not that i really had over tone problems with dragon age 2 it was just the fact that I had to upset my companions by turning down the OTT sexual harressment from my general party members if your into that it's cool not judging but anyway i digress. #

Ultimately however I have written this review off the top of my head in about the last 2 minutes so it is most probably full of typo's and spelling errors feel free to correct me. 

Solid combat system 
Solid inventory system
Solid plot line 
Solid party characters that you can love I mean Minsc is da man
Solid villans both first and second game. 

When you consider that they can create these characters without the CGI of newer games like mass effect or the voice over acting just done through partial voice acting and mostly text is a testament to how well written the dialogue in this game is. 

The more notable flaws I would say are in summation

Has not really done much to improve on the original few extra chars and high res 
Certain classes do have limited abilities however this is probably because they stayed quite true to the D&D rule set 2nd edition could be third... unsure never played D&D off the computer. 
Certain classes defintely kick out way more power at certain levels to others this game can be power gamed. 
Few bugs in places but nothing major imo. 
Action pace can be slow for some but i liked this made me feel emersed in the game like i actually was going to a tavern and meeting characters and conversing instead of just fight fight fight....

What I have played so far has left me mixed on the game, as I really enjoyed the world and how it improved on the simple looks of the first game and the inclusion of more DND monsters such as Beholders and Mind Flayers, but the difficulty of the game compared to the first game has felt like a massive downgrade and ruins a lot of the experience for me. The first did difficulty well in that it followed the simple rule that if you prepared you would do well in incoming battles, while also being beatable with most party setups, it was difficult but fair. Baldur's Gate 2 however seems to rely on enemies with unfair advantages to increase the difficulty. Pretty much any mage you fight will annoy you to death due to the magic system being one sided in favor of half the enemies so you sit there quick loading until you figure out which spells are useful since the descriptions of spells don't really tell you how good a spell is. I also find it ridiculous that some random undead deals more damage to my party then a two headed giant the size of a building. Even if the battles aren't difficult there is usually one thing that occurs that makes you have to wait a about a minute waiting for a status effect to wear off or an aoe spell to end, which to be fair was a problem with the first game. Sometimes preparing doesn't even help with battles as some enemies like the dragons for example have the ability to autocast spells which can dispel buffs off the party. I found a lot of these problems to appears frequently the more I had progressed through the game as well. In conclusion if you liked the Baldur's Gate 1 you might not like the sequel.

Story, world, lore, characters and dialogues are so rich and complex, that today's fantasy games developers can just watch and learn. Problem is also maybe, that makers of fantasy games and their realms these days are mostly inspired just by what they've seen in other fantasy games, books or movies and not by mythology and culture like creators of Baldurs Gate and Forgotten Realms. Graphics are of course more than 20 years old, with some Enhanced Edition tweaks, some more some less successful, but especially locations have been made with so much love and focus, they've fantastic atmosphere and vibe, especially Suldanesellar, Athkatla or Ust Natha, but also many more. This uncomparable atmosphere of the game is really much amplified but outsranding soundtrack, which is so grandious and epic, even I'm not much of an orchestral music fan. I wonder if BG3 by Larian can really stand up to this in the closest future. I'm really happy, that I could play this legendary game in 2023, thanks to this ""Enhanced Edition"", but not all it's improvements were step forward from original game. In some ways original was better, in some not. Also Enhanced Edition is still, after some patches, more buggy than original. Here is a list of some bugs I've encountered:

- Stone to flesh spell doesn't work properly for party members, they are ""de-petrified"" after casting it, but out of party and it's impossible to talk to them for joining back
- During Freeing De Arnise Keep quest, most of dialogues with characters in keep like Daleson or Lady Delcia don't involve Nalia's reactions, like she wasn't in the party, even if she is
- Ending some dialogues, especially quest-related ones causes camera to go uncontrollably up, which can be reversed only by going into game menu
- Pathfinding of characters wasn't the strongest point in original game, but it's even worse in EE I think - characters get stuck into each other in narrow places like bridge to Spellhold or Watcher's Kepp exterior side stairs or Abazigal's Lair, this is a bug not present in original game
- Conversation with Spellhold inmates repeats two times after freeing them and after battle with Irenicus, they are still present on floor with prison cells, despite Irenicus killing them 
- Ruling De Arnise Keep and lands quest chain got stuck after three or four events and never finished properly like in original game
- Graphical glitch on textures of bigger creatures like demons or dragons with a strange thin cross going through whole creature model
- Party character close to Draconis during the battle get stuck into his creature model after dragon transformation and they can't move until Drakonis is killed
- About this one I'm not 100% sure, I would have to see direct comparision, but lava and some water textures look worse than in oroginal BG2 and more like in original BG1, that goes especially for lava",1689257488,1689257488,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In case of a more modern type of gamers you should be careful. The game's a rewarding experience but it demands attention and patience. You may feel overwhelmed with the amount of info and discouraged by the rigidity of the class and promotion system. Collect and study your old D&D textbooks, fellow travellers.

Stuck in Amn, I'm afraid... and the Underdark. A lot of this seems contrived, like encountering Drizzt & Co on the road ""randomly"" and recruiting him for a fight. So odd and out of place, clearly done to impress fanboys (of which I'm one) and failing. The companions get annoyed very easily with each other and if you don't complete their questlines. My paladin complained twice about not doing his when I was unable to go back to Amn to complete it. Went as soon as we could and he spat the dummy and left when we were literally outside his estate. My rogue was taken in the first chapter, my wizard in the sixth... and I just got sick of it and went with 4 party members instead.

Okay, all that said, it's still a good game and a smoother experience than its predecessor. Play BG1 if you have time for only one of them, or maybe Icewind Dale. BG2 has its moments, and despite the nits one can pick you definitely won't be disappointed by this slice of RPG history if you let it sweep you away in its branching narrative (branching, but boiling down to two fairly obvious branches in the end, really).",1688881078,1688881078,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

But even so, one thing piqued my interest. The great antagonist they seemed to prepare for me. Irenicus is easily one of the most recognizable antagonists, mostly due to the fantastic voice actor behind the character. But even so, I never managed to get past the third chapter, mostly due to being overwhelmed by it all. It was also probably my second infinity engine/d&d game, after Icewind Dale, which still has a very special place in my heart.

Well, 20+ years later I've finally managed to finish the main campaign, with some caveats that I'll detail towards the end. 

Overall it's been a pretty great ride, that started with some fantastic chapters, but then it slowly started to stumble, while managing to pick itself back up for a high point towards the third to last chapter; but then ultimately being kind of disappointing in how it wraps up and reveals the history and motivations of the main antagonist.

I wished more from such a promising antagonist, more than such primal and basic motivations and reasons as to why he was doing what he was doing. I wished we could've resolved our differences with some philosophical discussions and debates. But unfortunately it was not to be.

The game is a grand adventure, with so much sizeable side-content that it can be overwhelming. While I did go through all companion quest chains and other side quests, at a certain point I felt I needed to say enough and progress the main one. But I did enjoy a lot of them. The only negative was the apparently superficial time pressure that the companions put on you, keeping you on edge as to whether they will leave your party or not, if you don't get to their respective quests. That really rushed my whole experience, but even so I managed to have a good time. And this was after I had abandoned my Siege of Dragonspear playthrough right near the end, as it just couldn't keep my interest.

In terms of structure and world, I think I might have enjoyed Baldur's Gate 1's approach of a more open world, than this one. But what this did manage to achieve was a much more tighter narrative. And denser areas, where quests seemed to almost be setup one on top of each other. 

One part that I didn't enjoy was either an imbalance in how certain encounters are supposed to run and how difficult they are, or maybe an over-reliance on the intricasies of the D&D ruleset, which I have to admit I'm very much a beginner in. I know most of the basic rules, but I feel what I'm missing is great patience to learn of all abilities and spells, and how they all function together and counter each other. It's a whole heap of particulars and details which I never had the patience to dive too deeply. 

So because of this, I've encountered three types of combat scenarios. Most, at around maybe 80% of the whole, are absolutely easily doable with just my standard party, and no explicit buffs and enhancements. (Btw, I played the whole campaign in core rules, so slightly more difficult than normal.). On top of those 80% I then had around 15% of encounters I could easily overcome by just buffing my party to hell and back. That leaves the final 5% of encounters, mostly with liches, dragons and Irenicus, which I absolutely could not overcome. Even after dozens of attempts. My main suspicion is that I was lacking certain spells that lock down certain enemy spells. And I also didn't have the patience to start scouring the internet for the counters to whatever particular spell some enemy was using. So I've managed to tackled almost all of these impossible encounters via non-combat options. Which I didn't have for the final encounter wit Irenicus. Which is why it pains me to say I cheated in order to defeat that last encounter. And sadly, the actual ending was no improvement over the general lowpoint of the final chapter. 

Another part I should to mention, that was very annoying across some of the game, were the verbal fights companions would sometimes get into. Two NPCs in particular really took it unbelievable extremes, that I was honestly shocked they put this kind of bickering in the game. I won't name them, but anyone facing that combination of characters will likely recognize them.

But even while saying all of this, I still need to grade the experience while taking everything into account. So I'd give the first 3 chapters an easy 9.5/10. The middle point a 7.5, and the final chapter a 6/10. Totalling, I guess, an 8/10. Which might seem high for how much I've complained. But even with these issues it's been a very solid game that's been a whole lot of fun. It's just disappointing that with this great premise and start, they didn't manage to knock it out of the park.

BG2 has to be one of the most overrated RPGs in history. Many of the areas are ugly, alien, and illogically bridge ridden (the original devs were seriously obsessed with bridges). The items are unbalanced and overpowered. Experience is artificially showered on the player to make him high enough level to fight epic enemies. The story line is just plain stupid. It boils down to contrived battles where you will see uniquely named opponents that have no reason to be there and have minimal meaningless or no dialogue. There are lots of contrived 'tests' with no logical reason for being there. The undercover mission in the drow town was good as was the prisoner sequence in the flayer area. But most everything else was pretty bad. I now know why I had forgotten so much of BG2 and never played the expansion, as it is very forgettable. My advice is only buy BG1 and get the mods that expand that game or just skip this journey down memory lane altogether as it is largely a waste of time.

Planescape has better story.

257350,100764857,76561198027025471,0,63,9981,0,9976,1687245151,"Baldur's Gate 2, starts in Athkatla, which is a city in the same imaginary universe as where it's prequel: Baldur's Gate, took place. The sequel features the same protagonist, and is continued from where the previous story piece: Seige of Dragonspear, left off.
The first part of the story takes place in a region surrounding Athkatla. The protagonist and a group of companion characters must visit various places connected to this city and beyond. These areas are inhabited by other denizens, who have unique background stories, which are integrated with the fantasy lore that this story universe is based on. The content material delves further into the dichotomy of that world.
At the beginning of the adventure, the antagonist is revealed. This character has previously been introduced, and unveils himself as the villain: Irenicus. The first half of the story: Shadows of Amn, follows the events set in motion by this character. The second half, concludes the story. Shadows of Amn, paired with this follow-up story, forms a grand storyline, and demands substantial involvement in that narrative. Progress that the protagonist makes between story arcs, is carried over to the next.
The story offers conversations between characters. Some of these characters may become confrontational, reacting to decisions that were made, or allow romances. Being emotionally connected to these characters is of importance to the play.

The environments are shown from the top. Displaying a field of view on a landscape from a certain altitude. This view may be drawn in closer or farther away, and shows a clear-cut overview of the surroundings. The protagonist and the party of companions may be ordered to travel across this landscape together. By means of an on-screen interface, and by pointing and ordering them towards a location, they can be controlled, or they may behave according to a customizable script. (The play can be controlled by, but is not limited to, using only a cursor.)
To win, finish the story by exploring the land. Making progress is challenging and requires intelligence. Every character, even the most unimportant, has something unique to say, which may be influenced by what has transpired, and by what was caused by the protagonist's party. The strength of the party is improved through battle and by completing quests. By obtaining equipment, the party may further be enhanced. Newly met characters may be individually chosen to join this group, and there is a great deal of customization involved.
Throughout the adventure is much strife, and there are many trials to overcome. Succeeding at this, requires outfitting each companion character with equipment. Characters may perform special abilities as well. This must be planned with forethought, and used in synergy to be more successful. Deciding the composition of the party is rewarding, because having characters join the group enables their individual stories to be told. Managing the party is a challenge, because every companion's wishes must be taken into consideration to keep them satisfied.
Challenges also come in the form of hostile encounters. There are a lot of battles, which may be paused at any time. The arithmetic system that makes combat possible is based on turns, yet time flows normally, and the outcome of events is influenced by both strategy and chance.
If the play is not paused, there is a day and night cycle, and there may be occasional weather effects, such as rain and thunder.
Because the story is about role playing, making the appropriate decisions is a worthwhile undertaking. The options available to approach a situation allow ethical deliberation. They distinguish between good and evil, and also offer neutral decisions. Their proceedings are generally suitable towards these alignments. This also allows the protagonist to indulge in arguments, by for example choosing characters to join the party who have opposite personalities.
In order for the party to be successful, collecting various items and gold is required to obtain better equipment. There are many items that may have no obvious purpose, but are worth keeping, because their use may become apparent later. Obtaining the highest quality equipment is an ordeal, because items are hidden, and they may not always be found. There is a considerable amount of these unique items, that have extensive descriptions and stories attached to them.

The length of the story is immense, featuring hundreds of unique story characters and branches. The narrative is satisfying, because the story succeeds in offering substance where the protagonist is of importance to the events taking place in the world. The story features tens of thousands of lines of text, that are often voiced by a multitude of different voice actors, who are acting theatrical.
Audible, there are environmental sounds, such as footsteps and bird songs, and an extensive amount of orchestral sounding music, which often changes, and is thematically similar to Baldur's Gate's musical score.
Visually, environments feature art assets, which are unique to each environment, and there are many different environments.

Not knowing exactly where the story is going or what the characters are going to do next based on their personalities that are actually just things instead of something living is surprisingly refreshing.

As a new player it did take a while for me to get accustomed to enemies that change their forms and names instead of color. Instead of red skeleton man and blue skeleton man the player might encounter for example trolls, spoders, shadows, golems, vampires, some dudes and most importantly mustard jellies. Some enemies even do more than one type of attack which sometimes forces me to think about things.

This is my first playthrough of Baldur's Gate II and I have to say it was a blast. Tedious, but a blast. I played this entirely on Steam Deck and it ran flawlessly. Could have gotten about 8 hours off a single charge. I played it on ""story"" mode as I was more interested in seeing the story unfold than the complex combat mechanics. I played up to Chapter 8 (start of Throne of Bhaal), but did not complete the expansion. The base game took me about 26.5 hours to complete which could be considered a ""rushed"" playthrough.

The story is a bit more directed this time around with less time to ""free roam"". I did not mind that as much, but if you hadn't looked it up then you could miss out on side content after a certain point. I had imported my save from BG1 and was able to continue with my character which was an awesome feature of this game back in the day. The game takes place some time after the events of the first game, and you have been kidnapped by a powerful mage who is doing experiments on you. Imoen (mage from prior game) is taken from your part early on by another faction along with this powerful mage. The main goal of the game is to get Imoen back. The main questline has a lot of twists and turns and takes you to some really cool, and unexpected, locations. The side quests felt impactful and it was really cool to experience things from D&D lore that I am familiar with. I overall preferred this more directed approach, and I didn't feel ""surprised"" by the outcomes of any of my decisions.

The world building in this game was spot on you. You felt the tension in the lands of Amn stemming from various events. The main hub in the game is quite large and each zone feels unique. The surrounding locations all have their own unique flare, and felt distinct. I think my favorite piece of side content came from a trading post that worships Waukeen (a lesser deity of wealth and trade). One of my D&D party member's character worships her and it was fun to experience that in a different context. Thought it didn't fee like there were as many locations as the first game, they all felt unique, had engaging side content, and kept me engaged with the game.

The gameplay in this game hasn't changed too much from BG1. The UI is still kind of clunky, and the combat mechanics can be tedious. I am still not a fan of the AD&D ruleset, but my main goal in playing was to experience the story. Playing on story mode helped to alleviate some of the more frustrating elements, especially playing on Steam Deck where the control scheme is not as ideal as mouse and keyboard. The game does a better, and sometimes comedic, job of making sure you understand the consequences of a lot of your choices. I became a fallen ranger in BG1 because some things were not as clear what would happen. It did make it a little harder to roleplay though as I wanted to be a more neutral (and sometime evil) character but certain content would have been cut off from me. The game was an overall refinements on BG1's mechanics and I felt it was a decent step up. Nothing really new, but it works.

I enjoyed my time in Amn and can highly recommend this game to anyone that is into classic CRPGs or D&D. It takes some getting used and is a bit clunk but is worth it for those interested in some classic PC gaming.",1684849138,1684849138,True,3,0,0.563492059707641602,0,True,False,False

Released in 2000 by BioWare, it is the sequel to the critically acclaimed Baldur's Gate and is set in the Dungeons & Dragons Forgotten Realms universe. The EE version by Beamdog is incredible updating the graphics, sound, and appealing to the modern gamer. 

The game's story is immersive and captivating. It picks up where the first game left off, with the protagonist, known as the Bhaalspawn, held captive by the powerful mage Jon Irenicus. The game takes players on a vast adventure through the city of Athkatla and its surrounding regions, filled with intriguing characters, complex quests, and political intrigue. The overarching plot revolves around the Bhaalspawn's heritage and the struggle for power among various factions.

One of the standout features of Baldur's Gate II is its memorable cast of characters. Each party member has a rich backstory, unique personality, and personal questline. The interactions and relationships you develop with these characters are incredibly well-written, allowing for deep and meaningful connections. The voice acting is superb, bringing these characters to life and enhancing the overall experience.
The gameplay in Baldur's Gate II is based on the second edition of the Dungeons & Dragons ruleset. It combines real-time exploration with pause-and-play tactical combat. Players can control a party of up to six characters, each with their own abilities and skills. The combat encounters are challenging and require strategic thinking, making each battle feel rewarding.

The game's world is vast, with numerous areas to explore, including cities, wilderness, and dungeons. There are countless side quests and hidden treasures to discover, providing hours of additional gameplay beyond the main story. The game also offers a high level of customization, allowing players to create their own unique character or import their protagonist from the first game.

Visually, Baldur's Gate II was impressive for its time, featuring detailed environments, character sprites, and spell effects. However, it's important to note that the graphics may feel dated by today's standards. Nevertheless, the game's art direction and attention to detail still hold up well.

Baldur's Gate II received widespread critical acclaim upon its release and has since become a classic in the RPG genre. It is praised for its deep storytelling, memorable characters, challenging gameplay, and extensive content. Even today, it remains a highly recommended title for both fans of the original game and newcomers to the series.

You prepare for this big finale fight, and there is this great sense of relief when you've won, only  for it to not really be the final fight and you have to do it again, but just harder this time. 

I have no shame in saying i played this game on easy and got my shit rocked the entire way through. I do not know these systems, and honestly did not take the time to learn. Fully admit that's my fault, but where I felt I could fumble through BG1, that is absolutely not the case here. I still have not beat the final boss. Likely a combination of not being smart enough to fully manage this battle system and maybe being a bit under leveled. Regardless of my frustrations with the final boss, and accepting the fact that i'm probably not going to beat this game, I still enjoyed my time with it.

I love D&D irl and I'm surprised I never really properly looked into BG. I heard I could jump into BG 2 ee with fresh eyes and still enjoy it, and I really did! I was nervous about getting used to the UI and the rules as I'm so used to 5e, but it was actually fantastic. The characters had strong personalities and interacted very often with each other as a player would, and I loved the big involvement of alignment, as it should be imo. I also found the difficulty really decent and challenging (if you're looking for that), which I think a lot of modern RPGs sometimes disappoint me on. You actually have to use strategy which I appreciate, as opposed to cheesing most of it. Although I'm sure people have figured out for this too. 

Looking forward to BG 3 now in August, and I'm happy to have gotten into some of the backstory of ogs like Jaheira and Minsc before starting. Not that I think that BG 3 needs to be played with some previous game history! ...Yes, I agree, Minsc (and Boo) is 1000% the best character!

Also - being new, I love hearing what the longtime D&D and BG fanbase have to say about these games. Really pushed me into getting it and I actually love it. If you're new like me, and enjoy D&D but especially like dungeon crawlers, or deeply involved questing and RPGs, I reckon you'll really like this. If old game aesthetics really bother you... you'll get over it fast - it's a great game and I understand those who think it's one of the best RPGs of all time.",1682755123,1682755123,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

PROS:
+ Same PROS as in BG1 (interesting quests, interesting dungeons, many enemies, a LOOOOOT of spells)
+ Level cap ""removed""
+ Companions speak more
+ Finally got bag of holdings and enough scroll-cases/gem-bags for everyone
+ 99% of cases can order disbanded companion to go to their specific spot (and not wait till end of time in random dungeon)
+ A looooot of cool magical items

CONS:
- Same CONS as in BG1 (no AOE indicators, clunky movement in case if many party members, reputation limits your companion choices)
- Many encounters aren't meant to be beaten with first time
- The fact that you don't know when a round begins and ends sometimes makes you feel that your char is just standing and doing nothing
- In DLC most enemies suddenly get bunch of +2, +3 magical weapons. Which feels a bit wrong

+/- Still too many companions (it is fine for people who will replay this game multiple times)
+/- You will start to cheese more as game progresses. Some enemies just demand it. It is possible without doing that, but if it is first time playing this game, you dont know the system that well. 
+/- Hard to master the system, so many synergies, exceptions and statuses.

Summary:
Overall I quite enjoyed BG1 and BG2. In my eyes it was wortwhile journey. In this day and age it isn't masterpiece (especially when you recall some of most annoying fights - yes, i am talking about you liches and mindflayers), but it has hold against test of time quite well (even with that kind of graphics :D ).
If you want to enjoy how it feels like to play high level DnD (2e, but still), this game definitely will scratch the spot.

Whatever hours are in my Steam profile, feel free to add many more. I've had this game since launch on CDs, I've had this game in GOG, I have this game in Steam. I've played a good thousand hours, through tens of gameplays through the years.

Every RPG I play, I measure to this one (sadly few compare.)

I honestly find no faults with either BG1 or BG2, in my mind they are a masterpiece, and this is what makes them timeless:

+ The story. 

+ Choices with certain consequences.

+ The length (back in time when games didn't come with 20 DLCs you needed to buy to finish the story or play a full game.)

+ The characters and companions, the depth and their unique quests.

+ The many more years of life and replayability through thousands of released mods, ranging from the absolute must-have to the mediocre and everything in between. New quests, companions, romances, and adventures have kept this game alive for me for more than 20 years.

I really love whole journey from BG1 to SoD to BG2.. It is really special one that I will always remember very fondly. I also love the mods that community has made for Baldur's Gate games (and for Icewind Dale). Baldur's Gate Trilogy is very replayable. And I will always gonna enjoy doing another playthrough of Baldur's Gate Trilogy. I am very glad that I played this trilogy through and finished it long ago now for first time. i think Baldur's Gate Trilogy has one of the best writing in RPG history. It has good old BioWare magic. And I think, even if I didn't grow up with original versions of Baldur's Gate games, I think Enhanced Edition is the best way to experience this wonderful awesome D&D video game trilogy Baldur's Gate! i will admit that I had hard time getting into Baldur's Gate for first time around when I first time tried in 2017 but then I started Baldur's Gate again in few years later (also after when I also got really into D&D 5th Edition and had fun playing it with friends, and really got into lore of Forgotten Realms), and learn how to play Baldur's Gate and stuff. And I really started to enjoy playing Baldur's Gate. I think Baldur's Gate is one of the best Dungeons & Dragons video games ever made, and Baldur's Gate 2 is very awesome epic conclusion to the story! I really love this series! I love Baldur's Gate, Dungeons & Dragons and whole Forgottem Realms lore and world! It is truly magical and overall amazing! I highly recommend Baldur's Gate 1, and it's expansion Siege of Dragonspear and Baldur's Gate 2! I also recommend to check out mods from community has made, there are some cool quest mods and companions, EET and stuff which is nice and could enhance your another playthrough experiences!

It can be hard to learn a new game when you keep dying every two minutes! So, I have recycled my fighter character back to the beginning. I messed up so much, selling off stuff I need in the future, passing up opportunities, etc. I will say this: DO NOT sell anything with a name! Or weird ingredients. Or the most expensive gems. You will prolly live to regret it. I don't know how anybody can play this game and stay alive as a mage or rogue. Both my characters died repeatedly. It became very discouraging. So I figured out that this game was built with a Fighter class in mind, made one and I'm doing great. The AI for the non-focus character is a bit fussy. Be sure to fine tune it in the settings. Like, do you want you mage to die constantly or take a potion? Melee or ranged weapons? I just wish we could set them to cast spells, as it gets tedious to cycle from magic user to magic user to cast the spells each round. Typically, I only do that for bosses now. It just takes too long. I'm on my third character, but the first two didn't finish the 1st part.

In my personal opinion the two games should be taken together and you're losing out on a nice bit of lore not only about yourself as the character but the world as a whole if you've chosen to skip forward to this installment. Though you can RP it in game as having amnesia,  I'd highly recommend choosing to play through BG1 before you touch this game, if not for the story, then to just get a general understanding of how to actually play this game mechanically, because it only gets more complex from BG1.

That being said, Baldur's Gate 2 is much like Baldur's Gate 1 in terms of storytelling, following the character referred to in canon as ""Gorion's Ward"" through the land of Amn and other outlying regions in the southern Sword Coast of Forgotten Realms fame. You find yourself imprisoned by a mage named Irenicus and spend the majority of the game chasing him down for various reasons that would spoil points of the story in this near 20 year old game. 

This game is obviously an old title, and getting into it can be difficult for those who are used to something like Skyrim or Borderlands being the main games you think of when you think of ""Roleplaying"", but getting past the jank of this ancient masterpiece can lead to some very interesting storylines and characters, as well as a very satisfying conclusion to the storylines from the previous installment. One main critique of Baldur's Gate 2 is that the story feels much more rushed than it did in the original Baldur's Gate, at least in the earlier chapters. In Baldur's Gate 1 the main questchain was relegated to being just about yourself running from and fighting an ominous threat that you know very little about until later into the story, meanwhile Baldur's Gate 2 feels like they light a fire underneath you to get a move on. This isn't a bad thing but it does result in a different feel from the first game.

Overall the expansion content, Throne of Bhaal, feels just like Siege of Dragonspear did in BG1's Enhanced Edition release. It feels rushed and tacked onto a story that had a good conclusion already at the end of the main game. What sets this above Siege of Dragonspear, however, is that this story expansion feels better written, and due to the successor to this game being set 100 years in the future, decides to keep the story mode as a definitive end to Gorion's Ward's overarching storyline, rather than having to explain why the start of the second game with a completely unrelated campaign like Siege of Dragonspear did. Ultimately, Throne of Bhaal sets up what they're trying to do and then finishes it in a short enough time. It's a nice victory lap for Gorion's Ward to go through, even if the storyline that it follows was mostly finished in Baldur's Gate 1.",1680645136,1680645136,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Baldurs gate 2 was the game that made DnD kinda popular, and the enhanced edition is the penultimate Version of Baldurs gate 2.
Although plagued by an older DnD rule set, Baldurs gate 2 stays addicting.
What makes this game so great is its charme, decent story,and complex combat system. 
Especially the charme is what made Baldurs gate 2 famous. Charme, that is expressed through every and each dialogue line, through the convervasations with youre companions, enourmous amounts of humour, kind of Cheesey dialogue. 
This game has side quests which are sometimes as good as the main story.
But there are downsides to this game.
You will need a lot of hours to get used to the combat system, and it will cost a lot of patience to actually read dialogue, because most of it wasnt voiced.

Do you like fantasy?

Let's focus on the good: the game's opening 30ish hours are the materials of legends. Chapter 1 starts with your character tortured by the snarling wizard Irenicus and is made up of your careful attempts to break free from his prison. You break free only to find yourself in the city Athkatla with Irenicus tailing you. Chapter 2 then starts with a simple but effective hook: both Irenicus and your half sister Imoen are arrested for using magic illegally. Someone tells you that they can get Imoen for a price. He asks for 20,000 gold. Get adventuring.

I haven't asked around, but I image that when people think of BG2 in glowing terms, they're thinking of this part. Athkatla is dense with NPCs pulling you to one quest or another, which either play out in the city or take you to the surrounding regions of Amn. The quests vary from ""free a keep taken over by an evil army"" to ""find out what's up with that weird orb"" and are always baseline good enough to be worth seeking out, and frequently much better. The main plot is fully on hold but here we get to understand Amn as a region and the companions we choose to party with. The best part is that the 20,000 gold is actually fairly easy to get, so you could move on whenever you want to. You explore for exactly as long as you want.

The game keeps going on, involving a bunch of scenarios and locales, and it does overstay its welcome a bit. Part of this involves perhaps one too many diversions into plot-unrelated cities. There's good stuff here, but it feels like it could have been great stuff if it wasn't stuffed awkwardly here and allowed to breathe perhaps in a different game. At least part of this also is because I don't think Irenicus is actually too strong of a villain. He certainly has the presence, but his motivations feel trite and much of the end of the game center on the motivations. I honestly liked Saverok's whole ""if I become the CEO of Raytheon then technically I'd be responsible for like, a bunch of murders"" plan from Baldur's Gate 1 better. I think on the whole that, while BG2 has some very high peaks, the first game might be the superior of the two.

Throne of Bhaal in an entirely different affair and this should be understood as a review fully separate BG2's base game. My understanding is that ToB was originally Baldur's Gate 3, but was stripped back and made into an expansion instead. This can be felt in the plot, which feels rushed and trades a good villain for a baffling one ([spoiler]Balthazar responding to the ""you're even worse than I am"" line with a ""yea that's why I'm gonna kill myself after this"" was probably the quickest a villain won me over, so it's a shame he immediately dies and is replaced by the did-they-think-this-is-a-twist-because-it-was-obvious villain Melissan[/spoiler]). Enemy encounters also become a drag; you're comically high in level in this expansion, so frequently a dungeon will just drop like 30 spiders on you and call it a day. Something the expansion does not skimp on however is the mood, which feels apocalyptic in scope as you hurtle toward godhood. The stripped down content actually leads to a really interesting idea that ToB ultimately centers on: godhood must suck. Having so much power means that you can no longer act subtly, so all your actions must be big swings. Everyone knows your face, and their expectation of you colors how they act around you. The trees of opportunity does not grow but rather is pruned. Ultimately, everything is funneled down to a point and then at the end of the world there's a binary choice: become god, or don't. I didn't have trouble deciding what I wanted to do. Throne of Bhaal can be messy, and its writing perhaps the weakest in the series, but it manages to find an idea and end on it, creating a suitable ending for this entire saga.

Also worth noting how much of what I wrote about ToB also applies to Mass Effect 3. Perhaps the problems with that game were less about content and more about genre. Maybe Bioware never really stopped writing tales of the Sword Coast and just reskins the models. I'm not sure, that seems like a thought larger than I can think through right now.

Edit: A day out, a feel a little worse about ToB. I hold by what I said about mood, but the writing isn't just weak, it's actively bad. It's the ending, which I praised up above, also requires some barely explained mechanics that seem to fully trivialize the game before it [spoiler]because if Solar could move Bhaal's essence from person to person and safely disperse it, then why did any of this have to happen? Balthazar must be fuming in the afterlife[/spoiler]. Ultimately my feelings on it are weird and sour. I agree with my earlier praise of its tone and themes, but that stands in the middle of a poorly written and deeply unfun campaign. I don't think it can save the game.",1680060892,1680130096,True,0,0,0.472222238779067993,0,True,False,False

Thinking back on the turn of the century, it certainly felt like the golden age of gaming. We were soaring to greater heights and the bar was raised every year with new groundbreaking titles. It was an era that came to define gaming, and I loved every moment of it.

BG1 struck my existence me like an asteroid, it was immense and lasting. For me it was the catalyst into the realms of D&D and made RPGs my go-to genre. It was true love and nothing could possibly top it... then BG2 happened. No form of diction exists in me to put into words something that would bring justice at how much this game means to me. The nostalgic memories of a child playing on a school night until the sun rises, just because one more hour wasn't enough. The hours spent rolling new characters, being glued to a creation system that was just that engrossing. Lines of dialogue that survived the decades, fresh in my memory and always on the tip of my tongue, ready to be repeated.

Time has passed, but legends never die. I bought the Enhanced Edition with expectations riding high, but climbing back into that familiar seat and taking old faithful out for a spin melted away the years. I was taken right back in time, back to the old computer study room, stressing over my poor time management skills, at least I no longer have to worry about being late for school though.

[b] Pros [/b] 
[list]
    [*] A beautifully crafted world with quests and events that will last well within hundreds of hours of gameplay
    [*] Characters so memorable they will stick with you for many years
    [*] Gameplay and mechanics masterfully built from the 2nd Edition D&D ruleset that translates a complicated system into something easily understood while keeping the depth
[/list] 

[b] Cons[/b] 
[list]
    [*] If you're a Baldur's Gate purest, then perhaps the additions brought in by Beamdog might not sit right with you

The game is fantastic. The enhanced editions add a few creature comforts, the new content is notably not as good as the originals, but you can mostly avoid it. It's good, just not on par with the original release and the same can be said for Throne of Bhaal, which is just a mad rush for more and more power. 

Baldur's Gate 2 is a masterpiece in my approximation.It is phenomenally good. I have played through the game perhaps 15 times. The different party combinations and NPC's makes the game extremely repayable. The NPC's are incredible and you quickly fall in love with them. 

The game has also has a great character creation system and depending on how you build your character and party, the game can either be a cake walk, or you can really struggle to defeat otherwise simple enemies.

I highly recommend this game to anyone wanting to see what sparked kicked off the role-paying revolution.

I played Baldur's Gate II when it released in 2000, and I've been searching for over 20 years for another game that can match its depth in character creation, combat mechanics, encounter design, itemization, quest quality, lore, replayability, and fun factor.

I've played everything from AAA games down to the buggiest, jankiest indie trash you can imagine. I was let down by NWN2, Dragon Age: Origins, Divinity: Original Sin, and Pathfinder: Kingmaker. I even kickstarted Wasteland 2 and Pillars of Eternity for hundreds of dollars each, desperate to throw money at anything with a chance of recreating the BGII magic. Both, of course, ended in disappointment.

I always end up coming back to BGII for another playthrough. There simply isn't another game like it -- it's lightning in a bottle that will likely never be recreated.

The Enhanced Edition adds a few nice things over the original. This game is 100% playable in 2023 -- no need to hold your nose for clunky game mechanics, it plays perfectly.

On top of that, there are 20 years of mods accumulated to further enhance its playability and tweak it to your liking.

The progression is clearly not as free as it is in the first game resulting in a chaotic overall rythm.
However, if you manage to get rid of that first (yet stout) impression, you'll discover the best adventure game ever. (I know it's a RPG but imo it nails the adventure part better than anything else. Also I include the first game background in this definition of best adventure ""game"" ever since the second one starts litteraly weeks after the end of BG1)

You definitely need to play the first game before playing this one, but you also definitely need to play the second game since it takes the story of the Gorion's ward to a whole other level (which is kinda ironic since how strongly the antagonist steals the show, nonetheless the DLC confirms what I was saying first)
Compared to the first game, the story and the characters development are by far way more succeded, the environments are deeply varied, the covered topics are more mature and the bestiary is more developped since it focuses on the high levels of a DnD campaign (for better and for worse)
The antagonist takes a large place, and his success is definitely carried by the amazing voice acting by David Warner (RIP)

Still I enjoy the first game more, but Baldur's Gate II is unavoidable. It gained and kept the reputation of the best PC game of all time for decent reasons: first it's overwhelming in a bad way, but then it becomes overwhelming in the best way it could.

Also: Jaheira is the most badass character ever and it's not arguable, please put some respect on that druid she's having a bad time.",1677983788,1677983788,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There I played through quite faithfully but ultimately, in the overextended, unnecessarily complicated Boss fight I slipped into Easy Story Mode- where if your party loses health they don't die and when the fighting is over slowly regain full health.

Now on to BG2 Shadows of Amn . The focus of the Main Quest is lost and we transit from area to area, each having its layers, levels, underground cities, new sorts of creatures, new pointless quests - lots and lots of all the detailed questy, fighty new monstery, suffery new magicky, ally with new racesey, new everythingy bits. We get lost in the forest of details and wonder - oh no! the exit is not on this level - then where is it? Do we keep looking or refer to a walkthrough or double back to that tomb we left behind or what ????

So after only a few Chapters I slipped into Easy Story Mode and all the traps, magics, vampires, trolls, ogres, ghasts, drows, skeletons, fish, wolves, guards and so on became super easy to negotiate/kill.  Some of the tedium and grinding vanished. The fact that the main quest was not clear became unimportant and then it only became click and check the map, click and check the walkthrough, and click again and even then each chapter took 5 hours.

I love that they have kept the original ingame and intro cinematics instead of the disappointing sketches they replaced the first game with (just watch those videos on youtube).

This game lacks the scaling of tension and wonder of adventure that made the first game so magical. But, in fairness, this is a high-level adventure game where the challenges and monsters are supposed to be harder to overcome. This game still has the wonderful feel that makes this series to characteristic. I highly recommend playing a character through the first game, then through the Siege of Dragonspear DLC, then importing that character into BG2. As the first game, this one has a mix of audio and text dialogue (although maybe a bit more speech than the first game), and I wonder if this is because I felt spoiled with spoken dialogue in Siege of Dragonspear (where I felt almost all dialogue was spoken), but this is natural as Siege of Dragonspear was a newer DLC that was made to newer standards.

As always, I feel that a set maximum of six group members is a bit restrictive, and would love to have a limit of 7 or 8 members (for the diversity and the fun of character dialogue), but as the experience points are divided between the members of the party, it would lead to stagnation of level advance. I love that these old classics still follow the AD&D 2nd edition ruleset; my all-time favourite roleplaying game system.

Baldur's Gate 2 is an interesting experience, especially now, some twenty years after it was released. On one hand, it's one of the most mechanically obtuse games I've ever played. It would be kind to describe Advanced Dungeons and dragons as ""difficult to get into"" and this game really proves it. I'm not even sure it's possible to complete the game without a mage in your party - there are many encounters where some opposing demon or mage has some hellishly powerful protective magic and you need to choose the one counter-magic (and it is always magic) that will undo it from dozens of options. It can make things extremely frustrating and I highly recommend checking wikis to find out what variety of obscure protection a problematic foe is using. The main downside of this is that it felt, to me, like you really needed to have certain people in your party - and that you can be harshly punished for choices you made long ago (even an entire game ago if you imported your Baldur's Gate 1 save).

However, I do not mean to give the impression that the mechanical difficulty and unfairness is a flaw. Instead, it is one of the ways that this game delivers its high drama. You are enabled and encouraged to use every dirty trick you can think of - and to do research to discover the dirty tricks you can't think of on your own. Your opponents are NOT playing fair and there is no reason for you to do so. This is a game where you move through the higher levels in AD&D and you really feel like you are fighting with creatures of rarefied power (and becoming one yourself).

All of this challenge supports legendarily inventive writing. This game has a reputation for treating the player like an adult and its a reputation it deserves. I won't spoil anything, because the surprises are a lot of fun, but the game constantly feels unpredictable, inventive, and interested in letting you make decisions. There are so many inventive, unexpected characters and scenarios and events that it makes many modern games feel mundane and blase by comparison. Playing this game will make you ask why other games aren't giving you interesting choices, why they seem so obsessed with boring, wrote characters and scenarios. Why they can't find more interesting ways to tell familiar stories.

If you are here, there's probably some question in your mind about the ""Enhanced Edition"". People will tell you that you can mod the original game and fix most of its problems and they aren't lying - but maybe they are smoothing over the truth. Running a 20 year old game has some challenges that are just *a pain* and there are some engine problems the mods can't fix. This version of the game really is a smoother, easier experience for only $10 more. It's a bargain and the developers, who can be forgiven for not quite having the same writing chops as the people who wrote one of the best RPGs of all time, deserve your money and support.

I cannot recommend this game more strongly. It's an all-timer.",1675365669,1675365669,True,24,1,0.74880605936050415,0,True,False,False

Beamdog have, after many updates, added enough for me to stand by their version. The ability to zoom out and see far more of the world is a great feature. I also like the addition of achievements. Various items have had a face lift and help to better blend the slightly jarring style of ToB with BG2.
A few ease of life enhancements in regard to item stacking and therefore carrying capacity are also most welcome although they could have taken this much further.

Unfortunately the big addition of the four new companions and their side quests is still a sore point.
The worst part is their script writing and dialogue. It's childish, devoid of any charm and at odds with that of the original. Likewise many of the new locations look more in keeping with the artistic style of the first Baldur's Gate.
Unless you really want a wild mage, a monk, or another evil companion I would advise you to just pretend that Neera, Rasaad, Dorn and Hexxat don't exist.

Even after all that time, it's still one of the best CRPGs ever made. Is uses the Infinity Engine which defined CRPGs for generations. If you like CRPGs, you have to play BG2.

BG2 uses AD&D (D&D 2nd Ed.) which means that lower (and more negative) numbers are better to hit and for your AC. After 2nd edition D&D inverted that system, but you have to deal with THAC0 (To Hit AC Zero) in BG2. Just remember that ""-10 THAC0"" is REALLY good just like ""AC -10"" is REALLY good. Otherwise, the story is great and epic. Lots of companions and side quests. Plenty of challenging and interesting opponents. And you'll encounter most of the ""iconic"" kinds of foes you expect in D&D.

Baldur's Gate 1 is the ""level 1-7"" part of the story, but isn't required to play this game. You can get through BG1 in a few hours to keep up with the story and transition your character from BG1 to BG2, but it's not required to fully enjoy the game.

The first game in my quest to become a grave robber, digging up old RPG's and stealing all their best story ideas for my own TTRPG campaigns. It's worth mentioning I only started this journey because I played D:OS 2 and was so enthralled by it that I had to play more CRPGs, so if you haven't played D:OS 2, lets be real though you have, who hasn't, then go play it now. It's also worth mentioning that I went into this without playing Baldur's Gate 1, because from reviews and videos I gathered that BG1 was more about gritty combat and exploration and BG2 was more about grand story, which is what I'm more into. So I bought the game on Kinguin, because its just an easier version of switching your steam country to Russia and waiting for sales... Yes I'm a bad person, I know. And I opened up the game. Without hesitation I was sure this game was [i] classic [/i]. I mean for gods sake's it starts with a dungeon escape, followed by a friend getting kidnapped, with an evil elf turned ultimate wizard as the big bad guy. Like I said [i] classic [/i]. But before any of that, I got stuck on character creation. Picking a class, picking a race, picking a picture, picking spells, the list goes on. The craziest part was that this is that I reckon this is a fairly small character creator compared to pathfinder. But yeah I spent more than an hour on my beautiful creation, which ended up being the timeless, the magnificent, the malevolent KRUKINDLE. The Chaotic Neutral character I play in every RPG I get the opportunity to do so in. Apart from when I played as Shrek in Pathfinder Kingmaker. And then I entered the world... To be introduced to one of my favourite villains ever: Jon Irenicus. I find his whole character so great for a villain, his confidence, his power, his humanity. They add up to a character who is much more than just a machine trying to chase and kill you. And his whole arc was just super satisfying to me. And then there's all the companions, well, mostly just Minsc. Minsc and Boo. From the first dialogue I knew I was going to love that character, and his cries to 'Go for the eyes!' never got old, so I'm looking forward to see what Matt Mercer can do with the role in the upcoming Baldur's Gate 3. Leaving Irencus's Dungeon and exploring Athkatla I was pleasantly surprised that you could enter every building with a door, a technology so ahead of its time not even the most modern games have implemented it. And inside each building I was even happier to find interesting and unique interiors with detailed NPC's, quests, and marketplaces, in every nook and cranny. Another technology far ahead of its time. The graphics themselves are admittedly bland in the city, and you can definitely get lost in the first few hours, with a lot of the streets having the same textures and bland colours. But even taking a wrong turn will only have you land by an interesting quest. Some of my favourites including the tracking down of a moon cult, the killing of a shadow dragon, and hunting down a serial killer. There is a part of me that wishes they had been more clearly land-marked that I hadn't only discovered them at super high level, but then again that would have taken away from the journal system of questing which I do so enjoy. As for the main quest it was really awesome. There were a couple of things I did see coming, and a couple that I didn't, and I loved them all the same. I wasn't such a big fan of Brynnlaw, for the same reason most people weren't such big fans of Guarma, although I did enjoy the change in setting as well as the characters in the asylum. While the same thing sort of applied to the [spoiler] underdark [/spoiler] it bothered me a lot less because the theme was so impressive. That whole area of the game had some of the coolest vibes IMO, although it also had some of the absolutely toughest fights for me as an underleveled party. The whole game made me appreciate modern RPG's so much more, being able to see a lot of their influences and designs in this game.

[h1]Graphics & Sound: 6/10[/h1]
[h1]Narration: 7/10[/h1]

✔️ A solid enough follow-up to a pretty nice game. If you fully enjoyed Baldur's Gate 1, Baldur's Gate 2 should be to your taste.
✔️ The narration clearly gets better in the second game, with a lot more depth both to the central narration and the companions.
✔️ Higher levels allow to explore an arsenal of abilities far wider than the first game.

💭 The exploration gets quite more linear, especially in Throne of Bhaal. Not necessarily a bad aspect - I enjoyed the more focused narration it allowed - but some people might dislike it.
💭 The plot and stakes get terribly high over the course of the game. Again, not necessarily bad, but also a strong change of tone as compared to Baldur's Gate 1, which can displease some players.
💭 The game is LONG. If you found Baldur's Gate 1 long, well, brace yourself.

❌ As you rise to the highest levels the feeling of progression tends to disappear since you barely unlock anything to the end.
❌ The game suffers from most of the same issues as Baldur's Gate 1 does, and amplifies some - especially the presence of a lot of ""fodder"" battles that take time, aren't interesting, and just consist in watching your characters do the work - and at the same time several highly random difficult battles that you'll have to retry several (or a lot of) times before you are able to win them.
❌ Just like Baldur's Gate 1, the game suffers from a huge lack of clear information, which leads you to either die & retry repeatedly, or check wikis regularly with the high risk of getting some plot spoiled because the information isn't separated correctly there (and still die & retry a bit because of the random nature of the game).

Overall I would recommend this game to someone who enjoys an old-school high fantasy story, with an RPG progression wrapped over it, but beware that the game can take a lot of time, most of which is filled with pretty unsatisfying (in my opinion) combat.",1641686830,1673454929,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some games have come close, but I have upwards of 300 games across all my gaming platforms and to this day I've never played a game I liked more than this one. If you're an RPG fan, you owe it to yourself to play this game; although, I do recommend playing BG 1 before as the magic system and other core mechanics may be over your head if you skip the first.",1672559627,1672559627,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

* story
* open world - do what you want and when you want and the way you want (within limits of course)
* lots of side quests that are rewarding
* re-playability potential
* interesting character related quests
* dialogs are often well through and contain humor, quite often additional options are available based on charater's stats

What is bad:
* the game has no introduction whatsoever. If you don't know what is THAC0 and other things and how to counter certain spells - you will have hard time in the game
* ballance - it does not exist. You don't even know if you are ""powerful enough"" to continue the main story line and later you might struggle a lot because of that
* random at the core - from hits and misses up to learning new spells and sleeping praying that the enemies don't show up. It is just unnecessarily punishing and often loading the save to do the same fight with the same actions will lead you to different outcome.
* quite often the enemies are scripted to appear in places which have been cleared out before - not cool
* my character model bugged out after I ressurected her (Aerie). The model became a rotating flying piece of meat. Before you start writing the answer - no, she wasn't torn to pieces. I wouldn't be able to ressurect here in that case. I tried different options from killing her again and ressurecting again up to quitting the game and restrating, but it just couldn't help it. The piece of meat wouldn't move although the game whould show Aerie as resurrected and full hp. So midgame I had to dump my character I've been building and get a new one.
* the game just throws all sorts of shit at you in such quantities and in such moments that it just feels not fun. Unless you are well know with the DnD mechanics and what dispells what and which skill is better be picked at what time in the game - you will likely struggle a lot from mid game until the end.
* each chapter had a punishing bump to complexity. It was just ridiculous how powerful the enemies in the Underdark and the Illithids were compared to the enemies from the previous chapter. And you gotta either try to hack it - for example by setting a bunch of traps before encounter and then luring the enemy into them, or come up with some other approaches. It just quickly makes it a chore rather than a smooth experience. It ruins fun when the quest is ""oh we dug a hole in the ground and found a demon - kill it and then I'll let you move on with your quest line"". And then you find out some uber demon saying ""Gingle bells"" at your face before decapacitating it with one hit.
* in the main city your enemies are allowed to use spells, which they generously do, but if you use any spell - cowled wizards will appear to kick your ass. Please help me find logic in it.
* enemy AI mages can spam their spells all they want and AI enemies in general often appear pre-buffed. But you have to rest, hope that no shit appears over the night (hope again, and again and again and oh yes, finally, you are lucky and you rested and can use spells again). And then you encounter the enemies, get your ass beat cause you didn't know what to expect in the first place and then good luck figuring out the strategy and hope you have the spells that help.
* some characters are just kinda weird. Like this warrior with a hamster. Just feels too old to even be funny to me tbh. It feels like they were trying too hard to make characters drastically different.
* inventory is incredibly small for the amount of items you discover
* you have to go and read the wiki to figure out why you are so bad. Eg: certain bosses only take damage from the weapons that are +N enchanted. I expect the game to either not have such logic at all or lead me towards it, maybe give some hints. When the enemy requires +5 minimum weapon to get hit and you haven't even seen one in the game at all - then there is a problem with the game design.
* friendly AI absent entirely. Unless I missed some configuration, in Baldurs Gate 1, my AI was actively trying to heal the other characters or to apply certain spells when they are useful. Here - you just have to do it yourself. And it becomes as ridiculous as having all of your 5 characters standing doing nothing while being hit by nearby melee enemies waiting for you to click on one to command them to attack it. Or being knocked down - they just keep laying down until you click them and command to do something. If you have a rogue, then you have to manually trigger them to look for traps after each fight. That's just annoying to do.

Based on my overall feeling, I think I am more leaning towards not recommending this game. I liked Baldurs Gate 1 because the experience wasn't as punishing and the obstacles and enemies were more balanced. I didn't even have to use cheat keys a single time. Here in Baldur's Gate 2 I just couldn't go past the final boss in the main game and Throne of Bhaal DLC was even another step up complexity wise. Sometimes with bosses being even weaker than the enemies encountered during the storyline that is leading to the boss (like Yaga-Shura)

Mostly I am not recommending this game because all the old mechanics and randomness. The story was decent and there is plenty of fun stuff to find while exploring. Lots of humor as well. But as you play the game you just start hating it and eventually start asking yourself why do you even keep playing it.

For DnD table top players - could be fun. For regular players who never played a table top game - you might not enjoy it.",1672543607,1672544264,False,3,1,0.445945948362350464,4,True,False,False

But let's not talk about sad things. I would like to briefly dwell on some features of the game that can attract or scare away a new audience that is not yet familiar with the Forgotten Realms universe.
First of all, I want to note that the review is intended to a greater extent for new players, and not for veterans who have gone through the main story more than once.
Well, if you have never heard of this game and by the will of fate got to this page — the information is for you.
First of all, you should understand that the original game was released a very long time ago. The first game was released back in 1998, the second — in 2001. Accordingly, the game is a so-called old-school action RPG with an active pause. Old school in this case incorporates both positive and negative (for a number of people) moments.
Assistance to the player from the game system is minimal: spells cause damage to allies, so a random cast can multiply the lives of party members by zero. There are no quest markers — you will have to carefully read the quests if there is no desire to get into a situation of ""blind wandering"" around the world. The characters are dying. And they do not fall ""unconscious"", but seriously die. You have to resurrect them in temples if you do not have a cleric with the appropriate spell in your arsenal, or a scroll. And if the game takes place on high difficulty, then death can end in the destruction of the body so much that resurrection will not be possible and the character will die forever, you will have to load if such an outcome is undesirable.
Inventory is limited by slots and weight, arrows are spent when shot. And magicians do have a limited number of spell slots for a conditional game day, which will not allow turning them into a death machine, non-stop pouring fire on enemies, even at high levels — at some point, the prepared spells will run out and you will have to ""rest"" in order to regain access to them. A lot of reading is required :) For players more accustomed to the current trends in the RPG genre, this may seem like an unnecessary complication. However, if such moments do not scare you away, I strongly advise you to familiarize yourself with the game.
Moreover, if you have never played, you should start from the first part. Both games are one story, where the second directly continues the first. Of course, it is possible to start playing immediately from the second part, but in this way you will deprive yourself of a huge part of the story and it is unlikely that you will fully experience the rise and fall of the protagonist, whose role you will play.
The game is a party RPG, which means that you have to control several (up to 6) characters at the same time. At the same time, it is not necessary to play with the largest possible group, you can even play with one character if you ""grow up"" the corresponding hero. At first, playing with fewer heroes may seem more difficult, but over time, they can outperform a full party in combat capability — the experience here is divided by the number of characters in the group, and is not issued as a fixed value for all.
Mages, warriors, thieves, monks — the game provides a wide field for experimentation, and if you like to think through leveling in advance, test combinations of many classes / skills, choose spells to cast from a wide list of spells — the game will definitely not disappoint you.
If tactical difficulties do not excite you, you can play the game on a low difficulty level, which will allow you to easily win battles of any complexity, focusing on the story. Which I would not advise doing — the game is a port of D&D and is heavily focused on battles.
At the same time, the story should not leave you indifferent — it does not shine with narrative delights a la Planescape Torment, but no less interesting. there is a lot of text here, and the feeling of ""narrative impotence"" does not arise throughout the entire narrative. At least it was interesting for me to replay the game and read the dialogues with the characters every few years, despite the fact that I remembered the main dialogues quite well. Although all this is individual, of course.

Summarizing: a lot can be said about the game. the game is multifaceted, but all this will result in a huge ocean of text, which is unlikely to be read by anyone here.
Why did I write all this? I wanted to express my commitment to the title, with which I have many wonderful memories from my childhood/early youth, and once again remember how wonderful it was. I played most of the time in the original BG 1/2, as well as in the BG Trilogy project, so please do not evaluate the amount of time spent according to steam statistics.
If you decide to dive into this story, I recommend that you familiarize yourself with the guides for beginners, because. many things may not be clear at first sight. At a minimum, it's worth understanding what thac0 is and why a negative armor value is better than a positive one.
I definitely advise you to purchase both parts of the game, if you are a beginner and have never played BG, you are not afraid of ""old school"" and you want to immerse yourself in the world of interesting and rather complex game mechanics. If you are attracted by a fascinating plot and stories of the forgotten realms of the good old time-tested model!",1671492842,1671492842,True,15,0,0.657435417175292969,0,True,False,False

My video reviews of the game and its expansion:

My written review of the game:

The story is pretty good, filled with exciting moments and twists, but even that wouldn’t make me play the game if it was not for the great combat challenges it offers. There is a huge variety of enemies and if you’ve never played the game before, you won’t always be ready for every situation. Luckily with a bit of research of spells and potions, you should still be able to get out of most battles alive. And if some of your companions die, you can usually resurrect them during a fight or after.  

I really enjoyed the game’s music and voice acting. Some of the soundtracks are still playing in my head even a few weeks after finishing the game and the same counts for some voice lines of the more famous companions like Minsc with his hamster Boo. ""Go for the eyes, Boo. GO FOR THE EYES! RrraaaAAGHGHH!!!""

Baldur’s Gate II is not a perfect game. My biggest complaints would be companions getting stuck in each other at narrow places, because everytime the levels get many long and narrow places, it feels like a never ending struggle to get your team through it. Even worse when you get ambushed in that kind of environment. Your spellcasters won’t be able to fall back and with the little amount of health and protection they have, they will die in a second before you will even manage to unstuck them and send them to the backline.

Then there is the problem with the extreme amount of side quests in chapter 2. I am talking about around 70 hours of side questing if you want to finish everything available to you before making some moves in the main story. I get why they made it that way. There is not really much space for side quests in the next chapters because of how the story is structured compared to the first game where you could do them almost anytime. And they probably wanted to offer us a lot of side stories, companion missions and other special encounters.

The quest list is absolutely terrible. In aforementioned chapter 2 you have so many quests and you can’t even hide the finished ones. Then there are the quests which you can’t finish anymore, because of some decisions you made and when they are not even marked as finished and they don’t disappear, it gives you a false hope that you can still do something about them.. The quests list is so messy and chaotic. The only thing which can make it better is to move to the next chapter where you start with a clear quest list for that chapter. You can still look back at older quests and you can still work on them, but at least you don’t have to watch the mess every time you open your journal.

The game still has bugs. If your companions leave and never come back, don’t wait around for them too long, look it up and try to find a solution. In my situation I was supposed to be approached by someone but it didn’t happen because the person got stuck on some roof. Another time I got stuck in a dungeon where a door should unlock after a fight and it didn’t happen. Luckily I saved the game right before the fight so I didn’t have to replay too much of the game.   

I enjoyed Baldur’s Gate II a lot, even more than the first Baldur’s Gate. I enjoy playing  older games once in a while. It can be a valuable experience to play games like Baldur’s Gate. To see how roleplaying games were back then compared to how the new ones are now. I recommend Baldur’s Gate II to everyone who is interested in playing an older rpg with a lot of attention to detail, deep stories and a fair amount of complexity. It can be a bit hard to get into especially if you are not familiar with D&D rules at all. Because of that but not only for that reason I recommend starting with Baldur’s Gate I. That game has a bit slower start and it has a tutorial where you can learn the basics. It’s also where the story begins. You can even import your character to the second game then together with a few specific items.

This is the first time I've played since the original came out so it's also my first time playing the Enhanced Edition. Everything seems to work well enough - no fiddling to get it to run on modern computers (I have Windows 11 right now).

I""m going to say it: I'm the odd one who prefers the low level adventures of BG 1 - especially now with the Enhanced Editions porting the changes BG 2 made (i.e. things like kits) back into BG 1.  It felt like a real adventure where danger was around every corner and levels really mattered. In BG 2, you get assaulted with numerous quests as soon as you get out of the starting dungeon and it's really jarring even if you don't have to do them right away.

I know people like BG 2 companions because they have more personality, but IMO it's not really a good thing (especially since you can install mods to add personality to BG 1 companions). As a good-aligned character, I didn't really feel like most companions really were for the good cause. In BG 1, you had Yeslick, Coran, Kivan, Minsc, Imoen, and Khalid who would all say praises at high Reputation. What do you have in BG 2?  Anomen who whines even if you pass his test to make him LG (and he still talks about how he can't believe how my party is successful). Imoen is missing most of the game and does nothing, but whine about her experiences (as if your character hasn't suffered either).  Aerie is fine... if she isn't complaining about her wings (and didn't level too slow for a 6 person party). Really, the only good aligned characters that seem to approve of good deeds are Nalia, Mazzy, Keldorn, and Minsc.  Yet, I can't take Keldorn after his sidequest because it felt wrong, and I'm something of a power gamer so I won't take Minsc or Mazzy (just not the best) classes.  That pretty much leaves Nalia as the only good-aligned character who approves of your actions, but she needs help with her thief abilities because she dual-classed to soon.

That's not getting into the Enhanced Edition additions.  I don't really hate them to the degree a lot of people did.  Though I only really experienced Neera (who quickly becomes one of the strongest mages once she gets improved Chaos Shield and can cast the level 1 Reckless spell which basically let's her cast any spell she knows (memorized or not) with little fear of wild surges.  Rasaad... was just bad.

My biggest issue is probably that the new stuff wasn't really needed.  BG 2 + ToB already is full of content so it didn't really all the new quests and such.  Although I did find Neera's interesting, but Rasaad's was as bad as his character.  For one, his quest is about avenging his brother's death by going after the killer, but if you do his quest in Siege of Dragonspear like I did, you will be confused as you know who the killer was and it isn't whoever it is they say in BG 2 so they basically retconned their own stuff.  Not to mention that for a good-aligned companion, it's very strange that the most rewarding path to completing the stuff in his quest... is killing everyone with no downside.  Plus, all of your dialog just makes it seem like you hold the idiot ball for no reason.

That's not to mention the bugs or whatever you can encounter.  The first annoying thing is that this has the worst pathfinding I've ever seen and everything i've read is that this was broken in the Enhanced Editions (and i don't remember the originals being so bad even if they weren't great).  Your characters take odd paths to the enemies or something just stop to wait for an enemy to get to them.  Sometimes they forget who they are supposed to be fighting. Worst of all is that your party gets stuck inside each other.  No joke, it can take like a minute to get through a door or leave an area because your characters bunch up and get stuck.

I was also unable to complete the game.  I'm not sure if it was due to mods (but I've pretty much use the same ones I used before and no one seems to have issues), but I can't get past Yaga-Shura in Throne of Bhaal. He starts off immortal and you are supposed to go to a temple, talk to a witch, go somewhere else to get his and her heart to make him mortal, take it back to her, go to fight Yaga-Shura where he's supposed to run away once he realizes he's now mortal and then come back with reinforcements so you can kill him. Only once i wound him to the point where he runs away, he never comes back. I've tried reloading various previous saves (like an experienced RPG gamer I keep multiples saves just in case of situations like that) and even tried going through without saving.  He never comes back with the reinforcements.  Sucks that I've basically completed everything (even Watchers Keep) and can't finish because Yaga-Shura won't return for me to kill.",1667440065,1667440065,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Regardless of any bugs or maybe a bit of artistic liberty with regards to adding enemies to boss fights, etc., I've got to say, these guys really enabled me to accomplish something I had always really wanted to do. I can't believe i beat the game, BG1, SoD, Bg2 and ToB all through with one character, and it worked swimmingly. There were a couple of quest bugs I had to debug but all in all, what an amazing experience.

Thank you Beamdog.


Update: EE version has some bugs, main questline was broken for me (did not recieve key in throne of bhaal for monastery) and various broken changes to townspeople AI, and HP boosts for random NPCs that are not in line with PnP. Also I understand ToB was meant to be difficult, but some of the boss fights just had kind of annoying/imba stuff emphasized, instead of increasing the difficulty of the fight in a more creative or fun way. I'm not going to get into specifics but, just adding more of the same enemy, when that enemy is unkillable, isn't a fun way to increase the difficult of a fight.

I do love beamdog, I do not believe they did a disservice to the series, but when I contact support and receive no response, I just don't see why I would recommend the title at that point. If there is no support and assistance with bugs then why not just buy the old title and tutu? It saves you having to always login to steam, mess with updates you may or may not want, etc.


This is just simply, hands down, one of the best RPG's of all time. It's the loved child birthed from the intellectuals at Black Isle. It's occasionally mercurial, but altogether a dark and meaningful title which I've come back to many times over the almost 20 years since I first played it.

Simply put:
The Plot: A long and twisting tale of power, revenge, and destiny, where the stakes continue to climb higher and you must confront what it means to truly be a Child of Bhaal. Will you succumb to the taint of evil, give in to the sweet taste of power, or will you accept your heritage and stand tall despite it?

The characters: Shadows of Amn's villains were certainly more memorable in their motives and personalities, though at the end of the day the climactic showdown at the end of ToB as my resources were utterly spent was the most epic fight I've had so far.
Your companions are beautifully written, in particular Viconia and Jaheira's respective arcs over the two campaigns see them grow as people to an extent I could not have dreamed in the first Baldur's Gate. Neera is a wonderful mix of chaotic, sweet, responsible, and vengeful, and the bond you forge with Minsc cannot possibly be overstated. Your loving step-sister Imoen is taken apart piece by piece, and she is a far more haunted figure than the carefree rogue of the first game.
Every single one of them was compelling, and I love them all dearly.

It continues nicely with the story from the first game, even letting you import your main character from the first game. The quests are interesting and packed densely into the game world; there are plenty of dungeons, puzzles, and secrets to be found around every corner. However, the game does somewhat reduce the scope of the game world in exchange for this increased density. I do not necessarily see this as a downside however, just a difference. For every three random quests in the first game that ended with a whimper and did little to develop the characters, there is now one quest that attempts to deliver a more intriguing story and generally succeeds at doing so. 

My primary negative critique with the game at this point is that it has crashed exactly twice for some reason, though I am not certain it is entirely the fault of the game. I just think it is worth mentioning since in all my many hours with Baldur's Gate 1 and its expansion Siege of Dragonspear, the game never crashed.

THE GOOD:

- A cast of phenomenal, dynamic characters of all alignments with destinies that carry over from the first game and oftentimes even lead into the game's epic finale, Throne of Bhaal.
- The antagonist of the first half of BG2, Jon Irenicus, is my vote for the coolest villain in gaming. Amazing voice acting, gripping writing, and the final battle with him is downright incredible.
- Sidequests are even further improved upon, and the higher level of play allows for an even greater variety of dungeons and combat situations.
- The voice-acting has improved tremendously from the first game.
- The music is some of the best of it's era.
- Character creation was already pretty fun in Baldur's Gate 1, but things blow up in the sequel. You're characters get loads of fun abilities to play with: wizards start going absolutely insane with pure power, barbarians can't die, rogue's kill everything in one stab, clerics save your ass around every corner, oh yeah baby it's high level D&D all over again.
- Despite the city of Baldur's Gate being the namesake of the series, Athkatla blows the pants off of it in terms of depth of intrigue. There is SO MUCH to do, so many people to talk to, good grief it's glorious.
- The main path of progression through the story has no low points. It is a high fantasy thrill-ride through-and-through.
- Seeing the events of the prophecy from BG1 finally unfold in the final act feels like witnessing, no, SPEARHEADING history. So much build-up, with so much more payoff.

THE BAD:

- The closer you get to the finale, the more your builds and party will be tested. Some classes fall off pretty steep, and while nothing ever becomes completely irrelevant (it is possible to solo this game with any class on any difficulty) you will definitely struggle without certain roles being filled.
- 2nd Edition D&D rules are still stupid.
- I wish the Strongholds did more.
- It's kinda a shame there wasn't more foreshadowing for the main antagonist of the game's second half, Throne of Bhaal.

Yeah that's about it for criticism; this game isn't perfect but it gets pretty damn close.

ADVICE FOR A NEW PLAYER:

- It's REALLY worth playing through the first game before Baldur's Gate 2. You can transfer your save file, and it has a lot of effects on the story and you also get to carry over some of your inventory. Also it's a damn good game.
- Mages go big mode in high level D&D and are kind of required to not get mulched by the lategame.
- Don't sleep on support casters either though (like Druids and Clerics).

As soon as I finished the first game at like, 2am, with bloody eyes that were practically begging me to get some rest and still reeling from the impact of the Siege of Dragonspear DLC, I jumped into the universe of this game and the adventures it would take me on in my beloved Faerun. I was so eager to discover how our dear Bhaalspawn's destiny would unfold, and curious about what struggles they would have to face, what frustrating injustices they would be subjected to. [b] Again. [/b] I was ready to devour almost everything the game could offer, from every quest and NPC, to every tiny letter I found lying around and books that hardly anyone would bother to glance at. If you asked me what I gained from reading the Book of King Strohm, really, there is nothing it contributed to my life in any way. But love can make you do a lot of things... 

Honestly, maybe that's just the sentimental value of this game clouding my judgment, but honestly, there's nothing I don't like about this game. That being said, you can always improve something but I'll get to that. If you're hopping onto this after the first game and have some knowledge about the Forgotten Realms lore and specifically, the story this campaign tells, you can more or less imagine what kind of a chaos you are about to find yourself in the middle of. So let's talk some history. During Time of Troubles, a conflicted period in the Realms as almost all the deities were forced to walk Faerun as mortals by Lord Ao's wish, the entire pantheon collapsed as the gods were stripped clean of their divine powers and portfolios. And Bhaal, God of Murder, was one of them. He was also one of the first victims of this turmoil as Cyric, the nice gentleman that he is, slayed Bhaal and therefore stole his powers. However, you cannot trick a trickster such as Bhaal that easily. The God of Murder had foreseen his death and impregnated mortal women from different races. Voila, the Bhaalspawn! In a nutshell, these games tell the tale of Bhaal's desperate attempts to return to Faerun through the mightiest of his children, and the conflicts between the benevolent Bhaalspawns and their brethren who have been led astray by such strong power. 

Now that our history lesson is over, let's take a look at the game mechanics, or as I'd like to call it: the Dice Gods. Baldur's Gate II, just like its prequel, makes great use of 2e features and rules of D&D. It's very rare to see 2e getting any recognition nowadays with the latest titles, so if you're more experienced with 3e and later, you may notice a few differences. Most of the lore that has been built up over the years for Forgotten Realms are not mentioned since the game takes place in 1369 DR (Dale Reckoning) and that's like a thousand of tendays inbetween! Character creation interface is quite rich with lots of options but I do think it could have been a whole lot richer. The races you can choose from are very limited when compared to titles like Neverwinter Nights and Icewind Dale (specifically the sequels) and overall the varied options Forgotten Realms truly offers. Which means that many of the details that could have easily made some areas and interactions much more fun and engaging to explore are not even allowed a chance. For an example, the feeling of discovering Ust Natha as a drow would have been much more interesting than a non-drow. 

To this day, Baldur's Gate II is still considered to be one of the best RPGs of all time and it aged like a fine wine. I can't put it into words just how much you have to play this, especially if you're an RPG enthusiast such as myself. It's definitely worth its price since it takes an awful lot of time to complete it and that's excluding the Throne of Bhaal storyline. So I hope you decide to give it a go and enjoy it as much as I did!

The hard work put into the original is what made the game great. the new content feels like someone's poor attempt at writing themselves into a great story, with little effort and understanding of what made the original story great, while forcing their views and values upon future readers and, taking credit for the whole thing...

While DKapple's post had a nifty title I think should be re-stated; Avoid Beamdog products at all costs. ""I rushed out and bought the ""enhanced"" versions of these same games without doing my due diligence, and so I refuse to believe that that 4 star rating is an actual representation of player satisfaction with the ""enhanced"" version of the games. ""Enhanced"" -- it turns out -- doesn't mean ""patched to fix bugs"" or ""updated to run on modern machines"" -- it also apparently means ""bland graphics and shoe-horning in characters and writing that never existed in the original games and were never meant tod"".

Like all Giant Space Hamsters, they were not naturally evolving creatures, but were instead created by gnomes originally from Krynn. Gnomes experimented with Giant Space Hamster breeding by mixing enchanted substances from a variety of monsters into the process, which produced several varieties of Giant Space Hamster. Among those, Miniature Giant Space Hamsters were one of the more unusual varieties.

These creatures were apparently quite intelligent and had the ability to talk in whispers, though most of the time they just made normal hamster squeaks. According to advertising brochures found in Sigil, they were gentle with children.

Before Dragon Age or Divinity, and between Action RPGs like Diablo and Elder Scrolls, Baldur's Gate hit that sweet spot of fantastic story-telling and a solid game engine (for its time).

To outline that latter point, there didn't exist a D&D game engine on PC before BG - this franchise pioneered PC RPGs of the modern era. Granted, the unit pathing can sometimes make StarCraft Dragoons start to feel good about themselves again, 
the Quest Log is...rudimentary,

I am posting this on both the review for this game, and the first in the series, Baldur's Gate: Enhanced edition.

I absolutely LOVE this game, and everything about it, and the other game in the series. I loved the combat, the UI was tight, everything was well-polished when Beamdog re-released the game. I was actually in the middle of a run through the entire game on the hardest difficulty with only the main character...

Before IT happened.

The update to Siege of Dragonspear affected both games, and it's been nothing but negative for me so far. I can no longer access the Command Console (used for fixing the many glitches that can happen here and there), the UI is buggy and, when it does work, is clunky and, frankly, ugly as sin itself. My saves have all disappeared into the wind, and my character's data has become ridiculously bugged (Level 34 at the tail end of Throne of Bhaal suddenly turning into a level 17 with all of the items from her run through BG1 and 2? What?) and more. 

Before now, I would have recommended this series in a heartbeat. This game, nearly two decades ago, defined and revived a dying RPG era. But now? Now it's nearly impossible to play. And, unfortunately, it was the fault of the people who brought it back in the first place.

--HOW BEAMDOG CAN FIX THIS--

-Implementation of the old character and save game formatting
-Option to use the old UI
-Option to turn the Console Command on and off IN GAME. The steps to do this in the first place were a nightmare in and of itself.

--Things that COULD help--
- Scale the difficulty levels back down a little. Insane difficulty jumped from enemies doing 50% more damage to 100%, and Legacy of Bhaal makes the game nearly unplayable.


As it stands right now? DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME. It pains me to say that (as you can no doubt see from my time in this game), but as it is right now, it's not worth any money.

*****EDIT 7/2/2022*****

It's been a long time since my initial review after the Siege of Dragonspear update. While I can say that the DLC is still very much not worth your money for what it is, I can say for certain that, as I have said in a comment below, it has gotten much better. Settings were introduced and added that allow you to play the game with as close to its classic UI as possible with a few added bells and whistles.

The UI is still ridiculously clumsy. This remaster doesn't provide the much needed quality of life improvements either.

The DnD formula is also not that great in a video game. Some classes are simply boring (fighters are auto attack bots).

Some combat encounters are poorly designed. Examples:
- The first two thirds of a dungeon are trivial, then a much harder encounter forces you to leave and return at a higher level)
- Trolls must be killed with fire/acid. Lore friendly but not fun when the game doesn't give you fire arrows first
- Too many early quests are actually suitable for higher levels. Sure, you can level first but not everyone wants to read a ton of dialogue for a quest that can be done only after more than 10 hours of gameplay. Quest placement and level progression are not tied correctly.

Story
  I feel like the story ended about as perfectly as a video game can.  Baldur's Gate 3 is not cannon in my book, unneeded and unwanted.  

Gameplay
  It feels glorious to be able to start off killing rats and become the Lord of Murder if you so chose by the end of it all.  I will say that the Underdark is a slog, but I'd say power through it.  If you can make it through the Underdark, the rest of the game is fairly easy to complete.  Throne of Bhaal is very quick to complete, I feel like it goes into the story very well.

Wish list
  If anything could be changed I wish modders would somehow make it possible for humans to dual class more than once.  I realize the name is dual class, meaning only two classes.  That said, people can change.  It would be interesting if a human could dual class as many times as desired.  Also, dual classing with classes like Paladin or Ranger and kits.  E.g. Start off as a Kensai kit for the Fighter Class, and dual class into the Assassin kit for the thief class.  Add on remove XP cap and you could take the game to absurd levels eventually in enough time.  Especially if a way could be figured out a way to ensure each class could use epic level abilities.  If a character could dual class in the same character class with different kits that could be interesting.
  Would that be entirely broken?  Sure.  Why not do it though?

I guess I write this review the way I did because I've sunk 500ish hours into the game on Steam.  Lord knows how many hours before Steam existed when it came out.  The game is a good companion while walking around in the real world.  I've noticed that the birds in real life sound a lot like the birds in Baldur's Gate, whoever designed these Hunger Games birds we have around here in Nebraska is a genius.  Kidding.  I would say that the value the game has to me is far less about the time I spend at a keyboard playing it (or on Nintendo Switch, which is an interesting Inception experience.  Play a wilderness stage in a wilderness area in real life), and far more about how I can think about it later.  Trying to come up with my own ideas for how to beat an archmage on my own without Googling it as much as possible.  Thinking about what I'd do if I were in CHARNAME's shoes.  This game has been a good companion for over half my life at this point, and I'd highly recommend it.

Final note on THAC0
  It's really not that hard.  A few ways to view it.

1.  In regular D&D your DM tells you if you hit or not.  The computer is the DM.  Don't even think about it.  Try and eventually you'll succeed.

2.  If you're actually that worried about it, play the game on Story mode.  You cannot help but win.  You can basically roll your forehead on the keyboard incoherently and you'll still somehow win.  Do it this way to enjoy the storyline if you care about accessibility. 

3.  Import and export to cheat like crazy.  Or Command Line Prompt if you prefer.  

4.  Figure out how to cheese the game.  Snares plus skull trap spell equals absurd levels of cheesiness.

5.  Ask yourself has anyone ever consulted a THAC0 chart and a Monstrous Manual for 2nd Edition D&D to play the game?  No.  I didn't think so either.  Has anyone ever consulted a walk through to check a monster's AC vs. your THAC0?  No?  Yeah I didn't figure so.

6.  If you kind of want to think about it, consider that as you gain levels you get better gear and spells in your party.  In short, as you gain levels the odds of you hitting increases and the odds of you getting hit decreases while the odds of you surviving tends to increase.  In other words, just enjoy the game.  It's the same basic idea in any edition of D&D or RPG when you boil it all down to brass tacks.

7.  It's a game.  You're not meant to think about a game mechanic like THAC0 extensively any more than you are supposed to boycott a movie theater because you don't understand how the debit card reader works.  You don't need to understand the physics of how to shoot a basketball or the algebra of how a parabola works in shooting the ball to like the game of basketball.  If you enjoy digging into the mechanics do it because you enjoy it, don't let other people talking about this be a point to steer clear from an outstanding story.

8.  It's your game.  Play it how you want.  Don't be worried about what other people think about it.  Don't listen to people tell you how to play your game, especially if you're playing solo.  This is a different argument than if you're playing WoW where everyone is raiding together as a group effort and you aren't paying their subscription.  

8b.  If you're concerned about what purists say about how you should play your video game, just ask them if they drive around in a horse and buggy.  Call them a hypocrite if they say no.  If they refuse to answer shame them with a look and shaking your fist angrily. 

9.  At not point in the playing of this game should you feed your dog chocolate.",1652185793,1652185793,True,11,0,0.58635026216506958,0,True,False,False

[h2][i]Great fun! Hehe. Right, Boo?[/i] ~Minsc[/h2]

Legends never die and, well, here we are as good ol’ [i]Baldur’s Gate II[/i] returns with new features and improvements in [i]Enhanced Edition[/i]. The original game was developed by BioWare and released by Interplay Entertainment in 2000, whereas the remastered version was done and released by Beamdog in 2013.

[i]Baldur’s Gate II[/i] is, yeah obviously, the sequel to [i]Baldur’s Gate[/i] and one of those timeless, classic CRPGs heavily related to the ‘90s tabletop roleplaying games. The game is still based on the 2nd edition rules of [i]Advanced Dungeons & Dragons[/i] and uses an isometric perspective with pausable, real-time gameplay. So, there’s no throwing dice here, because the game does it automatically, which makes everything easier - trust me. Anyway, [i]Baldur’s Gate II[/i] may be old, but it still looks really good thanks to its unique 2D graphics generated by Infinity Engine. The storyline and soundtrack also aged well and I enjoyed both even though I know them by heart.

Speaking of the storyline, [i]Baldur’s Gate II[/i] takes place in the high fantasy setting of Forgotten Realms. Well, without revealing too much, after the events of [i]Baldur’s Gate[/i] the protagonist and his companions find themselves in a dungeon, taken captive by a mysterious mage. The heroes escape at the first opportunity and fight through the underground complex to finally escape and realise that their captor doesn’t give up easily. The confrontation ends up with a fight, which complicates everything and makes the protagonist embark on another epic adventure. Originally, there was a huge gap between the two games, however, Beamdog developed and released [i]Siege of Dragonspear[/i] expansion, which closes that gap. Nevertheless, you don’t need to play through the prequel and the DLC to fully enjoy [i]Baldur’s Gate II[/i]. The storyline is epic, all original recruitable characters are unique and there is not a single boring side quest.

Alrighty, so what’s new about [i]Enhanced Edition[/i] and what’s been changed to make good ol’ [i]Baldur’s Gate II[/i] worthwhile not only for old-timers but also for younger generations? Well, first of all, the original expansion [i]Throne of Bhaal[/i] is now an integral part of the game. Furthermore, there are a lot of bug fixes and overall improvements, including a new interface with high resolution widescreen support as well as cross-platform multiplayer option. Besides, Beamdog added new character portraits and voices, new soundtrack pieces, changed sprites of many items, reorganised journal and character record tabs as well as added really useful mechanics such as quick looting and screen zooming. Another significant novelty is the Story Mode difficulty level, which is just perfect for new players, simply because it works as a sort of ""god mode"". Apart from that, when you travel between locations, loading screens appear no longer. 

Ok, now about the controversial part - [i]Enhanced Edition[/i] adds four new playable characters with their own unique questlines and three of them were already introduced in the remastered version of [i]Baldur’s Gate[/i]. Well, at least now they don’t stand out from the original companions with their dialogues, classes and overall complexity like they did in the prequel. However, the fourth new potential companion is rather interesting, especially in terms of mechanics, but I’m not spoiling the surprise here if you want to play the game. Anyway, the additional characters are pretty decent if you ask me, but not all old-timers may like them. There’s also one more new thing in [i]Enhanced Edition[/i], a sort of separate campaign with arena battles, namely [i]The Black Pits II: Gladiators of Thay[/i], which is a continuation of [i]The Black Pits[/i] from the remastered prequel. Nothing new, nothing special and nothing interesting.

All in all, [i]Baldur’s Gate II: Enhanced Edition[/i] is a well-made, solid remaster of a legendary, classic CRPG that was a worldwide bestseller at its time, even better than its prequel actually. [i]Enhanced Edition[/i] gives a second life to one of my personal favourite games of all time and I simply can’t say no to gathering my party before venturing forth. Oh, but what about the legendary duet of Minsc and Boo? Well, Minsc and Boo are simply Minsc and Boo, they’ll be always kicking butts for goodness everywhere they go. So, in the end, 9/10 would gather my party again. And, lastly, thanks for reading my review.",1550097871,1651923745,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Baldur's Gate 2 is a game I loved in my teen years, but now just makes me groan. It does still get praised a lot for its story and writing a lot of times, sometimes even for its gameplay, but both aged poorly.

The writing feels like young adult novel, very silly and eyerollingly embellished. I admit, when it came out the gaming scene was in a different state - and a lot of the cliches and tropes were reused by successors, but that doesn't make it good nowadays - the writing in videogames and media has improved a lot for the most of it. More fleshed out and polished, less silly and cringeworthy. Characters talk more like actual people, not cardboard cutout stereotypes.

Regarding the gameplay - it's based on Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2E, and calling it obtuse, clunky and aged would be putting it very mildly. The boardgame ruleset doesn't really make for a good videogame ""rules"", especially considering the focus on dungeon clearing and how simplistic some of the classes are.

It's not BAD in the true sense, but it's an artifact of its time - one which has been improved upon many times. If your time and money aren't limitless, I can't in good faith recommend the game, unless you want to take a trip to the past. You could play the likes of Disco Elysium or Tyranny instead. As it is, I'd rather leave the game in better memory than to be miserable playing it now.",1651527373,1651527714,False,8,4,0.487161070108413696,0,True,False,False

Every now and then a game comes along that completely defines (or redefines) a genre of game and Baldur's Gate was one such masterpiece.  Baldur's Gate 2 is the sequel and,unlike most sequels, is actually a better game.

PLOT:  Good but not exceptional.

COMBAT:  Game uses AD&D 2nd Edition rules set.

GRAPHICS & SOUND:  Adequate but dated.  There is no getting away from the fact that this is based on a 20+ year old game.

REPLAY VALUE:  Very good, may different companions and side quests.

ISSUES AND BUGS:  None.  Works “straight out of the box” with no messing around and appears to be completely bug free!  In over 110 hours of game play I have yet to have a single issue.

ACHIEVEMENTS AND TRADING CARDS:  Steam achievements and trading cards for those interested.  There is quite a lot of achievements in this game (93 in total).  It would require at least 8 playthroughs of the early parts of the game to unlock them all as there are 8 mutually exclusive stronghold achievements.

VALUE FOR MONEY:  Excellent as Throne of Bhaal is included in the base price.  Look out for bundles and offers in sales.

LONG REVIEW
Every now and then a game comes along that completely defines (or redefines) a genre of game and Baldur's Gate was one such masterpiece.  Baldur's Gate 2 is the sequel and,unlike most sequels, is actually a better game.  Yes, it is is 20+ years old and does show it's age I also accept that it since been surpassed by Planescape Torment (still the best cRPG of all time in my opinion) and more recently the Dragon Age, Pillars of Eternity and Divinity series of games but it is definitely still worth playing whether it is your first time or you are returning to the game having played the original.

There is a good amount of content here.

BALDUR'S GATE II.
The original Baldur's Gate 2 gate game but updated the the Baldur's Gate 2 engine and numerous bug fixes (mainly to the background mechanics of the game).

THRONE OF BHAAL.
The original expansion to  Baldur's Gate 2. Again updated the the Baldur's Gate 2 engine and debugged.

THE BLACK PITS II:  GLADIATORS OF THAY.
An arena style combat game.  No further comments as its not really my cup of tea.

With Pillars of Eternity and Torment: Tides of Numenera this style of gaming, having fallen out of favour, has made a comeback.  I think this is due to the fact that, whilst graphics moved on and games became more visually appealing the actual gameplay often suffered and there was a whole era of games that looked visually stunning but were real dogs to actually play.  (Whoever thought quick time events were a good idea should have been strangled at birth!).  Although playability is one of the strengths of the game people new to the games (as opposed to old hands returning) might struggle a bit at first picking up the vagaries of the 2nd edition AD&D rules set.  Also, in Throne of Bhaal, the limitations of the underlying rules become apparent as the 2nd edition AD&D rules set simply starts to break down at very high level.

In terms of what the enhanced edition offers over the original other than the ability to run seamlessly on modern hardware and support for modern screen resolutions I'm not sure most of the other added features really add a lot for the game to be honest.  The “auto loot” function is nice and the capacity of containers (gem pouches etc.) has been significantly increased so inventory management is less of a chore.  Personally I couldn't care less about the multiplayer options.

The difficulty curve in spot on with no nasty difficulty “spikes” that some games suffer from.  Personally I don't find the 2nd half of Throne of Bhaal (Chapters 9 & 10) to be very enjoyable.  The difficulty goes up and some of the combats become a long slog.  The limitations of the underlying core mechanics also become apparent.  The game is also possibly a little too long, I took me about 110 hours to complete and I completely skipped watchers keep.

The game works “straight out of the box” with no messing around with settings and is exceptionally stable.  At the time of writing I have over 110 hours of game play and have yet to encounter a single issue.

Overall definitely worth picking up.  Look out for bundles and offers in sales.

Whereas the original felt very much like a prototype and proof of concept, the second is a fully-fledged, high-quality RPG that offers an extremely enjoyable experience.

The first had the unfortunate development woes of the engine, tools, and even genre conventions being made at the same time as the game itself, leading to a disjointed and underwhelming experience bereft of a story or really any RPG interactions. It was fight after fight and the main exposition came at the very tail end of the game after sending you back and forth between nearly unrelated locations. This title, however, with all the tools and rules in place was where Bioware was truly free to create a rich game from top to bottom.

For starters, everything here feels solid and purposeful. Everything is built with an overall unified design, goal, or story in mind. Wandering around various wilderness maps devoid of content is all but gone, replaced instead with thematic and intentional dungeons, buildings, cities, and other locations. Also of notable presence is a story. From the opening seconds of the game, there's more story to it than the entire previous title and the characters that play in the story are actual characters written with personalities and motivations. There are clearly defined goals to the overall story and even the side quests and smaller stories found around the world are well crafted and feel impactful and meaningful. Dialogue is present and offers choice and exploration. The game also offers much more varied and interesting locations and story points. You'll visit some extreme reaches of the Forgotten Realms and some truly imaginative jaunts into a wealth of smaller but no less interesting places.

Even the combat, which I still loathe due to the shortcomings of real-time-with-pause combat in a complex RPG system, is much improved owing in large part due to the party's starting levels as a mid-level party and ascending up to high-level play. Unfortunately, while refined and bettered than the previous title, it still has the shortcomings of its combat system. A system designed around turn-based combat and limited encounters and resources suffers when the turns are blended together and replaced with arduous, constant pausing in order to affect meaningful tactics. Also related is the fact that the party starts mid-level and decently powerful and only goes up from there. By the two-thirds point of the game, encounters tend to throw a wealth of controlling effects or enemies that outright cannot be hit without the correct weapons as a means to elevate difficulty and counteract the party's power. This leads to increased frustration with this type of combat and due to the limited nature of protection against some of the game's favored ways to disrupt your party (be it time or uses) it turns what should be a relatively solid continuous combat experience into a slog. It's really just a bunch of inherent problems with the real-time-with-pause system and I'm happy more recent games, including the sequel to this one, have opted to return to turn-based modes.

This problem is only exacerbated with the included expansion, Throne Of Bhaal. Not only is it a wealth of these sort of frustrating encounters, but because it's the expansion and the highest-level content in the game it's almost exclusively this sort of disappointing and appalling design. Gone are the meaningful dialogues or the interesting character developments, wiped away with the notion of side quests or exploration in favor of difficult combat encounter after difficult combat encounter. I made it roughly halfway through the expansion before finding that what was on offer no longer respected my time or was any fun to engage with at all.

The bottom line is that even though the game has all the faults of its combat system and the expansion is almost completely made up of them, the base game is a fantastic RPG experience that set the bar high for years to come. This game is one of the reasons that for years the developer name Bioware was regarded with the highest praise and hearing they were working on a new project was an excitement in and of itself.

If you're looking at both Baldur's Gate titles, skip the first and immediately enjoy this one instead. If you're coming off the first title, be ready for a much, much better experience that holds up for the most part to this day.",1647967607,1647967607,True,36,3,0.784989595413208008,0,True,False,False

One thing that I have to stress is the inability to see buffs/debuffs on enemies in combat, which can be frustrating at times.

Don't cheat, play the game as intended, use all the characters you meet along the way and enjoy the best ever storyline and side plots ever in a video game.

If you struggle at the start try using a Tank Type character like a Paladin or Warrior until you learn how to play the game.

Then for a real good game play experience playing as a Thief (Swashbuckler class) and duel class at level 11 to mage. You can also use a Kensai and duel class at 11 for a awesome main character, both really fun to play.

I have completed the game using every class available, and its a blast on them all. There is no wrong, but the two classes  above when duel classes are particularily strong and make it easy to have fun.

There are so many character classes, skills, and specialisations to choose between, and so many in-game decisions, that it feels like I'll never run out of new options to explore. So far, I've made three play-throughs ~ one as a Ranger with the Archer Specialism, one as a Wild Mage who was super powerful but had permanently accidentally polymorphed herself into a cute little chicken, and my current main character is a Paladin Cavalier.

The scope of the adventure is massive, there's dozens of quests to try with multiple possible outcomes and tons of dialog options for when stabbing the enemy isn't necessarily the solution you were looking for. 

When the conversation turns ugly however, a beautiful thing happens. The game pauses and you're given the chance to make tactical decisions and engage in combat. Early game things can get hairy, especially when a critical can floor your main character. But then shortly after gaining a few levels and acquiring choice spells most encounters boil down to how quick you are at casting Fireball or similar powerful spells. There are dozens of spells to choose from, by the way.

As far as story goes, You, the Baalspawn have been captured by an obviously evil wizard and rogue taxidermist by the name of Jon Irenicus. Now, normally that would be super bad news and likely the subject of a gross fanfic but thankfully your buddy Imoen busts you out before things get really weird. The first area of the game is a puzzle of sorts, full of goblins, people in jars, and a poo golem. Yes, that's right. A poo golem. Interacting with the poo golem is the key to your success in this first area, and is a taste of how the game works but don't worry. You don't have to touch the poo golem directly, just mind which end of the control rod you grab and keep in mind there are no tissues in Faerun.

Upon liberating yourself from the depths of the weird torture chamber that was your home the party lands in Athkatla, a city that is not Baldur's Gate. As the subtitle of the game implies, the adventure takes place in Amn, and there is no delay in the start of the action. Navigate through the seedy underworld of Athkatla and save your friend, exact revenge on that silly wizard with the most common name in the multiverse, and also somehow fulfill your destiny as the spawn of Baal. Play as a good character if you like mental gymnastics and philosophical handwringing, or play as an evil one and be completely unsurprising to everyone you meet, it doesn't matter, you're the hero!

Its pause-and-play combat feels like a euphoric storm of blades, spells and blood in the larger fights. Few things compare for me to watching a hasted, buffed party charge into a room and carve enemies apart. The game will often punish you for playing stupid, with areas full of traps, casters who buff themselves at start-of-combat, at least a dozen horrid status effects and even enemies who can sneak-attack you, a sad rarity in many RPGs. The player is rewarded for being a cheeselord who casts 4+ buffs on their party, uses AOE spells at the edge of your line-of-sight, sending a rogue ahead of the party no matter how safe an area seems and other gimmicks.

Increasingly-powerful loot can be found regularly and with good money conservation, you can buy great equipment from multiple vendors - or have legendary equipment forged for you by a certain smith, provided you have the money and proper materials.

The enemy variety is unmatched by any other game I've played. Turn to a page in the Monster Manual of D&D and that critter has a high chance of showing up. You got beholders, elementals, drow, different types of golem, snake people, mind flayers, wild animals, rakshasa, dragons, a wide variety of undead (they're particularly nasty with status effects), trolls, orcs, werepeople, oozes - the list goes on and on. Even better, while some sections can have repetitive encounters, you'll soon be onto something very different.

There's a wide variety of companions and while their dialogue is limited, some of them are incredible - and they can bicker with each other or the player even to the point of bloodshed. Korgan Bloodaxe is my favorite for an evil run, 10/10, absolutely batshit, depraved Dorf. There's also romance lines with a few characters and the Enhanced Edition added a new trio of gay, bi and lesbian characters to boot.

The general roleplaying is limited but it's present. It doesn't compare to New Vegas in terms of speech checks or choices, but you are presented with the occasional dilemma or chance to flesh out your character's worldview more. There's a host of delectably-cruel evil options as well, such as [spoiler]murdering an entire town of gnomes to get a quest item from them instead of helping them with their balrog problem[/spoiler].

The story isn't the greatest ever, but it was engaging enough for me to feel drawn in at points. The people you encounter have understandable flaws, motivations and quite a few are in rock-and-a-hard-place dilemmas. There isn't as much mystery and intrigue as the first game, but the heights you reach are higher in terms of stakes.

Overall it's a very replayable game. I still haven't even done a morally-upright playthrough yet and I have over 200 hours in.  The older pixel graphics may not draw everyone in, but they look better to me than some newer games with bad 3D work. Give this classic a try!",1641558219,1641558219,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

""Cities always teem with evil and decay... let's give it a good shake and see what falls out!""

I first played BG2 when it came out on a friend's computer way back in 2000. It hooked me. I play it constantly, even now. I've probably sunk thousands of hours into this game over the years; played through it forwards and backwards, fuck I even have riddles from the third act stuck in my head that will never leave. This game is incredibly well built. 

I have my original SoA and ToB discs still and they work. I bought the original on GOG when it first arrived and I snagged the Enhanced Edition on GOG and then Steam. This game is all consuming. 

The Prince is 30, the Princess is 40. Just shut up and never mind, you'll know it when you see it.

Alright alright, on to a ""review"":

BG2:EE what is it? It's an isometric cRPG set in the Forgotten Realms world using AD&D 2nd Edition rules and systems, with real time combat; tactical pausing; voiced dialogue; hundreds of quests; vibrant 3D-esque backgrounds that are borderline art; stirring music... I can go on.

This game uses the Infinity Engine which is used in a slew of other cRPG games from the late 90's to the mid 2000's. It's flexible and it's downright rugged; it's easy to mod and easy to bend. The modding community for this game and it's ilk is STILL going strong and developing new content. It's not particularly amazing, there's no raytracing or DLSS or anything, but the graphics convey enough that even today it is still engaging and, dare I say fun. The Enhanced edition is nice thanks to the proper built in support for simple things like widescreen support and UI scaling for example.

Story wise this game is monumental. There are multiple Acts to work your way through with intriguing and complex side stories. Companions with actual personality and impact who are full of rich dialogue and interact with you and the story constantly. There's no real ""slog"" in this game, every event or set piece has it's purpose and honestly after 21 years of playing this game I still find new and unique things, combinations or events that I didn't know existed before. The Enhanced edition further adds to this with a little sprinkle of new content here and there to help shake things up. Nothing crazy or ground breaking, but it's nice to see some effort put in.

Sound wise you just can't beat some of the music in this game. It is dramatic, it is mellow and it is booming. There is a well crafted piece for every occasion in this game, and it makes an impact. Voice acting from the narrator all the way to the villain is near perfect. Ambient sounds from the cities to the forests, while on a loop (and you can tell) are at least varied enough that you won't notice until your tenth play-through.

Multiplayer? Oh yeah, it has that too! This game can be amazing, but add a friend or two in to experience it? Instant classic. Do not start a game unless you've got hours to devote. We tried this at a LAN party many years ago and I distinctly recall playing so late into the night (or early in the morning, take your pick) that people were falling asleep and drooling on their keyboards from exhaustion. Epic.

Combat and general gameplay in this particular epic can range from the ""click on it and it dies"" simplicity to ""I better take X potion combined with Y scroll and hope I've got Lilarcor equipped to handle this den of Mindflayers or I'm gonna beat my head off my keyboard"" complexity. Depends on your difficulty settings really. The game can unfairly spawn certain Vampiric assholes in a particular dungeon that will annihilate you in seconds early on, but I have only found that on higher difficulties than Normal and Core Rules. 

Undead Hunters can literally win this game single-handedly.

So. ""A conclusion!"" I hear you yell.

Buy it. I don't care if it's full price or 99% off. You WILL get your money out of this game if you enjoy a good story-rich experience and don't mind if it looks dated. This Enhanced Edition has all the modern trappings and conveniences that The Gibberlings Three community has been modding into the original game for years and then some. Although they've even added new stuff that the Enhanced Edition missed or sorely needed (Check them out please, their newest community packs work perfectly with all Enhanced Edition Infinity Engine games).

Camera zoom is really nice and handy though, that's a feature the mod community never was able to add.

Fast forward to 2020. The pandemic is keeping me at home anyway and I had been reading about a tool called the EET install tool for Baldur's gate. I decided it was time to try a heavily modded game again using the tool. Well almost 700 hours later I have to say it was a wonderful experience. This is a game that stands the test of time. 

The gameplay is addictive and the story is amazing. I had to accept some bugs and quirks but that comes with playing with over 100+ mods. Mostly though using the tool to install the trilogy made it mostly conflict free. 

One mod adds a Genie companion who had quests and dialogue that spans early BG2 to the end of ToB. Another, like Bone Hill adds new areas and quests to explore. Others add more items. One even had the Friendly Arms Inn under attack and its up to you to save it. 

The best mod for ME was ToB's Ascension. Created by one of he game's writers it really flushes out the end of the game and can't recc that mod enough. 

Now for the additions for the Enhanced Edition. I liked what they did. They added some new companions. who all have quests of their own. Fully voiced and I thought they did a very good job. Even more content for a game with tons already? Good stuff. 

Its hard to wrap up about 500 hours playing these games over the past year+ whenever I had some free time except to say take the advice of a gamer who had played them all and sink your teeth into this. You won't be disappointed.",1628698678,1640937040,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game starts from around level 7 or 8 depending on your class.  This is much more friendly to the spell casting classes as the starting character should already have access to level 3 spells.

There are many ways to build your character.  Duel class, multi class or focus on any class.  Different classes will approach battles differently and exploring a viable team is very fun. 

During the whole epic game journey, there is a lot of choices to be made and consequences to be seen.  Interactions between teammates are always fun to watch.  Romance options are great as well.  

For replaying the game, I would suggest experienced players to try solo the game with a single class character.  Without the teammates, the single class character won’t be able to handle all situations and thus there’s a need to relearn spells, potions, wands and equipments.

To say that I've put this much amount of time into a game that is near 20 fucking years old and still has me playing is a sheer testament to the amount of love and utter respect I have for this series as a whole. Not only that, but it shows just how devoted to the dream the developers of Baldur's Gate II were, and the precision, love and care they brought to this child of theirs. 

Story Time:
I started playing this game when I was around 5, I could never get out of Irenicus's dungeon, and on the one chance that I did, I was immediately sent to the Nine Hells as I decided to test the boundaries of the Cowled Wizards' patience for spell-casting in Athkatla. Suffice to say, it was love at first touch. Constantly watching my father before he'd go to work or whenever he had some free time, I'd be enraptured by how he carved a bloody swarthe through Trolls, Umber Hulks and various other beasties with such ease. However, as time went on and I developed the acute pain of younger brothers and sisters, my father's free time became less and less and before I knew it, the tale of the Bhaalspawn was put into a disc wallet where it would wax nostalgia upon every time me or my father found it after we moved houses. Then I got a job and money came in. I brought some varying games; Battlefield 3 and 4, Mass Effect, The Witcher Trilogy, Titanfall 2 and the classic Star Wars Battlefront II. None however, gave me the sweet sense of profound joy I found in listening to that  glorious orchestral theme blast down my eardrums. Tbh, I nearly fucking came. I definitely needed a cold shower after listening to that fucking gorgeous opening. My account pic being very fucking related. 

To say that I have some severe nostalgia goggles for the series would be an understatement. This game was the first thing my childhood eyes ever laid eyes upon and it has been incredibly hard to find things to even compare to the level of enjoyment I get out of playing this. For those more interested in their own time (ironic, having gotten this far), peruse the TLDR in dot point below.

Pros:
- Fucking beautiful story.
- Luxurious voice acting.
- Unparalleled lore.
- The strongest entry of Bioware TO DATE.
- Nearly two decades old and still has an incredibly active fanbase, community and dedicated modding community.
- Things can actually change depending on your class and as such problems can be resolved in much more unique ways.
- The developers realised that in order to not shoot themselves in the foot they keep the classes how they were in the original.
- I C O N I C
  C
  N
  I
  C

Cons:
- Occasional updates from Beamdog, but can't really help it, I'm complaining about how it fugs with my mods more than anything 
- Beamdog's 3 new additions to the NPC roster. Yes, they're somewhat strange but the beauty of it being an RPG is that you can slaughter all three of them with literally no repercussion, hell with one NPC's death you might actually get thanked by the local populace. Fuck you Dorn you insufferable fuck.

Look, if you take anything away from what I told you, take away the fact that again, a nearly 20 year old game has held my attention far longer than anything put out in recent memory. It is constantly selling copies, despite its age and lack of appeal to more casual gamers, and finally as I pointed out in the pros, the game is iconic. Without the inception of Baldur's Gate I and II, you can guarantee that games like Skyrim, Pillars of Eternity (ugh), Star Wars: KOTOR, Divinity Original Sin and numerous other games wouldn't have the critical acclaim they do. You want the game that started it all? Good, pay the $30 and buckle up. It's going to be one hell of a ride.

The max level in this game (varying with class) is between 30 and 40.

OH BOY, DO I RECOMMEND THIS GAME. The sheer insanity and bravado of Black Isle/Bioware in developing something like this. No surprise Larian took the coward's route and rebooted back to level 1 to 4. I believe we won't be seeing another high level D&D videogame never again in our lives, it's literally impossible to balance - but ironically, there's so much fun to be had in the absolute mess of magic effects going off.

Cons: difficult to see items that are hidden by the ""3D"" view - e.g. behind a wall , so often lose a batch of items when a character dies and is reincarnated - particularly if one of the bot characters does the reincarnation in the middle of a battle - if you do not notice (e.g. it takes place off-screen) you wander off  with a character with all their equipment missing
Sometimes it is difficult to know how to progress the plot (typically have to look it up on the internet)

Baldur's Gate II is an overall improvement from the first game in the series, sporting better visuals, a killer soundtrack reminiscent of Basil Pouledouris' score for Conan: The Barbarian and improved gameplay and interface. Gone are the low-tier Kobold junk mobs of BG1, here be Dragons! Lots of them, and Mindflayers... Too damned many. It's a good experience, if a bit padded in places. Athkatla is still one of the most jam-packed cities I've ever wandered in an RPG. Lots to do, perhaps too much, but at least you can be choosy.

I do feel obliged to say that despite the praise it receives, the story is merely serviceable IMO. It actually has very little to do with the narrative that the first game set up, though it does eventually wright that ship in Throne of Bhaal. Pretty much the entirety of Shadows of Amn is one big sidequest, a detour that doesn't really amount to anything significant for the main character. Jon Irenicus, while being superbly voiced, is written with shallow motivation. The main villain of Throne of Bhaal on the other hand has motivation in spades, but the actress hams it up so much that her machinations are made obvious to the player. Six in one, half-dozen in the other. Neither hold a candle to Sarevok, and I don't even rate him as that spectacular. It's a shame really.

Writing aside, it's the companions, as always in Bioware games, that make the experience special. Lots of old faces return and many likeable new ones are met along the way. I greatly enjoyed the added interactions and banter sessions, even if they tended to trigger at wildly inappropriate times. I chalk it up to growing pains. It's something Bioware would perfect further down the line in their subsequent RPGs like KotOR. 

In conclusion, if you like the Forgotten Realms setting or Sword & Sorcery in general, this game is for you. It has everything you'd expect to see in a mid - high level D&D campaign and it's a satisfying experience.",1637828922,1637830027,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I personally find the original CD-version with up-scaling mods crispier & sharper, but that's my only complain.
Maybe - and just maybe - the BG1/2EE companions are boring AF and all their additional quests (specially Neera's rabbit fetch quest) are just a bother. The optic of the gear introduced looks out of place; I haven't seen an uglier shield like that.

Else...super fast saving/loading; no stuttering and whatsoever - decent mod support for Item/spell revisions & Stratagems! + whatever you prefer. Sadly 1pp is done for BG2 vanilla....

Would probably not plugin my DVDrom just for the sake of being old-school ^^
(nvidia-tool helps in getting a reduced weird sprite-look, even with the 'modern' comic stuff disabled. The black outlines are just a bother)

+color-palette! don't need to use IWDKeep to get the look I desire

Blah blah blah whatever, it's still good, the Viconia and Sarevok dialogue and characterisation stuff is fantastic, just the actual mechanics of the game and encounters are creaking at the seams to deal with the reality of a 25 strength greater whirlwinded PC wading in like the God of murder he is.",1629285413,1637315600,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

he original plot remains impressive, telling the continuing Bhaalspawn saga about the protagonist coming to terms with his or her identity as the offspring of the dead god of murder. Script and story are much more mature than what was presented in the first Baldur's Gate. Even the main villain, a dead-faced sadistic monster named Jon Irenicus, whom you are first introduced to during torture sessions in his dungeon, is more memorably evil than the previous game's more prototypical baddie, Sarevok. Compared to the original the second is a bit darker than the first with the expansion the Throne of Baal leading you straight to Hell, 

This second version of Baldurs Gate is as i say a bit darker, NPCs will cross you and even double cross you so i felt i needed to play smarter. All that said, sometimes the game goes too far. The difficulty is artificially ramped up, and the game's reach exceeds its grasp in some aspects of the design. Dungeon levels consist of far too many tiny corridors that present daunting challenges to your party of six adventurers.

There's a certain pleasure you'll get from this. The spell of Wish, for instance. And figuring out each spell, exploring all over the place is an unforgettable experience that stands the test of time.

For anyone picking this up for the first time, definitely recommend checking out mods. There's been a dedicated modding since it came out. A few mods I consider canon: unfinished business (mod that adds unfinished content) and Gaider's Ascension (a mod made by the developer about how he wanted the ending to go, but didn't have the time.)

So, what's wrong with this game?

Some classes (I'm looking at you wizard slayer) are simply garbage. Some classes are easy mode (most magic classes.) Nothing really that wrong with that honestly, but it will hurt your initial experience if you play a class that ends up being garbage.

The game has given up so much love from its predecessor. A certain charm has been thrown out the window.
For example:
-CHA has become the penultimate dump stat. WIS is a close second. There are a handful of minor quests you'll have a better option and prices at the store with high enough of these stats. But... why? In the first dungeon of the game you'll get a ring that can blast your CHA to 18, just put it on if you want that Charisma. Aside from prices there's no real reason to get CHA. Morale failure is kinda a thing too I suppose.
-WIS is useful in a few scenarios for priests and druids it gives them a small bonus for their spells. Mages who want to use Wish will see its potential for that singular spell. After that you'll get nothing out of it. Maybe 1 or 2 quests you'll see a difference (example: a beholder guards a chest and tells me he's contracted to guard it. If you have 14 (or higher I think) you can point out it's the chest he was commanded to guard, not the items within. Still, you can simply ask a party member to ask. (Imoen, Viconia, etc can all figure it out.) And even if you don't have those members, you can drink a potion to temporarily increase your wisdom for these specific scenarios.
-INT the final garbage stat. Helps wizards scribe scrolls. 11 needed to use scrolls. That's it. There'll be a handful of useless dialogue options you can get with high enough int I believe. But nothing that'll feel useful.

Why did I bring up these stats? In the previous game, you had a world of differences in how they functioned. I remember in BG1 I became super moneybags king. Why? Because I my cha was high, and prices were always low. You talk to people and they see you as a welcome houseguest. Wandering into a house and the characters will comment on how handsome/beautiful you are. Being low/average cha feels like a whole different experience. And you need high charisma to convince people to join your party. They won't join you just for asking. And they'd even fight each other to the death if you weren't a good enough leader. Fuller will give you a nice +1 dagger if your CHA is high enough (legendary item at that stage of the game) boots of the north quest reward! A girl will give you a cursed scroll and mock you if you're ugly enough, and a protection scroll if it's high enough. All these stats effected the game, even if they weren't considered very important.

So... what else was lost in transition? Tactical strategies. Almost everything in BG1 could be whomped with blindness because of its massive -6 saving throw at that stage. A handful of other spells (spook for instance) degenerated into uselessness, when in BG1 they were extremely useful.

I recall exploring the massive trap filled dungeons of bg1, I would buff everyone, give everyone invisibility, flank the boss with my warriors with my first strike from the dark, while they're destracting it use spells to heal, buff, and damage, with my thief on a bow doing everything she can to hurt the enemy.

How does it end? Rewarding. I felt an almost Opium like feeling of satisfaction when I slew a demon in bg1. How does BG2 handle it? I try an invisibility strategy at adventurers in the sewer. They are programmed to notice my invisible character, then cast dispel invisibility. My strategy is ruined without explanation. total bs if u ask me :/

This continues throughout the game. Favorite debuff? all enemies saving throw it. Invisibilty? Enemies all seem to have a method to true sight it. Magical protections? Enemies all quickly dispel them. The game isnt hard. Just lacks the tactical glory of the past. Your strategies are railroaded in a singular direction. The few enemies that lose to blindness? They're no longer worth blinding. Sarevok, the last boss of the original game could be charmed and blinded.

It's also not a lack of tactics. There's also a lack of open-ended solutions. Example: In Baldur's Gate 1, There's a Gnome near a statue. The gnome is selling a stone to flesh scroll so you can meet the mysterious woman from a different time. In my first playthrough I was as broke as a pauper. Upon adventuring and selling some stuff I went back to the gnome, with just enough cash. I got a cleric of Tempus in my party! So I talked with others about it. ""Dude, the scroll is just 145 at other temples."" In my next playthrough I'd look for the other temples I could visit and buy that scroll. Then I thought to myself, wait... I have Imoen in my party right? Why not steal the scroll? So I did. And it went from 145 cost to just save scumming theft. Now I found, playing a sorcerer, I could simply charm him and have him use his own scroll. There's 5 SOLUTIONS. 5. The list goes on. BG2 there's almost always 1 solution for a quest, and it's usually buff your party then fight.

But lastly, another charm of the game was lost. Charmed dialogue. Easter eggs and interesting dialogue options could be garnered from the original game. Almost every character had unique dialogue when charmed. Buying a nymph's cloak can charm the whole city of baldurs gate and they won't go hostile after.

Some quests could be resolved with a charm spell. In one quest you get poisoned and must resolve it before time is up. Charming the guy who knows the solution will make him simply give it to you without having to look for a geas removal scroll. Charmed a wealthy aristocrat? He'll offer you some gold as a sign of your friendship and ask you to spend the night. It was this kinda heart I saw then that I don't see much of. The game has become more mainstream. It wants to make every moment more impactful. At the same time, it limits its own potential for different playthroughs and strategies. Every quest has a great deal of content. It also has no other methods of completion, no out of box thinking. In Nahlia's Keep you can get charmed dialogue from ONE character, but it makes no real difference.

The lost charm of the past aside, the game has a wonderful charm of its own. Seeing how far you can go is so fun. The world might be more episodic and less open world as compared to its predecessor, but that doesn't mean it's not worth playing.

Characters are more fleshed out here. Even unmodded you can tell each one has a distinct personality and is willing to show it. They banter and argue amongst themselves. 1 even betrays you. What they lost in creativity and open-endedness, they gained in writing characters and story.

The story is far more dark and serious. And it's written like a work of art. Of course there's some retcons and awkwardness. But it's not nearly as bad as the wizards canon where viekang kills abdel.

Anyway, definitely something to try out once in your life. Try to get it on sale if you can.",1631675499,1631878468,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat is frustrating. You'll win 90% of the fights in the game by taking your hands off the keyboard and letting the AI take over, and most of the rest of the fights by doing a little manual healing.

Она просто сделана во времена, когда играть было не во что. И за счёт объективных сильных сторон - да, она получила культовый статус. И её принято любить и почитать.
А на самом деле... Ну такая себе игра.
Перетащили из настолки кучу механик, которые правильно работает в настолке, но в компьютерной игре - превращают всё в фарс. Один отдых чего стоит. Этим многие игры по днд страдают, но тут, кажется, как-то особо сильно заставляют использовать эту механику. Ворвались в дом, подрались в одной комнате - устали. Давайте прежде чем открывать дверь устроим привал на 8 часов. Охренеть - ролевая игра...
Или вон ловушки. Либо ты везде ходишь в три раза медленнее, чтобы у тебя успевали задетектиться ловушки, либо абьюзишь сохранение. И то, и другое - просто выброшенное в мусорку время.
Происходящее в бою - нефидбечное месиво. Что лог происходящего засран до невозможности, что картинка - когда все призванными существами обложатся вообще не разобрать, кто, где, что.
И это я ещё не говорю о технических сложностях. Персонажи постоянно оказываются в одной точке и друг в друге застревают. Нахождение пути вообще такое, что хочется принять цианистый калий.
Ну и, конечно, Throne of Bhaal портит ощущения сильно. Я не знаю, как это можно считать хорошим ДЛЦ. ToB настолько планку опускает по сравнению с основной игрой, что портит ощущения от всей игры в целом.
Сюжет абсолютно на рельсах. Мир как-то ужался. Уровни уже за 20ый - всё в фарс превращают (ну потому что они ж вынуждены и противников подбирать под этот же уровень и ты просто по колено ходишь в противниках, которые предназначены для группы 20+ уровня, а это не бандиты или гоблины, про которых можно поверить, что они расплодились и постоянно попадаются).
Да и вообще мне кажется, что в ToB захватил власть ДМ, который пытался ""победить"" игроков и нравиться это может только людям со стокгольмским синдромом.

This game is lightening in a bottle in so many ways I won't even bother to go on about it as I've got water boiling on the stove right now for my hotdogs (already boiled off pot of water with my BG1 review.)

Out of all games, personally BG2 is the one i'm replaying the most and getting back to even restarting from scratch, that should tell something.

Great game played however you prefer, Solo, with NPC party, hybrid, coop multiplayer you name it.

Game is very intensive on save/load mechanic, take a few steps forward, if it's safe save, if failing something reload.

Perhaps having wiki at hand could help solving certain quests (you can miss out potential items or events or quest paths without prior research)

And also knowing the game mechanics, how Armor Class, THac0 and saving throws works, etc.

The perfect game imo would be the whole saga/story of the games merged into one, starting from BG1 and ending with BG2 Throne of Baal, but questing, pacing, narration, traveling with the style/design of BG2 (Shadows of Amn, not Throne of Baal), all Companion NPCs, items available in the saga w/ dismiss to tavern/camp option, not forced duo companions (Minsc/Dynaheir etc), companions interjections, dialogue and interactions and the Black Pits I and II being integrated in the main story perhaps as side epic quests or even main plot.

(Chronologically, Black Pits in BG1 supposely happen before or at the same time of the main plot since you meet Baeloth in the main story some time after the events of the Black Pits).",1628966320,1628987383,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I haven't played the game before and didn't have any friends who did growing up, so I didn't have any of the nostalgia factor a lot of the reviewers here seem to have.

I've played several modern CRPGs prior to this (Divinity Original Sin 1&2, Pillars of Eternity 1&2) which I think has spoiled this for me. Here are a few things that stuck out to me and ultimately led me to refunding:
- The controls are clunky at best, and usually very inconvenient. 
- The combat is _too_ true to its D&D origins. My first battle with 3 people vs a single imp took about 30 seconds due to the low accuracy of attacks.
- You have to really read a manual to understand what is going on
- The character creation process is (to me) silly long and complicated
- Can't resize the UI or resolution, so on high resolution monitors everything is incredibly small

The Enhanced Edition does full justice to the original and also adds some quality of life improvements.
You can enjoy improved pathfinding (still quite flawed but certainly much better than the original) and the quick loot function. As well as of course better graphics, some new characters and a few extra merchants.
There are still game breaking bugs, which is a joke. I had to use the console command cheats to make a certain dark elf appear where he should so I could advance the main storyline, and after Googling it, I'm not the only one. To have a 21-year-old remastered game still with game breaking bugs is surely a testament to how money-grabbing the industry is. But, don't let that dissuade you from playing such a great game.
This is def the best way to play BG2. I have the original on CD but I prefer this, and it's also a great introduction to the series if you're a new fan.

I started playing Baldur's Gate 2 when it first was released in 2000 and as I'm sure as many remember, installing the 5+ CD disks was a huge and time-consuming pain.  Technology has come a long way and the graphics of the current edition, although improved, reflects that it's a 2000 game.  But better graphics than Gateway to the Savage Frontier, however XD

The graphics, which should be expected to not be current (screenshots on the store page are accurate), is literally the only thing I find ""bad"" about this incredible game.  The companions, even the evil ones, are memorable, unique, and often endearing.  The main antagonist's intriguing plots weave though out the whole story so he doesn't just seem like a powerful and evil dick (he is, for sure), but also a thoughtful plotter who executes his plans with prudence and patience. 

Sometimes companions' combat AI gets a little wonky: setting Nalia's combat (playing her more of a mage class) as ranged when out of spells but she'll just use whatever weapon she's currently holding like her quarterstaff and whatnot.  Even still, the auto-pause makes this a minor nuisance at most.  

So in essence, I recommend this game for anyone who likes CRPGs with impressive story lines and memorable companions.  Super happy that this was re-released and optimized for modern hardware systems.

Maybe it's interface wasn't as braindead as I needed it to be.  Sadly, I quit playing because of this when I was first introduced to it.  What an idiot I must've been, and I cannot stress enough COLOSSAL moron as a video game player to have chosen Diablo II over this imaculate RPG.

The story, the characters, the depth, their ambitions and moral codes completely destroy anything Blizzard Inc. could hope to create.  I thankfully picked the game up later on, after the shallowness of Diablo II became apparenty.  There's no sense of actual creation with Diablo II. With Baldurs Gate II, it feels like not only have characters, their stories and towns been created, but they're infused with little things for you to notice as well.

It's 2021, so lets be real.  The graphics (being a game from 1999) are not top notch. If you can look past this (I implore you to do so, dont be me, the dumbass from 1999 that passed up this game as long as I did because of something so dumb). But I'll tell what else, they'll do the trick. If you're here to role-play or get the sense that theres a realistic world happening around your characters, grab this one.

Theres so much to do. So many different options. The writing is really top notch. I find myself cracking up at some of the conversation options. You can be good, neutral, evil, lawful, neutral or chaotic.  Whatever you so choose just pick something and start playing.  

There may be some.... difficulties at first (especially if you didn't know there was a difficulty slider available here.. christ it can be hard for a new player), especially with some of the interface and how character selection and inventory work out, but it'll become obvious pretty soon.

One of the best stories of all time from the Dungeon and Dragon universe, your character is the progeny of the ""Lord of Murder"" (someone call DFS!).  The lord of murder, Bjaal, was forced to walk the realm as a human during the time of troubles as were all other Gods.  He (in classic Greek mythology fashion) proceeds to get a LOT of women pregnant all over the land. Like.... a LOT.  Once he was killed, the siblings are forced to take eachother out collectively in order to turn into the new ""God of Murder"" prospectively, or to prevent there from having to BE A GOD OF MURDER.  Each sibling that is killed, the other become stronger.  Only one will prevail.  It brings together good and evil people from all over. It makes people crazy with the thought of that amount of power.  The children are all linked by some kind of telekenetic feeling that makes them capable of detecting others.  At the beginning, an evil mage has imprisoned you into his basement in a cage.  He does painful experiments onto you (hes goot a good reason, but it's a spoiler) in order to see if you truly are the child of this ""Lord of Murder"" you're supposed to be.  

Then theres some kind of conflict going on outside, and it seems like his little dungeon is getting invaded by some other group of shadowy beings.  In the chaos you're able to escape with your sister Imoen, but she is almost immediately arrest when you guys escape and she uses a spell againsts Irenicus out in the town square.  Since magic is illegal, 5 wizards transport in instantly and basically place the two in magic handcuffs so to speak, transporting them off elsewhere ONLY and I mean ONLY when John Irenicus has gotten bored of killing 13 of them without so much as the snap of his finger.

As the story progresses Irenicus speaks to you in hallucinations, dreams and visions you have through the game.  You're given the choice to do this quest and literally hundreds and hundreds of others when and if you choose.  The quests work pretty seamlessly and theres never really any SUPER boring moments to be honest.  Even when you're just buying potions, you're still bartering, asking questions around the tavern, resting, talking to prostitutes (it all plays out like a middle age Law and Order really...) and stealing other patrons things (should you choose to).  

Story scripts are told in a theatre like suspension of gameplay as well, and feel solid. The timing is good, and the wits the writers must've had had to be substantial.  The game offers fantastic difficulty or the easiest of cakewalks.  Very good voice acting doubles with an actual DUNGEONS & DRAGONS dice rolling system and mathematics behind the 2D rulesset literally being placed into a box on the bottom of the screen, so you can scroll up and see what did and didn't work, and why.

If you play D&D this is a nobrainer.  If you dont, pick it up and learn it.  It's a true to the core RPG with a fantastic character creation system, a ton of subclasses (OR NOT), and more.  On top of this is a great 2 full expansion pack games adding even more content. It'll take a year to get through all of it.  You'll thank me.

PROS:
Great roleplaying if thats your thing
Great action if it's not
Infinitely customizable option wise
Fantastic character creation and combat system true to the D&D core it's made from, but placed into a real-time-strategy style of game with pause and unpause for when things get too hectic

We set out one blissful night to the natural comforting sounds of Atlanta, shrieks & screams. To begin our quest together, we helped the Shadow Murderers or something do some things and I forgot the rest. Until, the Atlanta graveyard. 
There we descended into a waspy spiders-nest on the hunt for those that drink the body's natural wine, Nosferatu! As they slayed the Nosferatus, I valiantly stood by and got injured, doing nothing to help them or myself. But alas my inability to be useful (which I considered my greatest strength) ended up being my downfall. 
A Nosferatu disemboweled me because of my religious beliefs (which god? I could not say, I worship so many I can never follow just one) and I lay on the cold ground dying. When, all of a sudden, my friends and that rich lady came to me. They stripped me of my clothes and all my possessions, then loosely tossed them back on top of my person.

As a game in general the Enhanced Edition, Siege of Dragonspear and ultimately finishing Throne of Bhaal (been playing this game 20 years and ive NEVER beaten the final chapter, which is a game within its own right) if you like Dungeons and Dragons? Check. If you like Pillars of Eternity (imo the greatest Baldur's Gate spiritual sequel ever, Pillars 2 particularly.) If you enjoy infinity engine style games you will love this. If you like Diablo 1-3 style gameplay? You MIGHT, if you prefer story to crunching for items and money, you won't like this. If you prefer exploration and playing one of the games that put RPGs on the map? Yup. The story is compelling, your character is as interesting as player-toons can get. 

I recommend this and Pillars 1-2, Disco Elysium, Planescape: Torment (DISCO and PLANESCAPE being the most story-oriented where combat is entirely secondary), for slash'n'hack you will likely enjoy Torchlight series, Diablo 3 is fine (Torchlight is kinda more fun imo) and Path of Exiles is a great MMORPG Diablo-style game that works, and has a massive skill-tree per toon. Fallout 1-2, Fallout 3, New Vegas and Fallout 4 are all part of the spirit of the Bioware games of yore, to varying degrees, New Vegas is amazing (and I love Fallout 4 personally but it is more a first-person shooter, Skyrim clone)
Divine Divinity, Divinity Original Sin, Divinity 2.

MORE ABOUT BALDUR'S GATE TRILOGY (the original, BG + Siege of Dragonspear, BG Shadows of AMN and Throne of Bhaal which is what expansion packs often were, but this was so big (40+ hours) it was truly a game in its own right. Each game you start higher level and this one you have reached the heights of an Eliminster and Khelban Blackstaff. A Drizzt, and Barrabus the Gray (Artemis Enteri). In fact, you may come across some of these characters throughout the trilogy!  
I didn't want to spoil Baldur's Gate for those who havent played, needless to say there is A LOT to unpack with this game. There are well over a hundred hours in side-quests and NPCs that travel with you all have unique personalities, interact with each other.

 I recently started Throne of Bhaal with a high-level Chap 2 save from Shadows of Amn, so I hadn't hit the biggest parts of the party-NPC development. My character is role-played as a very chaotic yet good toon. He recruited his own ""suicide squad"" so to speak, of mostly evil characters. I did this as a roleplay choice and the banter is fucking fantastic. Hexxat the vampiress was my romantic interest this time around (she also is thirsty for Viconia's ass) Jaheria has a more classic RPG romance. Viconia's great. I'm not sure about the male ones i only tried Amonem which was....meh....

It is just an undying classic with almost endless replay value. Granted... the graphics feel old... and comparing them to modern titles like Pathfinder, Pillars of Eternity or Divinity Original Sin is just not fair. Nonetheless, old-style graphics are making a big comeback and I have to say, I still love the aesthetics of BG2, they are filled with lovely details. Every corner of the map has something to catch your eyes, especially on city maps, where you can even find hung portraits of the D&D cartoons series (among other easter eggs).

Another plus to this game is the huuuuuge amount of content you will find in it. Not only you will find books to read with endless forgotten realms lore, but also every unique object has a rich description that adds to this world lore.

Different companions and party configurations add lots and lots of fun interactions with you, with NPCs, and among them... starting hilarious conversations that are a delight (especially if you keep Minsc and  Boo with you, and maybe drop in a certain ""intelligent"" sword to the mix).

The character creation is a jewel on its own, with a massive selection of class and races choices, that will have a real impact later on in the game. This will make you want to replay as different classes many many times.

If you can't bear the 2D graphics then there is no way around it.... but I can't stop recommending this game to everyone!! It is with no doubts, one of (if not) the best RPG still playable by  2021 standards.",1621878066,1621878066,True,4,0,0.594943225383758545,0,True,False,False

Baldur's Gate II is a master class in RPG development. 

The game is densely packed with hundreds of random encounters, events and NPCs that makes it come alive. 

It also does some things differently from the other Black Isle games and on a much larger scale: there’s a much bigger focus on story, inter-party dialogue and timed quests.

When I was much younger, I absolutely hated the timed quests because I didn’t see the fun in pressure. It’s like, we’re off on a quest and something happens, and one of my party members has to leave, or something else happens and you just really have no choice but to deal with it, perhaps at the expense of something or someone else. Doing my best not to spoil anything. 

Now that I’m older, and perhaps a little wiser, I’ve come to appreciate just how well everything is handled and the decisions you must make. Quests have real consequences, can lead you down alternate paths, and where Planescape, Icewind Dale and Baldur's Gate are all fine games in their own right, Baldur’s Gate II might be the closest I’ve felt to a game replicating the feeling of adventure as if you're playing a real campaign. 

Some of the short-comings of the other games are still there, such as dialogue options sometimes not really fitting your character (having 5 different but positive responses to something my character is negative towards is just as annoying as ever) but even so, I am just blown away by how good Baldur's Gate II is.",1577637994,1621151335,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Like 100+ hrs in and I'm pretty sure I'm not even like a third of the way through the main questline. F*ck knows where my companion and that guy Irenicus have gone. Cowled who? Ya boi has already killed a dragon I met in a tavern, 2 beholders, a bunch of rakshashas and is currently busy trying to reseal some demon on the bottom floor of some 9 tiered murder house. The side quests don't even feel like side quests in the traditional sense with respect to DOSII and BGIII which have much more guided and linear storylines (even with their large areas to explore between parts). Like 1 hr in and having just left Irenicus' kink dungeon, I finally can go to the town gates to explore outside the city, but lo and behold during a quick stop in the tavern to rest, I discover a secret hole behind some random wall and get annihilated by some lich with timestop and immunity to all my spells, magical and normal weapons.

This game is excellent and although clearly dated in some respects (e.g. graphics), it has managed to perfectly recreate the very essence of playing D&D with a group, with new quests and hooks every session and things to discover and delve into in even the most mundane of areas. High level gameplay is an added bonus. My only real gripe (admittedly mostly my own fault) is that I have only ever played 5e and 1e pathfinder so I'm not too familiar with the intricacies of AD&D such as calculation of saving throws and class levelling.

The standard against which every fantasy cRPG should and is measured, this game sets the benchmark for excellence in RPG writing, voice acting and plot. Personally, I find the sprites, backgrounds and magic effects endearing and feel they still hold up.
Replayability is definitely above average as the sheer amount of companions and playstyles will keep you coming back (at least it does for me). Each and every companion has a clear personality and thanks to the stellar voice acting are believable and intriguing.
While I am more a fan of Shadows of Amn (the first and by far longest part of BGII), I find that Throne of Bhaal even though obviously rushed (some character portraits, like Balthazar, are just hliarious), presents a challenge to your group of, at that point in the game,  murdermachines and walking gods and also wraps the Bhaalspawn story neatly and nicely.

More subtle, less frequent, but successful in deploying characterization, interparty conflict, even romantic rivalry with the PC. Makes for a more dynamic, repeatable experience. Which is why so many of us have been repeating it time and again over the past twenty years.

It's pretty great. Better conceived than most modern games.  

Current run through is as a palate cleanse after playing Farcry 5 and New Dawn, two truly terrible games. Being able to return to this again and again over the years as an example of what storytelling can be is a relief from the onslaught of mediocre to bad experiences the industry has been churning out lately.

EDIT:
The EE stuff specifically runs the gamut. A bunch of quality of life enhancements in the UI. A character with a personal quest nearly as epic as Gorion's Ward. A character with a personal quest that gives you some of the best moments of character roleplay in the series. A character that's as bland, annoying, and superpowered as some of the worse unofficial character mods... that'll net you an early bag of holding, as an incentive to deal.

The extra stuff is of varying quality; some of it's better put together than others. But the ability to play through the old game without it is pretty well intact - so you can ignore the extra if you feel like - while still playing in ultrawide resolutions.

*****************

Ok, I'm leaving my original negative review up in the sake of fairness, but I'll give a legitimate review instead of the kneejerk one I had before at my current file getting messed up. Also to the developer, cool response. I'm not going to do any of that but I appreciate the info that the option is available.

Ok, BG2 is an old old old old game. I first played it I assume around when it came out and although I loved it, it had quite a few frustrating parts that caused me to set it down and never finish it.

Revisiting it a decade later, I find this to still be true. Certain aspects of the game I won't fault too harshly because it is indeed an old game and allowed to have a little grey in its hair for stuff we wouldn't necessarily tolerate in current games. For one, characters are slow as heck. This didn't bother me when I played the original version of this game, but now after the spiritual successors of this game such as Pillars of Eternity and such stepped in and offered the option to speed up the convenience of out of combat move speed, it is a little harsh. 

Also combat can sometimes be what I can only describe as 'anti-fun'. Even now while playing I only vaguely understand whether combat is failing because a monster is immune to a weapon/spell, or temporarily buffed and then what strategies need to be employed to work around it. Some people enjoy this. For me personally, I would equate it with someone sneaking homework inside my entertainment medium. Yes, I 'could' sort through the gish and find the 'right' strategy for this one fight, but I will then need to either make a quick reference guide of how to defeat every mage/lich in the game, or I will forget it between the next encounter. Honestly as of right now I just don't care and will either avoid the fight or cheese/cheat through it. This is a game I'm playing to fart around and hear fun interactions with well designed npcs and a vaguely whatever I want to do protagonist. I don't care to 'git gud' at this game. That's for competitive games, not a single player campaign.

At least one new npc that i've met so far is buggy. This was my initial complaint and negative review on the game, and honestly it was pretty disappointing. However it's not a dealbreaker, just make sure you have a 'real' save instead of just quick saves after major quests so you don't bust a blood vessel raging.

So all that aside. This game is fun. And it's large. And it's one of the OGs of the crpg video game genre so you should probably check it out. It has some great bits in it and some significantly less fun parts, but it's single player so my recommendation is just go ahead and use cheats. Normally playing DnD would have a dm to help keep the story on target and keep the fun going, so be your own dm and do what you need to to keep rolling through to the parts you enjoy.

So apologies for my initial salty downvote. The game really is a gem and the enhanced edition seems to have added a sizable chunk of some new fun. Good luck and happy adventuring!",1615122146,1615960240,True,0,0,0.45065760612487793,0,True,False,False

Your character is revealed to be the child of the deceased Lord of Murder (Bhaal), who was forced to walk the earth in mortal form and during this he was killed by a then-mortal Cyric, who took over his position (as well as those of a couple other gods who faced the same predicament as Bhaal). Naturally Bhaal was not the family type, so the purpose of Bhaals children was to fuel his rebirth (spoiler - they would be murdered in a ritual, which would make their divine sparks come together and re-form Bhaal. This is somewhat of a spoiler, but it is an explanation of the childrens purpose you hear in the intro of the game, so ....)
You pick one of a number of classes (not just the standard 3), from among which each has a somewhat distinct playstyle and most have sub-classes, which in turn further adjust the playstyle of the core class, meaning that the playthrough can be distinct every time you go at it. Furthermore - you can have a party of up to 6 characters (not counting summons, of which you can basically have as many as you can cast but they do not last forever) and each of those characters has their class, meaning changing your party will make you change your approach to combat and challenges. There is no diplomacy in the classical sence, meaning you cannot have an insanely charming character who will talk their way out of every trouble, instead conversations are directly affected by a characters Charisma attribute and indirectly by the reputation your party has accumulated (do good deeds, you become heroic. do bad deeds, you get despised and even hunted).
The graphics are ... pretty, but definitely not next-gen, so if that is important to you (more important than story and gameplay), do yourself and your wallet a favor and look elsewhere. While BG2: EE is a BIT prettier than the classical BG2: SoA (though the differences are truly minor and only visible when you really look for them), it is still a rather old game, released in 2000 on the Infinity engine, which is, by todays standards, very much finite (ba dum tss). However if you can pardon that you cannot see every strand of hair on your characters eyebrows (or pretty much any facial details for that matter), the colors and environmental effects are rather good, dynamic and responsive.
The story itself is one of intrigue and betrayal, further improved by the three new characters Neera, Rasaad and Dorn Il Khan (there were more in BG: EE - Baeloth the Entertainer, M'Khiin Grubdoubler, Glint Garndersonson and Schael Corwin. Here's hoping I got them all) which are all romancable and have loyalty quests, which further adjust their oppinion towards your character. There are also classical characters, which are a pretty colorful cast and provide further romance+story options. Each character seems organic and have oppinions towards you, reacting to your partys reputation. I have focused a lot on the characters, and as for the story itself - you find yourself imprisoned by an unknown mage, trying to make sence of what is happening and why. Going into this further however would be impossible without spoilers, which would be a shame. :-)

It is a big improvement over the first game. The game mechanics are deeper than a lot of RPGs being released today. Gameplay has aged quite well. I can clearly see how Bioware went from this to Dragon Age: Origins, one of my favourite games of all time.

The story is better than the first one and I really enjoyed the throne of Bhaal expansion. The Visuals are also better than the first one,

As I am among the majority of players who feel that what little they offer the game, is far outweighed by how out of place they feel. Seeing as they're written exclusively to cater to the 2010s AWFL sensibilities, along with their anoying way of forcing themselves into your party.

Pros
It's a long well written and fun journey.
There are many fun well written characters, both returning from BG I and new.


Cons
Gfx is still feels old even with the touch-ups.
The game is LONG, make sure you have time to play it to it's conclusion.
As with every other game in the genre, multiplayer is mostly cosmetic and genneraly not enjoyable.

Baldur's Gate 2 is more solid Baldur's Gate game-play.

This is good, but Baldur's Gate was better.

This is good, but unfortunately Baldur's Gate is not a game that can really be surpassed by any sequel, ever.

But this is still MORE Baldur's Gate, and if you enjoyed the first one then strap in for another ride.

...Be warned though, since you'll be very high level progressing through this game, and it is classic AD&D, so that means you best put on your best nerd pants and memorize the rule book or you'll find it very rough going. This is probably the biggest reason I feel this sequel isn't as memorable as it's predecessor, it likely presents too formidable a challenge for all comers to see through to the end, whereas the first Baldur's Gate was quite friendly to newcomers, being set at the lower end of the spectrum of difficulty encountered in the classic AD&D rules.

Still though no character configuration AI setting on any platform has ever came close to the old PS2 game Final Fantasy XII and the Gambit system they called it. The customization was the best I have ever seen.
But back to BG2, 
Be sure to have whom you want in your party before you head to save Imoen, you will not be able to go back to change for a good while. 
What can I say this is one of classics and after you play through the game you will get attached to the players. The fights can be really tough and I'm talking on normal settings. I remember there are several Lich kings ( I think they are) one is in a cellar at the beginning of the game as you go to exit the city. 
Don't even bother trying to kill it till you can cast time stop too. Once your wizard(s) can cast time stop you will be OP and should be able to handle the lich's in the cellars fairly easy, there are several spread out through the city, a quest to kill all of them too. It's some real fun battles, i think they are the most power opponent in the game except for the main bad guy..
Looking forward to getting the upgraded Icewind Dale too.

Even with enhanced edition, it remains extremely moddable for returning players and loses none of its original charm -- although, as a longtime player, I admit I found Beamdog's changes more annoying and weirdly out of place than interesting. Thankfully, if you're coming back for OG BG2, you can ignore most of it. Unfortunately, the EE changes do very little to make this game more friendly to new players, so it has a very steep learning curve (and the in-game tutorial is basically useless -- remember, this game originally came with a manual.

I am not a great review writer but, I hope y'all enjoy this game as much as I have. 

The only con I would give this game is that being evil is difficult. 
The choices are so damming each time, and the pros that come with it don't really match. 
The party members when Evil are very powerful but, you lose out on a lot of story if you choose this route. 

I like to keep it neutral or chaotic good, and it seems to be the best route.

Replaying the game again in the form of this Enhanced Edition was very enjoyable. Newer games have better graphics, but BG2 still has outstanding story, characters and combat. And there’s tons of content. It took me 64 hours to complete the main game, about half of which was doing side quests, and I haven’t started the Throne of Bhaal expansion yet, which adds around 20 more hours.

Combat is more varied and tactical than BG1, because your party can become much higher level, giving them access to more advanced spells allowing them to summon powerful demons, create poisonous death clouds, instantly kill enemies and resurrect fallen comrades. 

There are many different types of enemies to fight, including Human bandits and wizards, wildlife, giant spiders, vampires, demons, mind flayers, beholders and dragons. Many enemies can disable your party members with spells or abilities such as hold, charm, confuse or stun. Like many older games, the difficulty can sometimes be challenging, until you figure out the correct tactic. (My favourite moment of this playthough was after trying to kill a Black Dragon several times and getting my entire party slaughtered, I opened up the next attempt by casting Finger of Death and instantly killed it).

Although the party size is 6 including your main character, I kept swapping 10 different companions in and out of my party so I could do their personal quests. It feels like companions have their own place in the world, and don’t just exist to do your quest. Depending on their alignment, companions might not like each other and will argue among themselves as you wander around. On one occasion, two of my companions actually got into a fight, resulting in one killing the other. I don’t think I’ve ever seen this happen in any other RPG.

After about more than 200 over the entire series, I can safely say that these games are among my favorites of all time.

Pros:
- Wonderful voice acting.
- Lovable characters.
- Deep, tactical combat.
- Tons of interesting, varied quests that provide ample chance to roleplay.
- Deep, well developed villains (mostly).
- An Amazing Soundtrack.
And most of all:
- An insanely good story.

Cons:
- Some unbalanced encounters.
- The expansion, Throne of Bhaal (the conclusion to the series), felt rushed at times, and has some unpolished aspects (though overall, it was one of the high points of the series).

Near every aspect of this game feels polished to a degree that I'd never seen before in an RPG.
Unlike traditional JRGs, *every* quest feels developed, has twists and turns, and is backed by interesting NPCs.

Overall, this game has raised my standard for RPGs in general.

-REVIEW-

If there's one thing I've learned about video games(and movies for that matter), it's that the sequel being better than the first entry of a franchise is not the most common thing to occur. These first chapter hits are often so good that any planned second chapter tends to have big shoes to fill. And that's not even considering the expectations of a potential THREEquel.

Despite this, there have been sequels that have absolutely nailed it in terms of quality, going on to be even better than the original, a feat made all the more impressive if the first title was amazing to begin with. From classics like Diablo 2 to more modern day hits like Divinity: Original Sin 2, when a sequel continues the greatness that the initial game started, it really helps the franchise as a whole become that much more well known.

On that note, let's talk about a sequel so amazing, it improved on the original title in literally EVERY SINGLE FACET: Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn. In this title, you reprise your role as the Bhaalspawn, a child of the Time of Troubles moving steadily closer to his/her ultimate fate. You saved the Sword Coast from the machinations of fellow Bhaalspawn Sarevok. You took part in some stupid siege that no one really gives a crap about. This time, you are sidetracked by a vengeful wizard, seeking retribution against his kind, but not before taking a very personal interest in the power of your soul. You'll reunite with old friends, meet plenty of new potential allies, and go on a grand quest throughout the land of Amn, in hopes of stopping this new threat from wreaking havoc on the world. And even after that's done, you'll jump into the Throne of Bhaal chapter, a finale in which you and five other bhaalspawn wage war for the ultimate prize: to become the new Lord of Murder.

Sound exciting? Well, you better believe it is. Out of all the stories I've seen in any RPG, this is easily one of the best. While it continues the tradition of an over-arcing main quest peppered by numerous side journeys throughout, the overall layout is brought into much better focus: rather than traveling the main road for a while, then veering off to some lesser duties for extra levels and goodies in a random manner, the main quest will start you off with a jaunt through an opening dungeon, then surprise you with an objective that REQUIRES exploration and completion of other quests. It might sound like an irritating wall to deal with, but it actually does a great job of building anticipation in the player to see what the next big chapter is like, while going on some of the best quests any CRPG has to offer, gaining new equipment, resources, and party members along the way. Better yet, the big city of the game is treated as a hub, rather than a late game objective, letting world travel feel smoother and less jump-crazy.

While I can't say too much about the story for risk of spoiling(I really want you guys to enjoy this one!), I will say that this game also plays host to my absolute favorite villain in gaming. Irenicus just has it all: a dastardly personality, a powerful motivation, and fantastic writing and dialogue that almost makes him seem like he's ""helping"" you at certain points, only to flip your table with a crazy midstory reveal. There's no doubt about it in my mind: today's RPGs could learn a lot from this game's plot.

Of course, there is still a game to play, and surprise surprise, it's much better than the first game. Admittedly, I'm still not a big fan of this franchise's 2nd edition AD&D ruleset, but the good news is that you start at a higher level, giving you a chance to really experience the powers and spells that this game's character classes have to offer. This higher power ceiling closes some of the balance gaps on each class(not all of them, though!), and the expanded list of abilities make for some very exciting and fun strategies to try out. Naturally, this is a good thing.

Especially since this game is hard as balls.

No, not Dark Souls hard, not even close, but newbies and veterans of 2nd edition AD&D will definitely be put to the test with some of the deadliest enemies this game can(and will) throw at you. Beholders, liches, vampires, fire giants...make no mistake, the CPU is an absolute villain of a DM and will make every attempt to punish any mistakes you make. Throne of Bhaal is an especially rough doozy, so don't feel too bad if you need to tone the difficulty down some.

In terms of looks and sounds, Baldur's Gate 2 easily picks up where BG1 leaves off. The music is just a feast for the ears, with tunes that symbolize calm ambiance, epic battles, and everything in between. Vocal performances are also given more notice, and darn near all of them are phenomenal. It certainly doesn't hurt when big names such as David Warner, Jim Cummings, Heidi Shannon, Melissa Disney, Jim Meskimen, and many others fill in the vocal gaps. The graphics are also wonderful, unsurprisingly, though I also have to give credit on dungeon design; the infuriating maze-like layouts from the first game(remember Firewine?) are much fewer and farther in between, allowing for easier exploration. That, and these locales-no, ALL locales are freaking beautiful. Yeah, the 2D sprites still clash with the background a bit, but that's a meager complaint, and even then, some new sprites, such as Athkatla's guards, pirates, and vampires look really cool.

As a 35 year old, this classic game, among others, holds a special place in my heart. It isn't perfect by any means; the ruleset is still outdated six ways to Sunday, the difficulty can be brutal enough to even be a bit unfair at times, and we even have those...UGH, Beamdog companions gracing our presence, but aside from those issues, the game is still an unforgettable piece of gaming history that ANY fan of CRPGs, D&D, or any games like that should definitely give a try. Baldur's Gate 2 is a reminder of not only how awesome games were in the past, but also how they should be done in the present and future. A toast I give, then, to a CRPG that knows how to tell an amazing story...as well as the eventual full release of Baldur's Gate 3, and the hope that it will continue this franchise's amazing journey.

BG2 contains about as much story content as modern RPGs. If should therefore be very approachable also for younger players, and if you run into trouble, there is an active community and lots of information available online in the form of wikis and walkthroughs. About 20 years after release, only things like the UI appear old.

Although most of the game takes place in a fairly large, open environment there is not the same sense of exploration as in BG1. Dungeons are vastly improved - places like Ulcaster from BG1 look very shallow in comparison. Encounter design is also better, but not quite on par with the IWD series - hardly a surprise since IWD is focused on tactical combat over interactive story.

The Enhanced Edition bundles the original game together with the expansion ""Throne of Bhaal"". This continues after the end of BG2 and offers a culmination to the story which started in BG1, as well as interesting encounters and high-level AD&D gameplay.

As far as ""enhanced"" features go, the main important additions deal with graphics - scaling the UI, resolutions, et cetera. The added companions are a bit cringeworthy, but also eminently avoidable. Overall, I see little reason to play the original when the Enhanced Edition is available. The only negative thing I can think of is how certain portraits of non-joinable NPCs are very grainy.

This is not the first time I've played the game (I owned the originals when they were first released) but it has been over a decade since I last played. 

Regarding the basic game (ignoring the Enhanced parts):  This is THE rpg game for me.  I've played others, but in the end Baldur's gate  saga is the standard to judge by.  BGII is the best part of the saga with so much to explore! Lots of choices you can make, companions to meet, and things to do.  So many so that you can replay and get a completely different experience just by changing what you want to focus on.  In addition, if you are willing to get BG as well  then you can experience the full character arc, from lowly waif that needs to be careful of what you engage until you become an epic character from legends.  

Regarding the enhancements:  bottom line is that they are worth it.  In particular, adjusting to modern screen sized, changes to inventory management, quick loot, etc.

I think ive spent at least 60+hrs just doing side quests in the main city Athkatla, barely even touching the main story. These side quests aren't generic at all either, they're all very unique, with their own interesting characters, objective, enemies, and puzzles. And this is only on Chapter 2 out of the 6 main story chapters in the base game (Shadows of Amn) There's also an entire expansion that continues you and your parties adventure (Throne of Bhaal, its 3 chapters).

You can have romances with party members too, and every possible party member has a very solid questline that you can follow and there's so many companions, there are 17 recruitable characters in Shadows of Amn. All of them with their own personality, alignment, class, etc. The party members even have dynamics with one another, some of them may actually attack and kill one another, or challenge you for the affections of another party member. 

The combat is great to, it plays pretty much like 2nd edition D&D. It can be very difficult but is rewarding as hell, plus you can cheese a lot of fights, or play at a lower difficulty if you just want to experience the amazing stories. There are plenty of spells and abilities at your disposal (Especially if you're a mage or cleric), with sometimes pretty cool interactions with your spells on certain enemies/in certain situations. Not on the level of something like Divinity: Original Sin, but still pretty cool. 

The amount of care and love that went into this game is tangible its ridiculous how much content there is, it feels like a truly epic Lord of the Rings-esque adventure. I suck at reviewing stuff but I love this game so much and there's so much that I haven't touched on, you can find a much better review/synopsis on Youtube or something. 

Also you don't need to play BG1 before you play this, there's some references/returning characters/bits of story that are cooler if you've played the first game, but you wont be lost in the story. The game does a good job of catching you up on the events of the first game.

 Archers are still brokenly powerful, if not as bad as in SoD with the extra perma-bless and perma-chant objects on top of gauntlets of weapon expertise.

My biggest objection at this point with the story are the plot holes they left with the reconstructed Soul Taker dagger and Skie from the end of SoD. They really NEED to offer some kind of sub-quest to restore Skie and get her back in the party if you want her. It'd be nice if they added an alternative path for Clara (Hexxat) for those of us who want her on hand and not the vampire. 

Last, but not least, it'd be nice if they offered some player choice options on the classes of the available NPCs. Minsc, even though I loved him to death when I first started playing BG at 13, is not an efficient character in the least. Rangers are best suited to dual weapon fighting (for melee) and you have no choice on being able to focus him on that path, in the one game that really pushes the envelope on available one-handers (From the axe of the unyielding to the flail of ages). 

Then add in that both Keldorn and Dorn are better suited for greatswords, leading to a lot of competition for available greatswords.

Dunno, just feels like characters in multiplayer are always going to be superior to single player, just for the option to have a Fighter on hand who can actually use the legendary Halberd you just got, or get a Sorcerer, or whatever.

edit: The Firkraag encounter needs to be fixed s that true sight functions correctly and reveals the dragon for what he is in the copper coronet. Same for the fight he instigates.

Yes, if you have your old game CDs or buy the updated GOG version you can MOD the heck out of this game.

Its isometric view and in Baldur's Gate 1 apparent lack of content; a game which is just a precursor for 2 basically, like a little taste of what is yet to come needs some getting used to and patience to get to 2 basically but once attuned and adjusted for tolerance, engaged and open to the experience you basically get a very lengthy, thorough, deep and methodically complete package that excels in ways to make the game feel more like an excel sheet of information, for It 'reads' like a book.

All thus so sayeth the great Alaundo.

You don't 'play' it you try to comprehend and understand it for its basic mechanical appeal adds a very great added value to it. You are in control and you manipulate the game in steps. You [i]sway[/i] the player characters and other allies like NPC's into victory. You create the world by letting events unfold. This is really interesting.

 Not to mention all the interesting depth of characters (creation), (enthusiastic) enhancements and (other) magic(s), items and armor. Even the game User Interface: it's quite overwhelming and maybe little bit off putting to a lot of people, but hold your ground!

This game is really immersive and huge basically content wise and delivery wise, it's what's expected from it. It's what's expected from you: to try and master it. You got to understand that this game I think came about when such complex pieces of work really weren't an usual ordeal but had a good potential to shine through and hence therefore are brought forth into existence presented in a very convincing fashion that you'd almost dream it a plausible place. The world breathes, it lives it cycles, it dies.

There is really an amazing world at your fingertips basically filled with micromanaging, tools and loot at your disposal. 

The game is linear however, even though you may choose to partake in it in whichever way you see fit, the truth is that in order to progress the game's events are tied into the story which itself is bound to chapters that you have to progress through in order to make progress and going or turning back at any point doesn't feel necessary because there's nothing there once you cleared out all the monsters and achieved all the quests and objectives.

Needles to say. 

The game is full of content, and exploration and exploring next to the basically smooth combat, which may not seem at first that way until you familiarize yourself with it (and the games inherit Real-Time with Pause function) brings fort an explosion of impressions to tingle your senses and keep you thinking. I think that it is appealing for a really wide and huge audience because the game itself when looking at it from out one piece is like a masterful theatrical piece that just thrusts you through the emotions, ranging from good to bad but everything in all, it's really a masterfully crafted experience that I think a lot of gamers should give a try.

Its now 10/25/2020 and the last patch was sometime in 2018.
I really regret giving them my money they are not worth it.
I already had the original and it always worked perfect. It is the original. Yet they broke spells and other things and never bothered to go back and fix them. Yet they will take your money anyway and give you a game in worse condition than the original.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The original  game works better in some important cases.
For me its spells that do NOT work like they did in the original  game. They are  bugged now.

Spells like  minor drain and vamparic  drain do NOT even heal you when you  use them right now you only do the damage to the enemy but gain zero health.
I complained MANY  times about it and still after over  a years time they still have not released another patch. 
I mean really... it bothers me that they know some spells are broken but will NOT take the time to simply fix them so we  can enjoy the game. These simple things could have been fixed and updated in out game a LONG time ago but they apparently care less about all the people who spent money on the EE of these games.  I mean it  feels like a slap in the face honestly because many of us already own the original game and did not need to spend  our money on these EE versions.

There are many side quests for people who love them, and the game is so long that at the end the beginning seems faint, as if you truly completed a massive adventure. The number of companions that are available and the depth of spells and options is far better than many modern systems, which tend to make everything fit into a small box.

I've always been a huge fan of table top D&D and was exposed to this game briefly as a child, but never played it from start to finish myself until now. It has aged, but it is doubtlessly worth a play. The number of small events that happen in the various areas that just add flavor to the world is awesome. There are so many little things that are completely unrelated to the main plot that make things seem so realistically written. The world turns and sometimes you just happen to be around to witness it.

I generally play CG characters, so I didn't feel it was limiting but it is evident that playing evil and experiencing the plots of the evil companions is difficult to manage, which is unfortunate as I like to see all the story I can.

I only come away with two complaints:

I think Baldur's gate 1 had much better traveling rules, as you need to unlock zones into order to be able to reach them in Baldur's gate 2. Any real character should just be able to freely traverse the map - zone unlock requirements are not fun.

The combat is honestly just not fun. Every ""difficult"" enemy just uses abilities that are cheap and annoying such as full immunity to X or Y and other mechanics with very forced responses.",1602956251,1602956251,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is everything that so-called RPGs of more recent times have forgotten: not defined by skill trees, vapid dialogue, time-wasting errands or how big the world is, but by its unparalleled depth, insane replay value through class variety and actual choice and consequence throughout the world.

[i]""Ah, the child of Bhaal has awoken.""[/i]

Awakening to a cold cell deep beneath the city of Athkatla, far to the south in the nation of Amn, you find yourself in over your head once again. It seems that no matter where the Bhaalspawn goes, fate and the latent power in your blood has a way of catching up in the end. After escaping, your path is set to figure out just what brought you into contact with this ""Irenicus"" you keep hearing whispers of... and what exactly the powers that be have in store for you.

Whereas some games would require you to collect 10 magic testicles to get a new skill point, nothing in [i]Baldur's Gate II[/i] ever feels like tick-a-box filler. There are straightforward quests to encourage exploration around a town or region, long dungeon crawls that can push the party's limits, ongoing intrigue in the main questline and it's pretty much enthralling the whole way through.

It genuinely feels like you're sitting round the table with a really good group and the DM is at the top of their game.

The writing in particular is a significant step-up from the already great original. There's meaning and motivation to what both the player does - regardless of your alignment - and Irenicus himself, an antagonist that just might be one of the all-time best. Instead of tired black-and-white morality, there's complexity to most of the major quests without ever straying into edgy territory... not to mention plenty of humour to make sure the game never takes itself too seriously.

Of course, a lot of this investment in quests and characters is due to the voice acting. From the gravitas of David Warner as Irenicus, stealing the show every time he's on screen, to Grey DeLisle as Viconia, Jim Cummings as Minsc, Heidi Shannon as Jaheira... the range of characters here is simply stellar, even minor NPCs. 

BioWare understood that great games weren't about flashy visuals, throwing twists in left and right or setpiece after setpiece, but about the [i]characters[/i] that elevate the whole experience. This is precisely why games like [i]Baldur's Gate[/i], [i]Knights of the Old Republic[/i] and the [i]Mass Effect[/i] trilogy endure to this day. 

[i]""Evil, meet my sword! Sword, meet evil!""[/i]

Much like its tabletop origins, simple moment-to-moment interactions can vary wildly depending on the class you're playing, contributing to that all-important depth as a party of mages compared to a party of fighters approach an objective in different ways. Progression is [i]earned[/i] and, much like tabletop, it feels great.

You, your class, your choices and the people you travel with actually matter. Cutscenes don't just talk about how great you are or hand a power fantasy to you on a silver platter, you actively work at getting better and soon those beholders fall as quickly before you as the gnolls a few levels back. There are far-reaching consequences to some of the decisions you make, right down to companions potentially leaving or dying.

Everything in [i]Baldur's Gate II[/i] is on a bigger and better scale than the first game. More companions which are far more fleshed-out, more quests with more varied locations, more loot to make different classes feel valued... it's a rarity among so many derivative titles that have tried and failed to capture the magic of role-playing games in the years since.

And this is before we even get to Throne of Bhaal. Ever hated how in RPGs, the game seems to end just as your party becomes powerful? No opportunity to actually [i]use[/i] any of that sweet loot or abilities you've been working your way up to? 

Well, [i]Baldur's Gate II[/i] has an entire expansion that allows you revel in end-game goodness; playing with forces of creation, evolving gear and spells to new heights and battling demigods as who will mantle the new Lord of Murder is decided once and for all. Not bad for Gorion's Ward, hmm?

So what about the negatives? 

Beamdog and the Enhanced Editions have been criticised for adding in new content to the much-loved original release, particularly a bunch of new companions. You might love them or hate them, but I don't really mind either way. Mods have long been a staple of classic BioWare games. If you're offended by characters simply existing then there's not much point to interacting with any sort of fiction, but there's nothing stopping players from, you know... just not recruiting them.

Pathfinding continues to be a frequent issue for the Infinity Engine games. This is more of a problem with large parties, but it can be a pain to watch characters gyrate on the spot after getting stuck or be blocked from entering a new area because everyone's clumped together and trying to move in a tiny space. Similarly, inventory management is time-consuming until you get a Bag of Holding, but most players will be travelling with a group to split the loot anyway. Overall, however, these complaints are pretty arbitrary.

[i]""L'il alurl! For Shar!""[/i]

[i]Baldur's Gate II[/i] is not perfect, of course, but let's be honest... who cares when the rest is just so damn good? The golden age of BioWare delivered the closest experience to a great tabletop game that we're ever going to get and it's aged beautifully, even 20 years later.

As it stands, we're only a few days out from [i]Baldur's Gate III[/i] entering Early Access. Larian has done a lot to prove themselves as the new poster child for cRPGs - not to mention just being a great and friendly dev all round - and the IP couldn't be in better hands. 

We'll see what the long-awaited follow-up to this timeless classic holds, but if you have ever enjoyed an RPG, jump in and take your character from Candlekeep to the depths of the Nine Hells.",1601631692,1601631692,True,25,0,0.729492604732513428,0,True,False,False

BG2 is still the standard and precedent for Isometric RPGs. It has had and continues to have major influences on the genre(s) today, and in many cases it still does it better.

BG 1 and 2 gave me everything. Great story, writing, character development... the list goes on. Has a lot of ideas that went into games. For examples, Star Wars: KotOR and the Mass Effect series and its choices matter mechanics. Masterful voice acting (""GO FOR THE EYES, BOO!"").

BG2:EE adds some welcome quality of life improvements, and better support for modern systems. It also adds some new class kits, characters, quests, and a short side campaign ""The Black Pits"". Some of these are hits and others are misses, but none detract from the original BG2 experience.

I measure my life in roman numerals past the infinity game engine era. Yay I tell thee that the life of a review bard is fraught with danger. Ever lurking the trolls around every corner.  But upon the VIII fortnight past the year of our lord infinity engine, a white night arrives to carry the legacy of the well formulated and perfectly articulated review. It is Alas, they will write ballads about his grandeur and ability with the quill. Let him set right the woes of Baldurs gate and dispatch the evil trolls. Below are not the words of a mere mortal such as myself but that of a review god and lord of cringe, Alas himself. Ever vigilant to delete any single comment that dares defy the poetry of his reviews:

""Shortly after remastering the seminal first game of the series, Beambog strikes back, this time with an Enhanced Edition for Baldur's Gate 2. The game itself needs little introduction. It is the culmination of the Infinity Engine era, the grand finale to the storied Bhaalspawn saga and one of the finest cRPGs ever made. It offers a compelling main story, as our hero's divine heritage comes to the fore. An excellent and nuanced main villain that himself became an icon. Long and engaging side quests coupled with some great dungeon crawling. The game remains a must to this day. Yet, this is not a review of the game, but of this Enhanced Edition. So is it the way to go?

Unfortunately the Enhanced Edition proved a rather poor package. Coming in hot from the previous game I was hoping to see improvements here also. Indeed, this version offers the same graphical enhancements as with the previous entry and the same QoL additions. But they are not enough. The sequel plays differently to the first game, there is a lot more magic and modifiers here. The EE does nothing to make them clearer. The ""improved"" interface falls decisively short. Even the quick-loot enhancement that worked great in the previous game is not up to par here, not with the increasingly complicated encounters. Even the portraits for the new characters don't seem to fit the art style of this game. They were made for the EE of the previous game and not retouched here.

It gets worse when you consider bugs. Some bugs were corrected but not really as many as I would have hoped and on the other hand new ones were also added. Yes, this is a complicated game. Yes, it makes sense there would be difficult to trace and correct bugs. But that many? I encountered broken dialogues, broken quest markers, a broken journal and so on. I even encountered bugs that were noticed years ago and yet still they remain. What have you been patching all these years Beamdog? How about some proper fixes already? Having to do some ini editing to get the game's speed to acceptable levels, like with the first game, is one thing. But all this is another. I had to quit the game a number of times because I encountered a black screen when changing maps, I even had a CTD. Shame.

Then we have the new content that comes with the EE. As with the EE of the previous installment, there are new companions and they have their own quests. Sadly, the writing of these questlines is completely subpar. In some cases, such as Hexxat's storyline, painfully so. It doesn't help that the game throws those sidequests on your path, to make sure you don't miss them. Or that your options are more akin to yes/no/snarky. As if I'm playing some poor Mass Effect outtake. It was shocking to see content so bad that it actually detracts from the whole. Also it is completely incomprehensible why the need to include it. If they wanted to add things there is a ton of promising content the original developers had to cut due to time constraints back in the day. Minsc's questline, or Viconia's for instance. Add that.

I am rather surprised this ended up being so critical. I will repeat, none of this is about the game itself, except perhaps some of the bugs. Baldur's Gate 2 is one of the finest games ever made, to this day, 20 years since it was released, it remains the standard that isometric epic fantasy cRPGs are measured against. But this Enhanced Edition is a disappointment. Beamdog seems to understand the first game a lot better than the second. They should have recognized that and not messed with a classic. Like with Torment, they should have stuck to refreshing and fixing, nothing else. But that was not the case. So bad Beamdog, bad. Maybe there is no other way to experience this game. If so, you will have to swallow the bitter pill. The base game is worth it. But this EE on its own merits, I can't recommend.""",1599498143,1599498143,True,1,0,0.386463284492492676,0,True,False,False

Perhaps this time I'll make a Tom Bombadill character... ""Hey dol, merry dol. ring a dong dillo! Tom's going home again water-lilies bringing.
Hey! Come derry dol! Can you hear me singing? Come derry dol! Hop along, my hearties!
Hobbits! Ponies all! We are fond of parties.
Now let the fun begin! Let us sing together!""......Sorry sometimes I break out into song.

Baldurs Gate II is an excellent Dungeons n Dragons type game that set the standard back in the day. DnD made video game, and done damn well. 
The plot and characters are interesting and neat *Bender takes a picture*.
The writing is hilarious. Plus there's plenty of other cool things for you to discover, like secrets and hidden treasure across the world. 

There's tons of different classes and kits, you can dual class or multiclass to make just about any kind of character you want. 
BGII also brings massive improvements to the playable classes/kits, compared to BGI some kits were quite under-powered in more ways than one. BGII has done quite the good job in fixing and improving upon what was already a standard-setting game.

I rate this game 10/10 & highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a great RPG, roleplaying, brainstorming and testing character builds, exploring a vast world with secrets you can easily miss, or perhaps discover.",1596164852,1598916395,True,4,1,0.566994667053222656,0,True,False,False

1. The ""enhanced"" ai. Every single encounter acts like a party. Mobs will often Kamikaze past your fighters to get at a squishy target. Kind of ruins immersion when every encounter is this kamikaze crap especially when you know it happens so you just work around it and leads to more kiting rather than standard D&D fights, The worst example a dragon chasing around imoen who was standing way at range for 20 seconds ignoring my fighters (it died and this ""enhanced"" ai led to enhanced stupidity). 

2.  The AI cheats. Sure the ai pre-buffs and casts spells in a sequencer that you can't. That was in the original. However, a dragon casts entangle you are entangled. Your druid casts entangle and you are not because you have negative saving throws and no malluses on your characters. I have tested this. I can only believe this is a new addition with the improved kiss chasing AI and now AI get spells with buffed difficulty checks. This is dumb it means the players cant make informed decisions. Games and DnD in particular are interesting as players can look at the rules and think their way into ways to win. Hidden special rules are dumb. In addition you will not always be informed about what you rolled (even when enabled) to ""fail"" the unfailable spells so you can't know the chance you will fail a difficulty check. Say you get charmed  maybe by an impossible charm. How many spells do you need to use to counter charm a character? Well now the frequency of this event has changed so the risk benefit analysis an informed player can make gets thrown at the window and you have to just prepare for blanket immunity to spells to which you are basically or already immune.

Pros
-The story is easy to get in to and even if it's pretty simple it's told in a very captivating way, and the characters really elevates it.

-Well written characters and dialogue.

-Great voice acting.

-Great music.

-Great itemization. Good loot is rare but really good when you find it and doesn't become useless just because you gained a level.

-Beautifully illustrated world to explore. If you're not used to the dated look don't be surprised if it grows on you.

-This game is huge, and combined with the first game the complete adventure is massive. On top of that there's a lot of replay value here. Many different classes and sub classes, alignments, character specific quests etc. I've gotten many hours of quality entertainment out of a really small amount of money.

-I really like the real time with pause battle system.

-Great lore, you'll find it everywhere.


Cons
-This isn't a con really, more of a heads up: Some people seem to be able to just figure things out in game as they go. But for me, the high level second edition DnD rules on the Core rule difficulty setting really required knowledge of the mechanics of battle. Which I didn't have when i started with BGEE. I was used to hand holding, which I did not get here :) Once you get to the higher levels in BG2EE a lot of enemies have immunities and offensive skills that required some reading up on what spells I had to use, how the dice rolls worked, why I turned in to a squirrel etc. Things like THAC0 felt counter intuitive as you may have heard. Eventually it clicked and I started to really enjoy it, but in the beginning it could feel a bit tedious and confusing. If you don't like having to use a manual or a wiki I'd definitely go for one of the smoother difficulties and just enjoy the story! I highly recommend looking at the pdf manual, you can find it for free here on the store page of the game. This youtuber also does a great job of breaking down some basics and has a couple of tutorials, here's one (this is for BGEE but was helpful for BG2EE aswell): 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsCyHIRTw9U

-Really a small thing: the pathfinding can be annoying sometimes.

-I had a bug where my journal didn't work properly, which almost turned out to be game braking but there are solutions to it. I've made a post about it. I have seen that there are other bugs but that's the only one I had.



I know I've talked a bit about BGEE in a review of BG2EE but I think I wasn't alone in debating weather to play the first before the second etc. I think playing BGEE and exporting my character to BG2EE really enhanced my experience with the latter and I absolutely recommend starting from the beginning. But I've seen many say they really enjoyed the second without playing the first. As a whole these are my favourite games of all the games I've played, and I think the first one is the favourite of the two. As I said, the low level 2nd edition DnD rules are quite different from high level rules I felt, which affects gameplay. The first game felt more calm, is more about exploration and starting in humble beginnings and the second felt more focused on questing, the relationships, banter and was more action packed. They are both amazing at what they do so it just comes down to what type of gameplay you like.

Companions were fun and felt pretty 'real' as in they have their own agendas sometimes. The story was pretty okay, a little generic. Worldbuilding-wise it was enjoyable, my first Baldur's Gate game and won't be my last. The lore was rich and I can tell there is real depth to it.

Dear God.  I had to cheat to finish off the last boss.

And that there, I have never in all my life seen a bigger pile of luscious, steaming, finely textured, and pronounced bullshit. 

The whole game you go through and each boss still essentially works on the same rules you do. Maybe they get a few unique add-ons.  But the game goes out of it's way to make every encounter basically work under the same rules.  Then you get the Mellissan fight and F*CK HER.  

Four Boss fights back-to-back, with no chance to rest and waves of enemies in between, and waves of enemies during.  F*cking hell.

...

I looked up some walkthroughs, and I guess they balanced the fight under the assumption you'd heavily specialized the whole game and knew your builds and knew to cheese the boss with Rogues. Or had played the whole game with Mages and knew all the overpowered spell combinations.

But I'd played with a paladin that basically steamrolled everything and my general strategy was to summon help to back him up and let the fighters do all the hard work the old fashioned way- with a frontal slog.  And the final boss was simply not well built for a simple meathead like me. Not to mention all the huge monsters meant that I lost track of every character in the melee.  

I wanted to play some computer DnD, not Mosh Pit Simulator.

=sigh= so my foray into Baldur's Gate ended on a sour note.  It was fun, up until the last quarter of throne of Bhaal, and I learned a lot about game design from it, but by god, it was a slog at the end...

[h1] Baldur’s Gate II: Enhanced Edition Review | Arcade Theory [/h1]

Once again, I find myself writing a review for the Baldur’s Gate series, though it is not for the first game: no, it is for its superlative sequel, Baldur’s Gate II, enhanced, yet still a classic. What can be said that has not been already said about this game? Well, a lot of things. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to write a review. It is very much like the first game, using the same D&D ruleset (2nd edition) and mechanics, except it improves on what BG1 had to offer, making BG2 a much more engaging game for me. Stay with me, dear reader, for I shall share with you the insight of what 52 hours have revealed to me.

I hope you have played through the first game because Baldur’s Gate II starts off in media res with you imprisoned inside of a dungeon. The Siege of Dragonspear expansion fills in the missing gap between the first game up to what led to your capture. To put it in the immortal words of Dorothy, ""We're not in Baldur's Gate anymore!""

Despite the game still having the eponymous name of Baldur’s Gate, you are many moons away from that city. No, the dungeon that chains you resides beneath the Amnian city of Athkatla! As it turns out, being in a city of a different nation means that no one there knows you—perhaps they have heard of your deeds, but they don’t know you. And so, you start off once again as an almost literal nobody, forced to rebuild your reputation as either the Hero of Baldur’s Gate or the Butcher of the Flaming Fist; really, you messed up big time if you had a bad reputation in BG1.

Fortunately, you’ve nothing to fear from the Flaming Fist in Athkatla. Instead, your main source of sorrow will stem from the Cowled Wizards of Amn, a cabal of wizards that forbids any unauthorized use of magic in the city. Translated to gameplay, you can slaughter citizens to your heart’s desire with no complaints from the Cowled Wizards, but Gods forbid you decide to use a knock spell because you lost the key to your home in the Slums. Not to mention that with every attempt at travel across the city you risk an ambush by the local thieves’ guild. Welcome to Athkatla.

Mechanic-wise, it’s the same game. Almost. There are quite a few improvements over the first game that serves to maintain our sanity. In Athkatla, most of the districts of the city are fully revealed. That means that although there is still a fog of war, you don’t have to traverse every inch of the zone to know where things are. In fact, you can open your area map and it will label the significant buildings of the district right away. Speaking of labelling, the districts of Athkatla have names now. Whereas in Baldur’s Gate the districts are referred to by cardinal and intercardinal directions (e.g. northwest Baldur’s Gate), in Athkatla the districts would be dubbed with names like the “Bridge District” or the “Temple District.” It is much easier to undertake quests in the city when you actually know where you’re supposed to go.

On the topic of going places, the overworld map design is similar to how SoD did it. There are no longer any forested buffer zones that you must trudge through to get from one location to another—good riddance, I say. The encounters you could find in those zones were interesting, but many of them were spread across a large area that was at least 80% filler. And who could forget Cloakwood? Five different zones you had to go through for a single iron mine and you’d have to be blessed by Tymora to not be waylaid and forced to defend yourself. I give thanks to BG2 for saving us from such shenanigans.

When I first began the game, I had a specific party setup in mind, mostly comprised of the original gang of BG1. By the end, however, I found I had adjusted my party multiple times throughout the run: there was just too many companions I found interesting enough to keep in a single party. Compared to BG1, there was more party banter to be had with each companion, either talking directly to you or with other members of the party. As with the first game, the banter can just be pure fluff or lead to two companions forming some sort of bond or feud, the latter potentially ending with the coming of blows. Besides improved interactions, the quests they offer feel more involved, in some cases spanning more than just one quest such as Nalia’s family affairs or Neera’s fight against the Red Wizards of Thay.

Romances are also officially a thing with BG2: the original BG1 had none at all and the romances of the enhanced edition served only as a taste of what BG2 could offer. I won’t go into any specifics, but the romances add additional party banter and provide a mini-storyline that transfers over into the Throne of Bhaal expansion. They aren’t necessary to pursue, of course, but they do add some finality toward the end of the game. All in all, nothing but straight upgrades toward companions. They still have the abysmal pathfinding issue where they merge together into a single entity, but we learn to accept that it happens and move on.

I spent 25 hours before I finished the second chapter. There was just that much content to go through outside the main storyline. Most of the quests aren’t simply a matter of “go kill this monster” or “go fetch me this item” as you always have people to talk to and different paths you can take on a good number of quests. There are many more voiced lines of dialogue compared to BG1, with some NPCs being or nearly being fully-voiced. It’s great because there’s a good chance the nobleman NPC you’re supposed to talk to for a quest won’t start off his dialogue with “AWAY WITH YOU, PEASANT.” My two favorite NPCs in this game are a spectator beholder and a flying imp called Cespenar. The spectator wasn’t voiced, yet I could clearly feel his pure, unadulterated mordancy stemming from being bound to guarding an unwanted chest for decades on end. As for Cespenar—who you meet in the expansion—he is quite … conspicuous, to put it nicely, but he is almost fully-voiced and is a break from the usual demeanor of the characters you meet. He also likes shiny ones. [...]",1594322239,1594322239,True,4,0,0.568029582500457764,0,True,False,False

If my co-op buddy hadn't bailed on me because he didn't like the graphics...I'd have a lot more hours invested. Couldn't bring myself to go off into the dungeon solo...

From combat, to character development, to exploration, to party composition, to story, it really has it all. The graphics are outdated and it has a difficult learning curve, but it's well worth the extremely cheap price tag for the countless hours you could spend on this highly replayable game.

Firstly, this game is for those who like to put a little effort in and get a lot of reward out. The learning curve is pretty big, especially if you're into more casual games/rules such as 5th edition D&D. BG2EE is based on 2nd edition rules of D&D, which are more complex and in-depth, yet balanced to a point where most, if not all of the game can be beaten with the right preparation and a little insight (or online research heh). For example, one might find themselves in an infinite combat loop with a troll. Did you bother to look up how to kill a troll? Try some fire damage. Do you find that your melee characters never seem to be able to damage shades? Try using a +1 or better weapon. You see my point. I'll go over the aspects of the game that really shine, and some of those that don't:

Combat: Out of all the turn-based RPGs I've ever played, this game is probably the second best in terms of combat (Dragon Age: Origins takes the cake there). I am biased, as the combat system is VERY tedious. You will find yourself pausing frequently to prepare your next cast on your caster/cleric or to re-position your melee out of AoE damage or to block the path and mop up hits so your casters don't get obliterated. That's putting it very simply. However, though the combat aspect of this game is very tedious, it's also extremely flexible and can be whatever you want it to be. Feel like soloing everything on an all-powerful sorceror? Go for it. Want to cheese by pre-casting web and summons to keep your enemies rooted and distracted while you blow them up with fireballs? That works too. Luckily, you can always check your combat log to see what you're doing right or wrong, and the game is resource-efficient enough that any major mistake can be quickly corrected by a 2-second quick load. SAVE OFTEN.

Story: Like combat, the story in this game is what you make of it. Want to play a  maniacal despot who only wants to see the world burn? Roll a chaotic evil character. Want to play a defender of the down-trodden who seeks justice for crimes? Play a lawful good character. The game will morph based on your actions, and your alignment will shift as you make different decisions as will the favor or lack thereof of your party members and society in general towards you. Regardless of the decisions you make and the company you keep in your party, the game will always have fulfilling dialogue and consequences. I highly recommend keeping a full party of obtainable party members for your first 2 playthroughs so you can get a taste of the true depth and connectedness the game has to offer. I recommend doing a good playthrough then an evil playthrough to see just how different the game can be. Jan Jansen is my favorite playable character by far, and he fits well in any party, so make sure you pick him up. The final and greatest aspect to the story is that is evolves as your character does. You come out of the gates killing whimpy normie bandits and by the time you are nearing the end of throne of bhaal, you're killing demi-gods. Final piece of story advice: do your best to make your party happy so you can complete their individual stories. Some of the best content is from playable companions, especially Dorn il khan if you're evil and into bands like Pantera or Slayer ;)

Adventure: For a game so old, you'd think it would be pretty small and/or short. Nope, this game lasts 60+ hours in a wholesome playthrough. During that time, you'll go from cities to sewers to the underdark to lost ancient elven cities and some more really cool places that I won't spoil. Though the game is showing its age, I still find lots of enjoyment in the immersive sense of place that the visuals and audio effects develop. You'll go from feeling safe in a tavern, to feeling overwhelmed because you haven't seen a vendor in 10 hours after fighting your way through hordes of baddies and are running low on supplies and space, to excited because you just completed one heck of a tough dungeon and have finally reached the light at the end of the tunnel, to hopeless because you've been stuck in a dungeon for a day and every time you seem to progress there's a bigger and tougher enemy right around the corner. My advice: When you get to the overwhelming and hopeless points, either go with the flow and keep pushing forward til you can't no more, or turn around and find a different way to proceed. There's almost always more than 1 way to skin a gopher in this game, sometimes it just might require a bit of thought.

Class / leveling: Learning how the class system works and how levels fit into that is almost as daunting as learning the combat system. However, once you learn it you can make some awesome party compositions. I prefer to run 1 ranger, 1 cleric, 1-2 fighters, 1 sorceror, and 1 thief (the insanely balanced composition). You should absolutely dual or multi-class some of these, and try to base your main character's class around what doesn't get filled by the in-game companions based on your alignment. I highly recommend doing research on good companions to have for your character's alignment and how to milk the most from them class-wise. You don't want to end up half way through a playthrough having to restart or lower the difficulty because your 3 fighters cant get close to a powerful sorceror enemy. 

Now for the not-so-good:
Graphics: Yup, this game is 20 years old. It's probably older than most people who will read this review. I remember sitting next to my dad while he was playing the first BG, and he'd tell me to cover my eyes every time it booted up because I was in kindergarten and couldn't watch the original cutscene where Sarevok crushes the dude's throat and all the blood pours out. The fact that its a 3rd person iso game doesn't really help in the graphics department either, but I believe that's actually contributed to it aging so well. If this were a first person RPG, it would be unplayable without mods because you wouldn't be able to tell what's on your screen (Morrowind, anyone?) Regardless, the graphics aren't that great, but that's really not what this game was ever about. I find the poor graphics to be more of a blessing than a curse, as it keeps the download size small and the CPU/GPU/RAM running nice and smooth. Nobody likes loading screens, right?

Difficulty/learning curve: Like I said, it's a game that takes a bit but gives a whole lot more. This might be the only game I haven't been able to beat on the hardest difficulty on my first real attempt. I got stuck on a certain dragon in a certain cave that drops a certain insanely powerful weapon and can't get out. I have yet to go back and do a legit completion on the hardest difficulty, which I look forward to. If you like a real challenge that might take hours but will give you some fat loot and exp, BG2EE is for you. If you're more into casual games where you don't use your brain at all and can effectively turn yourself into a real life NPC, I highly recommend animal crossing.

Baldur's Gate 2 will always hold a special place in my heart. The amount of TLC put into literally every aspect of this game is something that puts modern devs to shame. Nowadays, we're sold re-releases of games that look pretty but don't even run (rip warcraft 3). This game re-released still looks like garbage but plays like a charm. Buy it.

[h1]""We are all heroes! You and Boo and I!""[/h1]

What could I possibly say about Baldur's Gate 2 that has not already been said? The CRPG genre is arguably the most storied and respectable in the medium, and among all CRPGs, Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn has long reigned at the very top. A reign that was, until very, very recently, entirely unchallenged. Developers looked at Shadows of Amn and cowered: they wouldn't even try to make a game as ambitious: it would be too difficult, too time consuming, too expensive. BG2 set the bar for the entire Western-style roleplaying game genre, and that bar has not shifted one micron since.

So why is Shadows of Amn so great? You likely don't need me to tell you. It's a brilliantly constructed RPG that offers the player a ton of choice with regard to play style as well as their path through the narrative; the writing and quest design is second to none, and the quests are some of the most memorable the medium has ever produced. The game is also well and truly massive, with a first time playthrough easily eclipsing 200 hours. With unique content that can only ever be experienced by specific characters, including but not limited to multiple companion romances, player stongholds and quests.

Further, Shadows of Amn is almost single-handedly responsible for creating what we now think of as the modern WsRPG. Romances weren't really a thing until BG2, or strongholds, or party banter. When you walk through the ruined cities of Ferelden in Dragon Age, listening to your party members chat about the area you're exploring, you have Baldur's Gate 2 to thank. When you delve into complex character-focused sidequests in Mass Effect 2, to learn more about your companions and strengthen your bonds to one another, this, too, is the legacy of Shadows of Amn. It's importance to the genre cannot possibly be overstated--so, please, mistake nothing I say here for hyperbole.

[h1]""The eyes, Boo! Go for the eyes!""[/h1]

To quickly delve into the nitty-gritty, a big part of Baldur's Gate II's appeal lies in its adaptation of the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2.5 edition ruleset. There are many different classes, subclasses, and dual-class combinations to experiment with, never mind hundreds of different spells and abilities: multiply this incredible build diversity with six different active party members, and you have an incredibly complex combat system with countless permutations and near-infinite potential strategies and tactics. That Baldur's Gate 2 has endured for so long at the pinnacle of the genre is not simply due to its unforgettable storytelling, open-ended quest design, and memorable characters: the combat is also among the most complex, engaging and rewarding the genre has ever seen.

[h1]""Magic is impressive: but now Minsc leads!""[/h1]

Which brings us to Beamdog's enhanced edition. If the original game is so great, what exactly is the point of the enhanced edition? Well, that is a very good question. Strictly speaking, I do not think Shadows of Amn needed an enhanced edition at all, and the additions Beamdog made to the game largely feel superfluous at best (and at worst out-of-place with the tone of the original game). That said, some of the improvements are quite welcome: loading times between areas have been greatly reduced and, most importantly, the game now properly supports modern high-resolution displays without breaking the intended ""zoom level"" as was the case with HD mods for the vanilla Infinity Engine games.

That said, if you'd rather experience the original game in all of its unaltered glory, if you buy the Enhanced Edition(s) on GOG, you will also get access to digital copies of the original games.

I should also point out that the enhanced edition here includes the Throne of Bhaal expansion (perhaps my younger readers here will be more comfortable thinking of it as DLC, but it's effectively the third and final game in the series). While Throne of Bhaal doesn't exactly rise to the same level of quality as the base game, Shadows of Amn (of course not: nothing does), it still provides a remarkably compelling conclusion to one of the greatest RPG sagas of all time.

The quests in this game are very well written and feel like mini campaigns, and the way they blend in to one another is incredible. The way that bg2 hints at what to do or where to go is perfect. They give you just enough information to investigate a quest. Theres not a quest marker that points you in the exact direction for you to b-line to, nor is it too vague that you have to look at the wiki every 10 minutes. Its a perfect balance. 

The game is so well written that i see a ton of value in replays, because theres so many choices that you simply miss out on with one playthrough

There are a ton of companions, each with a really unique and vibrant personality, as well as their own questline that will flesh out their character even more. You'll find yourself constantly switching out companions to for new comps and quests, which is super refreshing.

Really I only have two complaints with the game. 

One is simply the age, at the time of writing this review, bg2 is 20 years old and it shows. The ui is clunky and is missing basic qol features. The graphics are what you would expect, and the pathfinding is not good. 
The dialogue system is not the best, they give you a ton of dialogue choices, which is great, but i wish there were skill checks of some sort or an alignment check.

My second complaint is that the learning curve is fucking steep, and bg2 does not even attempt to explain how to play. I would recommend having a dnd 2nd edition book with you at all times to for help. Theres a ton of spells, each serve for a specific purpose and if you dont know how to properly buff your party and debuff an enemy then youre fucked. bg2 expects you to already know how to deal with magic res, liches, trolls, and a many other dnd mechanics that can be frustrating to new players.

BG II has a more complex combat system due to the higher levels of your characters, especially when it comes down to spell casting. The huge array of spells is what makes the encounters in BG II so engaging, whereas in BG I it’s mostly a few spells that you need to use to combat magic users.
Story-wise, BG II aims at being more epic by serving you liches, dragons and extra-planar creatures, while BG I mostly offers just ogres, bandits and creatures you would typically find in a medieval fantasy. Still, I would argue that the story of BG I is more elaborate and thought up. The Sword Coast is also more open-world than Amn – this quasi-linearity of Shadows of Amn was one of the things that disappointed me greatly during my first playthrough 16 years ago. Throne of Bhaal is even more linear, and it feels more like Icewind Dale.

Maybe they'll say ""for it's time, this was a brand new feature"". That doesn't really tell you anything though, does it?

Both gameplay and story have something in common - they meet you where you are. Want something silly? Done. Want something serious? Do it. Want something challenging? Got it. Not sure what you're doing? That's ok. 

That's why I replay this every few years. As a kid, I wanted maximized characters of ultra power. As a teen, I wanted that grim story. As a young adult, I wanted the ridiculous humor. Lately I appreciate more depth than I remember the story having. In every case, it has more than just ""something"" for me, it has a whole game for me. I keep playing because a storyline I forgot about turned out to have more depth than I remembered. Or because a character I usually don't use has much more interesting events, quests, and interactions with other characters than I expected. Or because I found a way to build an unorthodox character, or an item that is more useful (or less useful) than I thought.

The game is like an old city. Sure, the facade isn't modern, some of the design can seem uncomfortable, and it isn't exactly like what you're used to. But it's rich in history, every corner has something that'll fascinate you; even if you sometimes need to use your imagination to grasp the implications of what someone said. After a little while, you'll settle right in and appreciate where it's coming from. It won't replace the modern comforts you're used to, and you don't have to play it religiously to ""get"" it. But visiting it every now and then will make you appreciate it on a level that you can't get from the drive-through experiences on offer.",1590037077,1590037077,True,76,0,0.889423787593841553,2,True,False,False

The Enhanced Edition DOES NOT update the character, NPC or monster sprites so everything is blurry, pixelated,  and fuzzy just the backgrounds are improved. On high end screens its really noticeable. And during combat sequences its a blurry mess, can't see who is fighting who and it can be made worse by big health bars above mobs. Turning that off doesn't make it better and then you can't tell how bad something is damaged. There is also no way (as far as I can tell) to determine how powerful a monster is before you engage it. so Save often and restore is only option.  The User interface is clunky and aging and I've had to many times google how to do various actions. it just wasn't clear. 

Combat is NOT turned based really. this is a real time game, with the ability to pause it (a lot of you like, via events).  There are AI scripts but have no idea how to use them and can't seem to get them to be different across the group members. Another google I Suppose. 

On the other hand, the story is great, the character interactions are great,(even members of party talk to each other) the depth of gear and magic is what you'd expect from D&D great. I Can see why once this was a great game.

This is my personal favorite RPG of all time. If I could take one game to last me the rest of my life, this would be in the top few choices.

You can literally spend over 100 hours in chapter 2 if you're meticulous like I am.

Its so massive in scope, so exceptional in its details, and so dense in content that you cannot afford to miss this if you've never played BG2 before.

There are a couple very minor complaints I have thus far. Its possible to get your party stuck in the ee version when trying to go through a door such that you have little choice but  to reload. But, this has only happened to me twice.

If you already own BG2 and TOB you don't need this. But, you'll have to find a mod to make it fit all monitor resolutions and you'll miss out on some new content and (minor) fixes.

Don't forget to look at the tweaks on gibberlings page for even more depth or difficulty.

Most other things did not work for me though. The story was not engaging for me, I felt like it was a bit stale and all over the place in terms of tone and esthetic, between steampunk and high fantasy and folk myths and sometimes caricature. The game mechanics for the most part I found frustrating and not immersive.

I have to admit it's probably more of a 'me problem', as I tried a bunch of similar games new and old, by which I mean isometric RPGs with DnD mechanics, and I have yet to find one I like.

Unfortunately this so called ""enhanced edition"" is not. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Most of the content added by beamdog is buggy. 

- The new companions are pretty useless. You get a Monk who is just plain bad and a wild mage which is a hell of annoying character. The bear is just out of place and why should someone take a pure thief, when you can have it combined with a mage or have a bard instead? The blackguard is ok but also not that usefull since he has about the same roll as Sarevok in ToB. At least his companionquest is pure evil, which I liked. Sadly also pretty buggy, especially in ToB.

- The personalities of the new characters are not very compelling and in some instances the story completley ignores them, whereas the old chars get involved. Which shows how lazy the new content was designed. 
There are free Mods for new companions which are far superior written and implemented in the game (even befor the EE came out!).

- I wished just for one thing for an enhanced edition: a better PATHFINDING! But it got even worse since partymembers now can stuck in each other, which was not in the original version of the game.

There were parts that were buggy, there weren't very good online guides at the time. It's built on AD&D (DND 2.0) which is harsh and unforgiving. Coming back to it now though, it's an incredible game. The detail, the stories, the characters, it's all great. What's amazing to me is that I don't hate the graphics despite the age. Give yourself time to get through the first dungeon, and when you break out into the open world, you'll find a rich, immersive place to play with. I recommend that as you have questions, you look up the rulesets. Things like ""Clay golems are immune to everything except magical blunt damage"" are not exactly intuitive if you did not play AD&D.

That said however, it is like playing a D & D campaign and it is fun (once you get to grips with the interface, spells and movement).

In the last few hours I have learnt to scout ahead plus pause to consider my tactics and setup before launching into battle. Of course the saving after successful encounters and before a tough fight are a must in a game like this (unless you are good enough to go rogue).

For such an old game the price (£16) seems a little high but I am getting value for money from the gameplay and enjoyment (especially as the cloud save allows me to play on my laptop and at home on desktop) - they must be selling enough copies still or the price would have dropped right?

If you are looking for a fun D & D rules rpg while you wait for Baldur's Gate 3 to make early access, don't forget you can always request a return within an hour's play through Steam (an hour will be plenty to know whether you like it or not) - but don't waste too much time in character setup).

Be aware:
This game takes ""a few"" hours to play through. And I recomment to play Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition before playing part 2, and then import your Chars from the first part into the second part.
This game took me over 100 hours to finish. Together with the first part, you might need 200 hrs if you also go for the side quests, which I recommend.

All in all this is based on AD&D / D&D rules. During playing you should make use of the huge base of information among the internet, when you have problems with certain things. For example some enemies might be immune to certain weapons and the game won't tell you, what you need. You can have a try on your own, but you also can search for the information or simply use your rule books and monster manuals, if you are a rolepay veteran and still have all the cool books. ^^
DON'T HESITATE to search or ask the big fanbase, if you have problems at some points from time to time.

For the big final of the saga I recommend to use a walkthroug if you feel the urge to get the super good ending.
You will have to answer a few questions to a celestial creature during the end of the game and your answers will determine which ending you get. (good, evil and averagely good/normal)
It is easy to determine, which will be the evil answer. All other answers sound more or less normal / good. It is very hard to determine, which answer is meant to be the absolute good one and only one out of several answers is the ""correct"" one. If you want the good ending instead of the normal one, you will easily fail to pick the right answer and it will require you to replay a few HOURS to make up your choices again.

So if you absolutely want your personal saga to end with the ""best"" ending, you should read a walkthough to know the ""correct"" answers. Would be bad if you played 200 hrs. and then didn't like your achieved ending.
If you are fine with whatever you get (either ending will give you it's own achievement), then just go ahead and make up your personal choice.

Multiplayer:
You can play this alone with just one character. This will give you the opportunity to gather a party of six characters throughout the game. But don't exchange them to often, because you will want to level up your party in order to be able to fight the stronger monsters towards the end. It will make your game pretty difficult, if you exchange a high leveld party member with some low level guy you just met on the street.

However, you can pick up new party members for quests, thou, and later on remove them from your party again to get back your original members. But you better write down where you can find them. They will tell you, when they leave the party.

The other option is, to start a multiplayer game. You still can play the campaign as usual, it's the same game as in single player. But a multiplayer campaign will grant you the opportunity to start a party with already six members that you have completely casted by your needs. My recommendation => Re-Roll your attributes until you have at least 90 - 92 points.
A party should always have a thief, one or maybe two sorcerers and one or two clerics that know healing spells.",1587029950,1587029950,True,0,0,0.399677008390426636,0,True,False,False

Baldur's Gate 2 is a traditional DnD RPG game, with good story telling and your decision forms the character you are, and it's your world.
It also has a great depth in combat strategies: your knowledge and strategy greatly affects the combat results.

However it's also a very hardcore game, you may abandon it in the first 2 hours without coming out of the dungeon. But once you see the light at the end of the tunnel....""You dare to attack me here? Do you even know whom you face. You will suffer, you will all suffer!""

I got this game to scratch an itch that more modern and online rpg can't quite reach, and to learn more about DnD lore since I play more Pathfinder. The game follows the rules of DnD 2nd edition, which uses terminology that could be confusing for the modern 5h edition player might not get (believe it or not, 200h + of game time and I only know that your armor class needs to be low and not high, without knowing the actual mechanic)

Micro management is a big thing in this game, even more so if you love spellcasters. You can, however, let the AI choose its own way of fighting, but it generally won't touch your spell list too much unless it's to cast an Healing spell a bit too late for your survival, which is why certain things are better left in your hands.

The game may be old, but the story holds up with a nice cast of side characters that you can eventually recruit and exchange in your party, each having their own personality, goals and quests. Each quest gives life to the game in different ways, may it be a revange plot, the pursuit of power, a rescue mission, etc.

There is so much to do, and many side stories and quests with interesting characters. There is intrigue throughout, and difficult choices are presented to you soon after you start. The designers did a remarkable job and essentially contrived the isometric CRPG genre with this game.

It may seem sacrilegious, but I have to say I could have done without ToB. Sure, it ties up some loose ends from Baldur's Gate, but its one big smash-fest. It moves very quickly from one battle to the next. It seems like the story is rushed and culminates into one of the most difficult battles that I barely squeaked by without cheats. This last battle seemed more like work than play.

Since it all gets bundled together now, I wouldn't worry that much about what to play. Frankly, if you only played Shadow of Amn you would get the best of what Black Isle offered in one game [with the exception of Torment, which was another high point in the CRPG genre, but for different reasons].

You have to remember this game came out nearly 20 years ago, and it was the only game in town that scratched this particular itch. Now, with so many other choices of games that have evolved from this masterpiece you only have so much time to play them all.

I bought the EE version years ago on steam, and revisited it very recently. My latest Fighter was imported from a character file and dual classed into Mage, and leveled to unlock as Fighter Mage. However, my HP was an alarming 41 HP, while my Fighter had 120 HP before dual classing. i imported my character into a new game and the HP became  88HP.  I have tried easy and normal settings, and i made sure the Hp rolls were maximized in Gameplay menu. 

If anyone knows of a fix for this, please let me know. Otherwise i advise everyone to stay away from this game. A great game, but ruined by bugs. Abysmal really.

Thanks to jedi_master_edward_ala, I had downloaded EEkeeper to try to resolve this, but the HP remains an issue even when values were manually corrected.

BG2 is only a bit more linear (for the main story) than an open-world, but you have plenty of moral choices/freedom, optional side quests and choice of companions.  I recently finished Pillars of Eternity 1 (which I loved) and am now playing B2 :P. 

I mostly offer set-up/tech tips below that I feel are important.

[h1]IMPORTANT SET-UP TIPS[/h1] 

[b]Sort of turn-based if you want[/b] : 
In the settings, you can make the game auto-pause at the end of the round of each party member, so it really becomes the equivalent of turn-based.  
- You can also turn off companion AI if you want (with a button on the UI), so you can micro-manage all their moves and spells. 

[b]Difficulty[/b] : if you play tactical and with pauses, the Normal difficulty is too easy.  The Core (AD&D rules) difficulty is the base difficulty in reality.  I find it offers enough challenge. 

[b]You can activate an indicator or preview of the size of area-of-effect[/b], 
but this is a more recent feature that is not yet visible in the game settings.  
It must be turned on within the file baldur.lua in your Documents folder 
(just look for Show AOE within that file and set it on). 

[b]The message and combat log window can be re-sized[/b], by mouse-dragging the corner, 
but it is not obvious at all at first glance! 

[b]FPS 30[/b] : if you alter the FPS, it speeds up in the in-game time ; not joking.  At 30 FPS, 1 combat Round is 6 seconds (if you see a duration called a Turn, it means 10 Rounds).*  You can push your FPS to 60 using your GPU Control Panel, which logically will make Rounds last 3 seconds (which is fine I guess if you use auto-pauses).  

nb: 
* 1 minute (1 Turn or 10 Rounds) of real-time is actually 10 minutes in-game time. 
* 10 minutes (10 Turns or 100 Rounds) of real-time is 100 minutes in-game time. 
Time in combat is therefore not meant as realistic: real-time is just converted x10.
Pausing (spacebar) is therefore useful. 

[b]Health bars during combat are useful[/b] : it is optional, but health bars can appear (only during combat), which allows you to see if enemies are bleeding or hurt; otherwise you cannot tell (it is oddly within the Graphics menu).

The story is very good and has one of the best antagonists I know. The world is full of details and small things, so that exploration feels rewarding.

What makes this game different, is the quality. Every single room is unique. The story is incredible. The artwork. The music. The voice acting. You can't play BG without proper sound. 



Modern RPGs have voice acting over every script line. And they talk so much shit you end up skipping through it. This game has voice acting over the parts that matter. And man, does it have an impact. The rest, you need to read. It is very, very well written. The characters...I mean, Gorion. Minsc...

If you are a fan of the Forgotten Realms, this game is for you, it is ram-packed with lore and small little things that makes the setting unique. While yes, this is merely a remaster, the changes made to the original makes this 20-year-or-so old game makes it actually playable with today's standarts. The art is beautiful, the story is great, and it has those dreadful THAC0 rolled for you (i hate THAC0 if you couldn't tell, it was so uninstinctive on paper).

If you are not familiar with AD&D rules (which this game uses, with some adjustements to make it work on a video game), then fear not, you can also play this game with a casual approach. Or go the full hardcore route if you like the challenge, where every tactical decision can make or break your party.

The strong suit of this game is storytelling and it's main story (definately recommend playing the series from the start but not 100% required), and the fact that it is one of these rare if not the only (counting BG1) good Forgotten Realms game, in my opinion.

Do I recommend this game ? Well, it depends, if you are there just to hack'n'slash, it wouldn't hurt to skip it, though i'm sure some might find what they are looking for in this. If you are here for story and specifically a good Forgotten Realms game, then this is a no-brainer it's a must-have!

New playable NPC Neera, her quest has so many dialogue-merry-go-rounds and completing her major quest leaves several minor quests impossible to complete. I had to use console commands to summon NPCs as they vanished, not due to bugs or anything of the sort, but the narrative simply causes them to disappear.

Neera as a character feels like a downgraded Imoen for people who wanted to romance Imoen but were not allowed to because of -reasons I will not spoil- or for people who are unaware of the Imoen Romance Mod. I'll cut the writers a bit of slack as writing a good Chaotic Neutral character can be challenging.

With new playable NPC Rasaad's quests, dialogue choices, like with Neera's quest, are very limited in terms of choice-and-consequence and just overall flavor. Very bland interactions and questionable dialogue choices, including one that imitates a southern Baptist church goer (oh lawdy lawd, preach it, etc.) The main hook of his quest line is fine, great even, and Rasaad himself as a character is enjoyable, but unfortunately the writers only seem to have a grasp on the bigger picture and little else.

Out of the additional content you'll also get new items and extra loot to sell (suddenly Deidre's items don't seem so overpriced) so you'll potentially have more incentive to play other classes and maybe recruit NPCs you ignored in the past you monster.

If you've never played the BG series, the Enhanced Editions are recommended as playing the original versions requires finding a torrent (but if that doesn't bother you, there are communities that still play the original versions). If you've played through the series time and again, you're not missing much with the new content, so unless you want to try one of the new Monk kits or the Shaman or you're just curious to see how badly Beamdog will drop the ball on Baldur's Gate III if things keep going this way, I can't recommend it.

Painfully, I'm going to give this version of Baldur's Gate II a thumbs down. My reasons for this are a general dissatisfaction with the additional content added, a lack of a 3rd option to rate the game in the middle and to to hopefully send Beamdog a message regarding their handling of the game. Credit to Beamdog for bringing in an easily accessed version of the game that runs smoothly. Personally, I wish they stopped short of adding new kits/classes and items.

257350,57566590,76561198016512011,0,44,2264,0,2224,1613285554,"A note about my play time: I played this game when it originally came out and sunk hundreds of hours into it including Throne of Bhaal.

The story picks up after a period of time following the first game. A wizard named Irenicus has captured the player character (PC) and the game starts out during a torture session in Irenicus' dungeon. The dungeon is attacked by thieves, and the PC takes that opportunity to escape along with some familiar characters from the first game.

The Beamdog expansion for the first game, Siege of Dragonspear (SoD), attempts to explore the events between Baldur's Gate 1 and 2. The first game did not end with the PC being captured by Irenicus, so it comes as a bit of a surprise. I was disappointed with the events described in SoD as it didn't really explain much of the storyline. The explanation seemed shoehorned in at the tale end of the expansion. However, the story of Baldur's Gate 2 is exceptional.

Storyline: The storyline is a lot of fun. Many of the side-quests in this game are great, but the main story is very strong. I'll not put any spoilers here if you haven't played it. The entire Underdark section of the game is incredible. If you haven't played the first game, you'll miss many references, but should still have no problem following the plotline.

Level Advancement: Moving from the (roughly) 7th-level cap of the first game to the second game (which caps at level 40 with the Throne of Bhaal expansion) opens up countless options for character development. One of the charms of the original game was the relatively low level and the real feeling of power which came with each level. In Baldur's Gate 2, the sheer number of levels makes advancement feel less significant than in the first. That being said, your character -and party- becomes incredibly powerful (especially spell-casters). I don't use the term god-like lightly.

Travelling Companions: Imoen is a great character. Without spoiling too much of the plot, she leaves the party shortly after the start of the game. Be prepared for that. She is an excellent thief/mage, but you won't have access to her until several chapters into the main story. In fact, you could spend a hundred hours before even getting her back if you do a large number of side quests. Minsc is a great character to have along. Jan is also a lot of fun. The game isn't so difficult that you must pick a specific group of companions, but certain party compositions can be A LOT stronger than others. The party interactions are one of the shining points of this game. Having evil characters alongside good characters can create issues within a party. Some of the best banter is between disparate character types, but unfortunately the banter can lead to lethal blows. Pick a general alignment type and stick to characters of or close to that alignment.

Side Quests: As I mentioned before, there are a lot of great side quests. Some of the larger side quests are the strongholds available to the player. Each class has a Stronghold accessible by that class. Fighters get a large castle, mages take over a tower that phases between planes of existence, rogues take over a thieves guild hall, etc. The quests can be difficult to achieve at lower levels, but they are usually manageable. There are additional quests available as the owner of the stronghold. For non-stronghold quests, there are general side-quests as well as companion quests. Some of the companion quests are the best in the game. As a shift from a lot of other CRPGs, most of the quests are not of the fetch and/or kill variety, but more like investigations that may involve fetching and/or killing. The murders in the bridge district, the circus taken over by a psychotic wizard, and the evil cult in the temple district (the latter two quests tied to companions) are very well written.

Difficulty: This game can be very hard. In most cases, difficulty spikes are due to one of two reasons. The first is quest availability. Most quests can be taken at any time regardless of the difficulty. Some of the earliest quests available culminate in very challenging battles against dragons. The second is based on enemy locations. In some areas, there are high-level or well-composed groups of enemies that can completely destroy your party with ease. Some of these are in otherwise safe locations within Amn (like several enemy groups in Inns). Exploration isn't exactly punished in this game, but these can be frustrating battles if unprepared. Expect to spend multiple attempts on some of these fights (or send in summoned monsters for easy mode.)

A Negative: This game expects you to know what is coming up. Without proper foreknowledge of enemy tactics, some of the battles can be very difficult if not impossible. In BG1 and in this game, many enemies that can use petrifying attacks or death magic can completely end your game without warning. This leads you to want and/or need to save scum through certain dungeons. The dice rolls may also not go your way making generally easy fights seem overwhelming or impossible. There is a bit of trial and error in this game, along with random events. On the plus side, some of the random events (especially wild magic surges) can be incredibly entertaining.

Music: It's great. Enough said.

Sound and Voice Acting: Some of the banter of and between party members is really good and really funny. Overall, the voice acting is believable and engaging. The sound effects are sufficient if a little dated now.

UI and Controls: The addition of a ""highlight objects"" button is welcome in the enhanced edition. Being able to see where all the items (hidden or otherwise) are located, really helps. The UI is serviceable but a lot of the spell icons get a little samey. In fact, some icons are used for multiple spells or spell-like effects. This can be a bit cumbersome. The controls are usually good, but some of the mechanics in the game are strange.

Stealth: It's broken. It's broken in a good way and in a bad way. The stealth can be so good you can move around an entire area map without ever being seen. It can also fail miserably (especially at low levels) that you won't think it's any good. Stick with it and you'll never turn back.

Magic: Magic is definitely broken, especially arcane magic used by mages and sorcerers. There are so many reality-bending, damage dealing, and combat control spells in the game that it's almost absurd. Prepare to read a TON in this game. And not just because most of the dialogue and books are written out, but because there are paragraphs of explanations for each of the hundreds of spells in the game. Given that a single-class sorcerer can solo this game (with relative ease), you should have an idea of the power of magic.

Overall Thoughts: Play this game. Most CRPGs are happy to achieve 10% of what this game did. Play through the entire thing before Baldur's Gate 3 comes out. Skip Dark Alliance, though.",1574314923,1574314923,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have played Baldur's Gate I and it's expansion all the way through and enjoyed it.  This game is far superior to it's predecessor on many levels though. Everything in this one is polished, enhanced and just bigger all around.  

The enhanced edition is the way to go as it includes the extra npc's that come with that one and also has far better optimization for modern OS such as Windows 10. 

If you have ever played any tabletop rpg of any description this is the closest you'll get to that sort of experience playing a video game in my opinion.

It's one of the very best RPG's ever produced on PC with epic story, character development and NPC relationships, brilliant main villain and great all around fun factor.

Now for the longer review...

This game is fun, and I will try to be as unbiased as possible. I've been playing this game since it first came out before even getting it on Steam. I highly recommend you play the first game to understand the characters and story a bit better, but it is not overly necessary, you just may be a little clueless on some parts(like the beginning part). I've played every class and combination and have done every quest in here, although this was before steam, with my own copy.

Now comparing this game to a lot of the newer games, the graphics are still awesome from the view you do get. You can also input your own pictures for your character(which I love).

The music is amazing, and I actually listen to the music outside of playing the game because it is that good, haha. Cinematics, the few that are there are decent, but you can see it is outdated graphics.

The story is one of the most amazing ones out there in the gaming industry, very in-depth, a lot of character plots and side quests to understand all the characters and if you're a lore w*h0re like me, you will love it.

Content itself is actually pretty good, lots of replay in there, I love making new characters in different classes and trying out different play styles and different alignments. Even the extra characters that are in there will banter at each other and it's hilarious.

Now for the controls.... It's pretty simple, keyboard and mouse. It may take a little getting used to if you're not a huge gamer, but most gamers will know that ""I"" is for inventory, etc.

Game play, amazing. It's a round based type game. However you can kind of make it turn based depending if you jump through the options(kind of). Essentially you have your party come up to a point you see ""monsters"". You can either press space bar to pause and get your guys ready, or just let them attack on their own(because of the DnD play style, they use ""rounds"" in a way to attack and certain spells take a few seconds to cast, etc). If you go through the options, you can actually have the computer ""pause"" the game for you when you see monsters. There are also other ways they will pause(like a character death).

Whether it is on sale, or you get it for free, or full price. I highly recommend playing this game if you love lore and story, and some fun combat.

Somewhat spoiler a head?

Now I am not sure if this is a spoiler, so much as it is a trick I used after playing the game legit(cause it was fun!), which I recommend to do before doing this so it doesn't SPOIL so much for you. Cause it will....

When playing BG2, make a character in the expansion part first. Go through character creation, and play the game. When you get a hold of your character, you can now deck your character out in everything they need, plus filling their pack up with any gear you think you'd need for other characters when playing the non-expansion version from the giant sac of holding you were given. Now get rid of the bag of holding, cause it will disappear when exporting. Go into your ""profile"" and export your character. You now have everything and the character who is a little higher level. Now go into the non-expansion BG2, make a character and then ""import"" your character. Voila, you have them, and they are a little higher level. When you start, make sure to PAUSE the game before letting the cinematic happen, and go into their inventory. Drop ALL the gear on the ground or else you have lost all your gear you just grabbed from the expansion. When all the gear is on the ground, press unpause and let the cinematic go. And all that wonderful gear is on the ground.

This is not a ""cheat"" but I guess an exploit of the game?",1570730454,1570730520,True,2,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

Well... it’s a masterpiece and a game that can still be played today and you enjoy every minute of it.

First of all, it’s the same as the first one but more epic and even legendary with the included Throne of Bhaal expansion.
Gone are the scary gibberlings, the sleep spell is not game over anymore and you get to kill a dragon (actually many of them) in a Dungeons & DRAGONS game.

The vilain is interesting and the main quest is a wild ride that gets you to many interesting places (and planes depending where you step in). There is a lot less wilderness exploration compared to the first game and the areas are instead jam-packed with quests (and don’t forget to download awesome quest mods in gibberlings3 or pocketplane for even more fun!). They are all different and even if some are silly or have a reference to the first game, they are a testament to classic roleplaying game standards.

The NPCs for your party are all different and have their own quest (except Minsc! Until you install unfinished business mod), you even have romance possibilities! 
This is a good example of less is more (who ever played with Skie or Alora in the first game??)

The music is also fantastic as always but stealing the show is David Warner’s voice acting as the main vilain. Reeking of evil and... a certain...objective oriented tone to stay non-spoilerish.

The gameplay hasn’t changed except the addition of new weapons (also with easytutu) and the EE version has the same changes as the original EE version (zoom in/out).

This game is just terrific and the only flaws could be some strange design decision such as an egyptian theme in some tombs and the more steam punk look of some dungeons, especially since Baldur’s Gate 1 was more stoney looking (that UI also helped) but this is just personal preference.

There are much less fourth-wall breaking jokes in this game but the writing is still superb. It’s just sad that it ends...

Baldur’s Gate 2 is basically taking every good thing of the 1 and improving it.

The setting is better and more engaging albeit alittle bit limiting, the story is in the part where your character realizes that his/her  adventuring is going to be no longer taking on a few bandits, but that he/she has REAL power that requires confrontation and acceptance. The main villain is perhaps the most interesting RPG villain that I have ever faced and I didn't know what he was going to do next. The inclusion of new party members and the developers allowing you to explore their backstory is a welcome step in the right direction, the romance is typical Bioware crap and I never did them because they were just bland. 

The game feels a bit easier than the last game, but it is because at first you kinda are more powerful than most of the opponents you face because you start the game at level 9. As you progress and see more variety of opponents it smooths out and you begin having a tougher time. This is also a refreshing change from the last game where you were getting murked at level 1, but then when you reach 2 the game becomes child's play somewhat. Some of the enemies in Baldur's Gate II really require that you know what items and spells to use or they will kick your ass.

Baldur's Gate II is also considered one of the greatest games of all time. There are some who love BG1 more and this one less, but one can agree that this title took a lot of what made the first one great and expanded it into then unseen heights. A memorable, unforgettable campaign that goes to the very core of what the main character is, the Bhaalspawn.

BG2 is actually two campaigns - the war-related and intrigue loaded Shadows of Amn, and the more epic, godlike Throne of Bhaal, which was even considered by some to be BG3 in the past (way before the new game by Larian would be announced in 2019).

One cannot but recommend BG2 to everyone who wants one of the greatest titles of all time.

Baldur's Gate II is the best game I've ever played, and I can say that with one hundred percent certainty. And I can't believe it took me so long to discover it. With such a thrilling plot which is truly epic in every sense of the word, a cast of characters that are unforgettably memorable, and classic, engaging gameplay— this really is just something you got to go in and play for yourself. It goes on sale for pretty cheap, and if a high fantasy epic adventure, a colorful trope of characters, alongside expertly written and witty dialogue, in anyway interests you, then pick it up! You will not be disappointed.

The game itself is rather long, and the plot is a bit of a slow burner— especially if you decide to go about and do all the side quests early on. On my first playthrough it took me 160 hours to finish. However, it is so easy to get soaked into the expertly crafted story and world and characters that you only wish it were longer. I played this before I ever played the original Baldur's Gate, so if you haven't played the first game first then that is okay because the game does an excellent job with allowing newcomers to ease into the series. There are some parts nonetheless where it feels that playing the first game beforehand might make some later story bits more impactful, but the way the game gets you attached to its characters, your character, and the plot as a whole is just masterfully done, and I really haven't gotten this invested into the story of a game for a long, long time (again though, probably the best I've played!).

The game itself is set in the Forgotten Realms universe, which I knew nothing about before going in, but again the game does a great job of worldbuilding, without relying on text info dumps (they are there, but written in-universe fashion and are more of an extra thing than anything). In addition to all this, the replay value is extremely high as there are many different playstyles, alignments, and companions you can chose from. I have already rambled on for far too long here I'm sure, but for picking this up for $4.99, and having it sit in my Steam library for months on end until I eventually decided to give it a go— is just criminal. The amount of bang-for-your-buck here is just absurd, and honestly I don't think are any words in the English language, even those yet to be invented, that will allow me to recommend this game to you enough.

I now realize why this is one of the most beloved, and cherished games out there. No other game has combined story, gameplay, and replayability into such a memorable experience for me. I mean, to anyone who has played this, who doesn't remember Minsc and Boo, Jaheria, Imoen, and the rest of the gang? I look forward to getting into the original now, alongside the rest of the Beamdog games! Oh, yeah, and I'll probably replay this one too.

A few times maybe.

Maybe a lot  more.

A lot lot more.

You can create your own party or let NPCs join your team. In my last game I made my own party, because I already played with NPCs several times in the past. Beamdog added some new NPCs, but I completely ignored these.

There is a huge amount of character customization. There are several races and  there are several classes (e.g. fighter, mage, paladin, ranger, etc) each with their own specialisation. You can multi or dual class. Pick your own weapon specialisation and spells. You start at level 7 or 8 (or 1 if you play BG1 first, you can import your save) and end up at level 30+ (epic levels)

-Starting dungeon is the weakest point of the game. Just bear with it.
-Don't try to do the high level quests right at the start. Game will not make the quest levels obvious. But you have higher chances to stumble upon lower level quests first. And you can determine them by the magnitude of the problem you're trying to solve.  Let's just say it may be a better idea to start by helping out the local establishments rather than challenging a cult of maniacs and their (false) god dwelling in the city's underground.

Not surprising, really, it was more beautiful, better balanced, far more “epic”, told a far more involved and personal story and even introduced the concept of “Romances” that BioWare would become known for in their RPG titles. It is still considered to be one of the best cRPGs, especially among the story-focused variety and rightfully so. Though, revisiting it now, in the Enhanced Edition (that includes the expansion/final part of the Trilogy Throne of Bhaal and some new content) did reveal some elements that I blissfully forgot until now.

Unlike the original title that kept the mystery of the main character’s birthright a secret throughout most of the game and kept it as a secondary storyline in comparison to the economical and political events, Baldur’s Gate II is all about personal stakes right from the start. Your character and some of the companions from the first game were kidnapped, experimented upon and some of you have not survived the process. There’s a face tied to these acts and that face is asking to be kicked in the teeth. That’s your motivation for the game and while the stakes do often times imply things far bigger than revenge, it’s often up to the players if they want to care about it or not.

The whole game structure and feel is changed to accommodate that – you don’t wander much, most of the locations are added to your map by NPCs when they want you to go to a specific place and you don’t unlock things by just exploring usually. Map sizes are wildly different and always adapt to the needs of the location/quest, often leaning towards more dramatic, more tightly put together and directed experiences. Quests tend to have more story to them, more twists and talks and all the companions that you can get, of which there are considerably less than in the first game, have a more notable place in the adventure. Even discounting the “Romance” options, you talk to people more. Though, still, far less than whatever new content added in the Enhanced Edition tries to add – new companions in EE still feel completely out of place with just how talkative, often to a fault, they are.

What was most surprising for me to remember, however, is that despite the game being more linear and having less quests and locations in terms of pure numbers, the game overall is longer. You visit lots of very different places, some of which can never be revisited, all of which have new sets of mini-stories, characters and themes. Even more interestingly, some of them can be skipped almost entirely based on player choice despite being along the main story path.

The strongest point of Baldur’s Gate II remains in how really memorable the events are and how well they are written. Where original title was just well done and serviceable, Shadows of Amn tries a lot of really cool ideas in mixing more “cinematic” concepts into the interactive world of the cRPG. Questlines still can be awkwardly rigid, but it feels like your choices are more meaningful and your connections to other characters are far stronger then before. “Romance” was still an infant idea in lots of ways, mostly broken by how story+time-based dialogues work in the game (aka how they don’t work), and it was in many ways unfinished. Yet, unlike any other attempt at the concept since this title BioWare did, this is the only time where the relationship with a character you can establish can go through some stupidly serious events unique just for that character, including literal life and death choices, countless times where emotions can mean losing the character forever and, probably most famously, having a child with a character. That gets born during the course of the game. And becomes an actual “item” you both carry in your adventures.

Shame that the character in question is insufferable, though… And that’s another side of the approach – due to how involved and how important the personalities and the stories are in the game, the mechanics and the story often get into extremely annoying conflicts. Apart from the annoyances with dialogues just not triggering because of reasons (something lots of mods fixed, yet EE unfortunately didn’t) you’re very likely to encounter situations where you really want to keep a character for their story, yet they’re completely useless for your party or just don’t fit due to the alignment, or the opposite – run around with someone really good mechanically, but hating them every time they open their mouth for a character bark. And due to the more limited selection of companions in comparison to the original title, this is far harder to get around. Here EE is, again, really failing and bringing mostly annoying characters who give very few reasons to ever hang out with them, apparently Beamdog hasn’t figured that part out until the Siege of Dragonspear.

But playing BGII is extremely fun, if sometimes you do catch yourself thinking that the game is a tiny bit too long. Throne of Bhaal is, luckily, not particularly long, though. It was a fine ending to the Gorion’s Ward story, even if it felt a bit rushed and mechanically too reliant on linear runs through dungeons with very high level enemies. It hasn’t aged as well as I’ve remembered and if I’m being entirely honest, as a piece of content Dragonspear is a more enjoyable title, for all its faults, but I still enjoyed playing it. I just wish EE would fix/change more of the minor problems with it which have been addressed over the years by fans of the original yet were left as in the original release here.

Baldur’s Gate Trilogy is still an enjoyable time. While it’s not my favorite story-driven RPG and not even the favorite Infinity Engine game/series of games (guess that one, chief), it’s not good just for its legacy or influence on the genre. It still holds up today as an enjoyable game. Enhanced Edition, despite not being as enhanced as it should’ve been (and having an option to outright remove the companion additions that detract more than add), is a great way to revisit the games. I’d still suggest playing through games as they were released originally and looking at the Siege of Dragonspear only after you’ve experienced the original trilogy.

Graphics: This games' graphics look like shit, the kind of shit that you get used to real quick, the kind of shit that pulls you in and is just good enough to be able to enjoy the gameplay and story, the kind of shit that is actually quite charming and even better with the HD treatment of the enhanced edition.

Sound: There is nothing quite like the booming horns of the main theme that plays in the opening menu which instantly transport you to the continent of Faerûn and in the game you will be treated to a slew of ambient soundtracks and themes that bring the world to life.

Gameplay: This is why you will keep coming back to BGII. BGII was made with an adjusted version of the AD&D rules and using these rules you can play as one of several races (human, elf, half-elf, dwarf, gnome, halfling, half-orc) and you also get to choose from many many classes, many of which also have subclasses of their own. In addition, certain classes are capable of casting spells, which have many options as well. You can make a main character or if you want to go all out, you can even make an entire team yourself, though you might want to hold out on doing that until you've played with some of the NPCs that can join you in your quest. That's just the character creation though!
As mentioned, you can meet lots of different characters with different classes, that you can use to assemble your team of adventurers. They often add a spark of humor with their witty conversations and if you wish there are some that you can romance as well.
Combat is deep, especially if you put your spells and abilities to their maximum use, but you will want to pause the game regularly to issue orders to several party members at once. There's also lots of fun, ridiculous things, like polymorphing a foe into a squirrel, that you can do.
This is an old-school game without an automatic save system, so you may want to save regularly.

Story: The story follows your typical blank slate protagonist who's unlocking their godly heritage, while an evil antagonist is trying to use it for his own ends. There's tons of sidequests and several diverging paths in the main quest depending on how evil or good you want to be.

Overall: This game is legendary. If you don't own it and you like turn-based rpgs, then you should buy it immediately. Even though the graphics are dated, you won't even care as the story, sound, and gameplay slowly pull you in and never let you go.",1562291736,1562291795,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Compared to Morrowind, my first RPG experience, and a game I was still playing at the time, Baldur's Gate 2 felt linear and the world didn't feel nearly as interactive as Vvardenfell. Since then I have played many more narrative-driven games and have come to appreciate that style of game. In 2017 I decided to start from the beginning and play Baldur's Gate 1, and so here I am, hundreds of hours and two full games later!

In 2005, combat was very frustrating for me. Perhaps I should not have stubbornly insisted on playing on ""Core Rules"" difficulty, despite having no experience playing D&D. Since then, I have also completed a playthrough of Baldur's Gate 1, multiple playthroughs of Neverwinter Nights 2 and Mask of the Betrayer, and played a fair amount of Neverwinter Nights 1, Icewind Dale and Drakensang, so I have much more experience with these types of games and the combat was much less frustrating. That being said, in 2019,  having just recently completed the game, I still wish that there was more feedback in dialogue window while in combat.

The companions I met throughout the game all felt unique and though there was limited dialogue, their individual personalities were a delight to observe and interact with. Attitudes towards me changed as I made certain decisions or visited particular places. Party members even reacted to each other in interesting ways. The degree to which my companions responded to my character's behaviour was quite impressive for a game of this vintage! 

The setting of Baldur's Gate 2 is its true strength. Exploration was a joy and was strongly encouraged from the beginning by the design of the main quest. The pre-rendered backgrounds were full of interesting details and some of them even put modern games to shame.

The narrative started out strong, and I like how it continued on from the first game. Somewhere near the end though, it started to unravel. This may be in part due to mystery being a driving factor for me, and when there was none left I lost interest in the story being told. Neither did I care for some of the important characters introduced towards the end of the game and their struggle felt uninteresting to me and poorly realised or tacked on.

Though the inventory management was a real pain, and the game was too long. (This is NOT a short game). I would recommend Baldur's Gate 2 to people who are very interested in the cRPG genre, have experience and patience for older games, working knowledge of D&D and a lot of time on their hands. (I repeat; this is NOT a short game). There is a detailed world here, full of charm and waiting to be discovered.",1562181155,1562181317,True,3,0,0.540178179740905762,0,True,False,False

I'm glad I did. Finished with Shadows of Amn and started Throne of Bhaal. BG2 has the NPC witty banter we'd take for granted in a Bioware game. It has the complexity of old school AD&D. More importantly, it seems to have aged well.

There are plenty of side quests to keep you busy and some pretty nifty loot. The Enhanced Edition maintains the feel and glory of the original with just a few new things to pique your interest. I approve of the outcome.

One of the things that I liked about these games is that I knew exactly where to find everything on the next playthrough, meaning that loot isn't randomly generated (except for minor items).

Not only that, but the character interactions have a genuine impact on your game, instead of just a check on a list. For example (Spoilers), while pursuing Jahera's quest, she straight up LEFT for a week because the Harpers decided they needed her. This MIGHT have been all right, had I been somewhere convenient, like town.
I wasn't.
I was in the middle of a Shadow Dragon's cave.
I had scraped my way into a side area so I could sleep.
And she straight up left.
Just as I was about to fight a GODDAMN SHADOW DRAGON.
Let's just say it was a... DIFFICULT fight.
Still, the game does show its age here and there. For example, the character quests are based on timers that count real world seconds, not gameplay seconds, so if you're really in to getting this one character's quest done, you'll have to actually, you know... Log out once in a while. 
Additionally, the game does emulate the original AD&D, which means everything's SUPER janky. The lower your armor class, the harder you are to hit, because apparently that made sense to Gary Gygax.

The writing and freedom is of a calibre that you just don't see anymore as modern games have been commercialized, not to say all modern games are bad but back in the day they tended to be passion projects rather than something made to sell and it really shows.

This is a game that every RPG fan should play at some point in their life, the graphics while dated are still beautiful thanks to 2D art not aging as poorly as 3D. The gameplay while perhaps unbalanced and not very streamlined has so much depth to it thanks to the dungeons and dragons ruleset and the combat manages to stay challenging and engaging despite.

Not that gameplay or graphics is why you should play this (although it's a bonus), this is the kind of game you play for the story and character interaction, the banter between party members and the PC puts modern games to shame.

Baldurs Gate 2 is a direct continuation of Baldur's Gate 1 although the latter lacks a lot of the fluff that made BG2 so amazing, the story is also perfectly understandable without having played the first game and therefor I suggest only playing from the beginning if you are willing to commit to the whole franchise regardless of potential mixed feelings on the first entry and starting from BG2 if you want to immediately see what the series has to offer.

I did not get the EE editions right away as I had vanilla versions of the game that served me fine, but eventually snagged them for $5 due to innate widescreen support.

My final judgement: BG2EE is worth the $5, but I wouldn't pay any more for it. There were some great interface improvements which I love. Portraits are color coded to signal who would benefit most from a selected item, stats are displayed on the inventory screen to reflect gear bonuses, and group loot is such a pleasant time saver. But in the BG2 version especially, Beamdog dropped the ball in two key areas: they failed to address many long-known bugs, and most of the new NPCs they added are just... embarrassingly bad. 

For complaint Part A, BG2 still suffers from pathing issues in which characters will run up against an obstacle for eternity rather than find a way around.  This was an issue that was mostly fixed by the time Icewind Dale came out, and granted coding isn't as easy as copy-pasting better source code from one game into another, but that it's still present seems silly. There's also a new glitch in which party members will ""stack"" on top of each other and become immobile for a short period of time. I assume this is a problem with dithering. Movement issues aside, it's a bit ridiculous that Beamdog didn't fix ancient and well-documented problems like the borked shapeshifting tables (still rendering Cernd, tragically, near-useless as his kit is extremely dependent on the flawed version). Jaheira's romance still remains as prone to bugs and breakage as it ever was. There are other similar ""behind the curtains"" problems, but I leave it to others to chronicle the rest.

As for Part B of the downsides, my disclaimer comes first: not all the new NPCs are poorly done. Neera, at least, does not feel that out-of-place to an old timer like me, though some of her word choices don't quite fit the setting. Unfortunately Beamdog went and showed their fanboy underskirts with characters like Hexxat and Dorn. These two are comparable to the worst of fan-made mod NPCs. I was excited to romance Hexxat, but unfortunately I found the writing behind her so poorly done that I dumped her from my party in short order. Dorn somehow manages to be worse. A character I mostly liked in BG1, Dorn's intro quest in 2 is so ridiculously disconnected with the setting that it nearly turned my review into a full-on negative. It's like Beamdog devs thought to themselves, ""Wouldn't it be SO COOL to have characters do THIS??"" without thinking about how massacring an entire wedding party in the very stronghold of the city's paladins would bring the entire army of Amn crashing down on your party. In terms of the NPCs, Quality Control was sporadic at best.

So to reiterate my final verdict, pay $5 for the Enhanced Edition. More importantly, pay no more than $5 for the Enhanced Edition. The improvements and occasional instances of restored content freshen things up a bit to make the newer editions worth the pocket change, but don't expect much from the new developers'  original content.",1561848106,1561848106,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Before I get on to why this is still arguably the best CRPG ever made, lets first get some negatives out of the way:

1) Though Beamdog have gone to incredible lengths to improve the game engine, re-writing substantial parts of the game code, fundamentally this is still a 20+ year old game engine. Do not expect shiny modern graphics. If this is a must-have for you then look elsewhere, though you'll be doing yourself a great disservice.

2) Some parts of the game have not aged well at all. The player journal / quest tracker in particular is horrible and primitive beyond belief. Still, one must remember that this is by now a very old game and in terms of quest journals, this was literally one of the first.

3) Though the party AI is genuinely excellent and is some of the best I've ever seen in a CRPG, something that could never have been said about the original, AI route finding remains somewhat suspect. This can occasionally lead to frustrating incidents where a party member wanders alone in to a room full of enemies because the AI decided to take the 'scenic route' to where you wanted them to be.

4) Though the quality of the voice acting is excellent, the quality of the actual audio recordings leaves much to be desired by current standards.

So why then is Baldurs Gate 2 so lauded, so loved, so admired by the fans? The story and quality of the writing. BG2 really does feature a tale which is epic in every sense of the word. Some of the very best plot and story writing in the entire history of computer gaming is to be found here. This is no exaggeration, no hype. The story has to be played to be believed. Along side Planescape Torment the quality of the story & writing in BG2 is the standard against which all other games should be judged.

It's also worth noting that Beamdog have introduced vast numbers of 'quality of life' improvements over the original game, all of which serve to make playing the Enhanced Edition a more pleasant experience. Full marks there. One last point to make is that the story of BG2 is much darker than that of the original game, with some pretty adult (I'm not referring to sex here) themes, despite the generally 'heroic' nature of the story. As such BG2 probably isn't suitable for young children. The enhanced edition of BG1 is much more suitable for young players.

The original Baldurs Gate 2 that Bioware created 20 years ago is literally the standard by which others are judged in terms of story and quality of writing. Beamdog have gone to great lengths to bring us a version of the game that works on modern systems and that's been updated as far as possible, and are very much worthy of praise for their efforts.

Bottom line: if you enjoy CRPGs you must play through this game at least once. Better still, play through the enhanced edition of the original Baldurs Gate then play through BG2. You'll never forget the experience.",1560237997,1560237997,True,50,1,0.810135900974273682,0,True,False,False

Baldur's Gate 2 is a D&D game based on the second edition ruleset. If you have never played D&D before,(like me), then this game will prove very challenging at first. However, if you stick with it and put in the effort, you will be rewarded with a very gratifying experience. 

Graphics: Baldur's Gate 2 originally came out in 2000, and it shows. The enhanced edition did not update the graphics in any way, only allowed for higher resolutions. That being said, the graphics are not necissarily bad. There is a certain charm to them that gives the game a very nostalgic feeling, even for new players. I give the graphics a rating of 7/10.

Story: Baldur's Gate 2 has an incredible story, and is very well written. Playing this game feels like reading a fantasy epic. Everything from the main story to the side missions to the characters is very well written. I give the story an 8/10.

Gameplay: The gameplay is were Baldur's gate 2 really shines. Every choice you make feels very important, and will often lead you wondering what would have happened if you had chosen differently. Because of this you get a sense of real importance. The combat in Baldur's Gate 2 is incredibly challenging and tacticle; there are many times where your characters will die, and you will have to load a previous save. One of the things that really shines in Baldur's Gate 2 are the side quests. There are loads and loads of them, and they are all incredibly interesting and diverse. Another strong point are the joinable npcs in the game. Each one has a very interesting story, and will lead to lots of party experimentations. Based on all this, i give the gameplay a 10/10.

Sound: The sound in Baldur's Gate 2 is EPIC. Every place from the towns to forests sounds amazing and really brings the game to life. Then there's the soundtrack: The soundtrack in Baldur's Gate 2 is perhaps the best soundtrack ever made. It makes every encounter and every situation just flow with feeling and just plain epicness. I give the sound an amazing 10/10.

This game is not for everyone. If you are not a fan of rpgs or D&D, you may not like this. However, I do believe everyone should try this game. This is one of the best rpgs ever made, mabye one of the best games ever made. I give the overall score an 9/10.",1516154318,1559662720,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After he saved the Sword Coast from the Iron Crisis and the Crusade, he was abducted and tormented by a madman who was after his divine soul.  He escaped, but lost two dear friends and one was still in the hands of the wizard.

He ventured out. Found new friends and foes alike wherever he wandered.
He slayed dragons and Demons alike. He wielded mithy Carsomyr, the Holy Avenger. And Torm was pleased with him.
He helped the poor and those who suffered injustice. He followed the way of Tyr.
And when the mad wizard dragged him right in the howling Abyss, he stood tall and suffered for his friends. And Ilmater smiled upon him.

But evil never rests and after the wizard was banished and his soul back with him, he marched out again to face his kin.
It was in this wartorn lands that he realized what his destiny hold for him.
With his brother and sister at his side, he fought the evil bhaalspawn and they stood no chance against his righteous fury.

At the end he ascended to godhood. Climped Mount Celestia and joint his patrons. Forming a group of four out of what once was the Triad.

The time I have spent with this game, nevertheless how big it may seem is just a scratch of the amount I have spent with these legendary series. I think that Baldur's Gate saga is or should be known by every gamer who is fond of RPGs. I started playing the saga when I hardly knew any English but boy how I did enjoy the exquisite adventure in the Realm filled with interesting enemies, dangers and the easy to learn gameplay and when I got older I began to understand the story which is really one of the richest and most thrilling ones I have ever experienced. I have beaten the whole saga multiple times and twice I have completed it with a character that I created in BG1 and later imported it in BG2. Both playthoughs took hundreds of hours. 

So I can say that Baldur's Gate games, especially this second one ranks high in my books. It is a masterpiece concluding the epic tale where protagonist grows from the young, harmless apprentice to one of the most powerful beings of the world. And if you should not be familiar with the games know that this game is originally developed by Bioware which has offered classics like Mass Effect and Jade Empire. This however - I think that this was the game that revolutionized the RPG genre and the formula still can be seen in games like Pillars of Eternity.

When it comes to Enchanted Edition I highly approve the polishing work like wide screen compatibility and even new characters which are available, but can be also easily avoided if one sees that they do not fit into original script. There is also few new areas and extra loot. The great feature is that there is not importing mess between the main game and last chapter Throne of Bhaal which was originally a separate sequel. I think that as an Enchanted Edition this is meant to be played.

Thus I ask you to turn yourself over an experience - a legendary Baldur's Gate II.",1556653096,1556790140,True,14,0,0.625609159469604492,0,True,False,False

My grandma took me to Walmart and told me I could have anything I wanted as long as the price was not over 20$ I walked around the store for a long time until I stood in front of Baldur's Gate 2 Shadows of Amn. (video games back then came in huge square boxes with covers on the front that opened up.) Picking up the box, my little kid brain exploded with excitement as I stared at the screenshots and read every word on the box over and over. I looked at the tag on the shelf which read 19.99$ !!! Happily clutching my Christmas miracle, I ran to find my grandma and we went to the register to pay for it. The cashier rang it up, and said pleasantly to my grandma ""that'll be 39.99$ "". My little heart sank as my grandma looked at me and said ""I thought I told you up to 20$ only?"". I said ""no grandma it says 20$ on the shelf I swear!"" So the cashier went back to the electronics section and returned a few minutes later saying that they had all been stocked in the wrong place, but because it was advertised as 19.99 that is what they were gonna charge us for it. (i'm sure they wouldn't do that these days) I was so happy and we drove back to my grandparents house and for the next 2 weeks straight I stared at the map, read the huge game manual cover to cover again and again, memorized the spell descriptions, and waited eagerly to get home to play it. The ten-hour car ride home felt like an eternity, everyone else sleeping, me holding the box, looking out the window. When we finally got home me and my two younger brothers ran to my computer and holy shit, the installation time back then was so damn long, it took hours, there were four fucking discs that you had to change out while installing. After all that I started it up, my brothers in the background already begging me to play. The epic Baldur's Gate 2 theme music began, and I was fucking hooked.  To this day I have not encountered any game that has affected me as much. The voice-acting is amazing, the story/quests immersive, each area is so richly detailed, each character so believable and immediately impressed me by how much love, how much polish went into their creation. I played this game in and out, with multiple character types, exploring every inch of every map, every side quest. I use to sit at my computer desk pretending to do my homework but actually playing this game. (and quickly turn off my monitor when my mom came in the room) I loved this game so much, so of course when I heard they did an Enhanced Edition I HAD to at least check it out. I was fully prepared to send them hate mail if they messed up or tarnished my beloved game but instead was shocked and surprised that they actually improved upon it. The auto-loot button? YES. The new party members and their quests? YES. The new portraits? YES. They added many great things, but I'll tell you what really hit me the most. IMPROVED PARTY MEMBER AI.  Jaheira knows when to heal. Korgan knows when to berserk now, Minsc charms animals without being told, Imoen hastes the party at the first sign of trouble, Viconia turns undead on sight, Anomen steps up and casts restoration on party members that have been level drained, Edwin throws out hold person when confronted with humanoid enemies or fire arrow when a troll gets downed, Keldorn uses his true sight ability to reveal hidden/invisible foes. Nalia mirror images herself when being melee'ed, or knows when a fireball is appropriate. When I witnessed Imoen immediately using breach or pierce magic to dispel an enemy mages magic protections all on her own I was like wow. My party finally fights as a team. Each member knows their role and fulfills it with ease. I say Bravo to the developers. Yes, there was AI back in the day but nothing as effective as this.  Even after all these years this game is still fun, its still interesting, its also probably one of the most modded games ever. Look online and you will find many player-made mods that add quests/npcs/items/features/classes/enemies/spells, you name it. My favorites right now are the mod that adds wings to an elven character or the one that lets your mage create a golem to serve him. When you get this game keep in mind the huge amount of content that fans have been creating for the past 17 years.  I wanna say Thank you to beamdog for breathing new life into an amazing classic rpg. And of course Thank you to my grandma (who passed away last yearILOVEYOUGRANDMA) Thank you for reading my review, this game is close to my heart. Give this game a chance, it has sold (in 17 years) millions of units. and hey don't take my word for it, there are other reviews you can read telling you this game is worth playing.

More Baldur's Gate. 
Interesting story and side quests. 
Imoen and Minsc are still there. 
Good voice acting, but limited since most dialogue is text, you must read. Jon Irenicuses actor, David Warner, is top notch!
Graphics have a nice art style to it, just like in the original. 
D&D. 
Replay value: various classess, subclasses, races and dual classes to choose from and solve quests and role play.

The Bad:

NPCs and player characters still have not detail to them, still pixelated. 

This game is more expansive than the original, but sometimes it seems like the game procrastinates the main story just for the sake of making it longer. 

Conclusion: Fully recommended.

No. This game remains the best party-based RPG of all time, especially with mods (SCS, Spell Revisions, aTweaks etc). There's a reason that the modding community is still active to this day. Don't get me wrong: Later titles like Pillars of Eternity, Divinity Original Sin or Dragon Age Origins were decent, too. But Baldurs Gate 2 blows them all out of the water.

It has such a good story, the most memorable characters, the most exciting quests (no heartless ""go there, kill that, fetch that"" side quests like in so many other RPGs these days).

But the most important aspect for me: It has the best magic combat system. Veterans often refer to it as mage chess. Especially with the SCS mod, which makes the AI insanely good, you will have to think about your spell usage in detail. You can't just throw your damage spells at stuff and hope that does the trick. You have to read the combat log and peel off layers of spell protections, combat protections, invisibility spells etc. A tough enemy mage can decimate your entire party without taking a scratch if you don't know what you're doing. 

Replay vaule is through the roof, too. People have replayed BG2 a dozen times. You can play with 3 instead of 6 party members, do solo runs with several classes (be a badass battle mage), play as evil or good party.

Of course, you can also chill and just play the vanilla game on easy difficulty and that's fine. But if you want to experience the best magic combat system that I've ever seen in any game, then play it modded.

The biggest mystery of our age is how and why this game is praised by gamers, the only answer to this riddle must be a bunch of inbred 45-year olds who have never played anything else in their entire life and are desperately clinging to nostalgia. Literally every single game I can think of that I have ever played is superior to this putrid, smelly pile of turd, and I've played Magic *fucking* Crystals, a motherfucking HORSE-BREEDING game for god's sake.

The combat is abhorrently boring, It's like a budget version of Old-School Runescape, and the graphics made me start wearing lenses after having been caused permanent eye-damage by how bad it is. Now it might be unfair of me to bash the game for its graphics when it's as old as it is, but when the transition from beach-to-water literally looks like its 2D, it's fucking bad. The dialogue is the equivalent of waterboarding, in that it's unbearable torture and you would prefer to just be killed outright. The NPC's spew out dialogue longer than a Harry Potter book, but still the voice-acting is actually only applied to about half of the shit they say(more proof of this being a budget-version of far superior RPGs).

This is a fantastic game that I have played since I was a kid, I love baldur's gate.
For some reason, Steam applied my review of ""Survived By""  to Baldur's Gate II.

About Baldur's Gate 2: You make a character and decide their class, guild, companions. You go to a merchant and buy swords, or do you steal from the merchant, or do you kill the merchant, or do you summon a cacofiend in the middle of the store, and run out, and come back later just to see what happens?  The choice is yours.

Minsc and Boo stand ready.

@ Julius Borisov, sorry for causing you distress, steam has glitched badly. I played and reviewed the game ""survived by"" , and for whatever reason, steam replaced my baldur's gate 2 review with it, despite being on the ""survived by"" page.

Some lose tips:
- dont play a full party (6 Chars), rather go with 4 (or even less): makes micromanagement easier,  the characters will level faster (as most xp is shared between all group members evenly) and you'll be overwhelmed by the mechanics, amount of spells etc. anyway, so better focus on 4 chars.
- supportive chars should stay ranged (slings, shortbows etc)
- have 1 rogue for spotting and disarming traps and opening locks (70-80 points from the get go, then increase to 100 slowly by leveling up or gear). set traps, detect illusion, hiding or pickpocket all have its uses but arent mandatory
- there are a lot of cheesy strats and semi-exploits which might come in handy if you get stuck at a certain encounter ;)
- druids are late bloomers
- mages are king

My negative rating has changed to a positive, the game is still there, play with the settings and the cartoon looking graphics can look normal, as for the rest you will have to make your own mind up!

A true classic, this game get you obsessed about exploring dungeons, dread entering a secret area full of high-level enemies, plot the careful counteracts to powerful wizards and liches and cheer as you defeat the toughest enemies through careful planning and tactics. It will consume you for the 50+ hours you’ll need to get through Shadows of Amn and another 20 to get through its expansion to finish up the story in style.


In 2018 there are multiple games vying for the crown of successor to Baldur’s Gate, be it Divinity Original Sin, Pillars of Eternity or recently released Pathfinder:Kingmaker. After going through this game, the one thing that elevates Baldur’s Gate 2 to the status of unattainable classic is the sense of wonder that you experience every time you boot the game. Every cave, every plane of existence, every quest has a potential for a great story. Every fight against a group of bandits, a powerful lich or a dragon is an exercise in patience and dread.

As introductions go, you can't get much better. Baldur's Gate 2 is still lauded as one of the best RPGs ever, deservedly. 

Mechanically, it's pretty complicated. You've got a fair bit to learn and control, from spells to special abilities, equipment, a journal, levelling up, and so on. Pretty standard fare these days, I suppose, but if you've never played an RPG before, well, there's a pretty good tutorial to run you through everything. Once you've got the hang of it, it's pretty straight forward. You control up to six party members. You pause the game and issue commands, and then your dudes will go forth and smite their enemies.

The gameplay is quite good, but as an RPG the game really shines with the story and dialogue. I'd say you spend at least half your time talking to NPCs (Non-Player Characters). Before voice acting became standard, writers were able to give you a lot more branching dialogue options, and you really are given a lot of choice in how you want to handle situations. As for the story, it's pretty great. You play as a young orphan child raised in a monastery who find out they are a child of Bhaal, god of murder. It's somewhat of a curse, because it seems that the bhaalspawn are trapped in a game of Highlander, with the last surviving child set to inherit the dead god's power. What you choose to do with your inheritance is up to you, you can be a great force for good or evil.

To be honest though, the first game is a little lacklustre. You don't really get to know anybody in your party very well, and they only rarely make comments about the quests you embark on. The sequel is such a marked improvement, where you'll really feel connected to your party, as they make small talk with each other. You also get character-specific quests, and a whole stronghold based on which class you pick. Also I think Baldur's Gate 2 was one of the first RPGs to have romance subplots, something that would be almost unthinkable to exclude in a RPG these days. I still play the original Baldur's Gate, but only because the two games are linked, you can carry your character over from the first game to the second, and I enjoy the continuity. Otherwise, I'd just play the sequel, since it's better in every way. 

In summary, if you like RPGs, but somehow managed to miss out on this game, I heartily recommend. If you're interested in Dungeons and Dragons but don't know the first thing about it, this is a great way to get started. I give them 3.5 and 4.5/5 stars respectively. Baldur's gate 2 is a true classic.",1538828393,1538828393,True,20,0,0.709037899971008301,0,True,False,False

To me the Story from Shadows of Amn and the depth of NPCs and Setting were always a big selling point for me.
There is tons to explore and learn about the game and the amount of content can be staggering.
A fair warning though, for people who have never played Baldurs Gate or 2nd Edition of D&D the learning curve can probably be pretty tough, as there is very little hand holding.

The replay value of the base game is immense already, the amount of content, the forking story in Chapter 3 (you choose a side in a conflict), and the many ways to complete quests good or evil ways, and the amount of companions most with their own side quests and interjections can allow for entierly new expiriences.
But there is still a pretty active modding community from where you can get enitrely new quests, npcs, companions, classes and tactical challenges for the more expirienced. (As a reminder it is an old game and modding is a bit more involved then just downloading it from the nexus or steam workshop).

Anyway, one thing that has NEVER been replicated since this game is the loooong character leveling. The slow crawl from weakest link in the party to hero of the party to champion of the kingdome to demi god/devil- only if you play BG1 and 2.
This is the only game that has such a long arc . It's fun getting so powerful becuase the game gives you a real sense of having ""earned"" it. It has never been done like that since.

The Enhanced Edition is the best iteration of this masterpiece, thank you Beamdog.

To begin with this review, the Enhanced Edition is totally worth it, there is the base game, the expension (Throne of Bhaal) and The Black Pit II that is an arena module, as well as new characters, quests and items that fit perfectly in the original title.

Beamdog did an exelent job on games that uses the Infinity engine, the UI has been improved, and there are many setting that wasn't avaible with the original, the game is now available in many language without the need of patches (texts and voices), but this is not the only improvments, compatibily is also a huge point and will allow us to be playing BG forever.
They also improved, revived i should say, the multiplayer, it was no longer working due to compatibility issue with modem and modern technologies.

Resolution, graphics and effects has been improved and makes the game look good even on big screen, yet you could need a time for adapting if you play on a TV screen, because even for a fan like me i have to say that it could make your eyes bleed the first couple of minutes.

Once you pass that, the 2D art is the most beautiful i have ever seen and this is perfect to retranscribe the atmosphere of the Forgotten Realms, you will enjoy exploring all the map that Baldur's Gate have to offer, this game is huge and immensly deep, and there are many secret and things to discover, even when you explore everything during a playthrough, you still want to get back in and do it again from A to Z with the same enjoyment.

Did i mention the soundtracks, voice acting and sounds effect ? Imersive and awesome seem to be the most accurate.

The dialogues are well tied, imersive and quite funny sometimes and even the most insignificant character have something to offer to the lore, there are many path in the dialogues so you can progress in the game in different ways, and this is very role play friendly.

Concerning the combat, there are much enjoyments to get with it, this game is in real time but you can pause it, you plan the action of all your characters then you release the pause and see how it works, you are not forced to pause the game but it really help especially with wizard, priest and any kind of spellcasters.
You can throw any spells or actions on allied or ennemies characters and even objects, wich could have use at some point considering the variety of spells in the game.

There are an unbelievable amount of classes, subclasses, multiclasses, races, skills and items to the game and your characters will be unique and wil suit your taste perfectly.
The most important aspect of this game is the liberty of actions, there are a lot to see and do, and you are totally free to do it in the order you want, the story itself is really good, and there are hundreds of subquests to do, with morale choice at every corner, like i said it is roleplay friendly but considering that it is a solo game you do whatever you want and you play the way you prefere.

I have one last thing to say, if you played this game back in the days, then don't hesitate to get back in with the Enhanced Edition, because this is for sure the best version of the game that is available.
And if you never played Baldur's Gate before or don't even know any games from the Infinity engine, or if you feel too young to play an ""old"" 2D game, then believe me, you won't regret it.

Baldur's Gate is adictive and it will suck your life out of you before you even realise, no spells can prevent this, period !",1532123136,1533736189,True,17,0,0.695825576782226563,1,True,False,False

The imagination and freshness that went into this game is astonishing. The battle system feels good and is deep and rewarding. The dialogue is well-written with compelling and lovable characters. The sidequests are also a ton of fun.

I know it will not be for everyone as it is not an easy game to just pick up and play. The game follows an older D&D ruleset and is very unforgiving. There are lower difficulties that help make it more accessible for those who do not want to spend so much time micromanaging the party. Beamdog even added a story mode difficulty for those who just want to enjoy the story.

In terms of story, I think it is great. SoA and ToB end up wrapping up the Bhaalspawn saga quite well. I found the characters (original, none of the added Beamdog characters) for the most part interesting and all with very unique personalities. Party member will often have unique quests you have to do with them and they are all, for the most part, quite enjoyable and interesting.

I do have to say that I found the Beamdog added party member to be lacking, they are not bad just feel out of place a little, maybe it is just my nostalgia talking. Think Hexxat was my favourite of the added companions but the initial part of the quest to have her join your party was miserable (I really did not enjoy some of the voice acting and some of the dialog felt dull). I also found all of the added companions quests to have annoying you are stuck here until you finish the quest parts (never really been a fan of that unless main quest line). I cannot comment on the Black Pits 2.

I am glad Beamdog has brought these enhanced editions of almost all of the Infinity Engine games to Steam. I look forward to see what they do next.

While it disappointingly loses its openness after a great opening with a huge city and many dungeons to explore, it never goes below the quality which I'd call good. Great and meaty side content, a superb magic system which starts already in a good spot and very good music and art compensate the annoying companions and a more restrictive second half. ★★★★☆

Baldur's Gate II is a fantasy isometric RPG with real-time-with-pause combat. This being the sequel to Baldur's Gate, a game which I found fairly boring due to a great part of it being mostly empty wilderness areas with respawning trash mobs and which started from level 1 and only got to 7 in the D&D system, which meant that there were barely any interesting spells to play with, I was very pleased with BG2. It starts right where its predecessor left off, at level 7/8, which is just about when your spellcaster classes start getting decently interesting to play with in D&D. The world, while not having as many overworld areas as BG1, compensates that by not having mosty pointless content. Chapter 2 of the game is pretty much the ""open chapter"", where you can explore most of the game, and the main quest has a very simple goal to encourage this. And this openness is great due to the amount of content. This game has quite a lot of sidequests, each being fairly large (maybe upwards of an hour to complete each on average) and interesting. A lot of them have you explore dungeons which, besides having the usual combat, have some light puzzles which make it a bit more enjoyable than only a combat fest. After this chapter, the game goes a lot more linear, and even though there are some side quests, most are either short, and at this point there's not many optional dungeoneering, though the main quest has some good dungeons.

Despite some light puzzles/riddles, most of the interaction in BG2 is combat. and this is great. While Advanced D&D non-spellcaster classes are mostly based around clicking on something and waiting for it to die, there are a lot of items only these classes can wear, and they not only have interesting lore to read, but there's usually some interesting choices to make on which item to equip. It's not just some braindead ""pick whatever has more damage"". As for spellcasters... oh boy. As I said, BG2 starts from the point in D&D where you already have a decent variety of spells to cast, and it never truly gets boring throughout. Enemy mages prove to be the most interesting encounters, as non-spellslingers are usually just a matter of damaging until death. Mages and priests have all sorts of spells, both defensive and offensive, and you can find yourself casting a large variety of them within one fight to buff up your party's meatshields, protect your mages from certain dangerous spells, or just casting cloud spells and hoping the lack of an area of effect HUD indicator doesn't fuck you over (I only have a really bad estimate of how much a 30ft radius is on an isometric game I'm viewing through a screen, damn it!) Spellcasting is seriously fun, and I don't think I've played anything that gets close to this. Playing a wild mage was really fun, as it allows you to cast spells way above your level, but with the downside that you have pretty much a 1% chance to cast the spell correctly: There are 100 effects that can happen, from good to bad, and the game will pick them randomly, from losing your money, changing gender, having pigeons fly from your character or casting the spell twice!

As this is a party-based RPG you have to pick characters to accompany you on your journey (or play solo, or copy a multiplayer save into your single-player folder). There are some pretty cool characters in BG2, but some are just goddamn annoying. I kept Aerie (a cleric/mage multiclass) because she fit pretty well in my party as a second caster and healer, but having picked another party member they were constantly bickering over who my character was attracted to. Meanwhile, the person behind that character (aka, me) just found it annoying as fuck that the game was being interrupted over this shit. It got to a certain point where the game pretty much forces you into a choice, and ""I'm not playing this game to fall in love with a portrait and a sprite on my screen"" sadly wasn't one. The main story is nothing of a masterpiece, but it gets you a decent motivation to actually play the game, and the antagonist is really cool (especially voice acting).

If you're looking for a large RPG (I set the maximum framerate from 30 to 45, which multiplies the game logic speed by 1.5, making walking around less of a waste of time, and I got 35 hours out of the main campaign) with no element that feels weaker than the rest, Baldur's Gate II is very well-rounded in that regard. If you like isometric RPGs and haven't played this, do it. Skip the first one if you get really bored, maybe.",1522246317,1531675672,True,7,1,0.60935819149017334,0,True,False,False

The thing that always annoyed (and sill does) the hell out of me was the fact that you could not play as neutral evil or some interesing evil character without your reputation going underwater and being despised everywhere and attacked by guards in Athkathla.

Also, I think that wether you like this game or not is going to depend very very much on when you were born. This is a very personal tought but if you are from 1990 onwards its a bit unlikely you will like it or enjoy it as someone from the 70s or 80s for the simple reason that this was a game folks from the 80s grew up with while the 90s generation were still a bit too young

I've spent hundreds of hours playing through it (ignore my steam stats, I've played through this game at least 10 times before the enhanced edition came out), and yet keep coming back for more.

So what makes this game so great? Well...everything, really.

[list]
    [*] The story is well written, and the game is chock full of side quests. Unlike most games however, they aren't just lame  fetch quests and filler to pad things out. There are dozens of well developed, lengthy missions that often chain together into questlines that would be the main story in other games. The game is at 80-150 hours long, depending on how much of a completionist you are.
    [*]  The companion NPCs often have lengthy loyalty quests, and banter between each other (and other NPCs you meet.) This alone adds tons of replayability, especially given the wealth of missions in the game. Minsc and Jan are some of my favorite characters to this day.
    [*] The graphics, to me, look like a beautiful painting. The spells have varied, wonderful effects, and enemies explode into gibbets if hit with excess force. I considered Bioware's next game, Neverwinter Nights, to be a massive downgrade in looks when it first came out, and that's even more true today, as most early 3d games aged poorly. BGII has aged like fine wine in comparison.
    [*] Most RPGs have tons of trash mobs. Generic, nameless filler for you to wade through. While BGI had these, BGII for the most part doesn't. Most enemies have names, or are interesting monsters that need to be fought differently (Trolls have to be killed with fire, beholders have rays that can mind control or petrify your party, and are best reflected, or dealt with via summons, Mind flayers are terrifying to anyone without protection from mind control, and even those with it, etc.) They take strategy to deal with, drop unique loot, and often can be reasoned with, or at least talked to. It makes the world feel real to me.
[*] Items: I've never seen a game handle items quite like BGII. Using the D&D system means that there is a sharply defined scale. Enchantments go from +1 to +5, and while there are a few generic items (Eg: +2 sword), there aren't ANY randomly generated ones. Most items have detailed backstories, and feel and look unique, with great animations and abilities.. The effect of this (and the stat system, which are virtually impossible to increase, and only go from 1-25), means that many items are useful throughout the game.

That awesome flaming sword you picked up with the cool backstory? Useful throughout the game to finish off trolls. You'll want to keep helmets of charm protection around to deal with beholders and mind flayers. There are a few anti-undead weapons that you should keep (and upgrade) to deal with vampires and liches, and so on.

On top of this, artifacts and high end items (that you make or find) truly FEEL like a signification upgrade. The limited stat range (which you don't improve by leveling up), means that items that increase them feel far more impressive than those is say, Diablo. Finding boots of speed lets your characters race across the screen, saving time and making them far more flexible in a fight. Making dragon scale armor from the corpse of high-end bosses is immensely satisfying. But you'll still likely find occasional uses for earlier items, which makes the bags of holding you find useful!
[*] The magic system is increadibly satisfying to me. While low-level wizards are a bit weak, high level ones make you feel like an archmage. There are numerous spells, which are limited in use per-rest, which means you can't cast them as much as in most games, but they're a lot more powerful.",1530130760,1530941913,True,40,0,0.804194450378417969,0,True,False,False

Even after all these years, I still remember where all the traps are in Irenicus' Dungeon at the beginning of the game. Much more than that as well, since I don't know how many times I played this game. I still have my CD discs somewhere around here. :o

If that doesn't tell you what I think of this game... I'm not sure what else could.

Technically you should play Baldur's Gate 1 first, though in truth I started Baldur's Gate 2 before I had actually finished that. And because of the [i]significant[/i] quality increase from BG1 to BG2, it becomes way too easy to get sucked into this. Shadows of Amn is far superior to Throne of Bhaal as far as I am concerned, but that's an extremely hard act to follow anyway. What is important is that if you like RPG's, this is one you need to play. It's arguably the best Western RPG ever made. Seriously.

The game requires a lot of reading and all actions have consequences there, so it's necessary to pay some attention on what's happening. It is possible to play good or evil and to decide which companions you want to take on your journey. The complex character creation makes it worth to play the game again with different jobs, alignments, spells and proficiencies.

Since the original game is from 2000 it is of course not compareable to a game from these days. The graphics are not supposed to be like a real life simulator, but are instead very handy to have a quick overview about everything and to be able to control the characters and their actions easily. Next to the interesting main story there are also many side-quests/additional stories available.

The bad sides of the game are that it still has some bugs and that the voice acting of a few characters are rather poor.

The Enhanced Edition made a few significant changes in the menu and graphics which are a matter of taste. Bugs got fixed but they also added a few new ones. There is also new content and playable characters, which i really like.

I personally enjoy BG II more than BG I due to more detailed and unique maps. There are less companions you can pick from, but the stories are deeper from the ones that are available. Storywise i would hardly recommend to play the first game before the second.

My conclusion:  if you actually want to roleplay, even the slightest amount - do not play this game.


In the first game, you're given a vast open world where you can go where you choose and do what you choose. There are guideposts to the main questline, but how and when you follow them is entirely up to you and your character.

In this game you're railroaded so hard into a single plotline that whatever character you thought you were playing may as well not exist.

This game gives you the option to load your data from a BG1 savegame, which i did. It promptly then deletes all your hard-won items. Then it tells you you did not in fact adventure with the group you thought you adventured with, but with some other people in stead. Then it tells you two of them are dead.

These might be acceptable, as the story can't be written for every possible set of choices in the first game. But as soon as you exist the first dungeon, placed in the centre of a normally-functioning city with exits on all sides, you can go... exactly one place. The others are inaccessible for no apparent reason. You go to this one place and immediately are railroaded into a conversation which you can't get out of and in which no choice you make (especially ""i want nothing to do with you, go away"") has any effect on the result. You're then teleported to a place you don't want to go with the game telling you that you went there yourself of your own volition, and again no choice you make has any result. You are forced to follow this questline in exactly one way, with no other options.

In the first game there's reason to progress the main questline for pretty much any character. In this game there's no reason to follow this plot with any but one of two characters: a pathetically desperate adventurer who wants to save their friend at all costs, or a foolishly ignorant sociopath who wants revenge and doesn't care about being used. Any other character will not make sense in this game.


EDIT: I tried giving the game another go and forgetting about the opening part. It still makes no sense. In fact the only characters that make sense in the [i]rest[/i] of the game are the complete opposite of the only characters that make sense at the start of the game.

The only way to actually experience all the free exploration is to play a character that doesn't care at all about her best friend being captured, incarcerated, and probably constantly tortured. The protagonist can ignore this like a sociopath, and jaunt around the land meeting people and having fun.

Sane options for dealing with the situation (for example try to find the kidnappers / enforcers and ask if you can have your friend back) suggest themselves, but then you're railroaded out of them at every area transition.

The only way this game makes sense and is fun to play, is if you're not playing a character at all, just playing the game and assuming that you have no control over what happens anyway. Even then you still have to ignore the game constantly accusing you of doing things you didn't do. There was an example where you stumble across something happening, it locks your view so you can't do anything until the end of the event, and then when you meet the involved character (Neera) later and say you were there, she screams at you for not helping. The whole game feels like that. Nothing you do has any effect on the plot, and it constantly stops you from doing what you want to do, and tells you you did something you didn't.

In short, as above, if you actually want to roleplay, even the slightest amount - do not play this game.

This really annoys me, because i can see that if it was constructed better, chilled out with the ****ing railroads, and actually gave the character more information (your friend is okay, you should go get stronger before saving her), it would be a fine game.",1500097812,1528546405,False,14,1,0.427710235118865967,4,True,False,False

My absolute favourite game of all time. Played the original to death and I'll do the same for the enhanced edition.

The combat is deep and tactical.
The Story is engaging and gripping til the end.
The inter party dialogues and relationships are still one of the best, lots of people complained about the romances but I found them all very fullfilling.
The world may seem relatively small by todays standards but each area and city is rich with sidequests and adventure.


Even after so many years of playing this game with multiple playthroughs I still find new things I never saw before.

When a transcendent level of BOTH Quantity AND Quality collide, you get Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn, the great Magnum Opus of our time. One of the most revolutionary video-game series of all time, and THE most ground-breaking RPG saga ever. A perfect rendition of Dungeons and Dragons and one of the best gameplay designs in gaming history. A High fantasy setting and tale that rivals The Lord of the Rings. The template for every open world game that came after. Games that you thought were revolutionary, like TES Morrowind or GTA 3, were literally just 3D renditions of Baldur’s Gate 2’s world designed with perfect content-density. In this game, a sword features more character development and better voice acting than the entire Elder Scrolls series.

-Captured by Mind Flayers
-Find out What Happened to Montaron
-Find Proof of Mae'Var's Treachery
-Gain the Services of Sir Sarles for the Temple
-Inside the Planar Sphere
-Investigate and Destroy the Cult of the Eyeless
-Investigate the Deaths in the Umar Hills
-Rescue Gerran's Child from Firkraag
-Rescue Raelis and Haer'Dalis from the Planar Prison
-Seek Out and Investigate the Fallen Paladins
-Solve the Riddle in the Sewers
-Solve the 'skinner' Murders in the Bridge District

The above would be among the best RPG main stories ever, but they aren't, they are SIDE quests! All for one game, one game that still stands in 2018 with a game world of unparalleled scope, atmosphere, and intrigue. Each of the above-mentioned quests takes hours, and there are dozens more that I didn't even mention, but there's always more to do, even after you finish them. 

The massive scope of Baldur's Gate 2 is decorated with mostly text-based dialogue (though the main story line is almost fully, and fabulously, voice acted). Despite featuring the best side-content in all of gaming's history, the main story is still the best part of the game. Dialogue that represents the best writing the gaming industry has to offer. BioWare's storytelling in this game hasn't been matched for 17 years. Baldur's Gate is not a story about saving the world, like countless other RPGs. Instead, it is a personal story about your character's struggles with his own evil inheritance and corrupted lineage that has led to the people around him suffering because of your tainted blood.

But it features everything else we all love about the best BioWare games. BG2 Probably still stands as the best cast BioWare has written. 20 deep and intriguing, well developed characters make up the cast of NPCs you get to choose from to form your party of 6. Each of those party members will banter with each other, and will question your decisions, and sometimes your decisions will lead to them leaving you, or even trying to kill you. And if you manage to keep them all there's a classic BioWare style quest that is unique to each companion, and will ultimately shape your relationship with them, for good or for bad.

There's plenty complex gameplay that overlays a massive adventure here. 7 races, dozens of classes, and HUNDREDS of abilities and spells are all yours to experiment with as you clash with HUNDREDS of different kinds of enemies and monsters that represent some of the coolest beasts in Dungeons and Dragons, who all possess abilities and spells of the same complexity. Decorated with a fantastic inventory UI, THOUSANDS of epic weapons and other equipment to customize your party with, visually stunning spell effects and surprisingly immersive sound effects, this game still boasts the most epic RPG fights in the history of gaming. There's always something new to learn about the combat, so this gameplay will never cease to engage and interest you.

You'll find yourself in a dungeon, trying to rescue a poor man's daughter from a dragon, but that dragon instantly butchers all of your tanky warriors as soon as you unpause. You'll find yourself in an ancient ruin with a demon that is immune to all forms of attack. The challenges are endless in this game, and they rival Dark Souls, but they are equally rewarding as well. When you finally figure out how to kill that Dragon, his loot will turn you into a demi-god, which is good, because you will have to fight a God in the next fight.

The main quest features many more well-written characters besides the 20 NPCs that you get to choose. A quest that will take you on unforgettable adventures, not only through the Forgotten Realms, but through human emotion. Torture, imprisonment, war, death, suffering, betrayal, deceit, love, redemption, and atonement are all features in this wonderfully dark and gripping tale. 

The mage Jon Irenicus, widely regarded as the best videogame villain of all time, tries to strip you of your powers, tortures you, and interrogates you on your abominable and inhuman nature. These atrocities will linger with you for the entire game, and often come up in strangely philosophical nightmares whenever you rest. Because of his simple identity as a fallen human being with reasonable insights about human nature and society, yet with an aura of pure evil, he reminds me of Heath Ledger's Joker. He takes your friends from you, and he steals your very soul, and leads you on the most enthralling fantasy adventure that has ever been crafted, as you chase him through Elven forests, Catacombs full of vampires, alternate planes of existence, cities below the Ocean, Mage Asylums, Islands ruled by barbaric Pirates, treetop Elven cities, The Underdark, Drow cities, Beholder lairs, Mind Flayer cities, a lair of Dragon Demi-Gods, a city besieged by an army of Fire Giants, Gnomish Cities, the ancient prison of the Prince of Demons, and even to the Deepest circle of Hell. An assortment of locations and sights that encompass as many spectacles as every RPG from the last 18 years combined.

17 years later people are still playing this game, and the only ones who wouldn't tell you it's one of the best, if not THE best RPG of all time, are the ones who haven't played it. It's better late than never to change that. No other videogame has a combination of such a massive game world full of atmospheric detail and intrigue, combined with flawless and gripping writing, and extremely engaging and rewarding gameplay. And along with everything else, this games soundtrack will stick with you for the rest of your life, along with many of the characters, and many of the events.

If you call yourself a gamer, you must play this game. Period. You will thank me after you finish crying through the ending cut-scene for the Throne of Bhaal DLC

The pinnacle of the series that blew the RPG standard sky high.
-The first open world that was well decorated with interesting content
-The first RPG that had rewarding open world exploration, 
-The First videogame with character development,
-invented companion romances and party banter,
-invented the concept of decisions changing the story content of the game,
-invented the formula that was followed by The Witcher series, ANY Bethesda game that came after, Mass Effect 1-3, Dragon Age 1-3, and every other RPG you've heard of that came out after September 2000.

And most notably, the Infinity Engine still has the absolute best control scheme and User Interface of any RPG.

Baldur's Gate had the same effect on the videogame industry that the original Star Wars trilogy had on the movie industry.

One of the most revolutionary video-game series of all time, and THE most ground-breaking RPG saga ever. A perfect rendition of Dungeons and Dragons and one of the best gameplay designs in gaming history. A High fantasy setting and tale that rivals The Lord of the Rings. The template for every open world game that came after. Games that you thought were revolutionary, like TES Morrowind or GTA 3, were literally just 3D renditions of Baldur’s Gate 2’s world designed with perfect content-density. In this game, a sword features more character development and better voice acting than the entire Elder Scrolls series.

The above would be among the best RPG main stories ever, but they aren't, they are SIDE quests! All for one game, one game that still stands in 2018 with a game world of unparalleled scope, atmosphere, and intrigue. Each of the above-mentioned quests takes hours, and there are dozens more that I didn't even mention, but there's always more to do, even after you finish them. 

The massive scope of Baldur's Gate 2 is decorated with mostly text-based dialogue (though the main story line is almost fully, and fabulously, voice acted). Despite featuring the best side-content in all of gaming's history, the main story is still the best part of the game. Dialogue that represents the best writing the gaming industry has to offer. BioWare's storytelling in this game hasn't been matched for 17 years. Baldur's Gate is not a story about saving the world, like countless other RPGs. Instead, it is a personal story about your character's struggles with his own evil inheritance and corrupted lineage that has led to the people around him suffering because of your tainted blood.

But it features everything else we all love about the best BioWare games. BG2 Probably still stands as the best cast BioWare has written. 20 deep and intriguing, well developed characters make up the cast of NPCs you get to choose from to form your party of 6. Each of those party members will banter with each other, and will question your decisions, and sometimes your decisions will lead to them leaving you, or even trying to kill you. And if you manage to keep them all there's a classic BioWare style quest that is unique to each companion, and will ultimately shape your relationship with them, for good or for bad.

There's plenty complex gameplay that overlays a massive adventure here. 7 races, dozens of classes, and HUNDREDS of abilities and spells are all yours to experiment with as you clash with HUNDREDS of different kinds of enemies and monsters that represent some of the coolest beasts in Dungeons and Dragons, who all possess abilities and spells of the same complexity. Decorated with a fantastic inventory UI, THOUSANDS of epic weapons and other equipment to customize your party with, visually stunning spell effects and surprisingly immersive sound effects, this game still boasts the most epic RPG fights in the history of gaming. There's always something new to learn about the combat, so this gameplay will never cease to engage and interest you.

You'll find yourself in a dungeon, trying to rescue a poor man's daughter from a dragon, but that dragon instantly butchers all of your tanky warriors as soon as you unpause. You'll find yourself in an ancient ruin with a demon that is immune to all forms of attack. The challenges are endless in this game, and they rival Dark Souls, but they are equally rewarding as well. When you finally figure out how to kill that Dragon, his loot will turn you into a demi-god, which is good, because you will have to fight a God in the next fight.

The main quest features many more well-written characters besides the 20 NPCs that you get to choose. A quest that will take you on unforgettable adventures, not only through the Forgotten Realms, but through human emotion. Torture, imprisonment, war, death, suffering, betrayal, deceit, love, redemption, and atonement are all features in this wonderfully dark and gripping tale. 

The mage Jon Irenicus, widely regarded as the best videogame villain of all time, tries to strip you of your powers, tortures you, and interrogates you on your abominable and inhuman nature. These atrocities will linger with you for the entire game, and often come up in strangely philosophical nightmares whenever you rest. Because of his simple identity as a fallen human being with reasonable insights about human nature and society, yet with an aura of pure evil, he reminds me of Heath Ledger's Joker. He takes your friends from you, and he steals your very soul, and leads you on the most enthralling fantasy adventure that has ever been crafted, as you chase him through Elven forests, Catacombs full of vampires, alternate planes of existence, cities below the Ocean, Mage Asylums, Islands ruled by barbaric Pirates, treetop Elven cities, The Underdark, Drow cities, Beholder lairs, Mind Flayer cities, a lair of Dragon Demi-Gods, a city besieged by an army of Fire Giants, Gnomish Cities, the ancient prison of the Prince of Demons, and even to the Deepest circle of Hell. An assortment of locations and sights that encompass as many spectacles as every RPG from the last 18 years combined.

17 years later people are still playing this game, and the only ones who wouldn't tell you it's one of the best, if not THE best RPG of all time, are the ones who haven't played it. It's better late than never to change that. No other videogame has a combination of such a massive game world full of atmospheric detail and intrigue, combined with flawless and gripping writing, and extremely engaging and rewarding gameplay. And along with everything else, this games soundtrack will stick with you for the rest of your life, along with many of the characters, and many of the events.

If you call yourself a gamer, you must play this game. Period. You will thank me after you finish crying through the ending cut-scene for the Throne of Bhaal DLC

The pinnacle of the series that blew the RPG standard sky high.
-The first open world that was well decorated with interesting content
-The first RPG that had rewarding open world exploration, 
-The First videogame with character development,
-invented companion romances and party banter,
-invented the concept of decisions changing the story content of the game,
-invented the formula that was followed by The Witcher series, ANY Bethesda game that came after, Mass Effect 1-3, Dragon Age 1-3, and every other RPG you've heard of that came out after September 2000.

And most notably, the Infinity Engine still has the absolute best control scheme and User Interface of any RPG.

Baldur's Gate had the same effect on the videogame industry that the original Star Wars trilogy had on the movie industry.

Unlike its predecessor however, I had no prior experience or childhood memories of this game because I never owned BG II as a kid. I came into this experience without a bias of nostalgia and basically took it for what it was.

It was a pretty solid RPG experience, with enough replayabilty for me to go at it quite a few times. The plot is pretty solid and interesting. The villians are really good. There were a lot of challenging and fun experiences. The game mechanics are similar to the first game so they're hard to initially get comfortable with, but once you're into it, it gets really easy to play with, and it's got some different little surprises and neat item finds along your journey to balance out the hard work you put into the fights.

I liked the side quests, although I will admit that there seemed to be a lot of walking back and forth between the same checkpoints which I found to be pretty darn tedious. There seemed to be a lot more maps in the wilds to traverse with plenty of goofy side quests along the way through in the first game, but in this game you spend a lot of time walking to places back and forth in the city of Athkatla and, maybe I'm a druid for thinking this, but overspending time in big cities is always super boring to me. I like to feel like an explorer in my RPGs so that didn't really do it for me.

And as much as I loved my party members, I felt like they were significantly less compelling in this game than they felt in the first game. I actually installed a couple character mods just to make it more interesting because I felt like some of them were written so flatly. The mods really added a dash of salt to the meal, if you get my meaning. 

This game did a fine job of introducing tons more different monsters to fight, and some really cool weapons too. So it definitely doesn't lack in the variety in those departments.

I guess all and all, I recommend this game. I admit to not enjoying it as much as my first Baldur's Gate experience, but it was still a lotta fun and I had a good time! My game didn't crash nearly as much as some reviews have pointed out. I think after at least 3 full-game playthroughs and 6 really short half-playthroughs, the game's crashed on me a total of 4 times. So that's not so bad. Especially because you can quicksave and the game will auto-save on occasion so it won't screw you up too bad. 

The Baldur's Gate games together however, are a lovely and addicting experience. I loved this series as a whole and loved the characters after the time I spent with them. Especially the protagonist that I built throughout the series. There's always something compelling about getting to make choices in games, and these games excell at pushing short term and long term plots forward based on the person you want to play as.

If you wanna play this game, I'd highly recommend you give the first Baldur's Gate a try. It's not required, but it adds a whole lot to this sequel and you'll definitely be driven to see how the entire story plays out until the end.",1521352539,1521360440,True,3,0,0.5677146315574646,1,True,False,False

The bigger screen is definitely nice, but I do see what some of the other reviewers mean about bugs.  Companion walking AI is even worse than the original.  At times it's like herding freaked out cats.  I have issues where my characters will try to walk right up to an opponent before casting a spell.  NOT fun with something like Fireball.  I felt like I had better control of my party in the original edition.  

Having all the extras thrown in is nice though.  I do have to agree with the previous reviewer who said Hexxat's voice acting was flat.  Granted until you complete that first mission for her, she's supposed to be in a trance (close as I want to get to a spoiler), but that could have been sold (acted) better.  After that point her voice acting is a bit better, but I was still bored enough with the character that she got the boot.

I'd say the main reason to go with this version vs the old is convenience.  No fussing with mods, etc...  DL and it's done.  If you're good enough at installing mods manually though, you'd be just as happy with the gog version or your old CDs (still have mine, lol).


ADDENDA:  Seems like some of the updates since I wrote my review have fixed the AI to some degree.  One thing I definitely dislike however is that they cut out the cut scenes at the end of Shadows of Amn and the start  of Throne of Bhaal.  Those were important for following the story, and it was nice to see the villain from SoA get his just deserts at the end.

It does not excel in any one particular field such as combat (where Temple of Elemental Evil is my favorite) or writing (Planescape: Torment obviously reigns supreme), but it is at least competent in every area. As a complete package, there is no other RPG that comes close. 

The one major downside is that the D&D mechanics can take some time and effort to grasp for someone who is completely new to the series, but the investment is well worth it. Just remember that lower = better in the case of Armor Class and THAC0. 

As with the other Infinity Engine games (except Icewind Dale II where the source code is apparently lost), Beamdog has done a fine job bringing the interface and resolution into the modern era. Regarding the NPCs and other content that they've added, I'm a bit more lukewarm about those. Their additions don't quite reach the same level of quality as the original game, and the contrast can be jarring at times. On the other hand, they're not awful either, and they're easy enough to ignore in any case. It's amazing that we're seeing fresh content for such an old game at all.

It's aged like a bottle of fine wine - the cork is a bit harder to get out, but the contents are better than ever.  The UI has been significantly improved with QoL features in this enhanced release, such as a quickloot bar that alleviates the need to go gibberling gem hunting.  The 2nd edition AD&D ruleset is archaic as always, but I find it extremely satisfying to learn and slowly gain mastery in.

If you like games where it feels impossible at first until you try another tactic and suddenly its super easy, well, this game is sure to please.  The modding community is alive and well despite this game rapidly approaching it's 20th anniversary.

The writing is excellent, the humor hilarious, the characters are interesting and multi-dimensional.  There is far more inter-party banter than in the first game, and there are even some conflicts between different NPC companions.  Don't forget there's like 25 companions and you can only have 5 with you at any given point in time!

I've been playing this game since like 2011 or 2012 and I've only beaten the entire thing once.  Simply generating different characters can be a fun way to pass hours, let alone rolling them out the door.

The enhanced release also includes The Black Pits, which is an arena style fighting pit.  It lacks the story and depth of the main campaign, but is an excellent option for to-the-point blood baths.  And since the campaign is already so perfect, the lack of story here doesn't really matter.  You get a lot of XP very fast in The Black Pits 2, which is awesome because I finally got to try out one of those Time Stop - Chain Contingency - 3x Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wiltings combos.  Whoa nelly, there ain't much left standing after that.

First off this is possibly the most epic story ever written for a video game.  Without saying too much, the plot revolves around the God of Murder being dead, but leaving behind scores of children vying for ascencion as the new God of murder.  The writing is great, the banter between party members is often excellent, and rarely annoying.  There is enough variety for multiple playthoughs, though if you are a completionist the game is plenty long on it's own.  

Save often!

Combat is very technical, and if you play on normal or higher you will die often.  You can create your enitre party, which does make the game easier, but I strongly recommend NOT doing that, since the recruitable characters in game greatly enhance the story.  But yeah, the BG games are pretty much the Dark Souls of the tactical RPG world.  You can't just run your party headfirst into every fight.  Tough fights are a fairly regular occurrence, and when you run into one you will likey get wiped the first time, then have to reload and come up with a battle plan.  If that is not your style, you are able to lower the difficulty so you can focus on enjoying the story.

This is basically a 20 year old game, but the work done on the Enhanced Editions really clean it up.  Beamdog did a great job modernizing the UI and graphics, while adding some worthwhile content.  The game still holds up against modern top down RPGs like Pillars of Eternity, Divinity: Original Sin, Dragon Age: Origins,

If you play through the entire BG Saga, including all expansions and Enhanced Edition content you are easily looking at a 200-300 hour epic.  You may as well buy the Complete Saga, but at a minimum you will want both BG and BGII to play through the main story.  You will get your money's worth.

Disclaimer: since I'm not into D&D, I decided to give it a go on Story Mode, which pretty much makes the game too easy to be fun. Despite the complete lack of challenge, I fell in love with the characters, and also with the systems.
Then I started another run, as a solo Undead Hunter, on the highest difficulty. It was brutal, so I imported another character and restarted. It was also brutal, but I had a chance, so I kept going on and on, until I finished it again.
And yet, I've yet to uncover the two expansions and all the other content I didn't discover. It's amazing how this game offers so many hidden stuff and doesn't just feed its content on a silver plate.
I kinda feel bad for starting on Story Mode, but I promise to play better when I buy Icewind Dale and the other IE games.

Amazing Old School CRPG. I fully recommend this. 

Ive had Steam for a while but as my first review, this has to be my first review. Ive beaten this game a half dozen times throughout my life, but my first time on Steam. The Enhanced version is a huge step up from the original. Adding mods and smoothing out the rough edges that came with games from the very early 2000’s. 

If you’ve never played this game, and you enjoy RPGs, then this will be a fantastic way to play one of the top games that paved the way for what games have become today. If you’ve never played the Enhanced Edition, but love the original, then find some time to relive this nostalgic world with all the new additions. 

This game is like the Skyrim of 2001. You played it a lot and now that the Enhanced Edition is out, it’s like playing it all over again but with a few extra mods to spice it up.

I've already sunk over 100 hours into this and am onto ToB, and for the price here, you're talking about cents per hour of enjoyment. Yes, it uses AD&D rules (like THAC0) and has a bit of that clunky late 90s/early 2000s interface... but I got completely used to it within the first 15 hours or so and it has been ultra intuitive. Can't recommend this enough... considering I have yet another expansion to go after ToB before I even pick up Planescape, it is crazy how much value is here.

2000/2012

I have stopped and started this game four times since its release. I have no excuse either.  This is the top echelon of isometric cRPGs. Sure, the graphics have grown outdated in the past decade, but story, gameplay, audio and controls all hold up magnificently and were even the gold standard for what could be accomplished back in 2000 for this genre. 

No, the reasons I have never beaten this title until now solely rest upon my shoulders.  As I age, my patience for tedium increases at the cost of perhaps my jerk reflexes. Though, I have been playing RPGs my whole life, so large blocks of endless exposition are nothing new to me.  Also, I've enjoyed DnD since the second edition, so the complex balance between gear, THAC0, magic and stats is old hat for me as well. Lastly, Forgotten Realms is my favorite fantasy world and I have all the books, most of the games, and it has inspired me to fulfill my own demiurges. 
So the graphics, audio, gameplay, controls, story, setting, genre, and mechanics are all decent, magnificent, precise, awesome, divine, perfect, and nostalgic....then, why have I waited fifteen years to beat this...

hmm, wait...wait a second....15....1 and 5 is 6. and the game came out in 2000....6 divided by 2 is three. and 15 is divisible by five 3 times...so like the three points of an Illuminati pyramid, this obviously alludes to the coming announcement of Half-Life 3.

Many consider this game to be the godfather of it's genre with many instant classics that came far after that ran in the same style and flourished to become stalwart games in their own right; Dragon Age, Pillars of Eternity, Divinity Original Sin 2, etc.

Playtime covers 100+ hours of gameplay depending on how much you want to get done with a tremendous amount of replayability dependant on multiple dialogue choices, who you have in your party to interact with those choice dialogues, party selection, party interactions, branching storylines, romance routes, sidequests, class based quests, stat based checks that open up other dialogues, etc, I could go on for ages.

Storyline
Story telling is one of the strongest aspects of the game, it is rich in nature and varied to some degree depending on your choices, which can have real permanent impacts on how it unfolds with other events that occur later. Being a D&D inspired game, how you see your character roleplaying through the game heavily influences interactions you'll have in the game.

Characters
There are about a dozen or so base characters in the game, each with their own unique look and personality. Everyone of them interact with other party members and some may even outright refuse to join you if they see a particular person already with you. Lots of instances in the game have reactive choices as well, meaning they will either comment on your actions or depending on how extreme may even outright leave you. Romances are possible in the game with three standard female options to choose from and one male. Your party can vary in so many ways with the addition of being able to create your own party.

Gameplay
The gameplay is largely based on the DnD 2nd edition ruleset, though you really don't need to be particular familiar with this in order to be able to play it. You are able to either create your own entire party from scratch, which can be a lengthy process if you aren't familiar with the game or choose from existing templates. Battles can be highly tactical in nature with many having numerous ways of being handled depending on your composition, spells and gear. Some encounters will also be different depending on what level you get to them at, being far more difficult if you aren't properly prepared. 

Sound
The voice acting in the game is top notch and there are thousands of lines of dialogue to go through. Not all of it is fully voiced, but all of the important scenes in the game are. Music sets a good pace as well, with some of them being able to indicate a tell tale pace as to what type of encounter you are facing, with major ones playing certain tracks which you will come to know and associate.

On a side note be sure to get any item management items ASAP. Scroll cases, gem bags, bags of holding. Looting things will quickly get out of hand if you don't have the right baggage space.


Pros:
+ Rich storyline
+ Incredible amount of character interaction possiblities and dialogue choices
+ Romance routes possible
+ Ridiculous amount of sidequests
+ Replayability 
+ Great voice acting and enjoyable music
+ Expansions are included

Cons:
- The pathing is so bad, the battles can be quite big and confusing so its a bit frustrating when your tank gets stuck at a crate at the back of the fight or decides to take the long way around simply because your mage blocked the doorway for 1/2 a second; it gets worse in Throne of Bhaal, especially if you have ""Big Metal Unit""
- Some annoying bugs in ToB that force close my game
- Item management was a little pain in the ass
- Some quest bugs like Aerie's companion quest
- Lack of not letting you continue certain sidequests without certain party members being present

TL;DR:
8.5/10
Being the godfather of it's genre, it's definitely stood the test of time. Graphics might not be where the current age is, but it doesn't diminish the shine this game gives off. Deep character developement, rich storyline, hardcore RP elements, amazing amount of replayability, this game is a must if you're a fan of the genre.",1511526254,1511526254,True,1,1,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

>What's awful about it?
Well, it runs on outdated D&D rules. This is 2nd ED from it's heyday, and even though I'm stil a fan of that set of rules, there's *a lot* to memorize and work around. In short, sometimes the rules- and thus the game- can feel clunky or needlessly complicated. If you put in the time to learn these rules, however, you will be rewarded with some deep tactical combat. The EE adds some fantastic difficulty levels for those who truly want some punishment.
The writing can, at times, leave something to be desired. It might feel campy- but then, what D&D story doesn't have it's silly moments?
The graphics are, well, also outdated. EE adds in a handy zoom-in feature, though obviously as you zoom in, the more pixelated the already blocky graphics become. But you're not playing this game for eye candy, surely?
It tries it's best to reward evil protagonists, but exp rewards especially are geared toward good/neutral parties. With the addition of several new evil-aligned companions and added quests, the EE does help bridge this gap a bit. An all-evil party is quite viable now, give you the freedom to play any class you wish and not be penalised by the party composition.

>What's great about it?
Basically, everything. 
The combat is extermely rewarding (after the learning curve). The plot has depth, the villains feel like proper villains, the heroes are excellent heroes, sometimes the heroes are villains and vice versa..
This game captures the feel of a long, cohesive campaign. There's something for everyone here, of all different classes. 
Exploration. Combat. Roleplaying. Character interactions. Sidequests coming out your ears. ""Your party has been waylaid and must defend itself!"" Silliness and seriousness, dragons and so many dungeons. There's always something to do away from the main questline- and you're greatly rewarded for deviating from it frequently with loot, exp, and party banter.

And, best of all, when you've absolutely exhausted everything... There's hundreds of player-created mods to download (or new ones you can write yourself!). New NPCs, new areas, new quests. 18 years after release, BG1 got an expansion. The community *still* creates new content for this series 19 years after release.

Baldur's Gate paved the way for all the ""big"" RPG's; Dragon Age, Mass Effect, Jade Empire, etc. See where it all began, fight for your birthright and eventually, connect the dots- there are Baldur's Gate references in all of Bioware's games for a reason.",1511511117,1511511117,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Beyond considerations for genre, platform, or era.

A deep involving story, memorable characters, tense combat, all wrapped into AD&D's (ironically unforgettable) Forgotten Realms setting. It is the rare sequel that not only outshines the original, but surpasses it in practically every way.

I cannot state enough just how much I love this game. It is, hands down, the best thing that Bioware has ever done.

This 'Enhanced Edition' provides a number of quality of life improvements seen in the original Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition, and, while such things don't necesarily add or remove appeal for me, if it helps new players experience and enjoy these games, I am all for it.

However, in my view, the story is a little less interesting than in BGI (I will not reveal details to avoid spoilers). I think that the focus of the story is mostly on the main villain and your character participation in the whole thing is more marginal than it should be, especially if you compare with BGI, in which your character is the center of the story. Thus, the game does not draw as much as it could from its predecessor, story wise. Although this is OK and the story still interesting, I think that it was less interesting than the previous game.
Nevertheless, the plot is quite well done and it is still an outstanding game and definitely worth playing – especially because now you will be able to see your character fully developed and kicking ass in combat (if you made wise choices during the development…).
About the combat, there is a very specific and annoying thing when you start facing high level spellcasting enemies: there are a variety of damage immunity and other protection spells that must be countered before you can start hurting them. Thus, you must be able to understand how to use an even greater variety of counter spells that can break the protections to beat those enemies. Otherwise, you will constantly have your ass delivered to you in a plate. As a result, you cannot just click and bash through the whole game - you must develop a strategy to deal with these overpowered protection spells.
Just like BGI, it is still possible to customize character speeches. In my experience, this small feature adds a lot of fun to the game, since I usually choose small pieces of songs to make a crazy combination for my character. I know it is silly, but I am not ashamed of liking that.
Finally, the expansion is quite nice and worth playing too. In my view, the character becomes once again the main focus of the history in the expansion, fixing a bit this issue in the previous part of the game.",1510788179,1510788179,True,2,0,0.517045438289642334,0,True,False,False

For old players returning after a long absence, you will immediately recognize a massive change in the UI thanks to some alterations by the aforementioned company. Black borders around the menu screen regardless of resolution, the Barbarian is tossed into the Fighter sub-class category, the original new portraits are replaced with some new-new portraits, and a slew of bugs and incompatability problems that make the game bug out more than it ever has before.

Some mage specialties are impossible to play as (such as Transmuter) because now you need to have a specialty school assigned for every rank during character creation. Except the problem is that not every school has a spell at every rank, which means character creation comes to a screeching halt when selecting your skills.

Making any kind of spell caster is a pain too, because they decided to throw away the Pick For Me option and make it automatically pick for you; as if you're too stupid to make your own decisions. Which means you have to manually go back, unlearn all these spells and pick new ones every time. 

I love Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II and was perfectly happy with the original Enhanced Edition until they pulled this crap. This is exactly what happened with Starwars Galaxies.

They're correct. However, the best reason to find this title lacking is the lack of improvement in gameplay features that are absolutely infuriating.

-The pathfinding is not better. This is because the engine Beamdog uses is nearly identical to the original one. It is not unreasonable to ask a studio developing games at new game prices to develop even a slightly improved engine.

-Trap detection remains a frustrating endeavor. The detect traps button is not toggled automatically, and detection still occurs after an enormous delay. This is just not fun. Unlike many of the other annoying things in BG2, this one has no basis in tabletop gaming, as if your DM made you wait 30 seconds before you were allowed to check for traps, you'd probably smash his glasses.

-Bandit encounters are awful and quickly become pointless. When you travel any substantial distance, you will probably encounter at least one group of bandits, ala BG1. Issue being, these don't scale, or at least not well. They're trivial encounters, often ending with no damage to youur party at all, and even less XP gain.

-Stability is WORSE. I've experienced more crashes with BG2EE than I have in Skyrim. 'nuff said.

-Quest timers. You may enjoy these, I do not. I have not spoken to anyone who does. There is no option to turn them off. 

-Counterintuitive quest requirements. This could be easily resolved by adding a highlight to ALL interactible objects rather than forcing the player to rub the mouse over every nook and cranny, hoping their cursor changes. There is a particular instance where you can lose a party member Permanently (to a quest timer, no less) if you do not mouse over a rather unassuming object. Would Bioware get away with this these days??

Through all that, it's still an engaging game. It's a rather suboptimal use of time, though, since we now live in a video game saturated world. Do yourself a favor, scratch the CRPG itch with Pillars of Eternity instead.",1503183161,1503183161,False,24,3,0.433627277612686157,2,True,False,False

TLDR: If you like RPG's its criminal to not have this in your library.

This is one of the best RPGs ever made. Want to find out how Bioware developed their reputation for deep, rich storytelling, extremely fleshed out worlds, and great characters? I started with Baldur's Gate and was perfected here in BG2. Everything that was done well in BG was improved for this one.

Characters return from BG, but not in a way that will get confusing for someone who skipped BG1. Romance options were added, though some of them are meh. Characters have their own personalities, motivations, and loyalties so you can have personality conflicts that are often humorous, sometimes deadly.

MASSIVE amount of stuff to do. There are many quests and sidequests and many were added to the EE.

Tactical gameplay is the name of the game here. If youre looking for a run in and hack em up, you're gonna have a bad time. If you enjoyed the tactical camera in Dragon Age Origins, this is that on steroids. You need a balanced party and need to plan engagements to survive. This is not power fantasy like Skyrim, where a high level character is basically a god. There is always something to challenge you. Try to take on the Dragons in this game like you do in Skyrim, you'll be a hero shaped scorch mark pretty quick.

The only Cons I can think of are if you don't like to read, you're just not going to enjor this game. There is voice acting in this game, and it is done well, but you will have to read a lot, as most dialogue is not voiced. I don't really consider it a con, but some might.

Also I've run into some framerate drops which oddly enough were solved by saving my game. Strange.

The voice acting and plot are excellent, and miles above more recent RPGs like Skyrim and even Witcher. Don't get me wrong, Witcher 3 is incredible, but Geralt is honestly a monotonous slug. He sounds like Bat-Bale grumbling in his sleep, but even quieter, somehow.

Baldur's Gate doesn't have this problem, with memorable voice actors who bring life and vibrance to the characters they play. Even the personailities you hate will stick in your head long after you finish (coughMinsc), and main villain Jon Irenicus is still one of the best antagonists in any video game. He doeesn't have time to stand around monologuing about his evil plans of world domination, he's too busy experimenting on humans and/or blasting them into red mist. I'm pretty sure he wipes out half the wizard population all by himself over the course of the game.

You should absolutely play this if you enjoy old-school RPGs, and especially if you're a D&D(2e) fan. The replayability is amazing, as most quests can be solved in multiple ways, often good or evil, and each class gets its own unique missions to acquire their base. The main story is long, but if you try to completely every side quest alongside it, you will be looking at well over a hundred hours on just a single character. Better yet, I can't remember a single fetch quest, and even the simple ""retrieve item for person"" quests had an interesting backstory to them.

Even though I am comparing a trilogy of games to one,it’s obvious how much the scope of BG is meant to be examined as a whole, not individually. For example, the beginning of BG2 starts the mid-to-late game of a character’s progression. Anyone in 2017 who wishes to venture into the series should know that is how they should set their expectations for the type of adventure before them. 

The journey of that adventure is as important as the camaraderie you forge along the way that has become a staple for modern BioWare, and every game afterwards has been compared to the BG series. Although Baldur's Gate 2 and DAI are separated by nearly twenty years of design philosophies, RPG standards, gamer expectations and opinions on how successful are these games, I found each game’s sense of scale to resonate with one another like brothers long forgotten. While there are inherent differences in the freedom of choices for otherwise linear questlines and stories, the scale of all these linear features offers a sense of non-linearity that is greater than any sandbox hoping to achieve the same effect in the grandness of quantity versus quality. 

[h1]To D&D or Not to D&D?[/h1]

However, despite the BG series maintaining its quality along with its quantity, BG2 suffers a  problem that I feel is more exasperated in DAI, and that issue is player fatigue with its mechanics. 

In my previous review of BG1, I had hoped to learn AD&D someday so well to better appreciate experiences like Durlag’s Tower by mastering the rules themselves. I had considered the pursuit plausible but not worthwhile of my time to beat the rules at their own game. When I choose to take a break after the 40/45 hours of BG1 & SoD, however, I set myself up for disaster; the Chapter 1/Prologue of BG2 only helps you so far before you’re released into the mass of content that is Chapter 2. 
 
What I think is one issue that SoD introduced to the franchise, unintentionally, is that the time it takes to get to BG2 is when the mechanics start to lose their luster. Even without mentioning the expansion for BG1, the expansion Throne of Bhaal eventually bored me from the same problem as I found the repetition of combat without a whole lot of extra complexities or challenges to wear out my patience. Add to the fact that setting the difficulty to anything but Story Mode will also add time because of micromanagement and do overs in combat, and the game begins to show signs that it is overstaying its welcome. That is an issue I think people are going to have to ask themselves whether to keep the challenge to retain your interest in the gameplay or cut-it-out to experience the game faster. 

One reason for this feeling of being overwhelmed at the very beginning is how the game acts are structured. Previously, BG1 had you wandering around the woods, funneled by various challenges to guide you to where you needed to go, before giving you a city and the rest of the map to explore. BG2, however, is the exact opposite; you start out in a giant city and world to explore, and as you move on to Chapters 3 – 10, the game gets progressively more linear. Not all the quests must be done before Chapter 3 as you have the chance to continue them, but I think the content would have been better had it not been so cramped at the start and more evened out along the linear parts of the game. 

[h1]Requiem of The Bhaalspawn[/h1]

As much as people have given much praise for BG2’s storytelling for BioWare, it’s rather interesting how many people believe the storyline is malleable to player agency when most of it is a guise of choice. However, because of the scale of that journey, the little details like companions forgetting you or coming back to life (Xzar) does not break the immersion. Events play out in a manner that enhances the storyline of the antagonists always being one step ahead of you no matter what you choose, and rather than insulting the player due to the limitations of their decisions or whiplashing the player back on to the linear progression, the story is benefited by this design as it adds character to what many would consider to be the greatest villain of all time, Jon Irenicus. 

What also works is that no matter what faction or ""good or evil"" path you take on repeated 
playthroughs there is always something new to experience or a new chain of events that adds value to both the worldbuilding as well as the replayability of BG. This is all before adding difficulty modifiers or handicaps/party-configurations as additional reasons for replaying the game. All of these reasons, and more, are why I believe many feel that BG2 is the pinnacle of RPGs as both a story and a game because both the game-design, gameplay and narrative benefit reopening the book from the start and finding all new details to explore. 

And when the Bhaalspawn has undergone all the trials and tribulations, the meanderings of fate and the questions of destiny that plagues every choice, the player reaches its end. Rather than establishing a definitive moral high-ground choice or an absolutely deplorable one, the player is left to make the decision of whether to accept the guidance and struggles of fate to reap the rewards for selfish or alternative reasons in claiming godhood or to renounce everything gained for a quieter life free from immortal concerns and to live out the rest of the days as a mortal with the company discovered along the way. 

The finality of this decision cements any lasting concerns or desires to see the storyline to continue from this point onwards and it is why there is no need to make another sequel to extend the continuity any further, a point many series should learn to accept and to move on to greater adventures yet to come.",1493309122,1495920185,True,10,9,0.640622854232788086,9,True,False,False

I was going to preface the review with the greatest WCRPG ever made, or perhaps the greatest RPG ever made but neither of those really describe the scope of this game's promise.  Sure, you'll probably end up having more hours in other games.  If you play a multiplayer game and you're playing for the people, you aren't really going to credit the game for those relationships but as I stare at my original BG II: SoA case sitting on my shelf, I'm supremely happy that I bought the Steam Enhanced Edition.  BG II quite simply has everything you can want out of a video game.

Unlike so many RPGs, BG II has the perfect balance of linear story, and branching exploration.  In fact, it's one of the few RPGs I've ever played that has successfully achieved that goal.  In BG II, you pursue a tense and captivating story, but the game allows you to explore Amn and the surrounding countryside at your leisure.  The result is an experience that doesn't feel like a plot train, nor like a meandering sandbox devoid of purpose.  Every main quest and its satellite components fit neatly in the plot mythos, creating a truly organic and wonderful experience.

Thematically, the location of Faerun is as rich and varied as high traditional high fantasy can be, rivaling even that of Tolkien's creations.  The game features a large, exotic sister city to Baldur's Gate (Amn), rife with political intrigue and a myriad of hidden secrets.  Walk past a bar a dozen times, and yet on the thirteenth a new adventure allows you to find an underground cellar with new, untold dangers.  The cavernous Underdark, hidden druidic groves, pirate ships, desolate islands, dark forests, castles of every imagination, ruins and even planar travel await you in this game.

The variety is staggering but theme alone doesn't propel this game's story.  A plot full of surprises, twists, moments of worry, panic and dread make this game something that you experience, not play.  The game organically develops, unfurling the finale like petals in a flower, instead of so many other, formulaic RPG plots.  Perhaps the characterization however, is the game's strongest storytelling element.  A diverse array of characters exist, both comically memorable and fearsomely grim and they not only interact with the protagonist but also with each other, with staggering consequences.  

After playing through BG II and its expansion ToB, and logging over 240 hours with the original release, I am now happy to introduce other gamers to this forgotten classic.  With rich and deep tacitcal gameplay, endless customizeability and properly functioning multiplayer, everyone can now enjoy this gem of a game.  And because the game has such low system requirements, no one is left out.

I played this game 15 years ago, as an adult but even as a grownup, I was still transformed by the depth and breadth of this amazing gaming experience.  Fifteen years later, middle aged as I am, I still appreciate what a special title this really is.  From art design, to music, to gameplay this title will give you exactly what you put in.

Buy it, sit down, steep yourself in the lore.  Go slow and luxuriate in the rich tale that will unfold.  As a gamer, I can think of no better gift to my peers than to recommend this game.

Must buy.

So, in a way I can't say much, but I CAN absolutely say that it does suck when the glitches occur and it sucks worse when they require ctrl-alt-deleting and starting over from your last save. The most painful glitches would happen if my friend and I tried to talk to NPCs at the same time, which once we discovered we did our best to avoid. Not the worst thing, but when you consider how slow the original Baldur's Gates are and you add a wrench in the works to make it slower, ugh.

This truly a deep, rich and satisfying RPG, one of the best I've played, even compared to Mass Effect and Witcher. 
I was quite used to the isometric style fresh out of playing BG1, Neverwinter Nights, Divinity Original Sin, and Fallout 1/2. As such, I adjusted quickly to the play style and was able to play on Core Rules on my first playthrough, though this proved quite challenging at times.
The gameplay is pretty much the same as BG1, though the expanded level cap and abilities open up new possibilities with how your party can operate. It also makes otherwise weak characters quite potent. Mages are still the most powerful class due to the sheer amount of spells available, and this also makes combat quite dynamic and require preparation and strategy. Perhaps too much, it felt - some abilities are needed, like Breach, Greater Whirlwind, Time Stop, etc... so some research helps with higher difficulties. Pausing is pretty much needed on high difficulties as killing mages is usually a priority, and positioning your tanks appropriately goes a long way to surviving battles.
Sound and voice acting are very good and atmospheric, but was quite subdued for most of the game. However, the amount of character interactions more than make up for it. In BG1 there was barely any, but in this game each character has the amount of dialogue with you that Mass effect did. The romance I had was actually very deep and led to a very satisfying ending for my story, and when I finished the game, I felt genuinely happy with my time with these characters, but also sad as if saying goodbye.
The graphics for the environments look very beautiful with its rich colours appropriate to each setting. The character models are not as sharp, unfortunately, but so long as you don't zoom in too much, its not very noticeable.
The difficulty can be a problem as you go along, however, If you don't follow a walkthrough, chances are you'll miss a really powerful item that turns future encounters easy, rather than frustrating bordering on impossible if you don't have it. That'll be a frustration for anyone who plays the first time through, though perhaps it would be more sensible to play on a lower difficulty first.
All in all, this is one of the RPG experiences that I probably won't forget. It hearkens back to that feeling of being fully immersed in the setting and invested in your character, because you feel like you are the character. It never feels like you're forced into anything... with the exception of one or two dialogue choices. On that note, I also really liked how they handled dragons in this game. Unlike Dragon Age, it never forces dragon slaying down your throat, and the dragons are actually powerful, mystical creatures rather than cannon fodder they are in Dragon Age. The game also lets you spare them even when it's impractical, and I really appreciate that given how many games force you to fight them nowadays.
This game is truly a testament to what RPGs are at their best... but also a sad reminder of how far Bioware has fallen. It seems a symptom of modern day video game industry, and unavoidable. However, I would say support games like this, where the developers show their creativity, care and attention to detail and who deliver rich and satisfying game experiences.

now the issue i do have with the game is to make party banter appear (it almost NEVER appears sadly, except your love interest or potential love interests. those activate correctly still) you have to hit CTRL+I and keep hitting it until banter starts. it sucks but at least you have the option of going through all of it whenever you want. just fyi, i don't know if this happens in shadows of amn, but in throne of bhaal your love interests party banter will repeat when hitting ctrl +I. it's annoying but i wanted to finish the banter of my other characters before finishing the game.

gameplay wise this is fun once you understand how the stats work and that crowd control and summons trump dps mages. that and haste is everything. makes the game run at a tolerable speed. your normal walk is just slow. 

I also love how each member of the party acts differently with eachother. like some characters will try and kill eachother. it's a aspect of a game i've never seen before besides the BG series. i think it's a shame other games don't do this. it leads to more playthroughs. i've done a full good playthrough and am playing a evil playthrough with 2 of the new characters and i enjoy it still with over 150 hours of playtime.

now a huge con of this game is that there are bugs. like i mentioned earlier there is banter bugs but there are some quests that litterally don't finish sometimes. like for example during edwins quest this guy shows up and tries to fix edwin. he does and then it's suppose to start a fight (edwin is a jerk but really fun party member honestly) the fight didn't activate tell i reloaded it three times. 

the biggest con of the game would have to be that it crashes constantly. now to be fair i looked it up on the internet and i think i found the solution (I haven't crashed in about 10 hours of play) it had me make the save folders in my documents not read only. remove the checked box on it. this probably wont work for everyone though. also i turned on admin for the EXE file and switched it to compatible with xp service pack 3. I do not know if this had any effect but it seems to help it. will see later on i guess. 

TL:DR great game with bugs but the game loads in so quick that when it crashes it's not a big deal. if this was pillars of eternity i'd have broken my monitor... that game takes forever to load... characters in this game are amazing and i do like dorn and hexxat of the new characters. i have not touch the other 2 (3 if you count the dark elf from 1. dunno why he isn't in 2) gameplay is fun but i think crowd control was overdone in D&D it lasts... way to long. other than that i highly recommend this game to anyone that loves isometric strategy games. hell, if you like a great story (even with todays cinematic stories this one beats almost all of them with how much detail they go into party member relationships.) they have a story mode button to basically make your party members immortal. they'll go to 1 hp and not die. if your unsure buy the game on discount. also i don't like BG1 much. the story was very bland compared to 2. they are night and day for me.",1492005814,1492006014,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Main Reason However?
Baldurs Gate (The original) which can be bought on Gog.com is ... Better for the most part for many reasons I'll list a few quickie reasons
1) After 3+ Hours or even before that this game get Buggie Like ... Realy Buggie
2) Heck GoG.Com Version MP works better then this games MP
3) This game is EZ Mode yeah the hardest differcultys Make this game hard To a point but I can play gog.com play on norm differculty still have problems Legit Challange Differculty
4) Lore/Gameplay itself Immersion seems to be NOT as strong in this vs the BG origional I remeber and still run across better fights / NPCS and other things that where More immersive in the game,  Example Assassins trying to kill you / Murderers / Thugs trying to steal things like that.

Considering you can get the Origional on Gog.com cheap and its not nearly as buggie and what knock? I rather get that then this .... Provided i could go back in time.",1491362896,1491362896,False,5,2,0.264237940311431885,0,True,False,False

No longer looks like it shows you on the screenshots, which is false advertising and tons of bugs aswell. Oh yeah, also makes your characters INVULNERABLE on easy ""story mode"", whatever that is. Great update.

EDIT: I decided that I love this game enough to give it the review it deserves, so here goes:

This game is amazing, in terms of everything from combat to story to world building and music.
There was a new update that kinda ruined the game, but there's a way to restore the old game if you go into properties > betas and select the 1.3 update. That makes the game what it used to be before the update: Good old Baldur's Gate, but with some updates like the multiplayer and resolution. (Works on both 1 and 2)

This game shines in the story aspects. The combat can be a bit tedious at time but at the core it's very solid. The game is based on Dungeons and Dragons rules, I'm not sure which edition. The stories are an official part of the D&D universe so this game is D&D canon. The stories are excellently done and you never know what to expect next in this game. It can literally be anything, no matter how ridiculous, wild or just purely awesome. Some grand quests take you through epic dungeons, fighting monsters from old folk legends, other quests have you kill god-like creatures, while others just have you solve a town quarrel or the likes. There's a wide arrange of amazing writing and voice acting in this game, and the most amazing questlines I've ever played in a game. Even if the game might be a bit outdated, I think it's worth to play for this fact alone.",1459641960,1490952833,False,69,2,0.539896190166473389,2,True,False,False

The NPC's have a load of fun interactions with one another and most fit little niches for party customisation and story progression. 

The wealth of magical items, equipment, weapons etc. available for you to hunt down and loot is fantastic. The main USP of this title compared to the likes of PoE is the uniqueness of special equipment that you can find and its interplay with encounters throughout the game. You don't just craft a 'normal/fine/rare/epic' weapon or armor piece, you find them on the corpse of a difficult foe at the end of a dungeon and your use of that item echoes your achievement without being overpowered.Some of the swords/flails/what have you have names and one of them even talks to you.

 For the most part, your path through the game is quite non-linear to the extent that you can journey about and make yourself as overpowered as you like before embarking on the main story, provided you're comfortable putting the work in.

The combat has a wealth of strategic potential. You'll be saving and re-loading many times to approach encounters with different strategies, and it's not going to feel tedious. 

The lore is interesting from what I've payed attention to, but I'm not exactly a lore guy.

Some seriously memorable people, places, and fights are packed into this title. It doesn't have an ""overwhelmingly positive"" response on steam at the time of writing, but I think that's a function of older players picking up the enhanced edition and not being totally happy with the quality of the added NPC's and their stories, which I agree with personally. Look up the reviews for the original release and see the overwhelming positivity for yourself. This game is a rare accomplishment on a significance and qualitative par with the likes of final fantasy 7 and I think you owe it to yourself to play through it.

In contrast, the final Throne of Bhaal portion is a very linear march through the final bosses, adding 15 hours of gameplay.

Everything in this series is inspiration and glory.

EDIT: I don't see why people bitch about EE version, when you can't even get the original to work on windows 10, and their +50 mods to just make it work, asking your self is this the original experience everybody was talking about?

After latest patch many things were fixed and i understand many fan boys are insulted the change of graphics or the price tag. Not to mention half of the websites offering you ""mods"" are out dated,
original installed is outdated for new windows/OSX. So shove it in your ass fan boys, original is great and will always be, but this is also great ""fix"" to play on modern system.

And who the hell buys games on steam for full price? Just wait for sale, when its 5.75€ like I did.
Now a game for that little money deserves a better rating in review section.

Again for those who dont own windows XP and willpower for installation of 50 mods, this is the right version.

I personally found no bugs that are so infamous for EE version. But i have found many fanatics telling me they exist, like it goes in every religion out there for god.

I learned how to cheat, but even that could hardly cover just how little I understood how the game functions. I'm in college now, and I still think about those first times I played Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn. Instead of focusing on the story, which I liked, or the awesome stuff I would find, or cheat for, I thought I should focus on what made me play the game again and again:

Minsc.

My introduction to Minsc was in Irenicus' dungeon. As we explored said dungeon, I enjoyed his quirky, funny style of thought and speech. Throughout the game, I grew to love his style. I absolutely enjoyed having him in my party, because he was quite a character. I reached the end of Shadows of Amn, eventually. Since Throne of Baal was not even a thing at that point, I started a new game. This time, I wanted to play as  an evil character. My intention was to horde and dish out vengence on whoever I jolly well pleased to. What I failed to realize at the start was that that would involve losing Minsc.

Instead of getting to listen to his hilarious speaches about goodness, buttkicking, and hamsters, I was instead subjected to stern, angry lectures about my actions. Eventually, Minsc left my party. I found others who could fill the role of meat shield, but no one could fill the role of ""Minsc."" No one had the same level of energy and enthusiasm for ANYTHING. A couple of the evil choices I would have to make as an evil character  also rubbed me wrong. Remember, I was a child at the time. So I abandoned that character.

I played as a good character mostly so I could keep Minsc. Having been the subject of his scorn, I started to seek his praise. I played as different classes again and again, and I continued to zealously court Minsc's favor. Looking back, I can see how much of an impact Minsc had on my development, and how I treat morality in video games. At some point, I internalized a number of Minsc's battlecries and sayings, and started playing as the good guy no matter the game. I played as the good guy because in the back of my mind was ""this will allow me to keep Minsc.""

I've since developed other reasons for nearly always doing good, but Minsc is still there, somewhere, in the back of my mind. The sting of his disapproval, and the happiness at seeing this strong character devote himself to goodness and justice. Did I idolize that about him? Absolutely. Do I still recall him fondly? Fondly enough to by a digital copy of the game so I can be with my idol and mentor again.

Baldur's Gate 2 didn't have much of an impact on me as an impressionable child. Minsc did.

IF YOU BUY THIS GAME DO NOT KEEP YOSHIMO(it's a spoiler if I tell you why). Yes, he's a really awesome pure thief. Still not worth it.

Overall: I really like this game. I have fond memories watching Baldur's Gate II over my dad's shoulder. So, there is some nostalgia involved for me. In short, I'm biased. Baldur's Gate II is tied to the original(as in you can import your character), which I recommend over-and-above the sequel. BGII is an old-style D&D videogame. Reading is required, and pausing the game to issue commands is a core part of combat, especially if you are fielding spellcasters of some sort. I have started the game multiple times, and recommend looking at all the classes' abilities before you exit character creation. You do have to save a lot in this game. The auto-save system isn't that good.

Plot: Fairly decent. The political intruigue of Baldur's Gate I was more enganging to me. In this game you chase an egocentric, manipulative, creepy, evil wizard who made your life miserable and abused your sister to hell.

Bugs: At worst, a quest may not trigger properly, and you have to load to five minutes ago. This game runs fairly smoothly, bug-wise.

Difficulty: It's unforgiving at times, and you may have to load again and again or save constantly fighting a monster with an immunity to all but one of your party members' spells or a particularly difficult enemy group. The difficulty is adjustible from 'being handed to you' to 'the game mercilesslessly laughs as you are slaugthered by a +1 skeleton'(or something to that effect). I play on the 'core rules' setting, which is, more or less, 'veteran', but easier than 'hard' or 'legacy of bhaal'(insane).

Graphics: The graphics are horrible. Don't buy this game if you need amazing visuals. The scenery, however, is rather pretty, especially outdoor forests and water. This is not a graphicially demanding game. You will not lag on this game unless you magic missile from every party member who you built as a mage/sorceror. There may be slight 'lag' when fighting one of the dragons. They are seperate fights, and are at the end of dungeons. I haven't had the game crash, ever.

UI: It's a mini-menu popup system there are numerous menus, from 'map' to 'journal' to 'inventory'. There are others. The UI was redesigned. Fans of the old system(which I agree looked better) did not like that. I like the clean, new interface. If you want the classic interface, sorry, it was scrapped. If you don't care, then this is a non-issue.

Party System: If you are playing normally and not 'hosting' an 'online' game and playing with a party you build yourself(which you can do, that's completely vaild, the interjections by BioWare NPCs serves to freshen the otherwise semi-stale dialogue), there is a single ""Playerchar"", and five extra NPCs. Banter and other random quest interjections makes the game a lot better. While it is realalistic, I don't like it that party members, even if you support them, will leave if your party reputation goes to the extremes. 1 and 0 are super-evil, 19 and 20 are super-good. Evil characters leave if you go above 18. Good characters leave if you go below 2. Neutral characters don't leave. The most interesting characters are good or evil, in my opinion. Also, certain party members, if left together for long enough, will try to kill each-other. The game does not have a modular system like mass effect, it's more of a 'team selection' mechanic. If you want to change your party, you have to re-find the character in question. Also, since this is a D&D game, levelling is important and shapes your character. Characters outside your party auto-level. The auto-levelling system in the game is insane, and makes stupid choices. It's best to find your five, and stick with them. I would recommend looking online at the party members and making it a priority to run around the world and find them as soon as possible.

Note on 'romance' system. Thre three original 'romance' options for a male character will get into verbal cat-fights over him. If this annoys you, you either have to deal with it, or only have one of them in the party at a time. Also, these three are the best NPC healers in the game. If you want multiple healers, and play as a dude, do it yourself, or put up with the snit-fest. Female player characters do not have this issue. However, they're stuck with a traumatized gooody-two-shoes fighter-cleric(likable if you can get past the arrogance).

For a strategy game, it is horribly unbalanced, as just the roll of one virtual dice (usually for one of the many overpowered magic spells/abilities) may completely eradicate your chances of winning a battle (because one or more of your party members die instantly), while on another attempt you might just get lucky and stomp every enemy in sight (because the spell is being resisted). In some situations, you simply have no chances of prevailing on your first attempt and you have to reload - knowing how to position your characters in advance, where not to go, or something like that. Inventory management is tedious (just so much stuff!), controlling your characters is prone to errors (casting spells is cancelled when the game is paused should you accidentally issue a move command, pathing errors), and some of the D&D rules employed in the game are just plain dumb.
So why play Shadows of Amn?

Because the game tells an amazing story, it has great characters and interesting locations, all of which alone warrant buying this gem from an age before fancy 3D graphics and well-thought out balancing. I have finished SoA at least 3 times in my life, and I’m quite confident I will do so a few times more before I die. And so should you.

That about sums up my thoughts on BG series, unless one is an original D&D fan and knows most of the rules and spells already.

BG isn't like the latest Blizzard games. It doesn't explain you much about anything, let alone a proper tutorial. There are dozens of status effects and you need to know how to counter them using the right spell which you might have or not if you didn't know about it. You have to pause a lot and make strategic moves, and I'm sure that this isn't rly familiar to younger generations unless they have been playing Dragon Age. This is definitely not easy to learn, thus you need to 'learn hard to enjoy hard.'

You might not like the term though. Why bother learning how to play this game when there are hundreds of other games that are much more newbie-friendly? This probably is the reason why the review score goes down every big sale; people buy it, doesn't get it, quit and thumbs down.

So back to the point. If you ask me why bother learning, this is my answer:  BG will let you conquer the game itself.
In Diablo, you will kill enemies using different weapons, and skills. It's not a matter of strategy, but a combination.
In BG, at first, you may step on traps. You may spend a long time to gear up different party members. You may be frustrated to control all characters at once. You may become paranoid at enemy mages, and be vulnerable against status effects.
After some time, traps wouldn't bother you anymore, and you may like it as a source of exp. You will learn how to gear up your party members properly. You will be using pause at a right moment and command all your characters at once. You will learn how to interfere enemy mages, and remove status effects. 
After considerable amount of time, enemies will be stepping on your traps. You will minmax every characters in different save files and do funny things. You won't need to pause anymore. Enemies will be paranoid at your mage and status effects, while you will simply prevent bad status effects from your party.

As time goes by, the things that you've hated for the most will start to work on your favor, and you will be able to try different strategies. This feeling of accomplishment and variety is probably why people still like and play BG.

If you are ready for it, BG can be a historical masterpiece for you. If you are not, you might see it as an obsolete piece of drek. It's up to you, really. And as a fan of this game, I hope you give chance at it and stick with it a little more before you quit.

If you're not sure if you'd like this game or not, I'd recommend starting with the second game, as it's much more initially attention grabbing and introduces you to the more fun aspects of the gameplay while having a better story, and you won't miss out too much story wise since the two stories aren't directly connected.

Beamdog has proven to be nothing but money-milking company. Claiming to be the most hardcore BG fans blah blah they actually showed a complete lack of knowledge of the game concept. People modded this game for an eternity before them and did a MUCH greater job in actually enhancing original title. None of these improvements were implemented in EE-versions of both BG/BG2. Instead they introduced a horrible UI design (that applies mostly to BG1 but still - compare their UI to BG tutu, for instance), disgusting new art/cinematic/portraits made in a complete different style, that distracts and ruin the whole atmosphere. Tons of bugs and glitches were introduced with the initial releases only to trigger numerous patches, that... brought new bugs. And what are these bugs? Camera zoom level being reset after leaving/entering the zone, commands not being issued after the first click etc. We are ""enchancing"" a 98' game, remember? 

But that aside, what i really hoped for was the actual enhancing of battle system as there were tons of great mods like scs that screamed to be implemented in EE version along with the option to tweak the difficulty on the fly, w/o the need of 3rd party programs, different difficulty settings etc etc. Instead we got none of this. Ye, they left a modding option (right, you needed to ""mod the enhanced verion"" to actually play the game), only to release so called EE 2.0 later on that brought an end to 20 years of hard work of modding. 99% of mods are incompatible with it. Wohoo! And yes, they intoduced a new difficulty to compansate. Kappa. All it does is 10 times increased mobs hp-pools so your first fight (in tutorial) takes a year and half with 1032377 game loads.

Sounds like a boring thing but to get the gold you need to find quests. This makes the gameplay and experience non-linear but keeps the story linear (linear stories are better). The game play is tactical and fun with lots of pause and unpause moments. Weapons are special here so you rarely change them. This makes your equipment mean more since they tell a story. I've got this from a dead witch… or whatever. Also, read the story on weapons with names. They are sometimes really cool.

My personal favorite feature is the ability to import a character from BG1 to use right from BG2. This is not required, but it adds more sentiment to your character in my opinion, as well as adds some flow to the game and story.

The graphics and gameplay are roughly the same, but the gameplay is expanded on a bit more simply due to the fact that all characters are higher level and; therefore, have better rewards for completing tasks.

Truely one of the greatest RPG's of all time, this (and the original) are must plays.  I recommend starting in BG1 - the plot there is much simpler and more grounded in the mundane, but it has some strong emotional beats and sets much of the emotional content of BG2.

This is the game that introduced me to D&D as then, I have to read up a lot to understand the mechanics of the game. Now it is much simpler in the enhanced edition as there is stats comparison that shows green and red stats to indicate improvement in stats or reduction in stats. Take note that reduction in armour class number is improvement and this shows the convenience of having the stats comparison. It was not available when I played the game then. After so many years, I still enjoyed the storyline and numerous spells and magical items available in the game. Fighting dragon is still very enjoyable, the euphoria of having killed a dragon is just so hard to describe.

Thanks to a little tweeking by the guys at beamdog, this game still holds up pretty well, dispite it's 2D world limitations. Where as games like skyrim imerse you with a 3D world you can explore. Here you are pulled in by not only the rich story telling centred on the main character, but the quests and dialog of your supporting party members. I remember the first time 2 party members started talking to each other, and I thought, 'hey, where's my bit?' but then realised that these characters had their own thought/agenders, that didn't make my character the centre of the universe.

Game play is pretty solid with a respectable learning curve. New game modes allow you to change the difficulty to however easy or difficult you want. Magic can take some getting use to, so it's important to read what spells do and track combat text through the feedback window. However with the game being out so long you can find any number of useful guides online to help explain spells and debuffs etc.

The soundtrack include one of my favorite games themes to date, which is good if like me you want to spend your first hour roling the perfect human paladin.

It can be frustrating, but for most of the time that's a sign of that you need to think of the problem more strategically.

And for some reason i could not figure it out. I was stuck on it for hours. Screaming and crying in frustration. that even with the wealth of knowledge about the game at my fingertips, I could not identify this damn shield. So I storm off and take a break. i come back to it and right click it. Then clicked identify. I felt so dumb. but. i finished that tutorial.

It covers around 200hrs or so of playtime depending on what all you decide to do in it, with tremendous replay value in the form is multiple choice dialogue, character creation, party selection, and branching storylines.

Storyline
Being of the strongest aspects of the game, it is rich in nature and varied to some degree depending on your choices in the game, which can have a real permanant impact on how it unfolds and certain events that can occur later. The main story covers about 50hrs or so of the game, so it is a small piece of the much larger game with dozens of sidequests and optional areas to explore.

Characters
There are about a dozen or so base characters in the game, each with their own unique look and personality. Everyone of them interact with other party members and some may even outright refuse to join you if they see a particular person already with you. Lots of instances in the game have reactive choices as well, meaning they will either comment on your actions or depending on how extreme may even outright leave you. Romances are possible in the game with three standard female options to choose from and one male.

Gameplay
The gameplay is largely based on the DnD 2nd edition ruleset, though you really don't need to be particular familiar with this in order to be able to play it. You are able to either create your own entire party from scratch, which can be a lengthy process if you aren't familiar with the game or choose from existing templates. Battles can be highly tactical in nature with many having numerous ways fo being handled depending on your composition, spells and gear. Some encounters will also be different depending on what level you get to them at, being far more difficult if you aren't properly prepared. 

Sound
The voice acting in the game is top notch and there are thousands of lines of dialogue to go through. Not all of it is fully voiced, but all of the important scenes in the game are. Music sets a good pace as well, with some of them being able to indicate a tell tale pace as to what type of encounter you are facing, with major ones playing certain tracks which you will come to know and associate.

Overall
If you are any kind of a fan of RPG games, this is a must play. Deep character development, storyline, relantionship building, roleplaying elements and sheer replayability will have you spending many hours in this classic. And with the ability to download mods for it to add more quests, characters, romances, items and new areas; the possibilities are staggering.",1476641713,1476641958,True,13,0,0.664976179599761963,1,True,False,False

Now lets also note a few things. This is a very old game that has been reworked in a minimal fashion to make it compatible with Steam. As of this current patch gen, the game features an improved interface, new difficulties added, and the correction of many bugs. This doesn't change the fact the game is old! If you are not into vintage games, this title may not be for you, as playing this game is like getting on a time machine back to the early 2000s, which was the golden era of RPGs.

In fact, you'll scream in rage every time you find yourself being slaughtered because one of your companions failed to cast the spells he/she needed, or got stuck on a corner for no logical reason other than crappy AI. Assuming you can see passed its imperfections, you will find yourself in love with this vast, complex, rich, and unforgiving fantasy world, and the people you'll meet in it.

This review features two specific parts: Shadows of Amn and the expansion, Throne of Bhaal. Additionally I'll give my overall experience having played both of these.

[u][b]Shadows of Amn[/b][/u]
You start off captured as a prisoner* in a dungeon underground by an unknown individual whom you have never seen before and he is basically torturing you in your cell for some unknown reason which will ultimately become apparent as you progress through this game. Only thing that will be apparent at the start is that he seems to be trying to bring out some unknown power you have. All of a sudden the dungeon itself is attacked by an unknown group, forcing your capturer/the torturer to teleport out of the dungeon allowing another prisoner who somehow escaped from her cell (gee I wonder how she did that?) and she reveals to you her name: Imoen. After a discussion about what the torturer did to you and her, she springs you free from your cell, and from there, your immediate objective at that point, is to not only escape the dungeon, but to find anyone that is currently in the dungeon to join your party to make the escape a little easier, but you can attempt to escape on your own if you wish, having others with you just makes it easier. Once you finally escaped from the dungeon (you'll end up in Waukeens Promenade which is essentially a place within the City of Amn or rather ""Athkatla""), your torturer, sounding particularly happy (and evil) commends you for escaping the dungeon, the exit of which collapses behind you after escaping. Imoen who had also been tortured by that guy demands to be released and launches a magic attack against him, he retaliates with a magic attack of his own, causing half-a-dozen hooded figures to teleport in to stop it and attempt to arrest him, and after the torturer resists both the hooded figure attacks and Imoen's own attacks, they ultimately arrest both the torturer and Imoen on grounds of using magic in a place (which is later revealed to be Amn) which is prohibited. From that point you'll have two primary objectives, find and rescue Imoen who was captured and settle the score with that torturer. 

Additionally in this game, among the outstanding number of quests you can undertake, you'll have class-specific quests to take on too, so for example, if your protagonist is primarily a fighter, you'll be tasked by a kind-hearted noble, with clearing monsters infesting a huge Keep and killing their leader and if you succeed you'll get a chance to become head of the Keep which you can use as your own home to manage as you see fit.
Also for example, if your protagonist is primarily a Mage, you'll be tasked by a ranger to help him defeat his ancestor Lavok in what is known as a ""Planar Sphere"" located in Amn. That sphere will be yours if you defeat Lavok inside of it.
Those types of quests depend upon what your protagonist's class is. Something worth keeping in mind.

[u][b]Throne of Bhaal[/b][/u]
After you have successfully completed your final objective in Shadows of Amn, it is revealed that a certain prophecy describes children (including yourself by the way) of a tainted godly blood, that will cause a wave of massive destruction destroying all in existance including each other. in order to fulfil a certain purpose. You are urged by an Elven Queen to visit a sacred grove to discover some answers as to why this prophecy is even relevant to you and what part you will likely play in it. After you have visited the grove and listened to the prophecy spoken (which also states that there is a person you may encounter at some point on your journey, who has ""the face of an ally"", but has ""the mask of a foe""), you are ambushed by what is revealed to be a ""Bhaalspawn"" (that's right a Child of the dead God of Murder, Bhaal) and her troupe, whose main objective is to kill you as a Bhaalspawn yourself. Once you have disposed of her and her troupe you get teleported into what is called a ""Pocket Plane"" which is essentially your sanctuary for you to rest and take up challenges and even upgrade certain weapons you have into powerful items via the imp Cespanar. At that point, you are visited by a familiar individual whom you had killed in the past, after vowing to never betray you if you let him join you, he gives you intel about the Pocket Plane you are in and states that it doesn't take you to where you want to go, it takes you to where you need to be: Saradush. Once you teleport to Saradush, which is under heavy enemy attack from outside its walls you meet up with a nice woman who is trying to save the people of Saradush, which ultimately becomes your objective as well, however it doesn't just end there as there are many quests to undertake after that, which may involve you ultimately battling other Bhaalspawn that will also seek your death among others etc. 

[u][b]My personal experiences in playing both Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal[/b][/u]
Both of these games provide a super thrilling challenge the likes of which no other rpg strategy game is likely to provide, because among other familiar enemies, you'll even encounter monsters/creatures you have never fought before. In my particular case, I always enjoy the thrill of battle, so doesn't matter how hard an enemy may be, I'll always rise up to the challenge. Some will be easy, others will be hard to kill depending on how you have built your protagonist, let alone your own party members.

Nothing as yet, about either of these games has frustrated me personally, but that isn't to say these two games do not have faults of some sort. If nothing else though, I would've appreciated Beamdog implementing more fleshing out of the SoD story ending, to better transition into Shadows of Amn or even towards Throne Bhaal if it needed to be so late, namely regarding a quest of some sort about getting the ""Soultaker Dagger"" that the ""Hooded Man"" had on him and bringing it back to baldur's gate to prove the protagonist's innocence, even if it meant still being declared ""exiled"" due to being a ""spawn of bhaal"".

I am not one to normally say this, but if you can, download an older verion of the game for free from the pirate bay or some other website because this current version is rather insulting in the fact that Beamdog did not allow the long time players a choice in this odd massacre of a classic game from years ago.

However, if you do decide to pay for this, you can expierience the game how it has been played for the better part of the past 15 years by right clicking it in your steam inventory, going to properties, Betas, and then selecting the bgiiee 1.3 Beta.

Wrong.
Riddled with bugs. You can't start a new multiplayer game without being forced to create a complete party (in a game known for having great NPC party members), constant crashes, random disconections, and strange lag whenever you pick up items without being the host. And many other minor problems.

Although I have not gotten all the new npcs, I can tell that the ones I've gotten to (a thief and a wild mage) are terribly written, and have no respect for the setting of forgotten realms. The writers clearly either did not read into the setting, or just did not care. Not to mention that they clash horribly with the old party members, and barely interact with them. It seems silly that jaheira would comment on a drow joining the party but not a VAMPIRE of all things.

tl/dr:
Bugs+terrible graphics make this a bad version of the game, and the additional npcs are badly written.

While the UI update was definitely jarring to me and I haven't played as much Baldur's Gate as I used to (usually because the in-game music always sucked imo and I liked replacing it with TSFH, but it crashes the game every time it's minimized now), the fact there's a difficulty for babies like me that suck at games of this nature is certainly welcoming. 

It's still Baldur's Gate, with the story I fell in love with a long time ago. I can work around the interface and learn it again. 

The contrast between the original story and the Beamdog additions is pretty obvious, but not on the same level as Metroid Prime or any of Hideo Kojima's writings. 

The fact that such a brilliant game is surrounded by such entitled little sh*ts who need everything to remain the same makes me sad to my core, honestly.

I was glad to be disappointed.  Sure there were a few glitches and crashes, but the game worked fine otherwise.  The new graphics introduced in update 2.0 are God-awful, but most can be switched off in the graphics menu.  Most things look the same with the glaring exception of the new character menu, but that's still easy enough to navigate.  Admittedly, I never tried any of the new content, save the Black Pits (which was surprisingly good).  I just couldn't separate myself from my grand party of Keldorn, Aerie, Jaheira, Minsc and Imoen/Yoshimo long enough to try Neera or Rasaad or Hexxat or Dorn.  I don't really feel inclined to try them either, which I think is a flaw of the Enhanced Edition.  The achievements don't even give incentive to try the new characters, so I never worried about it aside from a brief stint with Hexxat.  She didn't seem very important or fun to me, so I dumped her for another after an hour or so of playtime.

However when your chooosing things what is up with the red bar.... the original interface was very good why change it? And then in game there is this black outline around the characters now....uuuuh wth?

I still recommend the game becausse well its baldurs gate but they need to not change what is already good. A few tweaks (such as they aforementioned adding a bonus for casting a spell from your chosing school) makes sense. It adds to the game.

I heard people screaming about Beam Dog molesting my 2nd favorite game of all time and against my better judgement, I gave Beamdog the benefit of the doubt.  I installed it cleanly from Steam and loaded it up, started creating a new character and felt like I'd just taken a sip of beer spiked with Rohypnol.  I continued though determined to see all the changes they've made.  ""Surely they can't have completely destroyed this masterpiece."" I foolishly told myself as I finished creating my character.

""Oh god, those sprites look terrible"" These were my first words upon seeing the opening scene with Jon Irenicus. Every sprite now has gaudy thick black outlines, completely ruining the way the original developers seamlessly melded their spritework with the prerendered backdrop of the game world.  I hurredly retreated to the options menu to tweak everything as best I could back to the original.  The menus look so tiny now on my 23 inch monitor.  The UI overall doesn't scale well how it did before.

The map is awful, the journal is awful, the character sheet is awful, the inventory is awful, the spellbook is awful.  Even the gods damned Save/Load screen is awful!  How could Beamdog mess up this badly?  It's like they purposely made everything worse, piece by piece. 

I can tell a lot of things they changed for ""streamlining"" but this is a classic crpg.  We know how to play D&D computer games, we learned how when the game first came out with no problem.  Why do you feel the need to dumb this down?

I didn't continue playing this way.  How could I?  I'm not a fan of people staying in marriages where the husband continually beats and rapes his wife, and that is what Beamdog is doing to every fan of the Baldur's Gate series.  Something truly wicked is happening within this company.  I saw the signs when that accursed liberal politics expansion was released for Baldur's Gate I.  

I opened up my archived BG2 install directory and copied the entire contents over this new patch, I've erased the abomination from my own PC, but I won't stop there.

Beamdog, this is directly for you.  I am going on a full assault against you.  You are Jon Irenicus holding my sister prisoner and experimenting on her in disgusting and abhorrent manners.  I'm going to assemble a party and come after you. You will roll back these changes, you will publicly apologize for being child molestors of all Baldur's Gate fans.  And you will relinquish your rights of this game to a different group who will treat it and its fans with the respect it deserves.

The recent update to the UI has both positive and negative points. It unfortunately contains many (annoying) oversights, such as when you go from the world map to the area map, it zooms out again from the regular overview as if you just clicked on the area map from the regular overview.

Picking items up also retains their respective position to your mouse cursor, but afterward your mouse cursor is leading for when you want to deposit them: very annoying!

I am going to review in 2 parts, firstly up until the v2 update and then a small part dealing with that update.

Firstly the pre v2 Enhanced Edition was all that I remembered and more from completing the original game several times when it was first released. The new graphics etc refreshing the original really well. If you haven't played the originals, this (and BG 1 EE) is the place to start, if you did and just want to revisit without having to add several mods to make the originals playable again I would recommend to buy these Enhanced Editions. You can generally pick them up in sales for between £4 and £6 making them not too expensive either.
The story is, as it always was very strong, but most of all it is the companions who travel with you who steal the show. Get the right combination of characters who bounce off/argue with each other adds a real depth only really found in Dragon Age, and maybe Mass Effect.

Beamdog has done what I could not have forseen, with their ridiculous Siege of Dragonspear expansion they have managed to turn the original Baldur's Gate Games into a blurry mess of Arcanum-style character sprites and failed UI-""upgrades"". You now have to scroll in your spellbooks, just so that the new kids don't actually have to learn the symbols (which is psychologically idiotic, cuz humans are good at symbolism), the edge of the map now hangs halfway into your screen killing immersion in the process, etc..

This does not feel like Baldur's Gate anymore. I tried to play it. I tried to see the good in it, like the more organized journal, but it didn't come to me.

Do not buy this anymore until they fix this. I'm going back to my Big World versions. Goodbye Neera.

-------

I will never understand the haters of this excellent remake. I also bought BG1+2 as original 6/4-CD versions when they came out. First in german, than a few years later as english DVDs, then at GoG again when they came on sale and I still bought the EE's of both games.

And you know what? They've done everything right!

1) The small tweaks go over extremly well, like 80 arrows per quiver slot.
2) The engine works flawlessly and the little UI enhancements alone were worth the money to me.
3) The new NPCs are mostly great. I especially adore Neera, who is so very different from the rest, maybe with the exception of Tiax. I also like Dorn, because both BGs generally lacked evil party NPCs that weren't overacting or plain insane.
4) Both EE's are easy to mod. Most Gibberling's & Co mods work, but you need far less of them. The 12-hour-installation of the Big World Project was a pain in the rear, and it usually took me several tries.

To sum it up, Beamdog delivered a pure Baldur's Gate experience with excellent new content in a very polished package.",1419558554,1460023458,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

tiax is not an option, but somehow this game isn´t totally horrible. it´s actually pretty good. no idea how that works. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
still prefer the non-enhanced version.

on the political side it turns out that it´s better to be killed by a wolfwere than to be brainwashed, but that´s just my non-fav thief.

jaheira got the full progressive package in the prequel dlc.
if there´s a baldurs gate 3 in the making i hope all the non-beamdog chars face the end that khalid got.

Story: 5/5 
You are the mortal progeny of Bhaal, the deceased god of Murder. I think you can assume awesomeness will follow.

Characters: 5/5
Memorable characters abound here. From Minsc (and Boo) the loveable fool of a Ranger desperate to do good in the world, to Viconia the damaged Drow desperately trying to survive in the overworld. 
CHARACTERS CAN DIE PERMANANTLY. SAVE OFTEN.

Romance: 4/5
If you're a playing a female, there's not much variety. That being said, male characters can romance Viconia, Jaheira, and Aerie (and.....Neera). All of the Romances have depth and feel meaningful. It isn't give a gift, get laid, romance over.

Combat: 5/5
Strategic use of spells, abilities, and careful planning will be your only saving grace. This is a difficult game. I suppose it's a mix of real time strategy and action rpgs. 
REMEMBER, THIS GAME IS F**KING HARD. DON'T B**CH ABOUT IT ON THE FORUMS!!!

Gameplay: 5/5
Absolutely solid. No nonsense. The EE ironed out any bugs (so far as I've encountered) with dialogue. You should'nt encounter any bugs or glitches, definatly not any game-breaking ones. 

Music: 5/5
Perfect in every way. Works for every situation, nothing feels out of place or silly. 
And that opening is just sweet! BUHBUH BUNBUN BAHBAH

This has to go down as as bad an ""update"" as Windows 8 was, unless there is a way to back out the v2.0 or Beamdog release a v2.1 which reverts certain ""updates"" or allows the users the choice of the ""updated"" or the better view I will no longer play EE, I will get out my old discs and play through them.

In summary, I would no longer recommend BG2EE it's like some hideous modders w*nkfest, I would however highly recommend BG2 - it's a great game, an epic game, a game that has yet to be truly surpassed with a very effective UI already in situ - the only thing I'd really miss from BG2 EE is the looting bar.

--Character development. During my run, I felt a strong connection to all the characters, especially your romance options.

The characters are remarkable and numerous, each with a side quest, and the dialog is very well written. At times you will get random party banter, and some of these are hilarious. Certain quests have unique responses, that allow you to be a righeous hero, or a snarky a-hole. There is no set party, and you can recruit any characters you desire to aid you in your quest. Be warned that there is a reputation system and evil characters won't tolerate you being a goody two-shoes, and good characters won't stand by while you punch babies.

The pathing is still bad, as well as the combat A.I., and if your casters are set to auto-attack they will sometimes interrupt their own spells. The A.I. can be turned on and off with simply pressing the 'A' key, though.

This game does require some strategy for higher level fights, and you can't just wade in with your two-hander and expect results, unless that result is a dead party member. The learning curve isn't too sharp, with the starting dungeon teaching you the basics of the game.

There is no real linear path to follow, and many side quests and areas to explore. You can blitz through the main  quest line, or do side areas to gear up and explore the area of Baldur's Gate.",1458804893,1458804893,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A good role playing game with many characters and storylines. You are drawn into the stories and want to find out all about the many people you meet, especially your potential group members.

It's a bit tiresome that you can't save and sometimes it takes up too much time to find out, how to get any further.",1445697434,1448059031,True,1,0,0.497925281524658203,0,True,False,False

Unfortunatly I lost the disks during a recent move and was crushed to learn I could play my fav game. I've never really used steam and when I was surfing the store I saw this on sale for $10. Needless to say I was delighted to no end. I bought there and was surprised by all the added content to the original game. 

I have probably several hundred hours on the old version and this new Extended Edition has made some changes that I find interesting and helpful.

BGEE has some small changes such as loot finder, improved combat rolls, character creation, inventory perks, ect. But the change that got my attention was the item stacking increase.

I have played about every role there is to play in this game, but my most favorite is the ranger/Archer. The old problem was never having enough arrows. The old game had arrows in stacks of 40, now they stack to 80. Potions as well have increased up to 20, the old was 5. Small but very important changes like this make the game more enjoyable without having to fret over the constant nuscience of running out of supplies all the time.

Also there is a inreased amount of data availible about Armor Class, Damage Throws, Thaco, ect. that wasn't in the original. You can now see how much damage your charcters can take and deal (and how fast) with relative ease. Another useful feature, is the fact you can now zoom in and out to adjust the point of veiw of the game. A wider range of resalutions give the most access to play on any screen (I'm playing on a laptop). The perk about the EE is that it plays seemlessly with any version of windows. I'm currebtly running on Windows 8 and works without a hitch thus far.

If you've played this before and need more information on the changes made you visit the community page (also many tips on what class to start with and the changes made to the roles of each one). All in all a very good remastering of a classic and deffinatly recommend this game to new and old players alike.

Now that the opening pledge of perpetual love has been declared, we can get down to the gritty of the review. The Baldurs gate series is no longer groundbreaking. Not in graphics, not in sheer scope of content - even though its storyline still is very strong compared to other RPGs out there. It's a solid game, even today some 13 or 16 years after its initial release.

The plot, the twists and the mechanics of the game functions very well and even if the graphics are rough they still work.

Perhaps the best rpg i've ever played, I didnt think id be able to get into it with it being so dated and all but i got sucked in again like it was my first time in amn.

pros:

-the combat is awesome, the d&d rules and dice roles feel great and make the game challenging with just the right amount of luck and strategy

-no shortages of interesting characters, really engrossing story, you'll be dissapointed whwn it ends simply because there is no more

-you always get good loot, all the weapons and armor feel unique, like they had a story before you were in the world and somehow you came across them and your going to add to their legend

-this is a personal reason, I liked the way it felt like you and your companions are traveling large distances to go on your quests, the combination of distance and time really make you feel like you and your party are really going through hell together and bonding along the way, the only game that has come close to recreating that feeling for me was dragon age origins at the campsites and such, I cant tell you how happily exhausted I was when I escaped the underdark for the first time

cons:

-The pathing, dear god the pathing is so bad, the battles can be quite big and confusing so its a bit frustrating when your tank gets stuck at a crate at the back of the fight or decides to take the long way around simply because your mage blocked the doorway for 1/2 a second,

1.) The Writing - Quite simply, above and beyond anything you find in most modern games.  A compelling story (IF YOU LIKE HIGH FANTASY), memorable characters, beautiful set-pieces, and the best flavor text in any game...well, maybe ever.  If you love fantasy epics, this one is a classic!

2.) The D&D - Let's face it: this is a Dungeons and Dragons game.  For people playing it for that reason, it delivers!  A perfectly (well...mostly) executed take on 2nd/3rd editions, with the best parts of both (THAC0 forever!) mixed together in a way that translates well.  To get the true D&D experience, show the dice rolls in terminal and and pause after every round.

3.) The Graphic Design - Yes, by today's standards, this looks like an indy game.  But what a game!  Beautiful static backgrounds...I mean, hang them on your wall gorgeous.  Excellent effects that made the spells and effects really pop off the screen.  Detailed, well animated sprites that gave the characters a sense of life that other, similar games still struggle to achieve.  The monsters were so varied and detailed, it's a wonder the game didn't win more awards than it did.

There are some downsides.  It's a big game, takes hundreds of hours to do everything.  The gameplay can be frustratingly hard for the uninitiated (PROTIP: drink all the potions!!!!), and the lack of quest markers and waypoints and glowing exclamation points means the casual gamer will be lost without a walk-through guide.

But if you're like me - and if you are reading this, you probably are - and you want an old-school, authentic experience, BG2 is IT!  It's a masterpiece that I will continue to play into my waning years.  GOAT",1443832235,1443832235,True,3,1,0.516335248947143555,0,True,False,False

It took about 2 minutes for about 50 monsters or so, quite an impressive amount of patience for me. Now that I have a job I can buy my own games and stumbled onto BG2EE after forgetting that I still had the sequel to play.

I know that I'm probably part of a minority of gamers that can stomach games like this anymore but wow, the Baldur's Gate series just captures my imagination.
The dice rolling, stat optimization, old skool damage indication (2d10 for the win). The complexity and brain numbing amount of learning just fulfills that itch which has evaded modern gaming.

Epic story, ageless visual style, brilliant voice acting and sounds overall, interesting tactical combat, solid controls though mayhaps a bit outdated for the modern gamer (very natural for me as I played this at an age when I didn't even speak English), challenging, the writing on the party members is just gold and the list goes on.

Through the game it's great how you feel as the power of your party increases steadily and towards the end of the game you have seriously strong bunch of badasses wearing rare powerful gear, with stories of their own. And as you've finished the game you can't but help feel touched by what an awesome literally epic adventure of struggle and finding what and who you are and what is your destiny in the world you've traversed through.

To keep it short I'm gonna stop rambling here. I'm suggesting this game to anyone whose loved the old CRPGs and pretty much to any fantasy RPG lover.

The story is quite good, and there are so many different party/class configurations that will keep you coming back for more. There are a huge number of quests, a great deal of them with hours worth of content and multiple outcomes. Every class has their own unique quest chain, and there are numerous others for each side of the alignment spectrum. The game is hugely improved over Baldur's Gate 1, and there are even a few small improvements here over BG: EE.

I like the additions that Beamdog made, but it's worth noting that this game is still very, very buggy - especially in online multiplayer. Unfortunately, it seems like they've created more problems than they've fixed. It can be tolerated or worked around, but people who have the original and are thinking of upgrading to this should perhaps weigh their options. If you're looking to play multiplayer, expect to see good old Biff the Understudy fairly often.

My personal favorite additions are the hugely reduced load times, auto-loot, and the conveniently organized/bulleted journal. I haven't played around a lot with the new NPCs, but I like them a lot so far. Their romance options, however, seem incredibly superficial at present. There is now a same-sex option for both males and females respectively, so that's nice, though both of these NPCs are unfortunately evil.

This version is compatible with a lot (although not all) of the countless mods created for this game over the last fifteen years, allowing you to configure your gameplay experience if the hundreds of hours of vanilla content aren't enough for you.

(Just as a fore warning cos there's always ""that"" guy who says ""eww weird almost top down camera angles and graphics are meh"" the game is almost 20 years old now, suck it up and focus on the story its what it's known for)

I decided I was going to be a Paladin, I was going to be good! Travelling the lands, righting wrongs....

I Lost my Paladin status within the first hour of playing...god dammit! Instead of restarting I decided to roll with it, (the game was letting me so might as well right?) I mean now I was just a crappy warrior with low weapon skills and no fancy healing abilities and buffs to make me useful in any way but surely something will turn up...it got progressively worse over the next few hours of play. (Solely my fault not the game I should point out.)

The solution to losing all my abilities I decided, was to make my character almost constantly drunk for approximately 4 in-game (thankfully) months (i dunno like 3 days worth of play real time? It was strong mead...real strong.) This did little but lower my all ready pitiful weapon skills to nothing and cost me all my gold but I did hear a few interesting rumours. (basically hints on where to find quests) Then through more bad choices or drunken stupor, I ended up having to flee the city with a drow cleric (evil) and a deranged gnome (basically evil too) in tow. Don't cast magic without a license friends! I tried to redeem myself by helping out a local lord with a dragon problem, ended up killing some paladins, you know, reeeaaallly ""good"" guys.

However it gets better from here (no, seriously) I end up killing a dragon after solving some puzzles and finding some awesome dragon slayers gear (very handy obviously) and fighting some other nasty monsters, I saved a girl, reunited her with her father, the Head Paladins decided I had atoned and everything was all good, paladin status given back (sweet sweet abilities) I go back to the city do more quests help more people, earn a good reputation, earn TONS of gold, pay for my magical license (fear my mad gnomes level 8 magic missile!) Then remember I'm supposed to be saving my friend. So head off on my merry way, band of probably 85% evil party members in tow. (Kept 'em cos I assumed I could try and convert them to good being a paladin and all, I could not, however, the inter-party banter was pretty hilarious bloody jan jansen and Viconia.)

Without spoiling the storyline, s*** goes south real quick. My guy ends up going full rage mode mid way through some maze, PERMANENTLY killing (as in hit them so hard they explode into chunks kinda dead) all my party members barring the drow cleric and the friend I came to rescue, who I managed to get outside the room my main guy was in till he regained control. So at this point i'm down 3 party members heading into what ends up being the more difficult part of the game. Does this dishearten me? pfft, no! I'm loving every minute of this!

So I end up through good luck and several reloads (god dam acid breathing dragons man...yeesh!) beating ""Shadows of Amn"" I then rolled my character and what few party members that still survived into ""throne of bhaal"" and came out the other end (several days and reloads later) with hither-to unheard of attributes for a mere human paladin. I had some sweet armor, some super paladin only 2-handed, Holy Avenger, demon smiting, sword of awesomeness, became a God, (cos why the hell not right?) and then sat and read through the ""what happened next"" for my few surviving party members. Wrapping up my play through very nicely. I actually felt quite sad at this point as I had to lay my Paladin to rest. (No carrying on questing for you when you ascend to Godhood, but I guess theres more important things to do at that point...like maybe killing Gaelan Bayle, god I hate that ""Coo!"" noise he makes...)

In short, in my opinion of course, best rpg hands down, possibly that good that nothing else will ever come close in terms of storyline. 
Totally worth the money, i've played what...70+ hours...i'm defintitely gonna be replaying this and exploring all the places i skipped, finding the party members I missed etc there is sooo much I still have to do.

Sadly if you've already played the game before, which you likely have if you bought this remastered edition, then you probably remember most if not all of what made it cool. Like, you know, the plot.

Yeah they added a few new characters and a new place or two, and changed some of the dialogue around, but really in the end it's basically the exact same as it was when it was first released many many years ago. That isn't nessesarily a bad thing because the game is still great, but it really doesn't have a lot going for it to snare in people that were fans of the original.

TLDR- If you've never played the Baldurs Gate series before, then you should buy this and play it because it has a deep storyline, compelling characters, and it's fun.

BG2 stands at the top of the ranking at the classic RPG site GameBanshee - and deservedly so. Beamdog's Enhanced Edition brings the game to modern HD displays, and Steam - so that you never have to look for your CDs again.

There are many things that make BG2 great, and in their sum, they can be described as a spirit of complete and total confidence. It takes self-assurance to drop the player straight into the big hub of the game, bury him in quests, and let him figure things out. It takes conviction to fill a game to the brim with utterly broken enemies, spells, and abilities, and yet achieve a sort of a balance. It takes grand vision to hand-draw the phenomenal backgrounds of BG2, and compose a soundtrack fitting for a 3 hour epic Holywood production. It takes genius to emphasize the hero's companions to such an unprecedented degree.

And the results are magnificent. In BG2, you can one-shot majestic dragons, and be one-shot by nasty mind-flayers. You can yield insanely broken weapons such as Crom Fayr, and still enjoy finding a decent offhand in the Underdark. You can build your entire strategy around brutal backstabs, or never hide in shadows the entire game. You can power-game and try to beat the game with a solo Paladin, or pick an off-kilter class such as the Bard Skald, accept the roll the game gives you, and dive into adventure with your trusty comrade Minsc. You can exploit every mechanic to become a true demigod, or play it hardcore and delete your character if he dies.

And though the purely combat-oriented RPG in BG2 is good, it is the characters that really make the game (as is the case with other memorable titles such as Planescape Torment and Mass Effect 2). Video games seem to be a poor medium when it comes to conveying strong stories and plots; but they are perfect vehicles for character development. And fundamentally, as has been the canon in the West ever since the times of Plato and beyond, character development translates to a character's confrontation of his or her weaknesses, a journey through the darker corners of the soul, a quest for self-understanding.

It is in this aspect of its monumental edifice that BG2 succeeds, while perhaps not totally, at least to such a degree as to leave a lasting impression. Who can forget the trials of dark Viconia, her anguish at facing the cruelty of her kin imprinted upon her own soul, her doubts, her fears, and her eventual ascent to tranquility? Who can forget Minsc who finds himself a new witch in the little waif Aerie? What of Anomen, who visibly grows from a boy to a man before the player's eyes, and with the player's help? Is it not fitting that Sarevok, now humbled and desperate, should ultimately join his brother? Who can forget the player's sibling, the fiery little tortured Imoen? 
And what of the protagonist's foes? The nasty little sister Bodhi, and the mighty - yet so tragic - Jon Irenicus? Surely the voicework on Irenicus is among the best ever done in a computer game.
Finally, there is the protagonist himself - forced to face his fears, his demons, his destiny, and his nature. Will he choose to become a God and wreak havoc upon mortals and divines alike? Will he ascend his throne and try to change the essense of his heritage? Or will he willingly forsake immortality, and tread the roads of Faerun along with his trusty friends? It is up to you...

And though one can distinctly see Bioware run out of steam by the time of Throne of Bhaal, the final episode of the saga still manages to include some of the finest fights of the entire series; and loot galore beyond imagination.

Before concluding this review, let me say a few words about Beamdog's new content. I did Rasaad's missions, and though he had been a pathetic weakling for most of BG1EE and some of BG2EE, after about the midgame, Rasaad became a monster. Toward the end he was as powerful as my main (a Blade) and Minsc. His quests, unfortunately, were horribly broken and buggy throughout the entire saga. When the quests worked, they were great. But most of the time they did not work. The final fight in Rasaad's sequence, in particular, is heroically buggy, and took me an hour of replays to win - because I had to figure out how to activate the correct triggers in the right order.
But, by and large, the new NPC's are solid, and fit the game reasonably well. They are nothing to shout about, but they work.

BG1EE took me 30 hours for a fairly complete playthrough; and BG2EE another 60. If you have never played the game, you should. And if you have, like me, last played it maybe a decade ago - well, with this rerelase, maybe it's time you refreshed your memories. Good movies and good books never get old. And neither will BG2.

One thing I would like to  mention is that if you play the game then want to re play it and import your character it makes the game more difficult. I expected it to be a bit more challenging but not much since the rest of the party wouldn't be as high. My character is a half elven, chaotic good, conjurer mage at level 16 and the rest of the group (Misc, Valgayr (sp?), Jaheira, Nalia, and Viconia) all range between 10-13. I made it to Umar Hills and the shadow dungeon where I found multiple liches waiting. They were quite challenging since the rest weren't that high and my high level is a squishy clothie. Then doing ""Cult of the Eyeless"" quest line I found 3 beholders and 3 gauths in a location that typically had 1 beholder and 1 gauth. So  becareful when importing characters as it may make the game much more difficult then expected. Also when importing characters they don't come with their gear. All my girl had was her high level spells which was handy but the lack of good high level gear made the above fights that much more challenging.

The enhanced edition brings nothing new to the game that hasn't already been introduced in mods for the original. The updated graphics existed in the widescreen mod (albeit without the ability to zoom in to see an extremely blocky close up of characters). The new characters and quests are poorly written (dialogue choices are obvious and over the top - good, evil and sarcastic). Many of the quests seem to be attempts at comedy that both fall flat and break immersion in the game. 

This edition seems to have done very little to fix what bugs, exploits and even spelling errors existed in the original game, despite these problems being well known in the community and frequently already corrected in the various tweak packs. To make matters worse I've suffered several crash to desktops, which I've never experienced with the original game (I have the GOG version of the original installed on the same machine with mods).

In my opinion the only two reasons to buy this version are for the (admittedly very fun!) Black Pits 2 or if you don't feel capable of modding the game yourself (perfectly understandable, but be reassured that the modding community is largely very helpful and supportive).",1428615995,1428615995,False,2,0,0.518926560878753662,0,True,False,False

BGII is arguably one of the best roleplaying games of all time with an incredibly deep, intricately woven and dark story that plays host to one of the best game villains and a plethora of tangential side missions, stories and npcs that make the world of Faerun come to life. 

Shadows of Amn's story begins shortly after the events of the original Baldur's Gate, the opening cinematic and cutscene opens with your character being the unwilling constituent in the antagonist's demented BDSM fantasies. Little is revealed initially other than his name, [i]Irenicus[/i] and he has shown some interest in you, or more specifically your heritage. His experiments are quickly interrupted by a besieging rival guild and in the ensuing chaos you are able to escape and you begin your journey in pursuit of Irenicus and his ilk to seek out your revenge. 

Your adventure will see you travel the city of coin, [i]Athkatla[/i] and the surrounding countryside of Amn as you pursue Irenicus down the Sword Coast. Throughout your travels you'll slowly learn the motivations and misdeeds that drive Irenicus and your interactions with him reveal the true nature of your lineage. Irenicus is a solid and well written antagonist although he isn't as insidious or devious as Sarevok.

Defeating Irenicus will throw you into Throne of Bhaal which is the culmination of the Bhaalspawn saga which pits you against the other most powerful Bhaalspawn in a [i]Highlander[/i]-esque showdown to become the reincarnation of Bhaal himself. [i]'There can be only one..'[/i]

The gameplay is essentially unchanged from the first Baldur's Gate, at least at its core, it's still very tactical realtime combat with the ability to pause. Overall though the 'meta' is very different with [arcane] spellcasters being [u]very[/u] strong in BGII due to the increased level cap and access to higher level spells and the abundance of powerful items, where as BGI was much easier as a warrior. Generally though the combat feels more enjoyable with a wider array of tools at your disposal and a greater array of vastly differing enemies to fight makes many battles feel varied and memorable. The further you push through the story of SoA and into ToB the more action oriented the game and combat will become as enemies get tougher and your character grows stronger. The increase in action will help accomodate for the weaker story in ToB. Overall though the combat is still very slow comparatively with any Arpg as it is designed to take some level of strategy and meticulous planning to succeed in BGII.

Graphically the Baldur's Gate series is timelessly beautiful because of the development decision to use painted 2d backdrops. The spell effects still look amazing and vary greatly between spells. The character models on the otherhand have not aged well and look very bland, pixelated and blurry but is a minor grievance in the grand scheme of things.

Having completed this game several times now, both playing with a full player created party, solo and then picking up npcs along the way the game offers a lot of replayability whether it be from the particular challenges and different strategies required of each class during fights with certain enemies and bosses or from the story arcs and commentary provided by the npcs you choose. This is a thinking man's game so if you're looking for a game with which to turn your brain off and have some mindless fun you may wish to reconsider. Those looking for a challenge and a riveting story this is the game for you. On a personal note, this is one of my favourite games of all time and I recommend it wholeheartedly, especially to those that enjoy a good rpg.",1428040112,1428040112,True,16,0,0.595781385898590088,0,True,False,False

I'll split this review into two part. The first part will be for people who haven't spent their fair share of time in [i]Amn[/i], the second will be for those like me, for whom the continent is like a second home.

Part one:

Baldur's Gatewas in many ways the defining roleplaying experience of the 90's. Not because the roleplay mechanics themselves were the focal point of the game. But instead because of the environment, built around that most epic of stories. I've you dear reader have had the pleasure of playing one of the later Bioware RPGs, you'll surely find familiar elements in the BG storyline (Dear EA/Bioware, when can I get to explore the daily trials of a humble grunt soldier / farmer's son in one of your otherwise wellwritten universes?). The NPCs are engaging, their party banter good for many a giggle, and their individual storyarcs satisfactory. The Forgotten Realms (DnD) setting well interpreted / used. One thing to note, however is, that some of the more obscure ""classic"" DnD mechanics such as Thac0 is used, it's silly in a computer game, and once you understand ""which way"" the number is supposed to go, you will quite likely happily ignore it again.
Gameplay-wise the game centers around 6-man party combat. Unlike another classic CRPG series, Fallout, you can't talk or sneak your way through the game. So combat is definetely the name of the game here. Unfortunately combat is not one of the stronger suits of the experience - and is in general something I would say Bioware isn't particularly good at designing. Practically it plays out as realtime 'with pause', which on normal to ""harder"" is required in pretty much all boss battles. It however lacks any of the [i]in your face[/i] realtime satisfaction of hack'n'slash games, and at the same time is utterly hamstring in it's tactical possibilties while paused. So it's more of a half-baked measure of realtime/turnbased than best of both worlds, which is a shame. The spell system of the different caster classes is however rich in variance, and as has always been true, throwing fireballs into the face of your enemy has eternally been 'great fun'.
The one thing that may be a dealbreaker for many a younger / new gamer is the graphics. They're not horrible, but they are very dated. And if you are a [i]pure[/i] graphics enthusiast it is rather unlikely you'll find much enjoyment in this game.


Part two:

For the non-kids / teens / oldfarts like myself, how've already spent way too much time melting faces as the prodigal son of Bhaal: It's the BG2 you already know (and I assume) love. Not much has changed. It works on modern systems, without issues.
The extras haven't been noticeable enough to not seem entirely forgetable. Depending on your ""internal rate of nostalgia"", beware that Beamdog has redone the cinematics / cutscenes.
In my opinion the ""it's on steam!"" and multiplayer are really the most valuable features of this [i]enhanced[/i] edition.


As a small conclusion: Would I recommend this game to both the new 'uns and oldies? Wholeheartedly yes! Although I don't feel that the enhanced edition adds much, it's still one of the very best RPGs ever made, and will most likely retain that title for a very long time.

This is a BG2 EE review and while im sitting here writing it, i cant help but reference the start of an epic story which is BG1.
There are many people who will write that BG , as a series, is complete story of your character as they follow the path from start, middle and end of their own destiny.
I cannot argue with this valid point.

Yet I found that BG1 was clearly made from a company (Pre- EA Bioware) that had grand ambition , scope and excellent writing but didnt know how to implement this all into a single game.
What came from the end of BG1 was the experience , scope and confidence to make a vastly superior game in BG2.

When starting a new character in BG2 , all the back story that exsisted in BG1 is told to you in the opening trailer of the game. Who you are and what you have done have been generalised in a way that starting off in BG2 verses playing the first title of the series doesnt leave you lost.

Infact, anything you may have lost in terms of playing BG1 is redoubled in the amazing expansion called Throne of Bhaal, which takes the story of your past , present and potential future to levels that werent even touched on in the first title.
This expansion is included in BG2 EE so if you choose to buy this remaster , you will miss very little in terms of story.

If your old enough to remember Terminator and then watch Terminator 2 year later will understand this completely because they share a common trait.  The second incarnation is so vastly superior to the first that there is no need to experience/watch the first.

Im not going to beat a dead horse on the actual review of BG2:EE.
There are so many amazing reviews online that illustrate , far better than i could , all of the brillant traits that make this game one of the BEST RPG's of all time.

What stands out for me is the writing and PACE of the game.
Bioware crafted BG2 in a way , in the quest structure, that you never feel very far off the beaten path towards the end. All the side quests are meant to compliment the main story in some way or another.
And the side quests are easily the BEST of any RPG ive ever played.
That is not to undermind the main story at all, but only reiterate the strength of how impactful the side quests are.

I mentioned the pace of the game and I wish there was a virtual table I could bang to get this point across.
There are so many past and present RPG's I play where I get so wrapped up in the vast open nature of a game that the main quest or objective becomes a second priority.
This isnt the case in BG2.
BioWare cleverly crafted a way to keep the story in focus but give the player all the time they needed to explore and experiment. When you were ready, the story took main focus and ran forward at amazing speeds.

By the end of BG2 you feel satisfied. It truely is a complete story.
Yet if you feel is there more to the backstory that hasnt been complete, the expansion Throne of Bhaal answers them.
This expansion was made before the invention of DLC. Its a TRUE expansion with 20-30+ hours of content and RICH , character driven story. It could possibly be the best expansion ive played in my life.
It ends the story of a character you started from BG1 and ends it in excellent fashion.

This review was writtten for a very esoteric perspective. Made for a RPG fan who doesnt mind the learning curve of a good game and appreicates a epic story.  If there are gamers out there of this nature who havent played this game, I hope this review helps.

In the end, BG2 stand alone as one the best games ive ever played. It is a reminder that story, characters and solid gameplay trump impressive graphics and superfical gameplay.

Im old enough to see the progression of gaming in a unique perspective.  I owned pong, i watched nintendo and sega battle out in console wars that lasted 3 generations of systems, the rise of the X-box and sony into the market and a game that was so massive that 12M people played it online at the same time. 

Yet through all of this , even more than once when ive been amazed at a technical breakthrough, its how games have impacted me intellectually and emotionally that have stuck with me through the years.

This is one of those games.

What can one say in front of such magnificence? These two RPGs are simply the pillar of western production of this genre, and when the two are combined in a single game they definitively are among the top 10 of the must-play for every PC gamer out there, no matter the age.

BG:EE and BG2:EE are simply THE definitive Dungeons & Dragons experience, including almost all the possible 2.5 Edition Core and several optional rulebooks of the Forgotten Realms setting and translating them into a marvellous duo of 3rd person games.

Although both games are very old (they were developed and published between 1998 and 2001 by Bioware / Black Isle Studios), they have been “enhanced” and made available on modern systems (including Windows 7/8/10 PCs, OSx, Android and IOS) by the guys at Overhaul Games / Beamdog, who not only re-tooled the original Infinity Engine to make it run on modern platforms, but also added several other goodies that were not present in the original release, in addition to bug fixes and standard “curator” jobs.
I could go on for pages and pages describing in detail the marvels of the Baldur’s Gate Series, but I’ll try to cut it short and stick to a much shorter format.

[b]PROs[/b]
- Ever dreamed of taking your typical AD&D session with your friends out of the pen & paper setting to a PC screen? This game is for you!
- Charismatic characters and companions: Minsc the Ranger (and Boo!), Jaheira, Viconia, Xzar, Sarevok… what else can I say?
- Longevity: both games combined are well over 100 hours of gameplay
- Replayability: seriously, there are hundreds of possible combinations of classes / races / kits / alignments / companions / choices to completely change your experience at every playthrough
- Every action you make affects the game world, like it is expected from a proper Western RPG. Apart from some scripted events to progress with the main story, the rest is up to you
- Multiplayer: join with 5 friends to create a fully custom party!
- The (new) developers are supporting the game with patches and fixes, and they actually listen to the community
- Compatible with most of the original BG / BG2 community mods
- Runs on every system, even your mobile phone / tablet (NOTE: the Android / IOs versions are separate purchases). HW requirements are very low

I spent quite some time debating whether or not to recommend this game. It boils down to this: The original content is great. Still is, still always will be. It's an epic adventure with great characters, good plot development and fantastic modified-2nd edition gameplay. The graphics show their age, of course, but there are still some great backdrops and whatnot. The dialogue in this game is probably the best of any game ever made -- epic when it needs to be, and hilarious otherwise.

Why I don't recommend this game is the new content, which is poorly written and boring. The new characters are written by people who clearly don't comprehend the wit of the original game, but think they do. It's painful.

New Content (without spoilers): BG2EE adds a handful of new companions with personal quests, including a single class thief, a wild mage, a monk and an evil paladin. With the possible exception of the evil paladin none of these are going to make your party on merit, and the writing isn't good enough to make you want to use them for role playing reasons. All in all, nothing that hasn't been done better by the mod community. There's a gay romance for a female player character which I would usually praise, but it's so tepid I couldn't decide whether I'd misheard and it wasn't really supposed to be a romance at all. 

Speaking of mods, not every one has been updated to support EE yet (Item revisions/spell revisions are the ones I'm missing most at the time of writing) so check before buying if you've got favourites.

BG2EE comes with widescreen support out of the box as well as a trick that you can't replicate with the basic game and the widescreen mod - customisable font sizes and interface scaling. Having properly sized sidebars is a good thing on a high resolution monitor.

No reason to buy this over the standard version other than better widescreen support? That would be true except for one small detail - the standard version doesn't run properly on my laptop. This does. Enough reason for me to buy it - but I still waited for a heavy sale (elsewhere) before buying.

On many RPG-game community-sites, Baldur's Gate still ranks in Top 10 (just like the first part, Planescape: Torment and some other RPG games of Black Isles) although it is quite old and there is a reason for it.

Baldur's Gate II is a party based isometric strategical aD&D RPG game with a deep storyline, moral choices, real interaction between your NSCs, lore to almost no end... Almost anything a real good RPG needs.

ICompared to the first part of the series, there are some differences. The story is more linear. You have less open-world exploration but are driven either to your next main quest or to one of many subquests. This reduces the risk of newcomers getting lost in endless exploration without knowing what they have to do next, but I realy liked the true open-worldness of the first part, so this is a little downside in my opinion.

Everything else is still the same old-school RPG-style like the first part. So it is realy some kind of must-have for hardcore RPG gamers. Oh, and you can import your character from the first part which is a big pro for this game. There are only very few series which allow really carrying over your char.

This edition is shipped with the ""Throne of Bhaal""-AddOn which was not the best Add-On Black Isles ever made. The story and the enemys truely seem overloaded and a lot exxagerated most of the time and so are the items and the  ""epic"" skills your characters will achieve to beat the game (which is not very hard, even on increased difficulty levels). Buit still it concludes the ""Bhaalspawn""-storyline of the series.

The Enhanced Edition comes with another campaign ""The Black Pits II"" continuing the arena-fighting campaign from the enhanced edition of the first part with even more arena fighting, but also with a deeper story and more tactical options and more roleplaying between the fights.

It also has enhanced graphics compared to the original game and some new NSCs with their own subquests and interactions. Some of them you might know from the Enhanced Edition of the first part.

The enhanced edition also has some new character classes, skills and spells, but those are only bonusses. If you already own the original game, have some great mods installed and don't like arena-fighting, this enhanced edition might not be worth buying, but for all the others it is clearly a recommendation.",1416264202,1416264202,True,4,0,0.500919163227081299,0,True,False,False

The initial release had bugs but at the moment, this game is quite solid. The story itself is probably one of the best modules ever written for Forgotten Realms. The characters (original ones) are all quite fun in their way and the newly added ones somewhat blend in. Although, they are neither as interesting as the original cast (like Minsc, Edwin or Jensen) nor their voice acting matches the quality of the original NPCs. Still, they don't disturb you much.

Replayability: High
Budget: If you already own the original, buy on sale only. 
Lenght: ... It took me years to finally complete it. I'd wager an experienced player can get it done in a week or more. No less. 

Baldur's Gate is hands-down one of the best games I've ever played. While initially, porting D&D into a tactical real-time gameplay setting should set off some alarm-bells, this game is one of the most tactical games I've ever played, requiring precison, patience and understanding. 

It's also a roleplaying game that allows you to explore the, now venerable Forgotten Realms setting that I grew up with (Fantasy books ect.). It features a soundtrack and memorable characters that you will NEVER forget. You'll find yourself hearing things in real life, that almost makes you burst out a quote from this old gem, that no one will get. 

The biggest problem with Baldur's Gate, is that it's ancient by now... Which is where the enhanced edition comes in! 
Upgrading the game to HD and even upgrading the game engine and interface to the same standard as the sequel is exactly the kind of boost the game needed to become playable, even to people who didn't grow up with it. 

Enhanced edition also features some new content. While I appreciated this, I'll be honest and say that I didn't quite feel that this new content entirely fit with the mood of the original game. It was a bit too... Humorous and... Cute. I mean, considering the rather dark underlining theme of the game and the story, it just didn't feel quite right, but this is to be expected as the update was done by a third party. 

Baldur's Gate, to me, is the predecessor to all modern RPG's.",1412024109,1412024109,True,6,0,0.542900025844573975,0,True,False,False

I'm not going to comment on whether or not the series is good or bad since it goes without saying that any rpg fan needs to at least give it a spin. What's important and what I struggled with since the enhanced editions launched was whether or not these new editions were worth it, or whether or not I should just dust off my CD copies from the days of yore. 

It's true that there isn't anything in the enhanced editions that can't already be done with mods. The last time I tried installing the CD versions and modding it all up was a tedious experience though. It's also true that the added content is forgettable; the Black Pits is something that I'll never touch and the new NPCs range from tolerable (Neera, for example) to poor (Hexxat, for example). 

But I couldn't care less about the above. For me it boiled down to two things: One, was this version easier to set up and two, was this version buggier than the originals. The enhanced editions are no doubt easier to jump into on a modern computer due to many of the enhancements mirroring typical mods that you'd want to install (porting BG1 to the ToB engine, for example). Many of the community's mods have been updated for the Enhanced editions as well, so you can still cry in a fetal position as Swords Coast Stratagems mages rip you to shreds if that's your thing. 

Now, bugginess is obviously dependent on many variables and I can only experience my own playthrough of the series, but apart from one crash to desktop in the opening dungeon of BG2 my playthrough from BG1 to ToB was smooth and clean. The official forums would make you think that the game is a bug ridden mess and it kept me away from purchasing for months, but I do not regret purchasing it in its current state.

if you are expecting a major graphics overhaul, you will be disappointed.  most of the original art assets are gone (gee whiz, bioware!), so a simple HD remaster is out of the question.  you will get some new NPC's, which i personally enjoyed quite a bit.  as this is a matter of taste, your mileage may very.  for me, it was a chance to play with a party i would never have chosen for myself:  monks & wild mages?  ew.  but it's been great, and for those that are patient enough to stick with rasaad, you will find that he is insanely powerful by the time the ToB expansion begins.

the interface, while seeming the same, strikes one as less clunky.  several small conveniences quickly seem impossible to live without.  & the load times.  oh. my. gawd.  honestly, if you plan to spend much time with the BG saga, you will be amazed at how quickly saves and areas load, in contrast to the original offerings.  this is something no mod can change in the original game (at least not that i've seen), and the idiot-proof install & play package will have tremendous appeal for those who lack either capability, inclination, or time to mess with modding the now-antiquated technology of the original release.

having played the original vanilla releases for bg1, bg2, & ToB in the past year, i can honestly say that i'm hooked on the stability and convenience of enhanced edition.  the added characters have quests that add new areas (at a better resolution IIRC) to spice things up for veterans.  i'm not looking back.

The task is clear: Kill the Wizard, in the dungeon you woke up! After all, it was nice not there ... find him and kicks him in the ass! And on your way get cool weapons, exp, and all what you can get...
this game is 13 years old, but I still like it. Now with new Charakters. Cool. First, I had the normal BG 2-Game. Than, I get the Dungeons & Dragons - Anthology (Baldur's Gate) version from Amazon (Juni 2013... ) for 25 € and the Dungeons & Dragons - Anthology (Neverwinter Nights) for 25 €. Now I have the BG2 EE... 3rd time, I'm buying BG2.

The saga that keeps on giving. I gave BG:EE 10/10 and BGII:EE if anything exceeds that. The gameplay is more refined and driven, and the story as compelling as before.

Again the hours required to ""complete"" the game are little short of a century, I stand at 87 hours for one playthrough. 

The game has improved choices and gameplay, as well as more player options and character customisation. Again the visuals show their age but that isn't why you play this game.

The game really and truly feels.. alive.  It does this by having interesting and enjoyable characters, locations, and quests.  Sometimes things don't make sense.  Sometimes people say a little something that helps you along, but that little something is not recorded anywhere.  Sometimes things happen for seemingly no reason.  The end result?  The game feels like it's real.  People have their own wishes and desires, and you need to balance each party members' goals with your own.  Combat is fun, and very challenging.  You can make a choice that impacts you in ways you won't even realize until you play through again, which is one of the more amazing things about this game.  Modern games give you 'choices', where you 'choose' good or bad.  Baldur's Gate II blurs the line.  There are multiple paths to nearly everything, and very few (if any) of them are marked as ""good"", or ""bad"".  Say the right thing or have the right person with you and you might avoid combat.

- Crashes when alt-tabbing
- Crashes when progressing to the next chapter in multiplayer
- Glitches

Between romance, rescuing civilizations, personal revenge, reconquering castles or the many social as well as physical dangers adventuring brings with it, all of them are handled very well.

The AD&D rules are a bit dated and players unfamiliar with them will probably need the help of a guide, as some things other than the gameplay itself are quite hard to grasp. For example the damage reduction on certain constructs or demi liches, which make these (near) impossible to kill if the group isn't correctly outfitted. Also the fact that negative numbers are usually better is rather counterintuitive for younger players. 

There are also some smaller usability hardships during character creation and leveling (saving before leveling is recommended as the leveling screen can't be left to make comparisions between characters). Keeping an eye on your spells is also very important in this game as there a few spells without which the game becomes extremely hard to play. Without chaotic commands and negative energy protection the game becomes virtually impossible, so read all of the spells descriptions. Also managing arcane spellbooks is more important than it looks at the begining.

Other than this, the game is pretty much perfect: Engaging, lots of fun, nice puzzles, great epic fights, loot, loot and more loot, 100h per playthrough of the main game with dozens of classes and even more party member options.

So let google help you build a character. Save before leveling, so you know where to put your perks and which weapons you own. Read all the spells. ALL OF THEM. If you can't deal damage to sth., change the weapon type or try stronger magical weapons. And erase arcane spells, if you can't learn an important one or raise your int temporarily.

If you do that, you will have a lot of fun with this gem of a rpg.",1403546332,1404041813,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The realistic answer is probably, ""No."" You're better off watching a ""Let's Play"" on YouTube. The story is still good, but the mechanics and the bugs just drag the game down.

Like any D&D scenario, without a well balanced team, the game will make you mad. Keyboards will be thrown. Forums posts will be typed in all caps. I found myself dying withing the first few seconds of a fight just because I wasn't immune to the spells that were being cast. There's no respec'ing; what's done is done, and there's no going back.

It is, however, nice to have Baldur's Gate on steam and working on a modern machine without any fuss. I expect this version will be patched and the bugs I mentioned will hopefully be fixed.

well written story and well written NPCs(mostly) they you will love(mostly)
Shadows of Amn story was my favorite.

2nd ed D&D terminology may be a bit confusing to someone newer though.
THAC0 (to hit armor class zero) - chance to hit with attacks basically, lower = better
-Effects with ""+x to THAC0"" will actually lower this value, which is good
AC - Armor class - how well armored you are, lower = better
-Effects with ""+x to Armor Class"" actually lower this value, which is good 
Saving Throws - die roll you would need to save against a specific effect. lower =  better
-Effects with ""+x to saving throws"" actually lower this value, which is good

Only piece of advice I'd give is this:
Spellcasters will ruin your day with crowd control through confusion/fear/stun if you cant deal with them quickly.
5th lvl Wizard spell ""Oracle"" = best way to dispel their invisibility.
5th lvl Wizard spell ""Breach"" = best way to dispel their protection spells to kill them fast.
and dont be afraid to use the quicksave feature. this game is very unforgiving in some ways, especially your first playthrough.

Why can't you click the yes and no buttons when reviewing a game?  I wish I could on this one.  

Here's your caveat emptor people:

If you actually care about the new NPC's and Black Pit whatever they added in, OR if you have never played the original version, GET THIS GAME...... just maybe NOT THIS VERSION.  It is an amazing game, Baldur's gate series probably being the crown jewel of the D&D computer games.  However, with Beamdog, it is hit or miss whether the game will work with your computer specs at all.  Best to check with other people that have similar spec's or with beamdog before potentially losing 25$.  To prove my point, beamdog still hasn't even fixed the problems with Intel chipsets on the original BGEE, so I wasn't even able to play it at all until I got a new computer.  No refunds were given to all the people they f*cked in the arse on that one.

Honestly, there are only two justifiable reasons for purchasing this one, over the more affordable Original: 1, in rolling the dice for your char. stats, it gives a total at the bottom... which if you're a serious OCD player, will save you countless mins/hrs of calculating your points to assure good stats (you can add up the right column of #'s, e.g. 1(5), of all the stats and want the total around 30.  Such takes a lot more time than just looking at one # and making sure you rolled a total of around 90).
No. 2-the better screen resolution, and no3 you just want to increase the number of games on your steam list.

Often, hardcore players will create their own party of 6  unique characters and not use any NPC's at all, so I wouldn't make a couple extra characters being added into the game the fulcrum of your choice on whether to buy or not.  The original game is good with any and all glitches it came with and you won't lose out on any experience by saving money.  The other new changes aren't so significant to weigh into the decision.  Gametstop has a bundle of six DnD games that often sells for around 9$ which contains the BG series.  For getting full-screen out of the tiny resolution options, just plug in a box monitor from your old PC into your laptop or whatever.

Beamdog's work is just not that satisfying.  They released this game before the first travesty they put out was even fixed, and copped out of even fixing it.  Why isn't Bioware or someone useful updating these games?

Judging the game itself, however; guarunteed to make its way to the top of any top10 RPGs list.",1392501149,1398583974,True,2,0,0.534794270992279053,0,True,False,False

EG: 1) At least one of the ""rez"" spells DOESN'T -- it merely harms the caster and leaves the dead character dead. 2) The pathing of the characters, whether controlled by the player or the AI, is almost offensively nonsensical, resulting in members of the party wandering off in the OPPOSITE direction of where they are supposed to be heading or taking the most circuitous and perilous path to a space mere feet away. The AI will often halt a character mid-path and just leave them there, meaning you may find yourself missing a member of your party during an important battle. 3) The voices cut in and out, sometimes not even finishing sentences or words. 4) The ""triggered"" dialogue will sometimes skip ahead several steps, ruining some potential romances and preventing the player from making their own choices. 5) The AI-controlled party members will often disengage or cease attacking enemies, and casters will often stop casting spells or just freeze mid-spell. What is more, many characters will freeze in the middle of drinking a potion, meaning they receive no benefit from the potion but also cannot/will not fight back when attacked. 6) Many NPCs will simply stand in place, refusing to move, which can be game-breaking if they are blocking the only doorway or path to a game-crucial location. 7) Characters can have the wrong abilities for their class and/or race.

With a dark and provacative main story arc, the ability to play as both good and evil with alignment-appropriate companions, side quests with enough content to rival main quests in other games, compelling companions with deep stories, and a RTwP (real time w/ pause) combat system that manages to make combat both chaotic and strategic - BG2EE should be a slam-dunk recommend. Unfortunately the game does have flaws, and I'll use this review to detail these weaknesses so that users on the fence can make an informed decision before buying. 
 
BG2EE owes much of its incredible story to the environment in which its set. The Dungeons and Dragons universe is rich with both lore and mechanics. While the game unarguably benefits from the rich lore, the same cannot be said of the mechanics. The AD&D ruleset, cumbersome and obtuse even in its time during pen and paper play, is a harsh ruleset for a PC RPG. 

New players will need to spend a substantial amount of time learning about AC, THAC0, weapon proficiences, Ability Score modifiers, weapon enchantment levels, combat protection spells, spell protection spells, various dispels, and so much more. Diving into the game without a basic understanding of these rules will almost certainly lead to a 'gimped' charachter and near-guaranteed slaughter by certain encounters. 

The need for an intimate understanding of the rulesets is made worse by the choices the developers made in crafting companions. Your companions, while having emotionally compelling stories that draw you deeply into the game, will join your party with weapon profeciencies and leveling decisions that are questionable (at best). My recommendation on this is to download EEKeeper and use it to tweak your companions' weapon proficiencies. Problem solved, so long as you have the dicipline to not break the game by boosting instead of tweaking. 

You'll find another flaw with BG2EE when you examine how the story is balanced. Completionists (as I imagine most hardcore RPG players looking at this title are) will want to complete all available sidequests before advancing to the next main story chapter. In BG1EE, this worked fine. Every chapter unlocked additional sidequests in a relatively steady flow. Not so in BG2EE. You'll step out of the introductory dungeon with the vast majority of the game's sidequests front loaded. Literally dozens of hours of deep, rich content that will you keep you enthralled for days before you even touch the main quest.   

Normally this wouldn't be an issue, and most would consider it a good thing, except the main story arc's hook is to remove from play one of your best (imo) companion choices. This made party selection more difficult than it needed to be, at least for me. 

To wrap this review up, which has now become my longest review to date, I'll say this: 

If you're willing to play the prequel and immerse yourself in the story and willing to take the time to learn the mechanics, plan out your party choices, and use EEKeeper to  tweak those companions - Baldur's Gate 2 EE will be guaranteed to be one of your most unforgetable gaming experiences. If not, you're still likely to have a great time, but the experience may be tainted by frustration and confusion.",1389813422,1390455904,True,13,0,0.629293262958526611,0,True,False,False

So during the steam summer sale, a friend of mine bought me Baldur's Gate 1(Enhanced Edition) so we could play together(the 4 pack was 20 bucks). 6 months later, we had never played together once so I finally decided that I wanted to play, so I played it solo.

Now there's a few things you should know about Baldur's Gate. The game was originally released in 1998. I played it while I was in high school my senior year. It introduced a LOT of new people to Dungeons & Dragons. It's a 3rd person isometric RPG in which you control all members of your party. It's paused based(instead of turn based), which means that when combat starts, you pause, issue commands, unpause, wait for something to happen, pause again, issue commands, etc, etc. There are lots of games with that type of system now, but as far as I know, BG was the first.

So the way you're -supposed- to play it solo is to create one character and go along recruiting AI NPCs to join your party of up to six. Well you can get around all that by playing in multiplayer mode by yourself. Multiplayer mode lets you create all six party members and tweak them to your desire. You can also export/import different characters at any time. You can easily get away with this from an RP(roleplaying) perspective by saving your game in an inn and swapping party members in and out saying ""Oh I met this guy at this inn"". So to start with, I created my own party of 3: Human Fighter(me), Paladin, and Cleric, then I pick up NPCs along the way. Not completely satisfied with the NPCs in game, I finished the game with 5/6 party members self generated, and only one in-game NPC(Yeslick the Dwarven Fighter/Cleric). If you enjoy character creation and tweaking things and micromanaging party members, gear, stats, and other RPG elements, this game is definately for you.

Lets talk about the story. This is where the game really drew a lot of people in. For those of you that have already played, you know what I'm talking about. I'm not going to spoil it for anyone that may play the game in the future(even if it IS 16 years old), but it's a great, great story that lets you choose your own path. Of course my path is that of the good soldier fighting for... well... good. But if you enjoy the darker side of things, it's always allowed, which a lot of games give you trouble doing. You can lie, cheat, steal, and murder and still complete the game.

Oftentimes now that I'm in my 3rd decade of life, I've gone back and tried to play games from my childhood that I remember really enjoying, and graphically none of them have stood up to the test of time(X-Com, Doom, etc). Since all of the assets in BG are more or less hand drawn and the enhanced edition lets you play at your native resolution, the game still looks pretty damn good, especially amidst the recent indy dev 8 bit gaming boom. So graphically, it passes the test. The environments are pretty freakin cool too. A whole lot of unique, hand drawn areas that I had forgotten about since I first played a long time ago that made me say ""huh, cool"" when I came across them recently.

And now let's talk difficulty. Holy shit is this game hard. It's been so long since I've played a game that didn't just blatantly hold my hand and coddle me the whole way through I'd forgotten what it's like to play a game that punishes you. AD&D 2.0 core rules are a huge bitch and completely unforgiving. There are 5 difficulty levels in the game:

-Easy - Everything does half damage, all hit point gains per level are maximized, and characters can't permanently die.

- Normal - Everything does 75% damage, all hit point gains per level are maximized, and characters can't permanently die.

- Core Rules - Everything does 100% damage, hit point gains are randomized(so you can get as little as 1 hp/level on your badass front-line fighter that needs ~10 hp/level), and characters can permanently die.

- Hard - Everything does 150% damage

- Insane - Everything does 200% damage and you are a satan worshipping masochist

I may have added that last little part on the insane bit.

So being the badass gaming veteran I am, I of course choose Core Rules. I understand what THAC0 is, I know what the different classes are, I know how to D&D. I'm good.

Or so I thought.

I'm actually not as good as I had thought. I had to do a LOT of fights multiple times because Jesus Christ, this game can be hard. Mostly with the crowd control abilities the enemies get(note - If you fight against a group that has a mage, KEEP YOUR PARTY SPREAD OUT just like in ArmA). A lot of times I'd get hit with an AoE fear or confuse or stun, etc, etc, etc. It could be infuriating, but I kept re-loading and going at the fights in different manners from different angles, and analyzing my party and their abilities and switching things around until finally, at the end of the game, I had SOME sort of idea of what I was doing... I thought... until the final battle.

Let's just say that the final battle in Baldur's Gate had me curled up in a fetal position in the corner of my room praying to Torm asking him what I had done so poorly to have been punished so badly.

So somewhere between 20 and 50 attempts later, I managed to defeat the final boss and win the game. I even had to google strategies for the final boss. I actually felt a sense of accomplishment like I haven't felt in a game in a long, long time. The funny part is, 17 year old me beat the game in 1998 without the internet for guidance. I have NO CLUE how I managed that feat.

So I immediately went to steam and bought Baldur's Gate 2 enhanced edition, even though it's not on sale, and started a new game. This time, however, I'm playing on normal mode. It seems to be a much better balance of playability vs difficulty. I've still lost some fights, but I've learned a whole damn lot and built my party around the strengths needed.

I have a Cavalier paladin because he: 1. Can't be feared, charmed, mind controller, or poisoned; and 2. He can make the entire party immune to fear pretty much all the time. He's also a badass tank alongside my main character which is a frontline fully maximized fighter with sword and shield. I also have a pure Dwarven Cleric, Fighter/Thief, Fighter/Mage, and Dragon Disciple Sorcerer. I dual classed the Thief and Mage with Fighter bases so they could use longbows for good DPS instead of being relegated to a shortbow and a sling. The nice side to that is that they get fighter HP for their first 7 levels so they're pretty beefy on top of it all.

I just pretend(roleplay) that my entire group is a squad of trained military soldiers that have been sent on a mission, so they almost all have that base fighter class from their military training.

So I have 2 tanks(FIghter/Cavalier Paladin), a pure healing Cleric, and 3 pure DPS(Thief/Mage/Sorcerer). But don't be fooled, that fighter and paladin can put out some melee hurt too. The cleric is really the only non-dps class. Oh... Make sure you -always- have a thief in your party with the script that makes him passively detect traps. Trust me on this. You don't necessarily need a thief/rogue that can stealth, but you damn sure need one that can detect/disarm traps and pick locks.

And on that note, there are pre-set scripts that you can use for each character. There are about 20 for all the different classes in the game to mess around with. I pretty much have my whole group on the standard ""I see an enemy and attack with my equipped weapon"", except for my rogue, who is set to always passively detect traps when not in combat, and my cleric who is set to dynamically run around and heal. I micromanage everything else(mage spells mostly).

I could go on all day about it, but you could easily read anything I would say on a review of the original game. Instead, I'm going to adress the differences between this Enhanced Edition and the original. 

1. Praise to lord you can actually play the game again. The original had a nasty habit of not working with newer computers. You had to be a computer expert to get it to work, and even then it was unlikely. Until this came out, I feared I would never play it again.

2. The graphics are highly improved. You can run it in double the resoloution of the original. No more blurry combat and squinting hard at the screen through a grainy and pixelated mess. 

3. There is a lot new content for this game. There are 4 new party members, and each has their own quest associated with them. And that goes for both SoA and ToB, so that is 8 new missions and 4 new party members. 

4. While still a little bit buggy, it's much less buggy than the original. And it's nothing you can't fix with the console commands.

Some people don't think it's worth 25 dollars. I say thats a bargain. You get to play a game that hasn't been working for a decade and is also vastly improved, indulge your nostalgia, and play new content.",1389485148,1389485148,True,91,0,0.672478020191192627,0,True,False,False

I am one, still have BGII on my desktop, and still have the ToB CD to play through it from time to time.  I dont know why really, but I still enjoy this game after so many years.  I was rather sceptical about buying this, seeing that it didnt really seem to add much more for the $$.  However I have been pleasantly suprised.  They didn't really ramp up the graphics much - such as make it 3D or dramatically enhance the 2D quality.  I was kind of let down by this initially, but the small improvements have grown on me and it remains true to the original.  The new characters and dungeons are pretty good, and while not adding a lot of time to the game, they are still fun.  The new interface I enjoy quite a bit, and see it as a big improvement over the original.  The story remains the same, and this is the crux of what made this game great IMO.  Its like playing a good fantasy book and lacks the ham handed cheese that was so prevelant in NWN and NWN2.

As far as bugs and crashes, etc.  I have had one lock up and havent seen any bugs other than a few minor graphics glitches here and there (a few sprites flutter and thats about it).  Seems very solid, runs very smooth.  

Its an upgrade if you still enjoy this game after so long.  If your new to it... you may not see much here worth your time.  Its an old game and this upgrade doesnt bring it up to 2013 specs.

Ths is probably one of the rare RPGs that can still, after all this time, evoke in me a sense of wonder and just makes me want to play it. Now, i won't review the game proper, but just the Enhanced Edition, the game is simply a masterpiece and i think at this point most of the CRPG players at least heard about it. 

Let's start with the first bônus. The game comes with the expansion, Throne of Bhaal, an amazing expansion that is the size of some games released today. Besides it, the entire system of Shadows of Amn is overhauled to ToB standards, and that is another good point for the Enhanced Edition. And, there's no ""mumb jumbo"" to make it work in nowadays systems, it's just install and play, simply as that, so, if you wanna enjoy this game without any problem with your OS or the hardware, this is the version to buy.

About the enhancements in the game, there are the extra characters, everyone of them with content both for SoA and ToB, and...It's actually better content this time around, than the one presented in the original Enhanced Edition, so you're gonna have some fun. And better, they are romanceable, and that alone makes the replay value of the game to get even better. Of the new characters quests there is just one part that doesn't feel right depending on your protagonist...But the game is receiving feedback and it may get better.

On sound an video there's not much to tell, it's the same game, but with some improvements in those areas, nothing major, so it feels like the old beast, and that is good, the BG II graphics were beatiful then and they hold up 'till now.

I cant even tell you how many times i've played this game through to the end.  The world is massive, the NPCs feel human,  the quests are exciting, and the combat system is deep and nuanced. 

And then there's the 'Enhanced Edition'.   

It's difficult for me to recommend the enhancements 'overhaul games' added to baldur's gate simply because there aren't very many of them.  Almost all of the issues which existed in 2001 are present in the enhanced edition.   This includes (but is not limited to) : 

- Cheating the combat system by initiating dialogue with a neutral NPC and then attacking them while they are stuck in the 'i want to talk to you' animation.   
- Casting a spell in an area covered by fog of war and having your spellcaster get stuck in an endless casting loop which never results in the spell actually being cast. 
- Pathfinding bugs
- Awkward looting of certain objects which requires that your character be in a specific spot to interact with the object.

I could go on.

In Overhaul's defense, they did add a few new NPCs to the mix, all of whom seem interesting and useful in their own right.  But it feels like they did this to try and distract from the underlying issue -  which is that they are adding icing on top of an old, rotting, cake.  

I love baldur's gate and i'm enjoying the enhanced edition, but Bioware / Black Isle deserve the credit for that,  not Overhaul.  Only get this if you are a rabid fan of anything Baldur's Gate (like me) and just want to have one last spin around Faerun.  Everyone else should probably just buy the original version from GOG.com.

Therefor, if you haven't played it yet, head over to the Baldur's Gate 1: Enhanced Edition first and then come back and buy this game for it is fantastic. 

Both Enhanced Editions offer a much more convenient experience with some great solid new content. Baldur's Gate 2: Enhanced Edition offers four new companions, each with a great storyline and dialogue, new class and race combinations and  ""The Black Pits 2"" campaign (an arena-style combat campaign). They are both definitely worth getting as they are the definite modern way to experience these fantastic classic games that offer a tremendous amount of content, quests, great dialogue and a huge sense of freedom. Visually there have been few improvements, and a shocking lack of options is disturbing, but if you can set aside these problems and have the patience to learn these obviously outdated gameplay mechanics then both Baldur's Gate 1: Enhanced Edition and Baldur's Gate 2: Enhanced Edition are absolutely worth it.

That being said though having played the original Baldur's Gate 2 and Throne of Bhaal many time over, I would give the enhanced version a 3 out of 5.

I give the ""enhanced"" version a lower rating for a few facts;

1. I have noticed far more bugs in the enhanced version of the game then I ever did in the origional, including broken spells. monster spawns, and quests.

2. The price... need I say more $25 for an improved UI and multiplayer, 4 extra characters, a new expansion, and a host of new bugs, when you can get the original bioware clasic for $10 from other places.

3. With the improved engine comes a lack of settings present in the original, one of the more important being the number of pathing nodes, the enhanced version seems to be set at the default 400,000 nodes with out any way of changing it, so prepair for plenty of ""You must gather your party before venturing forth""

All in all I have still put in 20.5hrs in the last 2 weeks acording to steam and I plan on putting in many more just for the sake of finishing what I started, but I would definitely recommend waiting for it to go on sale before getting it unless you are a die hard fan like me and must have it right away.

That's it really. That's the only thing close to a flaw. It's an amazingly solid game filled with some fantastic characters and some genuinely imaginative quests that rewards careful planning and thinking things through, something modern games seem to have abandoned in favour of letting players just facetank everything. The challenges combined with the brilliant characters just make winning so much better, especially when that one fight you thought was impossible suddenly turns out to be easier than eating cake when you think to try one of the fun little counters to whatever was petrifying you/eating you/setting you on fire/Charming Minsc, setting him to BLEND and sending him back after you.

Carrying a character through from a level one scrub in Baldur's Gate and into Baldurs Gate two then onto Throne of Bhaal is an amazing journey full of frustration, laughter, lots of swearing and ultimately watching your level 40 character effortlessly wipe out entire armies is something everyone should do at least once.

It lives true to its name if you are a keen RPG fan (NOT to be confused as a hack n Slash RPG i.e. Diablo).
Although this is a remake, the devs have breathed in new life into a almost perfect game of its time with updated compatiblity of higher-res, new quests, new characters and eliminated its inherent bugs.

The graphics are dated, but still AMAZING for an aging game.
I recommend this to all true RPG fans, as the replayablity is immense, the story 10/10, the depth of game play is deep and an all round winner, refreshed for the modern age.

It have the most depth story, a lot of side quest and the main quest is one of the best written I ever saw. The interaction between your party members is even better than anything done recently like Dragon age or Mass Effect

The enhaced edition add some cool features to the UI to simplify thing and make it easier for gamer to enjoy it, without removing its hardcore gameplay or any game design.
