Now, unfortunately, this game has a story. A very convoluted, insane plot that somehow leads (without any spoilers here) to a conclusion you do not expect... understand or like even. Why does it happen? Elizabeth answers a similar question with ""It just does"". For me it means that whoever wrote it did not understand it either.

Released in 2013, this installment in the BioShock series is a breathtaking journey that seamlessly weaves an intricate narrative, stunning visuals, and innovative gameplay into a masterpiece that leaves a lasting impression. The game introduces players to Booker DeWitt, a former Pinkerton agent with a troubled past, who is tasked with rescuing a mysterious young woman named Elizabeth from the floating city of Columbia. Set against the backdrop of an alternate-reality America in the early 20th century, Columbia is a marvel of design, a city suspended in the clouds that feels both fantastical and eerily plausible. The narrative of BioShock Infinite is a gripping tale that explores complex themes such as American exceptionalism, racism, and the consequences of unchecked power. The relationship between Booker and Elizabeth is central to the story, and it unfolds in a way that is both emotionally resonant and thought-provoking. The game's plot is filled with twists and turns, keeping players on the edge of their seats until the final, mind-bending conclusion. The world-building in BioShock Infinite is nothing short of extraordinary. Columbia is a living, breathing city with a vibrant atmosphere, diverse locales, and a rich history that players can unravel through various audio logs and environmental storytelling. The attention to detail is remarkable, creating a world that feels both fantastical and deeply rooted in its own lore. Gameplay in BioShock Infinite is a dynamic mix of traditional first-person shooter mechanics and unique elements that set it apart from its peers. The introduction of the skyhook, a grappling hook that allows players to traverse the city's skyline, adds a vertical dimension to combat that is exhilarating and fluid. The combination of gunplay, vigors (special powers), and Elizabeth's AI companion abilities results in a combat system that is both strategic and satisfying. The audio and visual elements of BioShock Infinite contribute significantly to its immersive experience. The music, composed by Garry Schyman, complements the period setting while enhancing the emotional impact of key moments. The art direction, with its blend of steampunk aesthetics and American nostalgia, creates a visual spectacle that is both beautiful and haunting. While some may argue that the gameplay can be occasionally repetitive, the strength of BioShock Infinite lies in its ability to seamlessly merge storytelling and gameplay into a cohesive and unforgettable experience. The game's thought-provoking narrative, combined with its stunning design and innovative gameplay, cements its status as a modern classic.

In conclusion, BioShock Infinite is a triumph of storytelling and game design, offering a captivating experience that transcends the boundaries of the medium. Its exploration of complex themes, coupled with its breathtaking world and gameplay innovations, make it a must-play for anyone seeking a truly memorable gaming experience. BioShock Infinite is not just a game; it's a work of art that will leave a lasting imprint on those fortunate enough to embark on its sky-high journey.

Set in the early 1950s with the backdrop of Rapture on land and at sea, this game oozes a lot of scenic beauty blended in with the retro 50s music which suits its style.The game has a lot going for it with its unique artstyle , intriguing storyline with plots and twists and slick gameplay. 

The story is what makes Bioshock different with Ken Levine's direction really adding a lot of meat to it. I wouldn't get into much of the story, but I would say that if you play it a couple of times you will know what I am talking. Further, there are YouTube videos which dive deep into the  story tying out certain loose ends. I, for one, am going to watch these videos to understand Bioshock Infinite, not just in a nutshell, but as a complete storybook.

The music is quite good with the enervating feeling of birds chirping, stalls selling stuff and the pristine beaches with waves slapping against the sand to the nervy unsettling and eerie music being in Rapture City infested with splicers and psychopaths. Yes, these psychopaths are more in the story and in the DLCs, so please be warned . I would suggest stocking up on medkits and tranquilizer darts with your very own tried and trusted guns. 

The gameplay , as discussed before , is quite good and it continues with the subsequent DLCs. To me, DLC 1 was great as it gives you innovative ways of playing the game. You can go guns blazing or sneak in like an assassin just like in the Dishonored or Thief series. This , to me , does justice  to the main game which incorporates the same. 

However, DLC 2 doesnt do the game justice as its focussed solely on stealth which brought its downfall. I would only hope they brought in the same gameplay elements of DLC 1 which could have sped the progress of DLC 2. This DLC is a slow one (i.e anaemic)  as you sneak past enemies and ahem, the Big Daddy , as well to try to complete tasks. I ama person who likes to go guns blazing and I had to replay levels just for the simple reason that I was caught with my pants down by one of the splicers . :)

The challenge missions are a pallette cleanser as they test your skills with a number of weapons and challenges to sink your teeth in. Overall, I could see why there was no sequel to the Bioshock franchise solely because of DLC 2 which didnt stick to the basics of what Bioshock has and will always be. The lack of innovative mechanisms, paucity of choices and the short story took a number of hardcore gamers away. 

Do not mistake me while you read this post. Its a great game  as a whole. But this DLC gets a 6/10 as the story was short with no twists coupled with a sneakfest of a gameplay. However, Bioshock Infinite gets a 9/10 as it really is so good to play even today and forever.

A note on timing: I played this game in April 2015, two years after it was first released. I put it down for five months and returned to it in Sept. 2015 to see if the passage of time had given me any new insights, and still disliked it. Finally I loaded it up in Feb. 2024 and completed it after watching Youtube guides to get me past the bits I couldn't do.

My final verdict is that this game is far weaker than its two precursors and features lazy ""quantum physics did it!"" handwaving to explain its creaky plot holes. Having finally completed it with a fair bit of resentment, I believe it is not worth completing another time and I'm on the fence about whether it was even worth completing the first time. The sort of game that might be worth watching through on Youtube before putting down the money to buy it.

1. Weapon selection is limited. Or more specifically, you're limited to carrying around two weapons at any one time. This is still okay with the standard mooks, but the boss fights can be frustrating if you brought the wrong tools for the job.

2. If mook fights are too easy (which I found they are), boss fights are too hard. It's sort of all right, because the game gives you a respawn auto option. This sort of compensates for the obligatory deaths from damage while you're still figuring out the level geometry, but there isn't really much chance to investigate much into the mechanics. Some funky effects do happen, but I had to look them up in walkthroughs because standard combat is so frenetic that you don't get much chance to really think about what happened.

3. Level design merely appears to be open. In actuality, once you look beyond the open-air backdrops, the actual walkable areas are still linear. There's some gymnastic potential with some of the boss battles, but as I mentioned above, I found I was dying too often to really enjoy exploring them.

4. The scope of philosophical inquiry in this game seemed much more subdued than SS2 or the BS1/2 games. Instead of thought-provoking questions about collectivism vs. individuality, Irrational Games gave us some alt-history, some speculative fiction, and a passing look at religious zealotry and a vague mystery of the holy uterus. This is probably unavoidable with the change in focus of the game - there are very few non-combat challenges in the game when you're not shooting or hurting something.

5. After programming in hard-coded fanservice cleavage that literally follows you around the entire game, it struck me as a bit disingenuous of Irrational to scold its fans for making Rule 34 artwork. They were sort of asking for it.

Not a terrible game, but not as inspiring as its predecessors. I'm not sure why. Irrational used to make great games.",1442622031,1708317767,False,10,0,0.438990533351898193,0,True,False,False

BioShock Infinite was a game I genuinely wanted to enjoy, drawn in by its captivating style and setting, which are undoubtedly the highlights. Despite this, I found myself unable to finish it. Beyond the initial allure, the game didn't manage to hold my attention. Its scale felt lacking, and I struggled to feel connected to the characters. While the gameplay was smooth, it didn't offer anything novel, leaving me feeling underwhelmed amidst the anticipation for a return to the BioShock universe. The surrounding hype raised my expectations, only to leave me wanting more from the experience. Given these points, I find it hard to recommend BioShock Infinite to others now, as it didn't live up to the expectations set by its predecessors or its initial presentation.",1708159995,1708159995,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

This game is like taking a rollercoaster through a steampunk fever dream with a side of existential crisis.

You play as Booker DeWitt, a guy with such a murky past he could give a soap opera character a run for their money. Booker's mission? Find a girl named Elizabeth who can open tears in reality. Yeah, it's as bonkers as it sounds. She's basically a human Swiss Army knife of spacetime. Need a weapon? Boom, she tears one in. Need cover? Bam, she tears in a wall. Accidentally tear in a 1980s rock band during a firefight? Oops, but also, kinda cool?

The city of Columbia is a floating paradise filled with Americana turned up to 11, where the locals are about as friendly as a hornet's nest and twice as chatty. You'll be floating around on sky-lines, which is basically like riding the world's most dangerous rollercoaster while people shoot at you. Fun times!

And let's not forget the big daddy of this game (pun intended), the story. It's like a philosophy book and a conspiracy theory had a love child. Just when you think you've got it all figured out, the game hits you with a plot twist so wild, you'll need a moment to just sit there and question your entire existence.

In summary, Bioshock Infinite is a wild, mind-bending adventure that's part shooter, part existential road trip. It's a game that doesn't just break the mould; it throws the mould out of a floating city and watches it plummet to the earth below. 10/10 would question reality again.",1708027041,1708027041,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story is very interesting, but its ending felt kind of ..... lackluster and confusing. The context for some things in the story can also be somewhat underworked.

DLCs are also interesting, but they also leave you somewhat confused as in what they are trying to say with them.

dislikes:
weapons:
-can only carry two guns meaning much less choice
-only worth upgrading guns you use and only really worth going for damage upgrades
-no alternate ammo types so even less choice
-a lot of guns suck so why bother with them
-much less niche to guns, choice comes down to what damage type do you like the most?/what is your play style?

vigors (this games plasmids):
-a lot of the vigors are functionally very similar
-don't get to choose what vigors are equipped, they just are all at once

management aspects:
-now there is only one currency which you have to buy both vigor and weapon upgrades with
-lock picks are the only new management aspect and by the end of the game you will have well over what you need.
-Elizabeth, the npc that follows you around, will just toss coins and lock picks at you making the discovery of these resources less satisfying.
-never bought ammo in my play through from a vendor because enemies either dropped a lot of my ammo type or I would just switch guns for a short period
-can't carry health or salt so you don't have to spend money stocking up and just have to dig around for supplies.

Exploration:
-everything is so linear so there isn't much exploration to do other than unlock doors with lock picks
-no more free weapon upgrade machines
-only thing really worth finding are more lock picks, money, and health/shield/salt upgrades (which only the salt upgrade felt like it made a difference both functionally and visually)

Combat:
-enemies are no where near as interesting as first two games, only exception would probably be mechanized patriot
-why have a shield? why? it's a step backwards to having to manage health packs and just feels like another stat they wanted to throw in. Really just there to make bioshock more like Halo.
-no camera or item to research enemies, meaning less strategy to encounters
-rarely passive enemies and even then, the game is so linear that you are just going to fight them soon anyways.
-One of the bossfights really sucks.
-ending fight wasn't impressive, didn't even realize it was the final fight till a little while later.

Story(all of this can be considered spoilers):
[spoiler]
-While I love the Luteces and can see some charm in Elizabeth, both Elizabeth and Booker are idiots.
-How Columbia functions all seems half baked, it is made out to be a society filled with cultists following their prophet Comstock, but everyone just seems like regular people, living their lives. Edit: I forgot about the one part in the beginning in the game where there is a racist cult thing going on, but it was so short and nothing really happened here so I forgot about it.
-Bioshock infinite... has rascism? it doesn't make much sense. Irish and black people are lower class workers doing all the dirty jobs, but they still get the choice to move to Columbia. Why would any of them move? Ah yes, we will go from an America where racism and segregation is mainly going on in half of the country to Columbia where racism and segregation is throughout all of it AND it's also led by a giant nutcase cult leader.
-Not to mention all of the discriminated people live in shantytown, a run down part of Columbia. How did this happen? This obviously wasn't the intention because the sign was painted over. If this part of Columbia was initially a more beautiful part, why would they move people here that couldn't take care of the property? Why didn't they put them in barracks or smaller houses so that everything doesn't look rundown and the workers are at least living in a clean space, maybe if they did this they wouldn't have had a revolution against them.
-Gives no idea of how leadership actually works in Columbia, does Colmstock actually run everything? What are the laws? If it is all one big cult why isn't it more authoritarian? If it was democracy were the black and Irish people hoping for civil rights?
-Why did America even fund this project if the whole thing was to be controlled by a cult leader that said he was a prophet within Christianity? While America might have been more Christian back then, they would have denounced Comstock because Jesus literally said there will be no more prophets.
-Why did they introduce timeline hopping? It literally destroyed all stakes. Why didn't they just hop into a timeline where Columbia was just a nice place with no cultists, no racism, and no fighting? How is the audience supposed to care about what happens in every single timeline? Human minds can't comprehend or emphasize with concepts that big. 
-What was the purpose of killing Booker at his baptism? To kill Comstock? what about any timeline where something different happened before the baptism? There would literally be an infinite amount of things that could have been different. Yet the creators decided to explain it away with ""constants and variables"". The spiderverse did something similar with its ""canon events"" but this worked way better because it was similarities across multiverses, not branching timelines. Not to mention the whole ""Killing your parent kills yourself"" trope is stupid, this doesn't make you disappear because if you were the one to kill your parent but this also means you don't exist, then you could have never killed your parent. This wouldn't make you disappear, this would make all of time freeze or implode on itself.
[/spoiler]

I'm perfectly fine with disregarding this entry from the Bioshock series. It has stripped itself of fun mechanics to appeal to a different audience; it has plenty of questionable design choices; and the story is made for midwits who think that you have to be smart to understand the story when really if you think harder the entire story falls apart and seems like they made it up as they were going.

-Besides graphics the game is a downgrade in every possible way compared to Bioshock 1&2,the weapons are meh, the powers are meh, and the story is absolute piss.
-Say goodbye to having you weapons CHANGE as you upgrade them. I cannot stress enough how BORING this makes upgrading everything. Now it's just numbers you don't notice and nothing changes.
-The lack of a sodding manual save infuriates me. And on top of that the auto save doesn't occur at set times but happens at the beginning of each level so you either have to finish it or suffer an RESET OF THE ENTIRE LEVEL! What idiot though that was a good idea?
-I just cannot impress enough just how shit the auto save in this game is. I can't even sodding tell WHEN the game is saving!
-There are SO MANY WEAPONS and 1/2 of them are the SAME GUNS BUT RED.
-This game went from alt history psyco first person shooter that explored some really interesting concepts, to ""industrial era America but in the sky and more racist and with time travel""....... To the surprise of no one this  story is NOT unique, compelling or interesting at all, and to top it off all the characters are nothing more than extreme caricatures. 
-The potential ramifications of traveling through the rips and opening them at all is MOOT because you are REQUIRED to use them to progress the game.... You don't get a choice and the characters become EXTREMELY flippant with just doing it all the time without a second thought. 
-The first 2 games are about CHOICE and the ABILITY to make your own choices and live with the different paths those choices will take you. This game just shits all over that and just says ""JK actually you don't have a choice and you never did. You were always set on this path and we won't let you make any choices that matter unless they take you down the path we want""

There's something mildly damning about Bioshock Infinite and the whole franchise when its cultural legacy for the last few years has been either revisiting Bioshock 1 or Burial at Sea's kickstarting of the entire micro-industry of SFM porn with model rips of Elizabeth. A decade ago, this game was part of a pillar erected by gaming journalists trying to vie for the idea that games were art, and always leaning on A or AA games for it. Because they're hacks. This, Spec Ops: The Line and Life Is Strange were the easy hits for some literal-who article writer to say were challenging the gaming paradigm. Just as GamerGate picked up steam, Irrational leaned on Bioshock: Infinite and pumped out as many DLC's as it could to ride that wave. That and also purging most of the staff outside of Levine and a core group of devs who haven't done much in a decade. Thank you Take-Two, you really are the worst.

With the recent revival of interest in System Shock, it's painted Bioshock as a franchise and Infinite especially in a odd light. Bioshock has always felt like Irrational Games trying to recapture that same lightning in a bottle, and with varying results. And Infinite feels like the game that's trying to break the bottle and move on, and fails to do so. The game tries its best to reinvent every basic mechanic you've come to expect from a Bioshock game and spin it on its head, and instead ends up muting what you do like and replacing it with things you don't. 

The combat is neat until you realize that it's basically just Bioshock 1 with less punchy weapons and a movement mechanic the game barely uses. Sky-Lines were this game's bread and butter for advertising back then but you rarely get to use them for anything beyond bipping out of combat encounters, dragging yourself to the next combat arena or the odd enemy takedown. Once you're on the ground, it's the same shoot/spam vigors you've come to expect. And the game pallidly shrugging its shoulders with that makes it worse. Vigors being glorified plasmids from Bioshock 1 is one thing, but it nullifies what made plasmids and Bioshock 1's plot work. It's a plasmid except with no consequences. Which is the best short hand statement for what Bioshock: Infinite as a game is.

It's Bioshock 1 without consequences or proper pacing. It's spinning the formula enough that you don't notice the wizard behind the curtain, because the second you do, you're screwed. You're in fact Andrew Ryan from this dimension fighting against Andrew Ryan from ANOTHER dimension and the Little Sister you've been saving has been the Little Sister you sold years ago. And in the end you have to brain yourself with a golf club. The fact this game's positive reviews always to a tee mention ""wanting to replay this game with no memory"" tells you all you need to know. The twist of Infinite is not that deep, and the second you get the faintest hint of it, you're done. You know every punch this game is going to pull and nothing will solve that. All the while the game is leaning on the worst possible trope to pull that off. 

Dimensional chicanery and time travel would be neat if it wasn't in service of trying to make some greater Bioshock mythos. But this game forces it to try and tie Columbia to Rapture and in doing so, take them both down to the bottom of the sea. A stretched metaphor? Absolutely, Irrational knew that when they made two DLC's out of it.

In boiling down Bioshock's tropes to the basics, Irrational made a Bioshock game that feels the least like a Bioshock game. Crawl from arena to arena to open world-ish area and buy non-descript upgrades to your peashooters while using any of the game's features a whole five times. Enjoy the ever present fun of combat with the only interesting bit of it being using Elizabeth as an ammo generator and casting Testicular Torsion on random enemies. Read random audio logs that spoon feed you the twist 12 hours before it's supposed to happen and try to resist eating wallpaper paste for the better experience that'd be. Good work Mr. Levine, I can tell why you weren't lead writer for all of the good Looking Glass and Irrational Games. Because if you were, Thief would've ended with Garrett letting Victoria drown him for defeating the Trickster God.",1707233068,1707233068,False,3,0,0.494750618934631348,0,True,False,False

(SMALL SPOILER AHEAD)

Playing in a superficial utopia which soon turns out to be a flatout dystopia, heavily reminding me of germany around the second world war or america before the civil war but also unfortunately reminding me of more recent events around the world, which makes it appear like we aren't able to learn out of our history. This game is unbelievable close to reality and tells alot about human behaviour, especially the century long dispute about ""us"" vs. ""them"", ""bread & games"" and ""divide & conquer"". 

The first person shooter mechanics are nothing new, you've got basically the same array of weapons you've got in other games of that type, but playing on hard difficulty makes it less of a repetitive task. What really pissed me off though was the back tracking, I really don't want to backtrack for some more or less useful equipment, where the majority of it is not beneficial for the play-through, so I stopped backtracking and just finished with the story and it was worth it, but the backtracking really killed the flow of it a couple of times, if you're playing on lower difficulty I really recommend you not to backtrack to open some kind of chest, most of the times it's really not worth it and the navigation help system is garbage, way too often it just makes you keep going circles.

The game is great and the story is amazing, for being released more than 10 years ago now, it hasn't really aged at all, if you're late to the party just like me, I'd definitely recommend you to play this, it's worth even just for the story, especially when it's on discount and atleast usually all bioshock games are on discount whenever there are steam sales.

I am still wondering if the main character is somewhat an homage to shutter island.

Edit: The ending was incredible and deeper than you'll ever think, I'm mind blown and in love, aswell as extremly intrigued by the bioshock universe! Great job, amazing game! Gunplay and game mechanics get quite repetitive at mid-end game but after watching a behind the scenes it's understandable, the devs were ahead of their time and just didn't have the recources and developing time they needed. Buy it whenever it's on sale, for 10-20€ it's definitely worth playing for the story alone. (9.2/10)",1693055134,1706995436,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h2]Intro: Soaring High but Hitting Some Turbulence[/h2]

Bioshock Infinite is like going on a rollercoaster that's supposed to take you through history, but halfway through, you realize it's just a fancy merry-go-round. The game is a visual feast set in the floating city of Columbia, where the buildings are more uplifting than the storyline. Get ready for a sky-high adventure that occasionally forgets it's not tethered to the ground.

[h2]“Eye Candy in the Sky: A Graphics Gala”[/h2]

Graphically, Bioshock Infinite is like attending a Gatsby party in the sky – everything is dazzling and over-the-top. Columbia is a place where you'll spend half your time gawking at the scenery and the other half wondering if you accidentally walked onto a movie set. Astounding design? Check. Reality? Questionable.

[h2]“A Story That Almost Sticks the Landing”[/h2]

The plot is as compelling as a soap opera set in an alternate universe. It's got twists, drama, and a mind-blowing ending that will leave you more confused than trying to solve a Rubik's cube in the dark. The characters are well-fleshed out, forging relationships that feel about as real as your chances of actually visiting a floating city. 

[h2]“Shoot, Fly, Repeat: Gameplay in the Clouds”[/h2]

Shooting in Bioshock Infinite is sharper than a tack – if the tack was attached to a semi-automatic weapon. Combat is so engaging it almost makes you forget you're essentially on a very violent sightseeing tour. And don't worry about combat fatigue; the game keeps it as fresh as Columbia's apparently limitless supply of ammunition.

[h2]“Sounds Like Heaven, Quirks Like Hell”[/h2]

The sound design is an auditory delight, perfectly blending gunfire with a soundtrack that's more immersive than a 4D movie. But watch out for those occasional quirks and contrivances that disrupt the immersion like an out-of-place tourist in your perfect vacation photo.

[h2]Verdict[/h2]

[b]Graphics: 8/10[/b]
Columbia is a visual spectacle that might make you wish you lived in a postcard.

[b]Sound: 8/10[/b]

[h2]Closing Thoughts: “A Flight of Fancy That Sometimes Forgets to Fly”[/h2]

Bioshock Infinite is like that dream where you're flying – exhilarating at first, but then you start to wonder why everyone's speaking in riddles. It's a journey that's both awe-inspiring and slightly puzzling, like finding a hidden gem that turns out to be cubic zirconia.

[h3] Actual Review (No Spoilers) [/h3]
A modern twist on what made Bioshock 1&2 special. Infinite is definitely more of an action shooter than BS1&2, but thanks to a streamlined gameplay system and a stellar story, Infinite continues to stand the test of time a decade later - even for a new player like me.

[h3] Story [/h3]
The story (while majorly confusing) ties up the series pretty nicely and will keep you thinking about it long after you stop playing. I can't really say much about it because everything major is heavy spoiler territory, but just know that you will most likely be more emotionally moved on your second playthrough once you understand what's actually going on beneath the surface. I think the game is carried a little by the story, as I find the gameplay having some missed potential. Even still, the setting allows for some really creative ways to play the game. BS1 still manages to be the better game overall, gameplay wise I'd say they're on par, however they are two different types of gunplay so you can't really compare them directly. BS2 still reigns supreme in that department however.

[h3] Gameplay [/h3]
And speaking of gameplay, Infinite also is pretty refined and is even more streamlined and boiled down to it's core elements with very little bloat, almost to the detriment of the game however. There is definitely places where it lacks and there's also areas that feel like they have missed potential. Weapons for example have defined rolls but the amount of them kinda muddies the water and there is a lot of bleed over. There's also a couple weapons that are just bad and have better options (something that BS2 avoids) Infinite also adopts the two weapon system other action games have - which works for how the game is balanced, but I feel like they could have kept a version of the previous games' weapon system, it breaks away from the Bioshock mold too much IMO and just stifles a lot of the sandbox-style combat. The plasmids however (vigors in this game) are all still fairly unique, while admittedly holding less power for experimenting compared to BS1&2. A lot of them are just an attack and then being able to set it as a trap. There are a few different combos you can pull off but most of them aren't that useful or have a unique effect. There is also thankfully NO researching of enemies anymore and you just upgrade weapons and vigors to keep up with the increasing difficulty.

There are also four different difficulties and honestly, none of them were truly difficult. My first playthrough was on medium and there were some really tough sections because of my lack of knowledge, but on my second playthrough I cranked it up all the way and had an easier time than before thanks to prior knowledge. Enemies are tankier and do more damage and that's about it. The AI isn't particularly hard and the only really hard fights are the ones with either little cover (which rarely happen), or you happen to have weapons that aren't effective for that situation.

[h3] DLC & Achievements [/h3]
Now to talk about the DLCs, I know they are very divisive story wise, but I've kinda learned to look past the shortcomings because what we got is an incredibly interesting and emotionally climactic story that ties into the first game and offers different toys to play with than the base game. Clash in the Clouds however? Here's where I have some issues.

CitC is an arena DLC with a nice progression system that spans all 4 arenas. It's great.....if you aren't trying to achievement hunt. Every achievement in the game is not hard to do, you just have to put in the time and it will take a maximum of two playthroughs per campaign. The one and only stupid and grindy achievement is getting all 60 blue ribbons in CitC. The biggest reason why? Aside from some of them relying basically on RNG, There is NO WAY to replay specific rounds out of the 15 per arena. Meaning if you're stuck on getting a ribbon from a later round, sucks for you because you have to replay the entire arena up to that point every single time. This achievement is truly awful and there is a reason its the rarest one in the whole game.

[h3] Conclusion [/h3]
But putting CitC aside, the overall package of Bioshock Infinite is one of amazing quality, worth full price and then some. It's an excellent way to wrap up a revolutionary trilogy that I have no doubt will be one of those games that you'll remember fondly for years to come. 8.5/10",1694223799,1706667823,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

* Pros
+ Elizabeth is very good companion and very likable character
+ Art direction is great
+ City in the Sky is cool mirror to Rapture from the previous titles
+ Sky line riding is a neat spectacle

* Cons
- Story thinks it is profound and it just isn't
- Booker's character is as flat as a plank until the end
- Combat isn't very satisfying
- You can only carry two weapons
- Plasmids don't really help much in combat (I honestly only used three of them)
- The whole game had so much potential in so many aspects
- The game can be very easy in some parts or insanely hard in others
- A boss that kept spawning enemies, can move around very fast, and is all around annoying
- Dying has no real penalty (you only lose a little money and gain health back)
- Did not need to be a Bioshock game, it would of been a little better if it was its own IP

Overall: 5/10 Average

The Story is well told with little pieces of information being spread out through the runtime which allows the played to fit the pieces together at a well paced rate. The characters are decent with Booker and Elizabeth being a pretty good duo. I also really like the themes of religion and time travel being integral parts of the story; really fitting in with the whole Bioshock aesthetic.

The Setting of Columbia is just incredible. I don't know what it is about this development team but they really know how to make a creative and lived in world full of wonder. There were moments where i just stood there and took in the atmosphere of this 1920's sky world that was in front of me.

Visually, its a stunning game and it goes to show how a great art direction can carry a game for years. Performance was a bit janky to say the least. There would be moments where areas would be laggy, npc's clothing would just boomerang and there would be points where i would be stopped in my tracks while moving. Apart from that, there wasn't any bugs or crashes that ruined the game. Art Direction as i just said is fantastic and everything was just a cite to see, even for a game that came out from 2013.

Sound and Audio are also fantastic with the soundtrack containing may tense pieces as well as 20's music to even stuff like barber quartets adding to the atmosphere. Audio is perfect for guns, enemies etc.

In terms of gameplay, it might look simple but it can get fun real quick. There's a variety of guns to choose one with each being as fun to use as the other. The abilities are probably some of my favourite parts of the combat with each one having its own effect and allows the player to mix and match with new way to take down enemies. Speaking of enemies, there are your normal classes such as melee, shooter and heavy foes, but there are some nice additions such as the crow men (i don'y know their official name) and the mechanical presidents (yeah you heard me) that spice up the fights quite nicely. Elizabeth's tears are also quite useful with each one giving the player an advantage to take on the hordes of enemies. The vendors for upgrade and buying items are also pretty nice to use and fit the environments quite nicely. I do think that this game plays a lot better than Bioshock 1 sa with that game a lot of the combat was clunky and just tedious. 

Overall, Bioshock infinite blew my expectations away and greeted me with a brilliant experience that i would love to revisit again.",1678561343,1705848249,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is quite beautiful visually and holds up really well even these days from the real damn hard work that they've done when making this game. However, much like rapture, it too has it's own problems revealed later on with the corruption and revolution not far away.

The concept was certainly very different, being a far more religious-based situation with regards to how Comstock and his followers deify the founding fathers. Buying into the worst of their bigotry and classism. They game has Vigors instead of Plasmids, but often act the same, but have some new abilities too like releasing crows and such. You play as a PI, down on his luck and owing money to the point that he's been offered this one job to get rid of his debts. ""Bring us the girl and the debt will be paid"" which gets repeated often due to the aforementioned fact it's the focus of the narrative.

The levels are all huge and part of that is due to the skyhook that gives you a hell of a distance to travel by hanging on these wires and giving a whole new angles to the combat. Not to mention using it as a melee weapon when needed too. It's a really great game with not just great mechanics, but a great narrative and a beautiful ending and a wonderful character in Elizabeth.",1705791046,1705791046,True,1,0,0.51754385232925415,0,True,False,False

Who doesn't recommend this game for its art, remarkable themes related to politics and philosophy, and its rich story. This time it happens in a heaven, where man being exceptional escapes to the heights, achieving to conquer the decadent morals above the mountains. All created by the brilliant mind of Ken Levine.

This is the story of Booker DeWitt, who arrives at the floating city of Columbia in 1912. His mission is to find Elizabeth. In some of his nebulous remembrances, he assumes that he must pay his debts without recognizing the reason why it took him there. But the task won’t be easy, as he’s identified by the city's security led by Zachary Hale Comstock, who presaged them about the advent of the false shepherd.

The protagonist carries an anathematized AD stigma in his hand. With that the crowd and security identify him. So they try to stop him, nevertheless he’ll do everything possible to reach Elizabeth and at the same time realize more of the world (a civil rebellion is starting) like his past.

[h1]The quantum of possible worlds[/h1]

Without a doubt, the world of [i]BioShock[/i] captures the eye through its art. Thus it’s conspicuous the influences (books, music, science, paintings or films) that the game has been inspired. The idea of an aerial city is fascinating, the technological steampunk type is fused with late romantic art from the United States. Quantum knowledge is bonded with an excessively patriotic atmosphere. Since the world is a paradise, it was achieved from superb lighting with vibrant and vivid colours. Everything is detailed to halt for a moment to contemplate the architecture and its vertiginous design. As well, notwithstanding the years, its appearance doesn’t age. The characters are expressive and the places are perennial to their existence.

The ear is also enchanted by its soundtrack composed by Garry Schyman. At some moments we’ll perceive pop music from the 60's. But the monumental work is found in the orchestral pieces that narratively comprise the game. The theme immerses itself in Comstock's utopia, consisting of musical pieces about his vision of paradise. But also this immediately proposes music from a parallel world, occasioning the music gradually lose its lustre (from utopia to rebellion). The musical effort is formidable, as it expresses through atonality (as diverse musical vibrations) and film score with elements of US folklore. The soundtrack reveals the context of the past and present of a possible world.

The narrative develops a sober theme but without losing dramatic impetus at any time. The theme focuses on the exceptionalism of man, but whose glimpse of the future makes it fear and, therefore, it looks for a way to elude it through immoral actions for society in general. It turns to messianic, religious and political themes, issues that haven’t changed in the US. The parallel possible worlds or Many-worlds interpretation is the narrative core. Since everything is interwoven and overlapping, the narrative thread isn’t misplaced in the multiplicity of contexts and the memory game plays with the protagonist. It tells the past of father and daughter, but at the end it glints at knowing whom he and she’s. The interesting story always invites us to realize more about the world where DeWitt tries to be.

[h1]Disturbing the shepherd's flock[/h1]

If you've played the previous stories, [i]BioShock Infinite[/i] makes some noticeable changes. The familiar: first-person shooter that combines powers and their upgrades, the use of currency, looting as basic actions of the character's movement. Although it changed a little, this is the new thing. You can now only take and use two weapons. Depending on the difficulty you find weapons and ammo frequently. In addition, melees is effective, so it can be combined with Vigors. These powers are similar to plasmids, although their effects are new and different. You can combine them (almost two at a time); they have two effects and require salts to activate such skills.

Some of these powers allow you to take control of enemies, turrets or Heavy Hitters. Since everything takes place in the air, there’ll be no shortage of airship combat as well as being able to use the environment during combat, such as hooks or air rails. For better performance in the role of the character, it contains gear as clothing parts to get various advantages. He has a shield automatically regenerates. However, if you die, you’ll lose some cash. So be careful when you die and have no money. Currency is important, because it’s for the retries, enhance weapons and Vigors. While the character improves his health bar, salts and shield with Infusions.

He doesn’t travel the adventure alone. On many occasions Elizabeth will assist us. It makes the game feel somewhat cooperative. She takes care of herself —an self-sufficient and independent character who doesn't even seek to be protected. But she has skills: will open temporal tears to bring us allied machines, environmental support, money or supplies. All the time she’ll be in interaction, she’ll offer us clues and support us in combat by giving us what we need. We’ll find closed doors or places with cryptic texts (small side quests), in which she’ll use lock picks we find and notebooks for her to decipher. Elizabeth is someone with personality and helps a lot.

[h1]The windows to other realities or the best possible world[/h1]

The narrative is outstanding, with a logical heuristic and rhetorical scheme, its air of sci-fi through quantum, provides an unforgettable style of how much theme and game are developed. The political air within the game gives those “if and then” in a persuasive tone but simultaneously discreet way for the sharp mind who will be uncomfortable with the fact. I like to listen to them, but I don’t agree with such “reasoning”, it moved me to think and feel, it achieves its immersion well.

Its art is gorgeous compared to previous games; but its story, the first game still convinces me. The colour palette, ruled by pink and blue tones bear a resemblance to the divine kaleidoscopic rainbow, emphasizes very well what Comstock's utopia promotes through a distorted faith. Since the ending is an opening to possible worlds —Elizabeth's wonder consists of using the analogy of the stars being lighthouses whose doors lead to other worlds— it allows to be replayed to appreciate the story and the game in detail.

At this time the game is too cheap, so it’s better to buy the bundle where some interesting things like weapons and gears contains (its season pass). There are also two expansions that give an “end” to Elizabeth's story from another universe. This evokes nostalgia when contemplating the marine architecture of Rapture. Or, its difficulty can be a good challenge. If there’re games that persist in eternity, this is one of them.

I originally recommended it but, all things considered, this game, for all it's worth, is a pain in the butt. I think that the bad here outweighs the good. And it doesn't matter what amount of crap I have been able to tolerate from it up until now, the game just doesn't make for a good recommendation in my eyes.

The last straw for me was when I was recently trying to collect things in Burial at Sea, and explore completely all the areas (specifically the optional area where Shock Jockey is found, which you can miss).

Life being life, I had to close the game at some point, then I reloaded later, and the checkpoint system decided that I had no more access to the area I still wasn't finished exploring, and that I had to move forward on this metaphorical theme park ride (I even found an easily reproductible softlock bug while trying to go back to the area I wanted to be in, because the game apparently couldn't cope with what I wanted to do and had to break, and I effectively got stuck in a room).

In terms of my options, I couldn't complete the task I had chosen for myself, since the proper savegame for me to go back to didn't exist. So, all I could still theoretically do was start over from the beginning, not shut down the game at any moments the game would judge inconvenient, and be very mindful of each and every checkpoint (by looking at the icon on the upper right corner that's signaling that the game is saving). What do I think of all that? ""No, thanks"".

That was effectively the last straw, and what made me change my mind. Okay, guess what. On top of every other differences I mentioned in my original review, BioShock 2007 had a proper saving system. While Infinite has console check points. Now, what is so bad about check points, you ask, and how does that system compare to a traditional save system? Simple. The latter leaves you with complete control over your experience with the game and with your own computer, leaves the choices and decisions to you, the player; while the former is controling your experience, and is controlling you the entire time.

Infinite, on PC, needed to have a traditional save system with multiple save slots. Period.

--------------[Original review bellow]--------------

BioShock Infinite is a lesser game than BioShock (2007) in every respect, except for a couple of details and the graphics.

Its story, not only is a mess, but makes no sense past a certain point. In a way even a child would understand right away that it is making no sense. They had to make the characters be very stupid, to the point of mental retardation, in order for the story to progress (ie. to get to the next level, and the next, etc).

The game feels like a theme park ride, and has only as much depth as one.

All of this ultimately stems from the fact that BioShock Infinite had a very troubled development cycle. There is no real way to tell if Irrational Games would have been able to ever release this game, had the publisher not sent their own man to try and patch the various elements of the game together and salvage this mess, but all signs points to ""no"".

[strike]In spite of this, I would still recommend this game, though not at full price.[/strike] It can be an okay virtual adventure when playing through once, and the production value is obviously high and is looking like it, even ten years later.

BioShock Infinite is what Irrational came up with when they had, effectively, infinite time and money (no pun intended, but I'll take it). While BioShock (2007) was what they produced, whence they had to work within stricter boundaries and constraints. Let that also be an educational lesson. Today, on one side we have a timeless classic (BioShock) and on the other a mere curiosity (Infinite).

There you go. BioShock Infinite is a game that was saved by its publisher, and that would have been even worse or would not have existed at all, had its developpers been left to their own devices and, some could argue, their insanity. It's a bit of a Frankenstein monster, but it's a finished product with some endearing aspects.

I actually like the personal story of Booker and Elizabeth, and I also really like how open certain levels are - so much so that they don't really feel like ""levels"" in a video game.

I heavily dislike the fact that the player can only carry two firearms/weapons. This [b]takes away options[/b] from the player, choices, and makes for a more homogeneous and uniform gameplay experience, which is to say a more [b]boring[/b] one. This also feels very [b]controlling[/b], in the same way the checkpoint system instead of actual saves is controlling.

I also dislike the fact that Elizabeth's whole purpose during combat is to be your imaginary friend (she's invisible to ennemies and can't get hurt) who throws at you ammo and salts. The animation for that is also too long/slow, so you can fully expect to get really tired of it after a while - I think it can even make people feel dizzy, since it's in first person view and [b]takes control away[/b] (once again) from the player for a moment.

Finally on the subject of Elizabeth as an NPC, I strongly suspect that the whole reason why, as the player, you are so often frustratingly low on ammo, salts and weapons is because Elizabeth exists, and because they had to give her purpose in terms of gameplay. But this is, and feels, backwards. It was a backward way to go at things. And in my opinion it is making for a worst game overall.

I played this game for the first time in 2013. And replayed it at the end of 2023. It is not as fun the second time through, even ten years after your first time. Enjoy your first run. I felt like 10 years was an adequate amount of time to form an opinion about that game and finally write a review (yes, I am being facetious now).

I highly recommend using these launch options in order to bypass the 2KLauncher when you launch the game:

It's unfortunate that the scenario of the game is inspired by the American Civil War, indeed a boring topic that nobody but US citizens care about. While the first game takes you to Rapture which is a city inspired by Atlantis, this game introduces you Columbia which has a nice atmosphere but an uninteresting theme and history. At least the secondary plot, ""parallel universes"" become more important later in the game.

Oh well, I also did not like the relationship between you and Elizabeth. I will not give more details in order to not spoil the game scenario for you, but while it is obvious that the relationship created between the player and the little sisters in the first two games cannot be established here in this game with Elizabeth, who is obviously and adult woman, therefore the game is (probably unwittingly) promoting incest which is really annoying.

About game mechanics, the vigors are not more interesting than the ones in the previous games, but Elizabeth is one of the most useful NPC's ever. She gives you ammo, health, weapon, unlocks doors and safe boxes (but she opens them in 1 sec which makes the game unrealistic also), advises and she doesn't stop you shooting enemies by standing in front of your gun, she runs away from it.

In short, BioShock Infinite is not good as the previous games of the franchise, yet if you liked the previous games, just play it because with the two DLCs (Burial at Sea 1 & 2), the scenario of the this game connects with the first game. BTW, the scenario of the DLCs are better than the main game, so if you are gonna play the game, be sure to play the DLCs also.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

After replaying the 1st, 2nd and now infinite (3rd) I can say without a doubt this is a really good game/franchise. Even though infinite made a bunch of plot holes with the BaS dlc's they were still fun.

I really hope a 4th game comes out sometime in the near future; that being said buying these three when the collection is on sale is an absolute steal. The 2k launcher really isn't that big of a problem. It adds about 3 extra seconds of booting up the game which is whatever.

2k. Thank you for making my life even simpler by making me have to launch a game 2x before I can actually play it. Forcing a launcher onto my PC to chew up my time, my system resources, and my space (in order of importance). I was never asked if I wanted a launcher and If you think a EULA that you can change on a dime is equivalent to my consent than I  disagree.

Such a sincere contempt for the end user is something that should be answered in kind. 2K you'll likely never read this, but I don't care - You will never get another cent from me.

At the end of the day, this game is still a timeless classic. You come for the strange setting and shooty action and stay for the mind-bending story and ending -- one of the finest video game stories of all time.",1704566081,1704566081,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

8870,155284209,76561197994525136,0,1,1732,0,1732,1694914582,"I originally got this game for the Xbox 360 when it first came out. Preordered it even. This is one of my favorite games of all time. I was a big fan of the first Bioshock and the less said about the second one, the better. When Infinite was announced, I wasn't sure if they'd be able to capture the magic of the first while being fresh. Especially considering how much they stumbled in the second game and how the studio drama seemed to be reaching a breaking point. It did reach a breaking point (thanks 2K...), but from that break came this wonderful game. I already see some folks talking about how ""it's not a particularly good Bioshock game"" but let me tell you that this is just as good, if not better Bioshock game. It's just that it does things differently than Rapture and that's OK.

[b]THE AESTHETICS[/b] are the biggest reason I replay this game every year. It's a huge departure from the first Bioshock. Columbia as a setting is set in the 1910s America, the height of Nationalism and patriotic pride. There's a lot to love here as they get so much of it right: the iconography, the music on the radios, the speech, everything. That also means we get the same ugliness that the 1910s America brought with it: racism, bigotry, and those looking to exploit both for political gain. It's a tale as old as time. But it works great as a Bioshock setting. What really is different though, is how [i]alive[/i] the world is compared to Rapture. In Rapture, you arrive there after the fall. Everyone is dead or spliced out of their minds. In Columbia, you're there as it begins to fall so it's still relatively bright and sunny. It's an interesting trip because you get to see what once was and it's hard not to fall in love with the old shops, Independence day celebrations, and simple times. But so long as you're... you know... white. That's the ugly truth under Columbia that begins to fester an boil over. 

The game is set about 40 years before the time in Rapture so folks looking for a big connection to the other Bioshock should stop. Folks worried about needing to play all the Bioshocks before don't have too as you can jump into this one without missing a beat.

[b]THE COMBAT[/b] is pretty similar to the first Bioshock. You consume plasmids instead of inject them and they're all old timey sounding like ""Shock Jockey"" or ""Bucking Bronco."" This again, fits the theme as the 1910s was such a transition age of wild west adventures and the mechanical war that would soon take over the globe. You can see that in how the weapons are laid out. You have your sniper rifle, shot gun, and machine guns, but they're all either held together with tape or look like prototypes of better guns. When playing the game, your ability to mix and match your guns to your plasmids is what makes this game fun. Upgrading your favorites makes you more effective at combat and even the weaker plasmids become competent enough to handle most situations so long as your playstyle fits it. 

Added to this Bioshock is the use of rails to traverse battlefields and find caches. There's a lot to like here, but the game doesn't utilize it enough for it to really feel more than a gimmick. There's just not enough railings to feel like you absolutely need it to explore. Sure there are some hard to reach areas that you can grab with them and you do get some combat bonuses when you jump from them, but it ultimately just isn't as prevalent as I'd like. This isn't a huge complaint because you don't really notice this unless you play this game 19 something times like I have. But the rail system feels like something that would work well in an open world version of this game but it just feels a bit restricted in this more linear version. 

Finally, there's Elizabeth. This game is one giant escort mission. DON'T WALK AWAY YET! It's not a babysitting escort mission like in Resident Evil or in any James Bond mission or what not. Elizabeth is wonderful. They set out to make a good AI companion and they succeeded. She can handle herself and will throw you weapons, coins, potions, whatever. It's great to not have to worry about her but to see her as an asset instead. She's also incredibly charming and witty, but I'll save that for the character section.

[b]THE STORY[/b] is where this game starts to get wiggy and great. It's a simple prompt: Save the girl, wipe away your debt. You play Booker DeWitt, a very 1910s American private investigator who through immense debt, has been hired to get this girl. This takes a turn as you find out just how corrupt Colombia is and how crazed some of its devoted citizens are to it. No spoilers, but in this game you deal with a egotistical leader with a God complex, a race war where no one is the good guy by the end, time shenanigans, and your own demons that threatens your very mission. It's a great trip. 

Now... the ending. I feel like a lot of people just don't get it. It's a fantastic ending and it requires a bit of thought and knowledge of how paradoxes work in time traveling. Throughout this game there's this theme ""Will the circle be unbroken."" That's kind of your clue to latch onto and start looking at things in a different way. This is a game that you might have to play more than once to see how it all fits. Does that make the ending good? I thought so and still do today. But it isn't a perfectly executed ending because you start to getting into the weeds of relativity, and space and time parallel universe shenanigans. Which is just a complex topic that takes more than a 30 minute ending to help explain without having [i]some[/i] base for or some clue to how this would end like that. Just bear with it and enjoy the ride.

[b]THE CHARACTERS[/b] are the star of the show for most people. The team of Booker and Elizabeth is fun, challenging, dramatic, worrying, encouraging, and adorable at times. Voiced by Troy Baker and Courtnee Draper, this is a duo you will fall in love with immediately. Booker being the straight man that just wants to get this job over with and will do literally whatever he has to to get it done is a great foil to Elizabeth's naive, wonderlust personality. That doesn't mean they stay that way. Booker softens through the game, mostly thanks to Elizabeth. And Elizabeth learns some hard lessons in this game. Sometimes people who fight so hard to be free, become the very evil they were trying to rid. It's a profound moment that if Elizabeth was any other character or acted by anyone else other than Courtnee would have been lost or watered down. This game doesn't pull punches with it's main protagonists. 

Now, the other characters are a different story. You have four other big characters: Comstock, Daisy Fitzroy, Jeremiah Fink, and the duo twins: Robert and Rosalind Lutece. In terms of Comstock and Fink, they just don't get enough screen time. They get some good rumors and voxophones, but until their climaxes, you don't face them directly often. Daisy on the other hand, has such a unique arc. It's controversial though, but I thin it's one of those cautionary tales of how to far you'll go to achieve your goals and freedom. The Lutece twins steal the show for me. Every scene they're in is hilarious and thought provoking. 

[b]VERDICT[/b] I give this game a 9/10 easily. It's one of my favorites and is just such a joy to play through and explore this world as it tears itself apart. For anyone a fan of the first Bioshock, but want something fresh this is a game to play. For anyone that loves this era in time, you'll feel like you got transported into the Edwardian period. For anyone looking for a good first person shooter with some RPG elements, this is a game to try. And finally, for anyone that likes princesses in towers set in a modern time where maybe the princess is the one doing the saving at the end, this game will be a delight.",1704431679,1704431679,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It would be hard and unfair to describe the game just telling it's perfect in all possible aspects, the game (DLCs are included) is a quintessence of all Bioshock series. Yet I can't say that it's the best as all of Bioshock games are unique in its perfection.

Binfinite is a masterpiece that's for sure. I'm not going to describe common features like top notch graphics etc. I just want to say that the game, if played correctly (no haste, plz), will tear you apart and drain emotionally as the plot is so deep and heart-touching. The game has perfect balance between action and story-telling, yet I would advice to replay it in a while to understand the plot deeply.

It was a long journey for me to Bioshock series, and Binfinite was the pioneer for me, the successful pioneer. Thx [b]Irrational Games[/b], thx [b]Ken Levine[/b], thx to all the devs. It's a pleasure to play games like this: beautiful, story-deep and perfect in everything.

PS. @future players: would you kindly watch the cast till the end?

PPS: ""Clash in the Clouds"" (arcade non-story DLC) is one hell of pain in the ass!!! I ate my shoes until I was able to beat it for all the achievements :)

The colourful airborne city Columbia, the cute and lifelike sidekick Elizabeth, the music, the cinematography, the story… all got me hooked from the start to the end. I wholeheartedly endorse this game.

But, if you are a picky gamer, you might need to be warned that Bioshock Infinite is far from an impeccable masterpiece. As a matter of fact, many elements don't feel right, when I finally have time to ruminate on the gameplay after my breathless journey in Columbia (more details can be found in this well-written review from [url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioshock-infinite-pc-review]Rock Paper Shotgun[/url]):
- The architecture of the city is so majestic, yet its denizens are mostly glassy-eyed automatons, and there are so few things to interact with.
- The game is extremely linear, to the point that it doesn't even have an in-game map, since you barely need one.
- No manual save. The game autosaves at checkpoints, which sometimes are half an hour apart. Hence, this game is not suitable for gamers who cannot play a few hours straight at a time.
- Most characters are too shallow, and their raison d'être remains unclear.
- Bare-bones combat system, which would probably disappoint FPS players.

And some mechanics break immersion:
- Unlike in previous titles of Bioshock, you can only carry two weapons at a time. Ironically, you always carry the ammos for each weapon with you! Luckily, this design is fixed in the DLCs.
- Stories are mainly told by audio logs scattered around the map as collectibles.
- The scavenge system is nonsensical. You find ammos, food, or drink in unlikely places. Occasionally, you might even find a pineapple in a little chocolate box! Not that I do not love pineapple, though.

Other downsides:
- Apparently, some locations only support 30 fps graphics output: every time I go near certain places, the frame rate drops from 60 to 30, and when I stay away from these places the frame rate returns to 60 fps.
- The game has been through some development hell of its studio. As a consequence, many contents have been cut and the released game is much less ambitious than it ought to be, such as showcased in the early trailer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5it-pAYmKY
- Some small bugs have not been fixed after all these years. Even worse, 2K has recently added a 2K launcher and refers to it as a “quality of life update”. How outrageous!

All that being said, playing through Bioshock Infinite is still an amazingly intriguing and smooth journey. It almost feels like an interactive film where the interactive part is you explore the beautiful fictive city Columbia and shoot some guys. Its task system, guiding, and difficulty setting allow casual gamers who just want to enjoy the story to breeze through. Hence, I highly recommend Bioshock Infinite. Just don't expect too much depth from its gameplay or story!

Relation to previous Bioshock titles:
The main game of Bioshock Infinite can be played without previous exposure to Bioshock 1 or 2. The DLC Burial at Sea, however, will bring you back to Rapture, the city in which the stories of Bioshock 1 and 2 take place. To fully grasp the story of Burial at Sea, it is highly recommended to play Bioshock 1 first, especially because Burial at Sea contains major spoilers of the plot of Bioshock 1.",1662822273,1704135008,True,9,1,0.606129229068756104,0,True,False,False

It is a question numerous directors, game designers, etc. have sought and/or are seeking answers. In this piece of art (in the form of a game), Ken Levine tried to answer it with that you cannot just fix what you want to fix, but you have to find its origin and restart from there. Sometimes, this means you will experience a completely different timeline and universe. It is a price you have to pay. When I (Booker) first arrived at sea of doors, I could not wait to kill Comstock once and for all. When Elizabeth asked me, ""Are you sure?"" I was annoyed by her riddles and did not hesitate for a second. But when I replayed this part, looking at Elizabeth's sorrow expression, I suddenly felt powerless, fateful, and dutiful. I stared at her for a moment and still went through the door. There is no other choice I could make. [b]Do not do anything you will regret. And do not regret.[/b]

No wonder [i]Bioshock Infinite[/i] has an excellent plot, since Ken Levine was a playwright.

My first journey through Colombia in Bioshock Infinite was awe-inspiring, captivated by the intricate time-travel narrative. However, a second playthrough revealed some disappointing aspects.

[b][u]Pro:[/u][/b]
+ Colombia is beautifully crafted, showcasing incredible detail and ambiance.
+ The time-travel storyline is exceptionally well done, ranking as one of the best in gaming.
+ Initially, the game felt like a masterpiece, mesmerizing in its storytelling and world-building.

[b][u]Neutral:[/u][/b]
~ Powers that added depth in the first game are less impactful

[b][u]Contra:[/u][/b]
- Limitation to carrying only two weapons, a step back from the freedom in Bioshock 1 & 2.
- Audio logs and looting mechanics feel out of place in the lively setting of Colombia.
- Many shooting sections are dull and overly linear.
- Lack of real exploration opportunities, with a heavy reliance on following quest markers.

Bioshock Infinite's [u]STUNNING[/u] story and world-building are unfortunately coupled with [u]AVERAGE[/u] gameplay.

There were multiple points where I got stuck and had to restart because I simply ran out of ammo and there wasn't a way to get more. After watching some gameplay clips, I stopped playing just before Comstock's House near the end of the game, because I honestly couldn't keep dragging myself along without any desire to keep going.

I played Infinite when it came out and recently decided to play it again after 10 years plus the original Bioshock 1, 2 and all DLC that I never played before. So, this time I had way more context to the game and being 10 years older also helps understanding the story better. Replaying this also made me understand why I loved this game so much back then. It was entirely justified.

The story is smart with some really cool twists that you can figure out and puzzle together before the game tells you directly, but still leaves enough for you to think and put the pieces together afterwards. Listening to all the voice recordings you can find throughout the game (called voxophones) also give additional context and details about what actually happened.

The main gameplay loop feels really good and definitely made me explore a lot more powers (vigors) compared to the powers (plasmids) in the first two games despite there being fewer of them. The gun play feels great (though ADS is a bit awkward but you’re not supposed to use it that much anyways) and has enough variation. The game also forces you to switch weapons due to ammo at a rate that felt well balanced. It made me want to use all types of guns, but maybe that is also because the guns just feel really good.

The atmosphere of the game is definitely different compared to the first two, which were near identical in that regard. It feels fresh, nice and warm and features the type of music I started enjoying thanks to Fallout 4. It’s kind of like Rapture but not at the same time, which is a big theme in the game.

Elizabeth is probably the best companion of any game I’ve ever tried. She is useful, doesn’t take damage and has plenty of reactions and dialog to keep it interesting. It also helps that the voice actors are really good for both Booker and Elizabeth and that they both have a lot of character.

The story DLC is also really good. The first part felt a bit cheap-ish, kind of like Bioshock 2’s DLC but together with part 2 it felt amazing. Really nice to be back in Rapture too.

Infinite is also infinitely buggier compared to the first two games though. I got stuck a lot and had to return to the most recent checkpoint each time. There is also the problem with the FOV which is limited to toilet paper rolls by default. You have to go into the “C:\Users\<Username>\Documents\My Games\BioShock Infinite\XGame\Config\XUserOptions.ini” and change to “MaxUserFOVOffsetPercent” to e.g. 50 for 90 degrees and then turn up the FOV in the game settings to max (the 50 means 50% higher than the default 60 degrees). I would also recommend changing the launch options to avoid the stupid 2K launcher, just follow this guide: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3003566535

- The checkpoint save system is terrible. You either commit to an open-ended gaming session that could last 5-20 minutes, or longer, or take the hit of not saving and having to redo parts of a level.
- There isn't much variety of enemies. It's mostly basic humanoid variations with a handful of more powerful entities.
- The game is largely on rails with enclosed areas and points of no return.
- The combat system can be annoying if you like to use longer range guns due to random, unrealistic dodging from enemies. 
- The gear is unimpressive, it's far too biased to zipline and melee operations. If you prefer using ranged weapons and plasmids over melee, there isn't much to embellish those activities.

I think the gameplay was a considerate step down from the previous one, with no weapon customization, less interesting powers, and other downgrades. I was bored somewhat often.
What could save this game then is the story. And I have to admit, for most people, I think this will be a great aspect of the game. But for me, unfortunately, that wasn't the case. I could see the plot twists from a mile away, and that kinda killed a lot of the suspense and wonder from the game. I won't say much so I don't spoil anyone, but if you have seen stories similar to this one before, you will probably have the same experience as me. 
As for it has going on for it, the new setting is really nice, and definitely welcome after 2 just repeated stuff from 1. But that alone can't save the game for me.
If you've played the previous Bioshock games, you really need to know what you are getting yourself into here.

The combat is fast-paced and fun, offering plenty of vertical mobility and a damn excellent AI companion.

Despite this, I find the characters to be exaggerated cartoon people living in a cartoon world that lacks the dark realism or horror that defined the first two BioShock games. But then, there's the story.

In my personal opinion, BioShock Infinite's story is a travesty, dealing with time travel and alternate dimensions, which are ideas that feel wildly out of place and otherwise overused. The final scene, which explains the whole story as if Hercule Poirot himself was narrating it, is a painful slap in the place which makes no sense, sullies the BioShock name and tries to establish some kind of unwarranted connection to Rapture. Just... no.

My first experience with the Bioshock series and I LOVED IT!
The story is incredible, it made me want to get as many of the Voxophones as possible
some sections felt a bit slow, however I went through the game very leisurely and so that may explain why
The game felt increasingly challenging throughout the game and I felt like normal was perfect for me
The fact that you can only carry 2 weapons does make sense, however it did annoy me slightly due to the vast range of weapons at hand
This game suits many different playstyles as there were many weapons and vigors that I didn't use at all throughout my playthrough
I will certainly play Bioshock 1 and 2 after this!

When I played this when I was 17, I hated the story. Playing this as 26, I love it. Its good satire. I was able to understand most of what was going on, except the part where the girl gains access to infinity. That didnt make much sense. 

Not a perfect game. I feel like a good chunk was filler. I think the thing the impressed me the most was the ai. Between the powers and the floating city, I never seen the ai get confused or break. Honestly its a shame they dont make more of these. I think the biggest issue is I really dont like 2k the company. Super shady. 

I would say the best thing about this game, I never noticed a difficulty spike. Since you have to find heals, the fights tend to be short. I found the camera system a pain and the puzzles in the other ones. 

Overall I would say this is the best one. I think all the games had satire in it but this was the best one for me. Honestly just really good writing. I think this would be a good book. Its impressive they were able to pull off a perfect loop. This game mustve been a huge pain to make. I think it still holds up well against modern games. The only thing that really really annoyed me was the useless upgrade system. 10 percent here, 10 percent there. Really? For a non stop action game, this is very dissapointing. I also dont get the trap system. You never stand still in this game. Traps were pointless unless your a speed runner that knows the spawns.",1702951029,1702951029,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While being completely opposite to the dark, dreary hellscape that was Rapture, Columbia is an utterly gorgeous, utopian steampunk paradise. I could spend hours just walking the streets of Columbia just to appreciate the beautiful neo-colonial aesthetic running on steampunk architecture floating thousands of feet in the sky; it's truly one of the best settings I have experienced in any game in recent memory. I really liked the designs of the wonderous tonics of Columbia known as 'Vigors' in the game. They are similar enough to the 'Plasmids' from Rapture, but are drank by the user instead of injected directly into the bloodstream. Effects range from the ability to conjure fireballs, lift heavy loads, befriend machinery, harness water, and other supernatural capabilities as well as my personal favorite 'Shock Jockey'. The gunplay is thrilling and tense, with all manner of automatic, double barrel, and sharpshooting firepower at Booker Dewitts disposal along with great, visceral melee executions using your trusty Sky-Hook that doubles as a deadly weapon in close quarters and thrilling high-velocity skyrail transportation around Columbia. Elizabeth is a charming and iconic sidekick and is always there to patch you up when you fall, as well as carrying the burden of the ability to harness 'tears' in space/time making her a necessary and tragic case as you come to learn more about yourself and your real purpose in Columbia. BioShock Infinite is a masterpiece in its innovations in gameplay and storytelling, that pushed the entire first-person shooter genre forward into what it is today and is my absolute favorite game in the 'BioShock' trilogy aswell as being one of the best first-person shooters of all time.

It combines a unique atmospheric art style with refreshing FPS mechanics while a mysterious and evil plot plays in the background.

In fact I think the stories ambiguity adds a little something to the mystique of Comstock. Very rarely do we get a FPS with as good of a story as this, and the art style is nothing like you will see executed in any other game still to this day.

BioShock Infinite is an FPS (first person shooter) video game. The game takes place in 1912 in Columbia, a city that flies in the sky. Booker DeWitt, the protagonist of the game, is tasked with rescuing a mysterious girl named Elizabeth, who is being held captive in the city to get out of debt. Booker and Elizabeth struggle together to uncover the city's secrets and escape. The game's graphics, sounds, music and animations are very high quality and impressive. The story of the game tells the character development of Booker and Elizabeth, their relationship and the history of the city. The atmosphere of the game draws you in and you experience an adventure in the sky 😍

## 🌟 Pros of the game

- What I like about the game is that there are many options such as using various weapons, equipment and psychokinetic powers called Vigor, moving quickly on rails called Sky-Line, switching between different worlds, and getting Elizabeth's help. These features make the game action-packed and enjoyable. For example, I can change my weapons and equipment as I wish, attack enemies with powers such as fire, electricity, telekinesis with Vigours, perform acrobatic moves in the air with Sky-Lines, ask Elizabeth to give me things like bullets, health, money, or open space-time coins called Rips, and encounter different events in different worlds. These choices affect the outcome of the game and give me different endings. This makes the game more interesting and varied. 😎
- The game also has a lot of secret and extra content. This content enriches the game and adds new mechanics, levels, characters, and stories. For example, in each chapter I can find hidden Voxophones and listen to them to learn about the history of the city and characters, find hidden Kinetoscopes and watch them to see the culture and propaganda of the city, find hidden Infusions and use them to increase my health, shield or salt. I can also access additional packs with the game's Season Pass, returning to the city of Rapture in the two-part story Burial at Sea, engaging in challenging battles in Clash in the Clouds, and getting extra weapons, gear, and money in Columbia's Finest. This content makes the game more replayable and rewarding. 😊

## Cons of the game

- What I don't like about the game is that sometimes it is too confusing, sometimes it is too hard, and sometimes it is too easy. The fact that the game is too confusing can actually be an advantage, because it makes me think and wonder more about the game. But sometimes I might want the game to be clearer and more understandable. In this case, I might search the internet to better understand the game's story, characters and mechanics, visit the game's wiki page or forums, read interviews or commentaries by the game's creator Ken Levine, or try to find the game's hidden content. The difficulty of the game depends on your skill and preference. The difficulty levels of the game are Easy, Normal, Hard and 1999 Mode. If I find the game too hard, I can lower the difficulty level, if I find it too easy, I can increase the difficulty level. Also, the game's artificial intelligence can sometimes be too smart and sometimes too stupid. This can destabilise the game. Therefore, it is important that I follow the updates of the game and report any bugs. 😕
- Another disadvantage of the game is that it sometimes has technical problems such as freezing, crashing and crashing. These problems can spoil the enjoyment of the game and can be frustrating. The reason for these problems may be that the game requires too many system requirements or the game is not optimised. To resolve these issues, I can lower the game settings, update the game, verify the game files, or reinstall the game. I can also get help or share my problems on the game's support page or forums. 😢

## 🏆 Game Scoring

I will rate the game in five categories: graphics, sound, gameplay, story, and overall. For each category I will choose one of five stars. Here is my rating:

Front and center are dubious game mechanics changes compared to its predecessors, such as regenerating shield and two weapon limit which affect combat in a profound way. But in my opinion the biggest downfall of all is the technical roughness. BioShock Infinite truly does not play well out of the box. Noticeable texture streaming, borderline unusable sensitivity settings, forced aim assist, stuttering, forced post processing effects - these are some of the most obvious nuisances. Take a look at PcGamingWiki article for this game and see for yourself - the list of troubles plaguing this game is downright impressive. And while many of them can be solved one way or another, a prospective player has got to ask oneself if it is worth it at all.

For many it was and it is. Many a player enjoy Infinite's story, atmosphere and twists despite all the technical shortcomings. Whether or not you are a kind of player that looks past the bad to see the good is up to you and only you to decide.

I'm just writing this since I started it 9 months ago and, while better than Bioshock II, it's just way too much of a slog for me to get into. The graphics are astounding, the sky hook mechanic is genuinely some of the most fun I've had playing this franchise, but everything else about it is not very engaging. The story confuses and bores the hell out of me, though maybe that's my fault for taking so long to play this game I forget things. I was enjoying the game for a moment when they started giving you friendly NPCs, something that too my knowledge hasn't been done yet aside from security drones, but then they immediately turn those NPCs against you, and not in any interesting way, it's basically just like fighting the cops again. If this second faction was actually relevant throughout most of the game I'd like it a lot more, especially since it'd add impact to the part where you do fight against them. I think I could best sum it up as a mindless combat gauntlet. Although sky hook fights are fun, Vigors add spice to the combat, and Elizabeth's ability is occasionally interesting, I just feel like it's missing depth past that part, like interesting enemy variety or whatever. And yes I know some enemies have Vigor abilities but I found fighting them never amounted to much more than a tankier common enemy with a single extra gimmick to them. I think the only time I've seen an enemy be interesting is when they electrified the sky hook line, actively changing my play style and making me think about how to fight while they were in the field. Every other enemy though? Eh, just shoot them until they die and right click with appropriate abilities selected, and use the same props that you find in many, many other environments.

This is the game that made me play the final chapter twice to understand what really happened. It will make me want to do a “second wave” to find all the hints the game had given out in the previous chapters and enjoy the storyline again. 

[h1]Pros:[/h1]

Incredible storyline and ending
Great graphics/art design/details
Excellent soundtrack! Especially “Will The Circle Be Unbroken”
1999 mode (spent Silver Eagle wisely, learned that the hard way)
Lots of weapon choices (which might also be a con because finding the matching ammo was hard…)
Although the main game has little connection with BioShock 1 & 2 (I do not own the season pass), the storyline, soundtrack, and gameplay are the best in the series.

Cons:
-Gameplay is repetitive and dull

As someone who sticks around for the gameplay I was disappointed. Typically the player will be walking through a beautiful atmosphere when a wave of enemies that take too long to kill, and do hardly anything charge out. The player uses weak guns against healthy enemies, so the majority of combat time is spent reloading behind cover, or reloading while running away. There are certain interesting mechanics that allow the player to create cover, health packs, and sentries, but they are too weak to be useful. The first enemies encountered are the same enemies fought throughout the game, so after 20 minutes the combat can be almost fully explored.

I truly enjoyed most mechanics in this game. guns felt smooth and effective. the enemies didn't feel like rubber. the game was flowing. of course there are multiple examples as to where game was poorly paced or hid somethings very incompetently but it was rather a good experience. 

you have many weapons and have to switch between them to keep from running out of ammo as in the previous games. that does not change. what does though is you have 2 weapons that you can switch with the arsenal of around 10 in the game only if you find the next weapon on the ground. I loved this decision. the game flows way too slowly in my taste because of the tidious looting, attention requiring lore and all other reasons. this simplification still forces you to switch weapons as you can get ammo for all weapons but only switch weapons themselves. not only that headshotting feels good. mobs move their heads a lot but it is not as stupid as the animations in tomb raider games. 

graphics are not adequate in my opinion but the art design is strong so most of the time, graphics won't effect your immersion in a bad way. I don't understand what type of animations they used but seeing enemies felt harder in larger and darker areas. It is also manageable.

AFTER THIS THERE ARE SPOILERS

we gotta talk about elizabeth. she is our protagonist and has mechanical elemts such as givin you ammo, medkits, salts and even coin while exploring. she is also commentative which is basically a different sort of audio tape in the previous games. though the exception of this method is;, our character is distinguished and filled in. other games  also put lore and value into our main character but it did it in classical gameplay way of: your character never speaks. this approach gave depth to our protagonist and is a welcome change. elizabeth itself is very cute. rawr! leaving alonet the games like witcher 3 which are on their own league: I would say this is one of those games that gives the highest attention to characterization and mimics of characters. the characters you will see constantly all have unique characteristics and mimics that are natural to the enviroment and will flow with the game. 

sooooo the salt abilites were never my favorite thing in the bioshock series. in this game I again used them on occasion, didn't upgrade them, and used what I knew most of the time. I am sure very much a people will enjoy it. It is not bad or something. I don't really enjoy systems with dependable energy sources in loot focused games. 

here we come to the story. I adored this story. I loved the connection it had to bioshock universe. I loved the characters. I loved that it did not have a happy no consequence ending. to quote from alan wake: ""A story is not a machine that does what you tell it. A story is a beast with a life of its own. you can create it, shape it, but as the story grows on, it starts wanting things on its own... the characters have to be true to themselves. the events to follow a logic that fits the story. a single flaw and the magic is gone. the story dies. alice dies."" I can't express the way in which I relate to this quote and this game executes it beautifully. the setting is dark and realistic. major flying cities don't mean the princess will be a classical one and if you save the princess all will be same as before. the game actually makes use of this. It purposefully shows you the sequence where you were 6 months late and see new york. while you might not enjoy parallel universes concept. In this game the sequence was both impressive on its own, showed you the consequences, and had justifications for tear powers since the beginning. 

for whatever it does masterfully. there is still a huge problem with pacing especially when you are sent into that city like place which you pass 5 times. It takes away from the immersion... 

the actual story is genious in its weight of the consequences as stated before. infinite name has its weight. world-building is standart with previous games (not to say that it is bad). the story will give you joy, resentment, sadness, I would go further in depth but I really see no point. It uses many an aspect such as time travel, parallel universes theory, and what not and I can see that some people wouldn't enjoy it as much as I would even if they do enjoy it. It is quite relative and even though I wirte reviews satisfy myself. I can't bring myself to explain why I enjoyed it so much.

If you thought the stories for the first two games were average, I have no doubt that you'll find BioShock Infinite's plot completely nonsensical. It even goes as far as to undermine the plots of the original games for absolutely no reason other than fan service. The concepts within are simply an excuse for the writer to write blindfolded and what we end up with is the dramatic equivalent to [spoiler]""and it was all a dream.""[/spoiler] There are also multiple occasions for the player to make [b]binary[/b] choices which have no impact on the plot whatsoever. 

As far as characters go, Booker and Elizabeth range from bland to melodramatic but they are not insufferable, as they have their endearing albeit forced moments occasionally. The worst part is that, because of the plot, every major character is also a [spoiler]non-character [/spoiler] (which is even hilariously referenced in [spoiler]Burial at Sea 2[/spoiler]), including and especially the Lutece twins and Songbird. There are also many instances where NPCs will feign a struggle or state of emergency. Choosing not to press the interact key just leaves them in an endless loop of grunting and moaning. If you don't interact the game will tell you to with an onscreen prompt. The game also tells you that your companion Elizabeth ""can protect herself"" without ever showing how exactly she manages to do that. This game does a lot of telling and little explaining (except when it comes to basic tutorials of course). 

Where BioShock Infinite shines is in its world and visuals. After all, who wouldn't find a flying city from 1912 alluring? Even then the plot partially takes this novelty away from you for NO REASON other than to sound clever. There are also many character animations during cutscenes that look really unpolished and robotic. Despite this, it is indeed at times a very pretty game with very exciting set pieces. 

Combat can be surprisingly enjoyable. The smooth, snappy weapon animations and satisfying visual effects are pleasant to the eye, and I especially appreciate the integration of musical sound effects to communicate successful kills and critical hit kills. As for the vigors, I will say that I appreciate them in lower numbers. The earlier games really bombard you with variety, and even then many of them overlapped their intended applications. However, In BioShock Infinite you aren't really prompted to be pragmatic with your vigors, especially on 1998 mode where enemies become bullet sponges. Instead you'll just end up using your most powerful offensive vigors as opposed to your utility vigors unless you make a mental note of it. 

[b]ISSUES:[/b] 
- Launching a vigor trap occasionally doesn't work. Instead the regular attack will occur even though you held the button. This has happened twice in a row before and uses three times the salts than I intended to consume.
- During Comstock House, pulling a certain lever switch halves your sprint speed and increases zoom sensitivity by tenfold or more. I genuinely do not know if this is an intended fourth wall.
- Crank gun cranks itself while on the sky-rail. 

Despite it's major flaws, BioShock Infinite will still be found largely entertaining to many people.

(Spoiler alert: you can't.) And the sound design is just as impressive. Every gunshot and explosion feels like it is right there in the room with you.

While the first two Bioshock clearly showed you straigth from the beginning that something is seriously wrong in the world you are in, Infinite takes it time to introduce you to a deeply tattered society, full of arrogance and ignorance. 

I can directly tell you that the story, world building and gameplay sadly isn't as good as in Bioshock 1&2. At least in my personal opinion. The guns feel rather weak, even when you have fully upgraded them (this time even without the visual upgrades) and the skyhooks are pretty boring and a nearly unnecessary addition to the gameplay. Playing around with vigors is the most fun part and combining them can be a quite powerful tool in your inventory. The world feels emptier and almost copy&pasted in certain spots, the art style is just not on the same level as its predecessors even though it isn't bad by any means. The developers also decided to go with just one ending this time, which really doesn't fit the narrative of the story that much. There are also two story DLC's that take you back to Rapture, which is a pretty nice thing. Sadly the story is a little bit all over the place and doesn't make that much sense in retrospective.

In my opinion the weakest Bioshock title, nonetheless i still recommend it to fans of the franchise and newcomers likewise. It is a solid game and pretty much worth playing, but definitely wait for it to go on sale and get the collection edition.

BioShock Infinite brings entertainment to another level, I haven't had fun with a game for a long time. That doesn't mean all the others releases are bad but it's been a while since i had so much fun playing a game.

The plot it's one of the best i've seen in my entire gaming life, matching some Visual Novels and books i love (i kinda like a good plot and not the usual mindless action or generic shooting gallery we get most of the time). I don't think you'll find another game with a better quality plot anytime soon.

Graphics aren't realistic but that doesn't mean they are bad, they got kinda a unique style that makes everything beautiful. You could say they are the same as the older games but they certainly improved a lot. However i kinda get annoyed with the excessive ""bloom"" in some scenes, sometimes they are overused to the point of blinding you. Aside from that everything else is beautiful. 

There's the music, honestly it isn't great but it's not bad either, the combat music is the same for the whole game save some specific scenes and it gets repetitive after a while. It's average at best.

The gameplay is what you've already seen in BioShock 1 & 2 with some improvements. You can equip gears that gives you a few improvements like auto-casting lightning when you are struck or put your enemies on fire when you strike them with melee attacks.

There's the new ""Sky-Line"" mechanic that allows you to travel around the place and can even be used in your advantage during combat, your partner Elizabeth even rides with you.

And talking about Elizabeth, that's one hell of a companion. She is like Alyx in Half-Life 2: Episode One but instead of fighting she gives you support during and outside combat like finding and giving you ammo, salt, money and even warning about points of interest and some missable items like lockpicks. I love when i'm almost out of ammo and she throws me some ammo, she also plays a huge role in the plot.

Honestly i haven't cared about my companion in a single-player game since Alyx, she isn't useless like most companions who doesn't do jack aside from yelling at you all the time like 'AIM DOWN YOUR SIGHTS"", "" TAKE POINT"", ""THEY ARE KILLING US DO SOMETHING!!!"". 

PC port is above average, there isn't much graphics options but at least the game runs great, without vsync the game always run above 60fps (sometimes going up to 90fps) with everything maxed out and the game has some pretty graphics.

It took me around 13 hours to beat the game.

Somehow I don't have a lot to say now that I've completed the experience. But I will do my best to say as much as I can. 

The gameplay of Bioshock Infinite is its biggest strength. The game is incredibly fun to play. Almost every weapon feels unique and fun to use. There are a few that are pretty lame, the burst gun being my least favorite out of all of them. Otherwise they all feel natural to use and none completely outshine the others, although there are a couple that are really special. The new shield felt pretty dumb to have. Honestly, it didn't feel super necessary beyond allowing you to take a few extra hits before taking normal damage. It only really shines in harder difficulties or towards the end of the game.

The outfits are a hit or miss thing for me. On one hand you get encouragement to play in a bunch of different ways. On the other hand, most of those ways are so niche that you may seldom get benefit out of them. I found that most outfits didn't offer me benefits that were better than my current outfit. It kind of sucks because many of these are locked behind lock picking doors. So you spend however many lock picks just to get a hat that gives you 50 percent extra melee damage if someone is being affected by the crow vigor. I think these should've been a bit broader in what they do. That's all I have against them. 

The visual design of the game is a huge step up from the previous Bioshock titles. There is a big difference in what is being portrayed between Rapture and Columbia. It's nice to see designs in the series that appear cleaner and more well kept. Falling into ruin later rather than starting out that way. It felt fresh, especially after coming straight from the other two games. I really enjoy the city in the clouds look and how they portrayed it. Like Rapture, I focused more on the beauty of it rather than worry myself about how it works or how it came to be. There is a lot of care put into how everything looks and the evolution over time was something that consistently amazed me. 

Now I'm going to talk about the story and ending. So These next sections will be put in spoilers. An additional spoiler will be in my final thoughts. Look at your own risk if you wish to remain unspoiled. 

[spoiler] The story starts pretty strong. Taking things back in time from the previous Bioshock games, and also placing you in a different setting entirely. The opening is somewhat similar. Out on the ocean heading to a lighthouse, then heading inside to then be brought to a massive hidden city. Booker starts with a simple task, which is to find Elizabeth and then bring her back to whomever hired him. This quickly escalates to avoiding the entirety of Comstock's army and ducking through rifts. Where the rifts actually take you is pretty confusing and it doesn't get made any simpler after the ending. I mean it's not terribly hard to figure out, but the actual bearing it has on the story at the time is incredibly confusing. [/spoiler]

[spoiler] The ending itself is the biggest complaint I have heard about this game. While I'm not confused by it like some, I do agree that it isn't the greatest. I like the idea of everything being linked together. And I especially like how the ending essentially causes the story to never have existed in the first place. What I don't like is how the whole thing was handled. At times it feels like it's attempting to undo the significance of the first  two games by saying, ""It's a different world but things are similar"". Effectively turning the story of Rapture into an unimportant side adventure. It was nice to return to Rapture at the end, but the parallels being turned into a way to explain Infinite's story wasn't my favorite. The actual ending wasn't very confusing like I've heard many say. In the context of its own story it is a fine ending, though it feels rushed. I was expecting this big final battle but it never came. Instead I watched an incredibly long cut scene that tried, but failed to effectively explain itself. I figured out the dual personality of DeWitt and Comstock, but didn't really get why this particular DeWitt was the key to it all. Especially since his life path had already been decided. Killing him wouldn't realistically undo everything that had been done. Even under the game's own rules, this doesn't hold up well. Although I will say that I am limited in my own knowledge so take that with a grain of salts. The explanation of exactly who the Luteces are was lost on me. There is slight implications that they are the same person, but how they ended up that way wasn't explained much at all. I had to research that myself to figure it out. They are the most interesting part of the story other than Elizabeth herself. Yet they do not get the ending they deserve and ulitmately make the whole thing far more complicated than it needs to be. [/spoiler]

As its own thing, Bioshock Infinite isn't bad. I wish it were just that. Its own thing not tied to the Bioshock name, or at least not tied back to the other two games. [spoiler] Flowing into them rather than writing them off. [/spoiler] I recommend this game even with my criticisms. It's fun and the story it tells is interesting. I believe this game is one of those final series titles that got more flack than it deserved. After all of these years, it still holds up well. It lacks here and there, but makes up for those things in other departments. The additional content is pretty meh though. It doesn't really have a good to make up for it. At least not one that isn't the game that it ships along with. 

Check it out if it's on sale. I got it in a bundle with the other two games which is honestly the best way to get it in my opinion.",1700103603,1700103603,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now lemme clarify that NO, I do NOT have a problem with Bioshock being political. It's literally always been political. I also don't have a problem with it exploring certain topics, such as, in this specific case, racism. I DO, however, take issue with the portrayal of both sides of racism (racists vs minorities) as somehow equal, like an ""everyone is right AND wrong and they're just as bad as each other!!"" Like... no?????? The game tries so hard to convince you that the Vox Populi (allegory for self-freeing fugitive slaves) are just as bad as the Founders (allegory for slave owners) because of the chaos they cause. This is an insane take that they clearly knew wouldn't work, because they felt the need to insert a scene in which Populi leader Daisy Fitzroy just kinda... kills a child? Like why??? You can't just say ""oh, so you think fighting racism is bad? Well what if you did a CHILD MURDER?! Checkmate libs!!!"" and it really really really really really doesn't work.

Many years after release, they decided to release an ""update"" claiming to offer ""quality of life improvements."" It was just a bald-faced lie to wedge their shitty launcher between the players and the game they already paid for. They basically used an ""old"" game as a trojan for an advertising campaign. And that's a haunting thought. One that I fear has only just begun to haunt us.

Wide variety of guns allows you to decide yourself this time how you want to approach combat, though a lot of guns don't really distinguish themselves enough to be useful, [spoiler]e.g. most of the Vox weapons.[/spoiler] But overall a very refreshing experience. Cool story, satisfying combat, fun new mechanics.

[spoiler] Especially the addition of the Skyhook makes combat significantly more dynamic. Very satisfying jumping around, riding rails, and dropkicking enemies into the void. Run n' gun kind of playstyle actually practical here.
Heavy hitting enemies are balanced way better as well, feels like you have viable counter options and more control during the fight once you figure out the mechanics. Instead of just spam dumping half your armory into a Big Daddy and still having to panic run for your life, classic BioShock 1 experience.[/spoiler]

Solid DLCs too which expand on the story, especially Burial at Sea - Episode Two did a good job of switching things up with its stealth focused approach. Even enjoyed the challenge mode again, always makes me appreciate the combat depth in BioShock games more. Has you faced with every facet of combat possibilities, and forces you to get the hang of your entire repertoire of plasmids and weapons.

One of the best stories in a video game, worth making tv series or movies about it. Action is everywhere, you are gaming non-stop, no unnecessary cutscenes or anything that will stop the flow of the game. As for its gameplay, it has smooth controls and its a classic shooter game, but with salt powered magical skills, literally. I liked its gameplay, however, it wouldn't hurt to have some more enemy variety, and most salt skills were just a different elemental version of the other skills so, maybe some variety on that too. Music and osts are just top notch.

I really loved the idea that we have a companion to help us through the story and during gameplay. It helps to interconnect the story, action, and the gameplay all in one place, building the immersion of its world. I love Elizabeth's ""here take these coins"" or ""here I found medkit"" types of aids she gives, without them the game would have been difficult and wouldn't have the charming vibes it gives.

[b]Bioshock Infinite[/b]
Like the previous Bioshock games, its strongest point is atmosphere, though a very different one. This game is beautiful, all lights and greenery and clean buildings and nice people... and yet something feels off. Something feels very very wrong.
You explore several different environments and the more you progress, the stranger and crazier and darker it becomes.
The story was as satisfying and coherent as can be given the subject. Unlike previous games it's harder to understand the plot twist before it arrives, but when it does you reexamine everything and it all makes sense, so it was still very satisfying. You understand how all you are told fits together.

Gameplay-wise, combat is more dynamic than in the previous games, but has much less flexibility. You are limited to only two weapons at any given time, and you do not have any in reserve. If you want to change weapons you have to loot another one, and you never know where you're going to find what. Powers have more utility and less DPS potential, but there are still great options for combat. (Sadly, zap+bonk is no longer a viable combo...) You also loot random equipment that may not complement how you play, so there's a bit of luck involved. (But those you can keep and swap as needed.)

[b]Burial at Sea[/b]
The DLC was amazing. I loved it. That must be said before my main criticism, which is : it contradicts some fundamental explanations that were given in the base game. And that really, REALLY rubs me the wrong way, because I can't quite consider it canon. But it was SO GOOD.
[list]
[*]First : you play in Rapture. And despite my playing all the games back to  back, it still felt very nostalgic to go back there. (Btw, warning : do yourself a favour and do not play this DLC if you haven't played the first Bioshock.) It is set during Rapture's glory days so it feels like the base game : it's all lights and fun until you dig a little and realise how crazy the city really is.
[*]Second : the gameplay is very different from the base game. There are next to no way of killing enemies, you have to hide and sneak and disable. It's a refreshing change, and poses very different challenges.
[*]Finally, there are lots of relevations and story developments and plot twists, that all feel very good to learn, especially if you've played the first Bioshock.
[/list]

To conclude : it definitely feels like a Bioshock game despite the different setting so fans of the franchise can absolutely enjoy it.

The Bioshock series have some of the best stories in gaming and Infinite does not disappoint. The vigors/plasmids along with the gun combat are extremely satisfying as well. 

If you wanna do an achievement run just beware City In the Clouds DLC. While I was able to get all of its ribbons (which are rewarded by completing challenges every wave in the wave based game mechanic) within 8 hours I have heard of people taking triple that time to do so. The other DLC content Burial at Sea Episodes 1 & 2 have super easy and quick to get achievements. The second hardest achievement will be in the base game 1999 mode which my only suggestion is to not spend all your money and keep about 500 on hand in case of deaths OR if you wanna cheese it just close the game in task manager before it can save. As for the hardest achievement to get all the ribbons in CITC, I suggest you run through all maps to get all vigors and clothes to make rerunning maps for specific challenges easier.

Hard to recommend at least because narrative style is changed comparing to Bioshock 1 and 2 and plot is too ""overthought"" and with that your perception of the game will change.
Obviously, If you haven't played Bioshock games before, then skip Infinite and go for 1 and 2 and then decide if you want to know more about its universe.

Real con is that game was ""crafted"" specifically for consoles and mechanics were dumbed down: you carry only 2 weapons and maps have become almost linear. 
Difficulty is still ""two gear diarrhea"": either enemies are okayish, or either they're bullet sponges so you probably want to play Normal difficulty because Hard and, ofcourse, 1999 are real pain. They're not challenging, they're just lazy: increased enemy damage and health, less ammo.

======================================
Сложно рекомендовать, если честно. Но все же порекомендую только потому что это канон (тем не менее, сомнительный вклад в лор вселенной) и вы, возможно, играли в первые две части. Сложно рекомендовать, потому что способ повествования изменился по сравнению с 1 и 2 частями и сюжет слишком надуманный, из-за чего восприятие игры другое.
Очевидно, что если вы не играли в игры серии, то не трогайте Infinite и попробуйте 1 и 2 части и после этого решите для себя, хотите ли вы что-то узнать о вселенной еще.

Суровый минус за то, что игра была запилена с конкретным прицелом на консоли и механика была упрощена: ты носишь одновременно только два ствола и карты стали откровенно линейными.
Сложность по-прежнему ""два режима блевотины"": либо враги средненькие, либо же их хрен убьешь и тратишь кучу снаряги на каждого. Поэтому вы, скорее всего, захотите сыграть на средней сложности, ибо Высокая сложно и уж тем более, режим 1999, это для тех у кого много свободного времени. Они не вносят реальной сложности в плане гибкости подхода, а в них тупо лениво накинули врагам здоровья и урона.

Steam support is useless for non-Valve games. The play button runs the 2K store launcher now, not the game itself. Shame on Valve for betraying their paying customers. :-(

EDIT: found a simple workaround online: if you're having the same problem, just run the game binary directly from disc instead of going through Steam. On Windows it's located here, but on other OSs should be similar:

<library>\steamapps\common\BioShock Infinite\Binaries\Win32\BioShockInfinite.exe

The game will still try to connect with 2K servers sometimes, though, but at least you can play it...

EDIT 2: To substantially reduce the time wasted by the game contacting 2K servers, I ran Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security and created a new firewall Outbound Rule to block all connections from Bioshock Infinite to the internet.

Also, in case I try to run the game from its Steam page by mistake, to prevent the launcher from even opening, I changed the security permissions on binary:

<library>\steamapps\common\BioShock Infinite\2KLauncher\LauncherPatcher.exe

for the Users group to ""Deny"" on the ""Read & execute"" and ""Read"" permissions.
No more 2K for me.

EDIT 3: Unfortunately, since an update on October 2023, if the game files are not up-to-date / cached, the 2K store always deploys, and I have to start the game from there. The only thing, for me, that actually improves the user experience starting the game (short of installing a cracked version, that is) is managing firewall rules that block outbound connections for executables both in the game directory (<library>\steamapps\common\BioShock Infinite)  and in the Take Two launcher dir (inside C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local). After some googleing, I made a script that updates the firewall rules for all executables, recursively, in those dirs when I want to play. This way, at least, both the store and the game always start in offline mode. Let’s see how long this lasts before EDIT 4.",1662227399,1698514311,False,13,0,0.517853021621704102,0,True,False,False

Gameplay is a mix of intense gunfights and tactical challenges, with a variety of weapons and powers at your disposal. The companion character, Elizabeth, adds a new dimension to the game, as she assists you in combat and plays a crucial role in the story.

[b]BioShock Infinite[/b] takes players out of the underwater city of Rapture and into the floating city of Columbia. In this game, you step into the shoes of Booker DeWitt, a man on a mission to pay off his debt by rescuing the enigmatic Elizabeth from Columbia's clutches. [b]BioShock Infinite[/b] offers a fresh setting, taking to the skies instead of the depths of the ocean, and boasts stunning graphics that can rival those of contemporary gaming. It provides a new experience while still retaining the essence of the previous games in the series.

In terms of storytelling, BioShock has always been known for its gripping and imaginative narrative with a hint of mystery and surprise at the end. This tradition continues in [b]BioShock Infinite[/b]. As Booker DeWitt embarks on his journey to escort Elizabeth and unravel the city's mysteries, things aren't always as they seem. The game initially presents a comprehensible story, but as you gain the ability to manipulate tears in the fabric of time and space, the narrative becomes more intricate and at times, bewildering.

The combat system in [b]BioShock Infinite[/b] sees some improvements over its predecessors. Booker can open rifts in space and time, allowing him to summon weapons or turrets seemingly out of thin air. This addition adds a strategic element to combat that was less prominent in the previous games. Columbia's skylines are also available for Booker to ride like roller coasters while engaging enemies. This dynamic use of the environment creates a more fluid and action-packed combat experience. Plasmids, which were featured in the earlier BioShock games, make a return as Vigors in [b]BioShock Infinite[/b], offering a fresh set of abilities to wield. Overall, the combat in [b]BioShock Infinite[/b] is may feels more enjoyable compared to BioShock 1 and 2 for some.

The stunning and varied scenery of the floating city of Columbia provides a fresh and immersive experience compared to the Rapture setting, which players had explored in the previous games. With grand architectural structures, beautiful skies, and hidden dangers lurking behind every corner, Columbia stands as one of the game's most outstanding elements. More importantly, the cityscape and the game's narrative are perfectly intertwined, enhancing immersion. While the downloadable content (DLC) for [b]BioShock Infinite[/b] takes players back to Rapture, it still manages to make sense within the overarching storyline.

Despite its many positive aspects, [b]BioShock Infinite[/b] does suffer from certain downgrades compared to its predecessors. The combat system has been simplified in some ways, with limitations on the number of weapons you can carry, making it more challenging to change strategies mid-combat. Additionally, you cannot hack machines and turrets as you could in the previous games. These changes were probably intentional and aimed at creating a fresh and distinct gameplay experience compared to the previous titles in the series.

The story, while initially captivating, feels somewhat weaker, especially in its final moments. Without delving into spoilers, it's safe to say that the story is engaging for a while but may leave players feels lackluster and stupid by the end. However, the DLC story is well worth experiencing.

Despite carrying the BioShock name and sharing some connections to the series, [b]BioShock Infinite[/b] is better classified as a spin-off rather than a main entry in the series. It deviates significantly from the first two games, providing a unique experience that some players may find better or worse than its predecessors. Overall, [b]BioShock Infinite[/b] offers enjoyable gameplay and an intriguing story set in the BioShock universe, making it accessible and enjoyable for a wide range of players.

[h1] The Main Game [/h1]
Now Bioshock Infinite is a massive step up, in a whole new setting. We are no longer under water, now were in the sky on in floating islands travelling between them on airships and rail lines. I cannot stress enough how beautiful this game is with its art direction, much like the previous games before, but despite the massive change in scenery it still feels like Bioshock. The combat feels smoother, you have a AI partner that isn't a complete moron and actually helps you in combat, giving you ammo, health and salts. As well as opening tears to other realities to get more help in combat. The story is great to, with a well done twist at the end, much like the protagonist being a sleeper agent in the first game. The combat has been stripped down a bit though, now you can only get 2 weapons instead of a Doomguy arsenal in your back pocket. There also seems to be a lack of different weapons to use, the late game weapons are just a different version of the weapons you get at the beginning just instead of blue they're red.   

[h1] DLC'S [/h1] 
If your interested in the DLC's get them both or just episode 2, epesode 1 is only about an hour long and doesn't really add much. But episode 2 is much more integral and ties neatly back into the original game and being at least 3X longer. You play as Elizabeth but instead of running around shooting everyone its much more stealth focused with a silent crossbow and a stealth take-down. Now it is still first person and FPS stealth is always gunna be a bit questionable but its fine. Granted you can sort of just run past everyone in most cases and be fine as the enemy AI is too slow to cause any real damage to you.

From the moment I delved into its mesmerizing world, I felt an unparalleled emotional connection that left me breathless. To assert that video games cannot be considered a form of art is to overlook the profound impact of this BioShock installment.

This extraordinary game elevates the very essence of entertainment to unparalleled heights. While I won't discredit other releases, it has been a considerable span of time since I've experienced such unadulterated joy while playing a video game.

The plot woven into BioShock Infinite is a magnum opus, rivaling the intricate narratives found in cherished visual novels and literature. It caters to those who appreciate a compelling storyline, offering a refreshing departure from the mindless action and generic shooting experiences that dominate the gaming landscape. Finding another game with a plot of this caliber seems improbable.

The game's graphics may not lean towards realism, but they boast a unique style that radiates beauty. While reminiscent of its predecessors, significant improvements in visual quality are evident. The only minor quibble is the overuse of ""bloom"" effects in some scenes, occasionally overwhelming the player. Nevertheless, BioShock Infinite's aesthetics remain breathtaking.

The music, a true gem in its own right, elevates the game to even greater heights. The soundtrack includes unforgettable compositions that illuminate the grandeur of Columbia and the story. The melodies seamlessly intertwine, with the standout 'Lighter Than Air' leaving an indelible mark. It effortlessly conveys the initial idyllic impression of the floating city while subtly hinting at its underlying enigma. The music in this game ranks among the best in the industry.

Gameplay in BioShock Infinite builds upon the foundations laid by its predecessors, BioShock 1 and 2, incorporating meaningful improvements. The introduction of gear that offers various enhancements, such as automatic lightning casting when struck or the ability to set enemies ablaze with melee attacks, adds depth to the experience.

The game's crowning innovation, the ""Sky-Line"" mechanic, transforms the way you traverse the environment, providing an exhilarating dimension to combat. Partnered with Elizabeth, you're in for a treat. She's not your run-of-the-mill companion who engages in combat. Instead, she offers invaluable support during and outside of battles, locating and providing essential resources like ammo, salt, money, and offering vital insights into points of interest and hidden items like lockpicks. Elizabeth's role in the plot is pivotal, making her one of the most engaging companions I've encountered in a single-player game.

Speaking of companions, Elizabeth stands in stark contrast to the usual, often infuriating companions who incessantly bark orders. Her usefulness is a breath of fresh air, seamlessly integrated into the gameplay and narrative.

The PC port of BioShock Infinite is a cut above the rest. While the graphics options may not be the most extensive, the game's impeccable performance, even without V-Sync, consistently delivers frame rates exceeding 60fps, often reaching an impressive 90fps with all settings maxed out. This game is an aesthetic triumph.

In conclusion, BioShock Infinite stands as a pinnacle of gaming artistry, a transformative experience that reaches unparalleled emotional depths. Its engrossing plot, stunning aesthetics, and remarkable music intertwine seamlessly with captivating gameplay and a genuinely supportive companion. If you seek a transcendent gaming experience, look no further than BioShock Infinite.",1697998482,1697998482,True,3,0,0.487612605094909668,2,True,False,False

BioShock Infinite is a breathtaking and mind-bending experience that soars above the clouds and touches the heart. With 9.3 hours spent exploring the floating city of Columbia, it's clear that this game is a masterpiece of narrative-driven gaming.

The setting of BioShock Infinite is a stark departure from the underwater world of Rapture. You find yourself in the ethereal and seemingly utopian city of Columbia, suspended high in the skies. The city is a breathtaking spectacle, a testament to the game's artistry and imagination. Its beauty is juxtaposed with underlying darkness, and the narrative is a rollercoaster of tension, intrigue, and emotion.

The narrative is the true star of BioShock Infinite. As Booker DeWitt, you are tasked with finding and rescuing a mysterious girl named Elizabeth from the clutches of Columbia's enigmatic leader, Comstock. The story weaves a complex and emotionally charged tale, delving into themes of fate, free will, and the consequences of one's actions. The character development of Booker and Elizabeth is exceptional, creating a genuine connection between the player and the game's world.

Gameplay in BioShock Infinite retains the series' signature mix of first-person shooting and supernatural abilities, known as Vigors. The combat is fast-paced and exhilarating, with an array of weapons and Vigors that allow for diverse approaches to confrontations. The introduction of the Skyline, a system that allows you to traverse the city on rails, adds a unique and thrilling dimension to battles.

Elizabeth, your companion throughout the game, is a revelation in AI design. Her presence is not merely decorative; she actively participates in combat, offers assistance, and even interacts with the environment. This AI innovation makes her one of the most memorable and endearing video game characters in recent memory.

Columbia is a living, breathing world filled with vibrant characters, engaging side stories, and thought-provoking commentary on American exceptionalism and religious fanaticism. The city's audio design, from the haunting music to the lively street chatter, is a masterclass in creating a living, immersive world.

The 9.3 hours you've spent in BioShock Infinite may have only scratched the surface of the narrative and the complex world it presents. The story's twists and turns, coupled with a stunning conclusion, ensure that this game remains in your thoughts long after the credits roll.

In conclusion, BioShock Infinite is an exceptional work of art in the gaming world. Its narrative depth, memorable characters, and emotionally charged story make it a landmark title. With the beauty of Columbia, the complexity of its characters, and the thought-provoking themes, BioShock Infinite is an unforgettable journey through the skies and an essential play for anyone who appreciates narrative-driven gaming. It's a transcendent experience that proves the power of storytelling in video games.",1697695867,1697695867,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Don't let my Steam hours deceive you: I've also played this game on the PlayStation 3 for over 100 hours easily. To say that it's a great bit of fun is a definite understatement; BioShock Infinite is profoundly unique in its setting and remarkable in its fusion of gameplay mechanics with storytelling, as well as the development of its characters and ability to make the player care about them very soon after meeting them.

Columbia is a place full of genuinely unforgettable experiences: the entrance to the city through the rocket and the walk through the church to the tune of ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken"" (that actually brought me to tears the first time playing, no lie); the beautiful first look at the city proper, and the dynamic world you've entered playing out in front of you, including the little conversations you can listen to and other small yet notable interactions, to the fairground, to the flight across the city using the brilliant Sky-Lines. The introduction to Elizabeth was perfect, especially the section on the beach as she danced to ""Rory O'More / Saddle the Pony,"" and watching her interact with her surroundings and develop her character, which she had enough of to fill multiple games of this caliber, was an experience simply unmatched by any other game I've ever played. I have to praise the tastefully anachronistic music you can listen to, mostly including old-timey renditions of mid-to-late 20th century classics that provide such charm that they alone can pull and immerse you in the BioShock Infinite Universe. I'll never forget ""The Bonnie Blue Flag"" playing as sniper rounds [i]psssh[/i]ed past my head, or ""God Only Knows,"" Good Night Irene,"" and ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" as I walked around with Elizabeth and observed Columbia's horrifically racist past, bottled up and presented as a presence of American glory and strength, or ""Fortunate Son"" and ""The Girl They Call Fitzroy"" as the (based) Vox Populi's communist revolution sounded off all around the industrial areas and sweatshops of Columbia's working-class underbelly. I also want to mention the two small bits of music found in ""tears"" (miniaturized sections of non-local reality which can be bent by Elizabeth for a variety of purposes, such as aiding in combat or worldbuilding), ""Fortunate Son"" and ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun,"" both of which were, though a minor detail, just cool to listen to. I'll never forget the post-revolution aftermath, strolling through Columbia's remains and finding bodies and possessions in the streets, the bloody consequence of capitalist exploitation and oppression of working men and women. I'll always remember the Comstock House, the atmosphere of which was...well, it's hard to describe, but I found it both horrific and wondrous, as an alternate future played out in front of me in all its glory as you face weird and unnerving enemies unseen in any other section of Columbia.

Booker and Elizabeth are easily two of my all-time favorite characters I've encountered in any of the games I've ever played; it's extremely difficult not to enjoy their interactions and growth as the game progresses. Booker is a hardened, bitter and cold former Pinkerton agent, experienced in breaking workers' strikes and forcing Native Americans off their land, and as a result, comes across as little more than a jagoff antagonist, but by the end of the game, [spoiler]I was devastated at his death, technically by his own hand[/spoiler]. Booker is a dynamic character, and his change from grim taskmaster to genuinely empathetic is helped mostly by Elizabeth, the girl he is sent to Columbia to rescue in order to clear a debt. Elizabeth is a gem; gorgeous, knowledgeable, fun, funny, creative, curious and, most importantly, [i]positive[/i]. She is a master class in how to make a companion for an escort mission that will make a player [i]want[/i] to escort them, to hang around them and watch them learn and grow from their experiences with the world. Elizabeth comments on facets of Columbia she knows about, on its history and her understanding of it, and speaks with Columbia's citizens on some occasions, even giving a poor young boy an apple and singing ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken"" while Booker plays the guiter. This was just one of many striking moments that just took me out of the real world and into BioShock Infinite, one that I still remember. She and Booker made this game for me, and with other characters such as the manipulative reactionary Zachary Comstock, the badass revolutionary Daisy Fitzroy, the opportunistic and greedy Albert Fink, and the mysterious and eccentric Lutece twins, all of them solidified Infinite as a gaming experience I will never forget.

Is it for absolutely everyone? Not necessarily. Is it 100% perfect? Well...depends on who you ask, I guess. Is it damn close? [i]YES.[/i] I loved playing it for the first time back in 2015 and I love playing it now, for what it's worth.

Review is after completing the main game and the Burial at Sea DLCs. Did not play the Clash in the Clouds DLC as I have no interest in challenge gauntlets. In the past I have played BioShock 1 and Bioshock 2, so I was already familiar with gameplay, plasmids system and the lore.
[hr][/hr]


[b]Story[/b]
This game also has a story twist that all bioshock games are famous for. I found that twist satisfactory and astonishing enough. Nothing will come close to the mind blowing twist of Bioshock 1, but Bioshock Infinite's story was fascinating in its own right. There are two main characters in the game, Booker and Elizabeth supported by a multitude of side characters including the main villain. The game uses audio and video logs to expand on the story and I was able to find most of them while exploring. The setting of the game; in the sky as opposed to the bottom of the sea, is a welcome change of scenery. The game also depicts racism, inequality and the fight against this oppression. The Burial at Sea DLC story appears to be only for fans of the series as it takes players back to a past version of Rapture. The story in the DLC doesn’t gel together so well but it showcases an intriguing ending while also revealing how the story of Rapture connects to the story of Columbia.


[b]Gameplay[/b]
The game plays very similar to the previous Bioshock games. The main difference is provided by Elizabeth, as she has powers that can alter the shape of reality. Using these powers in addition to the vigors and the variety of interesting weapons the game provides produces excellent gameplay. It used to be that only enemy splicers had the ability to traverse vertically in the Bioshock games. This game now adds an element of verticality using the air-hook allowing Booker to get the drop on enemies frequently. There is an expanded enemy variety here, e.g. handyman mini-bosses and patriot robots. Elizabeth is a living companion that doesn’t get in the way and instead supports Booker in a multitude of ways e.g. tossing money, ammo and health during battles. The Burial at Sea DLCs introduced relaxed weapon restrictions and some engaging stealth gameplay. The set pieces are not as expansive as the main game but they were satisfactory to play in nevertheless.
However, the 2 weapon limit was annoying. It would have been great if we had access to the entire arsenal of weapons on demand, perhaps by using Elizabeth’s powers to store them somewhere. Therefore, the recommended weapons are a rifle and a selected heavy weapon of your choice. I found myself easing into one style of play: using a particular pair of weapons and a particular set of vigors and tonics. Therefore, this is a game that requires a 2nd playthrough to experience some other combinations. In such a manner, the game has strong replay value. It would have been great to have some puzzles to solve using the various vigors we don't use in combat. The game is also linear in its storytelling and does not have impactful choices.


[b]Graphics[/b]
The game offered a gorgeously colorful world; the sky setting of Columbia is the perfect setting for this game. An excellent choice by the game's creators! Another one of those games that I screenshot the most. 


[b]Controls[/b]
Played using mouse and keyboard on PC and the game handled mostly quite smoothly. The gunplay and use of vigors felt smooth and responsive.


[b]Side Missions[/b]
There are a few side missions in this game. But they are not very story rich as the main game but they do award some combat upgrades such as gear for Booker.


[b]Music/Soundtrack/Voice[/b]
There is one point in the game that has a wonderful singing quartet but that is an isolated and singular instance. The game has a decent soundtrack made of piano pieces but it wasn’t too noteworthy. The combat sound queues are on point. The voice acting of Booker and Elizabeth are brilliantly done. The side characters and the main villain also have excellent voice acting.


[b]Performance[/b]
Experienced no crashes and the game was not too hard on my PC (which is a mid-range PC). It did not cause undue heating of the CPU and GPU.


There’s always a man, there’s always a city and there’s always a lighthouse.

I feel it is a proper downgrade from Bioshock 1 & 2, and mostly comes off as a parody of the first game.

On top of all this, the protagonist is no longer you; it's some guy named Booker who won't stop talking and flaunting remarks. Ditching the silent protagonist feels icky in a Bioshock game.

This game is an exceptional piece of storytelling and gameplay that, despite a few minor hiccups, left me thoroughly entertained and captivated.

One of the standout aspects of Bioshock Infinite is its gripping narrative. From the moment I stepped into Columbia, I was immersed in a world filled with complex characters, political intrigue, and mind-bending plot twists. The story was a rollercoaster of emotions and left me questioning my own understanding of the game's reality. The unexpected ending, in particular, completely blew my mind and left me pondering its implications long after the credits rolled. Few games manage to deliver such a thought-provoking and emotionally charged story, and Bioshock Infinite excels in this regard.

The gameplay was equally enjoyable. The combination of gunplay, vigors, and the Skylines made for dynamic and thrilling combat encounters. The ability to manipulate the environment using vigors added an extra layer of strategy to battles, making each encounter feel unique and engaging. The Skylines, on the other hand, allowed for exhilarating aerial combat and traversal, adding a new dimension to the gameplay.

However, no game is without its flaws, and Bioshock Infinite had a few. My main gripe with the game was the presence of some annoying bugs. Occasionally, I found myself stuck in the environment or facing weird glitches that disrupted my immersion. Even worse, there were two instances of broken cutscenes that forced me to restart the game to progress. These issues, while not game-breaking, were frustrating and detracted from the otherwise smooth experience.

Despite these minor setbacks, Bioshock Infinite is a solid game that I would wholeheartedly recommend to any gamer. Its compelling story, stunning visuals, and engaging gameplay overshadow the occasional technical issues. It's a testament to the power of storytelling in video games and an experience that will stay with me for a long time.",1696890735,1696890735,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b][i] Этот шедевр с первых минут игры привлекает к себе и геймплеем, и красотами мира, и странным сюжетом.
А когда встречаешь Элизабет, то понимаешь, что это лучший персонаж. Она живая, всегда старается поговорить, что-то узнать или рассказать, всегда придет на помощь и подкинет очередные патроны/энергетик/монету. В нее невозможно не влюбиться!
Сюжет приводит к концовке, которая будоражит разум и приходиться проходить игру вновь, чтобы понять все. И вот, когда прошел и понял весь смысл, в голове возникает желание понять всю суть этого мира. Этой вселенной. Насколько она запутанная, пугающая и прекрасная. В голове появляются мысли: ""А что?"", ""А если правда..."".

-Girl is too perfect, physically and emotionally, while very incoherent.
-Loot tooltips can get overwhelming. Good for lore, but I'd mostly spam F around corpses and boxes for bulk ammo / health.
-Dramatic cutscenes kinda childish but that's pretty much in every big game nowadays
-Equipment complicated for nothing : lots of weapons, gear and abilities, but most of the time, I just do with whatever I find. While abilities can help, they aren't any game-changing, so quite forgettable, same for structures from other dimensions which were spoiling fights on top of that ; I basically used thunder a couple times but that's it. Also too lazy to make my gear build.
-On the other side, combat is very basic, and there's not really much more to it than taking cover.
-Melee particles take a lot of attention. When I first spammed it on rocket launchers, I didn't even realize my health was quickly going down as well.
-When dying, the player gets revived and enemies are healed a bit, which basically means you can bruteforce any fight without paying attention to staying healthy ; while it's great for people who want to focus on the story, I was playing on ""normal, if you're used to FPS"". And no, I'm not a crybaby (uh, depends on the game). I know dying to a fight is frustrating, but also more rewarding once I finally clear it.

It is hard to describe what I liked in this game. Next to the story I did like the gameplay of the original Bioshock. The gameplay in Bioshock Infinite (BI) feels like a rip-off of this original gameplay... and as such I do not really appreciate it here. What the BI tries to add to the gameplay with Elizabeth's abilities is mostly useless to me and simply makes the game a bit more convoluted.
Same goes for the weapons. The fact that you can only carry two is probably supposed to add to a sort of realism, but only in a pseudo way. I find it a bit annoying. And with the limited amount of amunition, it becomes a just-take-what-weapon-is-lying-around kind of thing. And there is a huge number of different weapons and often two very similar versions of one and you can barely tell which one you carry at a time. But all this makes it pointless to be able to upgrade weapons. After all you cannot upgrade all weapons as much as you would like to, but you also cannot upgrade a few weapons as much as you like, cause you will not be able to mostly use these weapons, because you always have to use what is lying around and amunition is there for.
And when I said that BI feels like a Bioshock rip-off regarding gameplay, it is even more the case regarding the story. The story of the male and female protagonists feel like a cliche and I do not care for their story, it bores me and I feel no connection to those empty shells of people. The characters feel as believable as ""Multiverse of Madness"" in contrast to proper characters in ""Guardians 3"". The original Bioshock being based on the works of Ayn Rand, the story of BI is a western-steampunk-bad Scifi mess, and the twists and turns of the story are not all predictable, but feel like the twists and turns of any soap opera and pulp fiction.

""A really dumbed-down Bioshock game"" is not enough to describe it
Watching those amazing E3 trailers and making-of videos made me so hyped to play this game and now I am regretting even purchasing it

Let's start with the fact how developers decided to kill a fresh First Person Shooter idea that was Bioshock 1 and 2 just to make another generic Halo clone for quick buck without any sort of effort
Why? Because a player is too dumb in their eyes to play a good first person shooter



>false advertisement because none of promises, E3 footage, Songbird, script, ideas or scenes such as horse resurrection are in the game and player is way too dumb to even remember that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_lN_7DsFIw

>constantly losing a control over your character because a player is too dumb to play a video game without cinematic experience

>""press this button to progress"" every few minutes of gameplay, cutscenes and conversations because a player is too dumb to pay attention otherwise

>in game choices doesn't matter because a player is too dumb to understand them

>stealth and diversion no longer an option because a player is too dumb to plan a tactic

>dull gameplay based around hidding behind covers and enemies with ton of health because a player is too dumb to enjoy a straight rail rollercoaster that takes less than 12 hours to finish

>regenerating shield because a player is too dumb to use healthpacks

>checkpoints every 5 minutes because a player is too dumb to have some sort of challenge

>tons of copy pasted generic guns because a player is too dumb to use something other than another pistol, shotgun or machine gun

>2 gun limitation because a player is too dumb to use multiple guns

>very small amount of maximimum ammo because a player is too dumb to use a gun that he want for a longer time

>upgrading multiple weapons makes no sense because a player is too dumb to use more than 2 guns at once

>4 out of 8 powers are just the same stun because a player is too dumb to understand more unique powers

>slow reloading and spongy enemies barely twitch after being shot because a player is too dumb to understand what a good gunplay means 

>no different ammo types because a player is too dumb to switch between them

>only 2 enemies in game use ""powers"" that are advertised all over the city because a player is too dumb to complain about world consistency

>laughable variety of enemies because a player is too dumb to fight something different than a human with a gun

>limited customization of passive upgrades because a player is too dumb to have freedom

>no side content, no crafting and camera research because a player is too dumb to do anything other than shooting enemies and watch cutscenes

>open area and map are replaced with tight corridors, worthless exploration and simple navigation arrow because a player is too dumb to find secrets on their own

>hacking removed because a player is too dumb for minigames 

>Elizabeth is invisible to enemies in the world where everybody wants to capture her because a player is too dumb to protect this moving magical dispenser

>existence of magic in the religious world runned by a insane zealot who is ok with giving such power to his fallowers and fighting ghosts with bullets because a player is too dumb to complain about McGuffins and illogical lore

>cliche and boring story filled with plot holes, meaningless choices, a message about racism that goes literally nowhere with ending so bad that creates a time paradox because a player is too dumb to spot inconsistency with script, ending and understand the basic concept of grandfather paradox



In exchange for what? 

Garbage gameplay? Comically paper thin characters? Lazy writing?
Badly designed nonsensical city build of corridors, dead ends and lifeless mannequins that tend to magically disappear the moment you look away?

An empty, unrealistic and dull invincible Disney princess that gives infinite resources for free, revives on spot and gives players no reason to care about her for a whole game?

Terrible incomplete story that is saying ""racism and religious fanaticism bad"" while being politically correct with racism being heavy sanitized and avoiding any sensitive topics such as punishing black slaves and using N-word but it quickly drops WHOLE subject to focus on taking over the entire world with army that cannot even kill Booker DeWitt to later focus on dull Elizabeth and even more dull multiverse idea?

Why incomplete?
Because to see true ending you need to buy very bad, tone deaf DLC's that feel like fanservice fanfiction made by 9 year fan and their existence RETCONS not only ENTIRE STORY and garbage ending of Infinite but ALSO entire story of Bioshock 1 and 2

Even game setting doesn't even make any sense
Rapture's downfall was tied to plasmids and they was integrated into the story, lore and enemies
Columbia existence is nonsensical, runs on pure magic and vigors exist there just for Booker and only him to use them

Bioshock 1 and 2 gave us gameplay affected by both player choices and moral choices with multiple endings
Infinite gave us a lesson that your choices means nothing and there is just one, sh*tty ending
So bad actually that it makes the story completely falls apart

I enjoyed Bioshock 1 and 2 for being a unique games in a sea of dull shooters on the market and because of all those gameplay and world differences - I really despise Infinite

Same with Duke Nukem Forever and Dead Rising 4 - dumbed down sequel because devs think that we are too dumb for unique and fun games

So why this game is even called ""Bioshock"" when it barely anything to do with Bioshock gameplay?
 
Oh, I know why - it was way cheaper to make a sequel to critically acclaimed games than making a new IP
""Easy money from blind fans"" as devs and publishers say
Thats why this garbage still have ""mostly positive"" reviews and people praise DLC's

At least devs could make this into a co-op game
Imagine that - Booker and Elizabeth, each with own skills, guns and paths making game worth of playing on both sides to see everything
Elizabeth could use her tear powers to collect items or give them to Booker when Booker have his own gimmicks but no - that would be too good and unique idea for this game

But that would require way too much testing and we had to rush this game into stores before the end of first quarter of fiscal year (26.03.2013)
Thats why we made another generic shooter instead - they are cheaper and faster to make than well crafted, detailed games with fresh, original ideas

Definitely my worst game of 2013
A huge disappointment after all that years of hyping up product by greedy corporations

I expected a step forward from a sequel to Bioshock 2, not 100 steps backwards perfectly showing-off that there is no place for innovations in First Person Shooter genre

I did want to play a Bioshock game that was promised to me by E3, all those trailers and interviews. Heck, I did want just to play another Bioshock game

Instead I got another heavy scripted Modern Military Shooter

Is this wrong that I expected a Bioshock game to have more Bioshock in it?
Unfortunate I got way less of it

And then we have all those people praising games such as this as a masterpiece because it send a message to devs and publishers that gamers want more dull and lazy shooters every year that insults players intelligence instead of good crafted shooters that respect players skill, time and IQ

I would talk more about this game issues but I cannot due word limit on reviews so I am gonna provide links to few amazing videos so would you kindly watch those

[b] The Good [/b]
Bioshock 1 + 2 has been a love of mine for a long time however I was never able to complete infinite, it felt like something was missing... I was 100% wrong as this game in my opinion is the best in the series in terms of story. Even the DLC tie into the games in a beautiful way and puts the story of Elizabeth and Booker to rest in a very lovely way that makes you want to revisit the original games with a new point of view.  Overall gameplay was very fun and the story was much better than I anticipated.

[b] The Bad [/b]
The achievements were fun however the last ~15 were the awful clash in the clouds DLC which almost left me raging often due to the massive RNG with some of the blue ribbon challenges. For example the enemies would sometimes just jump off the map and die and void any ""kill with ____"" challenges... very stupid. To top it off if you fail the challenge you have to restart the entire level, you can't just restart one part.  The skyhook was sometimes buggy for me at times such as forcing my camera forward which was very annoying at times.

Yeah, I confess: my first taste of Columbia wasn't through a legit copy. But from the moment Booker and Elizabeth soared across the city in the clouds, the game left an indelible mark on me. If someone ever invents a gadget to wipe selective memories, this game’s the reason I'd buy it. Just to re-experience the magic, fresh and untarnished.

Infinite's a work of art. Not just in graphics or mechanics — though it shines there too — but in its narrative prowess. It weaves a tale so intricate, yet personal. It's about choice, consequence, and redemption. And while Rapture, the setting of the earlier games, was captivating in its underwater eeriness, Columbia stole my heart with its sunlit facades hiding dark secrets.

It's rare for me to look back with such affection for a game, so to make amends for my earlier piracy, I recently bought the entire Bioshock franchise. A nod to the devs for crafting worlds I could lose myself in. Just finished reliving the horror and beauty of Bioshock 1, now gearing up for the depths of Rapture again in Bioshock 2.

Bioshock Infinite, though, it stands on a pedestal of its own. It's a testament to games as more than just entertainment. They're experiences, memories, and sometimes, they're moments we wish we could live all over again.

8870,146812344,76561198836871096,0,16,1203,0,1203,1695324837,"Personal words about the game: After the second game of the series, my interest in the Bioshock series increased, and the fact that the game has managed to stand the test of time and still offers contemporary visuals has given me hope. Especially the presence of a black haired, blue eyed girl who will accompany you throughout the game was quite delightful.

There is something to tell about the story: The concept of a guardian figure protecting a girl, a recurring theme throughout the series, is also present in this game. The stories in the previous games of the series were quite good, but the story and concepts in this game are much better and more comprehensive than the others. The story begins with two person we can not quite see on a boat sending us somewhere to find a girl. It looks familiar. However, we then enter a new gaming world with a very nice presentation. Our main goal is to rescue the princess trapped in the tower from a terrifying monster. Wait a minute, this is suspicious. Perhaps the main theme seems simple, but the constant diversification of the story and its unrelenting pace are very commendable. A dictator brainwashing the minds of people, minorities arming themselves for freedom, poors, and a woman traveling between parallel universes by our side. I believe these themes are well executed, but the linear progression of the game prevents a detailed exploration of these topics. I will not delve into these topics, especially the concept of parallel universes. I will leave those for you to discover on your own.

Retinal Pleasure or Art: Look, this game was released in 2013, but thanks to its design and lighting, it offers visuals that can easily rival today's games. I especially loved the outfits they chose for Elizabeth. Why did people stop wearing such stylish clothes? When you look closely at the textures, you can tell it is a bit dated, but the game itself has a mesmerizing presentation. I do not take many screenshots, but I took a ton in this game. You are in a city flying in the sky, and the buildings are amazing. You can even install mods for this, I did, and it was a visual feast for my eyes. Oh, and do not forget, you will also see the city of Rapture in the game.

Mechanics:  I am going to split this part into two and provide my comments accordingly.

1- In terms of the classic jumping, running, melee combat, and stealth aspects, there is not much to tell. When it comes to weapon variety, the series has always excelled in this regard, but this time, there were not any of the unique, power-fantasy-inducing weapons found in the previous two games. In short, there were more realistic weapons, but the variety was lacking. Additionally, you can only carry two weapons at a time, which I did not like. The Hand Cannon and Sniper Rifle were my favorites. Always aim for the head. Apart from that, the game introduces a new travel system called the Sky-Line. It allows for constant platform switching during combat and provides opportunities for tactical retreats, which is quite effective.

2- Unlike the other games in the series, this time, the special powers are called Vigors, not Plasmids. Essentially, they serve the same purpose but with some differences. For instance, there are abilities like charming, summoning crows, canceling gravity, and catching bullets mid-air to throw them back. You should see and experience these for yourself. Additionally, the rifts called Tears enhance the tactical depth of the battles.

Nomismata: I will divide the DLC section into three parts.

1- The first DLC. It was dull, with challenges similar to clearing waves and following the rules, as seen in the previous games of the series.

2- The second DLC. You start as Booker in the game, and you are in Rapture. The design of Rapture and the new Elizabeth were marvelous. There is not much mechanical diversity, but the first part sets the stage for the second part, so you complete it without getting bored of the DLC. It also has a beautiful ending.

3- The third DLC. This is where we finally get what we've been waiting for. New weapons, new powers, and the chance to play as Elizabeth. What more could you ask for? The second DLC was a setup for the third DLC, and this time, it comes with a longer gameplay duration, diversity, and story updates. Especially the ending of the DLC was excellent. To avoid spoilers, I will not say much, just play it.

Atto Finale: In summary, the game is fantastic. You will not get bored playing it. Especially after finishing the main game, be sure to dive into the DLCs; they are also excellent. The only downside I would mention is the storytelling style. Perhaps they could have used a different approach to make the story more easily understandable. In particular, ladies and gentlemen, please consider returning to the old-fashioned way of dressing. Elizabeth's outfits are superb.",1695419412,1695419412,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Combat and Story are the things that I love and hate at the same time.
Vigors are super interesting and are rly fun to use, but when in combat... you usually use guns since it's faster and more efficient.
The Story is fantastic, but it basically underlines the entire point of having infinite worlds. So no matter what you do, there is always going to be a universe where Comstock prevails or where Booker never loses his child. But the game only uses this when the plot needs it. Which is a shame since the game still looks graphically beautiful, but undeniably an underwhelming game from Irrational Games.

My biggest issue with the game is that nothing about it screams Bioshock. The developers have done away with Bioshock's clever story writing entirely- writing that's renown for being subverted by suspenseful horror on an almost cinematic level. This game has ONE jump scare, and worse yet does nothing to build tension. It is hard to compare Infinite to the first two games because it is nothing like them. 

Following from this point, the developers answer most our questions with mind-numbing exposition, something granted that happened in the first game. Infinite however, takes this to a whole new level. Without spoiling the story; Elizabeth might as well be the story narrator, she chirps away constantly about what's happening and even tells you what's going to happen next otherwise the story would make no narrative sense. If you made her silent, nothing would make any sense, this is bad storytelling. 

With regards to storytelling yet again, the game (unlike Bioshock 2) gives the player no free-will and treats the player like a toddler; spending hours chasing Elisabeth around, fixing her mistakes and being forced into traps and 'plot twists' without any control or say in the matter. You also cannot influence the ending, despite being given choices throughout the game so all and all nothing you do matters- it is inconsequential to the story. Which is a massive downgrade from Bioshock 2. 

[spoiler]The red-herring that kills the story, Cornelius Slate (the veteran the player fights for Shock Jockey), supposedly serves with your character Booker before Booker becomes Comstock. Which naturally throws the player off the main story. It is later revealed that the player version of Booker spent his life waiting for Anna/Elizabeth after giving her up. So the players version of Booker is a separate Booker to the one that served with Cornelius, as is the one who served with the Vox Populi. Which leads me to believe Songbird is a version of Booker. The ending also makes out that there are infinite Elizabeths and Bookers. So we have moved beyond just time-travel and are now in multiverses.  

The infinite Booker and Infinite Elizabeth arc only works if neither can influence time, which the ending reveals is not the case, as Comstock goes back to get the child. So infinite Elizabeths can go back and stop Booker from forfeiting the child. Therefor Comstock never exists and therefor Comstock can never exists. Unless for some reason [something] infinite is stopping infinite Elizabeths, which is never the case. So, why does Elizabeth kill Booker? It never occurs to her that she can travel back in time? even after seeing infinite timelines? Maybe she can't control her ability to timetravel? But if that's the case how does older Elizabeth send us back in time?

This game has been set up to feature multiple endings, it should have had multiple endings. There was so much filler content here, the developers could have easily cut out small snippets in favour of different endings. Especially after Bioshock 2. The developers have produced a game that made out as if the player had free-will and then simply taken it away. A story with infinite possibilities and the player is forced to play one of the worse possible endings. It is such a wasted opportunity. [/spoiler]


To add salt in the wound, the combat has been completely tailored to conform with the looter shooter trend that was common at the time. Slow, methodical and heavy combat has been replaced with fast-paced gunplay and Plasmids warped to match- the murder of crows ability was just down right bizarre. The plasmids have also lost their utility and are functionally no different from weapons now. This was all terribly upsetting, and burnt me out fairly quick. I will however admit that I enjoyed the skyhook and thought it was masterfully well designed. This however, is Bioshock, not Justcause or Assassin's Creed. I don't understand what prompted this design decision, beyond 'we want a fast-paced looter shooter, and why not make it a Bioshock game?'

That's my review turned rant, I really wanted to enjoy this game but am so awfully disappointed. I will give the DLC a try tonight and see if that changes my opinion somewhat.

If you mind, I have a few tips before you get your hands on this masterpiece of a game: 

1. If you can, play BioShock 1 first. Even though the gameplay has aged terribly, it will take you ""only"" about 10 hours, has a great story of its own and will drastically increase your enjoyment of this game (especially the DLCs). BioShock 2 doesn't have much to do with this game storywise, but is still a solid experience if you want to immerse yourself in the world some more.

2. PAY ATTENTION to the world around you. There are countless little scraps of foreshadowing and allusions to the game itself and other BioShocks scattered all over Infinite and its DLCs. The game and its DLCs aren't terribly long to begin with, so take the time to play a little more critically and inquisitively than you usually would.

BioShock Infinite, developed by Irrational Games and published by 2K Games, is a tour de force in the world of video games. Released in 2013, it quickly became one of the most critically acclaimed and beloved titles of its generation. Building upon the success of the original BioShock series, Infinite takes players on a mind-bending journey through the floating city of Columbia, where political ideologies, quantum physics, and morally ambiguous characters collide. In this review, we'll delve deep into the various aspects that make BioShock Infinite a true masterpiece.

Setting and Atmosphere:
Columbia, a floating city suspended in the sky, serves as the game's backdrop. From the moment you step foot in this marvel of art-deco architecture, you're immediately captivated by its beauty and eerie tranquility. The city's bright, sunlit streets and sweeping vistas juxtaposed with the underlying tension of racial and social inequality create a unique and immersive atmosphere. The attention to detail in Columbia's design is nothing short of astounding, with each district telling its own story through environmental storytelling.

Storytelling:
At the heart of BioShock Infinite is its riveting narrative. Players assume the role of Booker DeWitt, a grizzled former Pinkerton agent tasked with rescuing Elizabeth, a mysterious woman with supernatural powers, from her captivity in Columbia. As the story unfolds, layers upon layers of complexity are revealed, including themes of alternate realities, determinism, and the consequences of one's choices. The game's story is a testament to the power of interactive storytelling in video games, leaving players questioning their own choices and moral judgments long after the credits roll.

Characters:
BioShock Infinite boasts a cast of memorable and morally ambiguous characters. Booker DeWitt is a complex protagonist, haunted by his past and faced with impossible decisions. Elizabeth is a standout character, her childlike innocence contrasting sharply with her remarkable powers. The villainous Comstock, the enigmatic Lutece twins, and the rebel leader Daisy Fitzroy all contribute to a rich and dynamic cast. The relationships between these characters evolve throughout the game, adding depth to the overall narrative.

Gameplay:
While BioShock Infinite is primarily a first-person shooter, it offers a range of gameplay elements to keep things fresh and engaging. Booker wields a variety of weapons and can harness Elizabeth's abilities to manipulate the environment, summon supplies, and open tears in reality. The skyline system, allowing players to zip around the city on rollercoaster-like tracks, adds an exhilarating and unique element to combat. The mix of gunplay, powers, and environmental traversal makes for a diverse and enjoyable gameplay experience.

Visuals and Art Direction:
Visually, BioShock Infinite is a masterpiece. The game's art direction, characterized by its vibrant colors and intricate design, is nothing short of breathtaking. From the sprawling, cloud-shrouded skylines to the ornate interiors of Columbia's buildings, every aspect of the game's visual presentation is a work of art. The character design is equally impressive, with distinctive outfits and facial expressions that convey a wealth of emotion.

Soundtrack and Audio Design:
The game's soundtrack, composed by Garry Schyman, is hauntingly beautiful and perfectly complements the atmosphere of Columbia. From the stirring choral pieces to the eerie renditions of familiar songs, the music enhances the emotional impact of the story. The voice acting is top-notch, with Troy Baker's performance as Booker and Courtnee Draper's portrayal of Elizabeth standing out as particularly exceptional.

There's a reason why Bioshock Infinite won numerous awards:  the graphics and fluid game play; the ability to upgrade weapons and attributes; the depth of the characters, their backstories and the voice acting...it's all so 'fleshed out' that you'll not only feel that you're a part of everything that's going on in Columbia but that you're also a part of each character's life, characters that you'll likely never forget until the end of your days.  The Burial At Seal episodes are a great touch as well and further the plot that unfolds in the main game, with the second and final part being so epic that it feels like a game unto itself.  

All of the Bioshock games are phenomenal achievements, not just as far as games go, but also as works of art; games that let you know the developers feel as strongly about their product as all of us gamers do. Bioshock Infinite though....is truly a masterwork that must be experienced.

P.S. Try it on 1999 mode while not using vending machines.  It's extremely challenging but to a fault - you won't regret the journey if you make it to the end in one piece :]",1452473071,1693855680,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've just wrapped up Bioshock Infinite, a game I delved into two years later than the rest of the world. Honestly, it wasn't even on my radar, but a friend insisted it was something special. So, with a shrug, I decided to give it a whirl, and boy, am I glad I did. This game is an absolute gem, and that ending... wow.

Intriguingly, I ended up purchasing the season pass and blitzed through it all in a single day! I had initially pegged this as just another run-of-the-mill action shooter, but Bioshock Infinite surprised me on so many levels. It's not just a game; it's an enthralling narrative experience.

Now that I've reached the end, a peculiar emptiness has settled in. The last time I felt like this was after finishing The Witcher 3, and that says a lot. Although Bioshock Infinite might not boast the same vastness in terms of content, its 20 hours were enough for me to form deep connections with the characters and become utterly engrossed in its intricate lore.

To be honest, I find myself yearning to erase my memory so I can relive the journey once more. It's a melancholic feeling, knowing that it's all over, and that void it leaves is hard to shake off. Bioshock Infinite, you've left an indelible mark on me, and I'm profoundly grateful for the experience.

In conclusion, this game was a late discovery for me, but it's an unforgettable one. It's more than just entertainment; it's a captivating narrative that lingers in your thoughts long after the credits roll. I'm a little sad it's all over, but the memories will stay with me forever.",1470921924,1693807817,True,4,0,0.548192799091339111,0,True,False,False
8870,20863357,76561198050049656,0,261,2024,0,2024,1693760086,"I think these days Bioshock Infinite has even more value than it did when it first came out back in 2013, what with all it's multiverse shenanigans and timeline-hopping. It's actually kinda impressive how ahead of its time it was with this trend. I mean this game was a huge deal back in the day and blew my mind because it was my first time seeing the multiverse in action. I remember finishing this game for the first time and being like ""That was the best game I've ever played in my life!"". Granted I was 13 at the time haha. This game was a cornerstone of gaming for me back in the day, yet I haven't touched it in a number of years so here I am in 2023 giving it a replay to see how it holds up.

The WORLD in this game, oh my god it's still crazy cool to me. This giant floating city in the sky that's run by an ultra-patriotic American society is so unique and there's not much that rivals it in the gaming space in my opinion. The game takes place in 1912 and has a cool mix of stuff from that era and more futuristic blended together. You'll be running around using old wooden carbines and rifles surrounded by tech that really shouldn't exist at that time, it works surprisingly well. 

The game is gorgeous and full of detail in general, and the way the story is presented and the way characters are written makes it feel like a Disney movie. A good Disney movie like Tangled, I mean. (modern Disney just ain't it but that's besides the point) and a lot of that comes from Elizabeth who is just a fantastic character whenever she's on screen and works really well with Booker, the protagonist. I think Infinite definitely has the best characters in the series by far.

The gameplay is where Infinite gets a lot of flack these days. Not that it's bad but it's a far cry from the old Bioshock games. Levels are very linear, there's no hacking and a lot of the im-sim elements have been dumbed down. And yeah, that stuff is disappointing don't get me wrong. But I do think Bioshock Infinite has enough new stuff going on to make it stand out on its own. If I had to describe the gameplay it would be ""scrappy"". The way the game is designed makes it so you don't stay in one place for too long. There's a 2 weapon limit so you're kinda forced to run and find a new gun once you run out of ammo during a firefight, which you eventually will. There's also a shield that acts like a regular regenerating health bar which I'm mixed on. I feel like the old medkit system worked fine and would work better with the new gameplay style but it's alright. 

As far as bad stuff goes... I mean a lot of it's subjective stuff. Some love the story, some hate it. I feel like that's a universal thing with the multiuverse theme, and that'll be the biggest deciding factor as to whether you like the game or not. If you don't mind multiverse/time travel stories there's a LOT of good stuff here. I would go as far to say it's a masterpiece in terms of what it's going for, but your mileage may vary. Either way, I highly recommend trying it at the very least if you haven't.

It's a game that leaves no room for criticism, achieving a level of excellence that is rare. It's not merely a future classic; it may already be considered a classic in its own right.

On the other hand, I initially anticipated that BioShock Infinite would follow the trend of underwater cities, but once again, the developers showcased their pioneering spirit in the gaming industry. What a magnificent game it turned out to be! It had the power to both put a smile on my face and bring tears to my eyes. If you're a fan of the original BioShock, you absolutely must experience this gem. These creators need to conjure up another masterpiece because they have an uncanny knack for crafting the perfect formula to keep players enthralled for hours on end.

Pros:

- Graphics so good, your eyes will high-five each other.
- A plot that's more twisted than a pretzel on a rollercoaster.
- Combines old-school and new-school game mechanics like peanut butter and jelly (but with more explosions).

Cons:

- The story's more linear than a shopping cart with a wonky wheel.
- It dives into complex topics like a kid into a ball pit – only ankle-deep.
- Save points are rarer than a unicorn at a disco.

It was not worth the wait. Bioshock 1 and 2 are much better games IMO than this and I can see why they have not made any more Bioshock style games since this.

TLDR: Not recommended, 2K launcher sucks, game breaking bugs still in the game 10 years post release.

I only found the story mildly interesting and the combat was pretty good but gets old. I only stuck to using about three vigors for the whole game and did more with guns as the vigor upgrades are ridiculously expensive compared to the weapon upgrades. I completed the campaign on hard mode straight up which then unlocked a harder '1999' difficulty mode which I ignored and instead uninstalled the game.

The things that really turned me off the game were:
1. Losing my sprint all the time from hitting a pebble or invisible object
2. Getting stuck between objects requiring a checkpoint restart to fix (only happened once)
3. Elizabeth the friendly NPC ALWAYS getting in my way blocking doorways
4. Experiencing a game breaking bug where it spawned me under the elevator at the start of the hand of the prophet level. This required me to fiddle with the graphics settings and also replay the entire previous chapter to fix in order to be able to progress the game. This is a known bug yet 10 years after release it is STILL in the game causing problems.
5. In the late game you will be in situations (such as the ghost battle) where you run out of ammo and have to switch to random weapons you find. The problem is at that stage of the game you have the weapons you like that you have upgraded the damage for which do well so when you go to these other random weapons they perform very, very poorly. You go from having a challenge doing reasonable damage to every enemy being a massive bullet sponge because these other weapons have no upgrades and do pathetic damage.
6. The piece of crap 2K game launcher that was added in via a patch after the fact a long time after the game released. 

Things I liked:
1. The OP sniper rifle for popping heads
2. Shooting enemies off of skylines
3. The large number of secret rooms, boosts/upgrades and collectibles.

Not recommended. Play fallout 3/4 or something else instead.

From the moment I stepped into the floating city of Columbia, I was captivated by its breathtaking beauty and intricate design. The blend of historical elements with science fiction creates a unique world that I couldn't help but immerse myself in.

The storyline, filled with twists and turns, had me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire journey. The characters, particularly Booker and Elizabeth, felt real and relatable, making me genuinely care about their fates. The game's ability to explore complex themes while delivering an action-packed adventure is truly remarkable.

The gameplay mechanics, including the use of Vigors and the Sky-Hook, added a layer of excitement that I hadn't experienced before. The combat scenarios were dynamic and engaging, and the ability to traverse Columbia's skyline added a whole new dimension to the gameplay.

The attention to detail in BioShock Infinite is outstanding. The world-building, the music, and the atmosphere all come together to create an unforgettable experience. Whether I was exploring the streets of Columbia or unraveling its mysteries, every moment felt meticulously crafted.

BioShock Infinite's Burial at Sea DLC expanded the story even further, offering a satisfying conclusion to the series. The care that the developers put into creating a cohesive and thought-provoking narrative truly shines through.

In a world where gaming experiences can vary greatly, BioShock Infinite stands as a shining example of storytelling and gameplay excellence.

The worldbuilding is excellent -- Columbia looks beautiful and is a lot of fun to explore; the interactions with Elizabeth, both in and out of combat, are well-designed and immersive; the music does a fantastic job of adapting modern music into pre-war styles (e.g: ragtime, big band, barbershop quartet, etc.); and the combat has some great moments. In addition, as much as the story bothers me, there are some well-written pieces of dialogue -- I particularly like the dialogue between the Lutece twins.

Unfortunately, there is much about this game that irks me. It feels like Bioshock Infinite has a lot of missed potential. I think [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43lZUa69umw]this video[/url] summarizes my thoughts about the game pretty well.

With such a expertly crafted setting and many compelling characters, the game wastes itself on a nonsensical and frankly boring story. The intro and first (maybe second?) act of the game (up until the First Lady Airship) had me hooked, but as I continued playing, the story just kept dragging on and on and became less grounded and focused. In my opinion, the story could only have focused on [i]one[/i] of its main plot-points: [spoiler]The city of Columbia and its connections to white supremacy and American exceptionalism, or the many-worlds interpreation of quantum mechanics and parallel universes[/spoiler]. You can't have both and still maintain a coherent and meaningful story. While I appreciated the more character-driven nature of the second plot, the first could also have been as character-driven. In contrast, Bioshock's narrative had a much more grounded narrative with a twist that didn't throw the story into complete disarray; I see no reason why Infinite could not have done the same.

Perhaps the worst part about the story is that it tries to talk about so much, yet says so little. The original Bioshock had a masterful critique of libertarian capitalism, whereas Infinite only presents a shallow social commentary and shrouds its narrative in dubious science-fiction.

Furthermore, the health and salts system not allowing you to keep medkits and salt canisters proved to be frustrating at times and, even though the two weapon limit encouraged swapping weapons frequently which I liked, it became increasingly more restrictive in later sections of the game. As well, the game's hard mode brought with it a fair amount of bullshittery - especially with regard to enemies such as the Handyman and [spoiler]Lady Comstock's Ghost (whose inclusion doesn't make any fucking sense)[/spoiler]

If you enjoyed the first Bioshock game, it is worth experiencing because it does satisfy that Bioshock itch. But beyond the ""Bioshock"" label and judged solely on what the game offers, I would not recommend it.",1692745246,1692746561,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First paragraph after this is about my impression from the game, second is good points and third is bad and then I’ll tell you if I’d recommend the game for real.

Remember previous games in series? How depressive and weird they are, how Big Daddys are angry you’ve looked at them wrong way or how beautiful city turned to madness (and that’s putting it mildly), all because it was too small for two rich dudes (and one was an idiot)?  Yeah, here we have none of that and for the better. The world is still all kinds of messed up, characters have own, sometimes utterly stupid, motivations and main antagonist is genocidal maniac turned cult leader, but it feels a lot livelier and as if someone actually tried making functional “perfect” society for once… and kind of succeeded. Game feels, plays and looks as something more enjoyable and bigger than sum of its parts. Equally beautiful, depressing and bittersweet. It feels right.

Characters and their interactions (“Booker! Catch!” :) ), most of the story, but most of all this game lets you stop and think. It doesn’t force you to rush through, as fast as possible. Where other games would make you hurry because you have a world to save for some reason, Infinite says “yeah… you’ll get there eventually, for now have a break and explore the fair”. Elizabeth is, as odd as it sounds, one of the characters that you and not only Booker can, and likely, will, like, this is a rarity. Even more rare is that she isn’t deus ex machina nor needs saving at every turn, takes skill to do that.

Now the plot sometimes, or to be precise – half the time, doesn’t make sense. Lets look at you helping Resistance: you go to Fitzroy, get sent to an engineer, then jump realities, do plot-realted stuff, jump again to end up… somewhere that isn’t even your original reality. And that somehow is fine and dandy. Perfectly normal. Apart from minor graphical issues and extra launcher, this is perhaps all I can really say about unlikable parts of this game.

Would I recommend it? Yes, even with the launcher. Pretty nice game, even if it wasn't titled “Bioshock”.",1692490299,1692490299,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've now completed 2 playthroughs of the base game, completed all CitC arenas, played through both dlc chapters, and completed all story content on 1999/1998 mode.

After all of this, I've come to the conclusion while Bioshock Infinite is a good game, I would not say that it is a great one. 

Combat is fun but linear, repetitive & always on a large scale. If you want to run around and blast things, this is a game for you. That said, if you come into this title expecting a stealthy experience akin to previous Bioshock games, you will be disappointed.

The narrative is captivating on a first playthrough, but under closer inspection loses much of its impact.
If you look past its spectacle and begin asking questions, really assessing the game design, you will most likely find it lacking. 

CitC is fun, but the blue ribbon achievement is a ridiculous time sink. 
If you find pleasure in it, all the more power to you.

The DLC chapters resemble previous Bioshock titles far better than the base game. Combat is smaller in scale, ammo is scarce, and stealth is viable. The major fault of the DLC rests with part 2, which despite having fun gameplay, is full of plot holes and leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

Rating --- 8/10 --- Play the base game once and try both CitC and BaS Ep1. Replays and BaS Ep2 really sour the narrative.",1691892261,1691892261,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The beautiful and, in my opinion, unmatched art direction that they went for Columbia, and it's many paralleling technology to Rapture are some of my favorite things about infinite.

The gameplay is fun, the action is satisfying, it looks great, and it's a game that also benefits from [u]not[/u] embracing a more open world approach to its design. The other big plus is the engaging narrative and characters that elevates it from other games in its genre.

That being said... This is also a game that doesn't do its due diligence when it comes to the full implications of some of its story elements and politics. Which is a bit concerning, considering the nature of those very elements. I'm being a bit vague here to avoid spoilers, but just to be clear, the game is definitely saying 'fascism bad', but its focus on its characters both helps and hinders it by sidestepping and brushing over the deeper conversations about how to actually combat fascism for instance.

In any case, I still think it's a memorable game that's worth experiencing even today, even if it's not quite as clever as it would like to think it is, and definitely doesn't stick the landing for me in terms of those pesky political implications.

(And yes, I know that there are famously certain Gamers™ who absolutely abhor any discussion of politics when it comes to video games, because it makes them uncomfortable to think about anything that challenges their status quo, but hey!

First... Visually, it's stunning- some of the most beautiful imagery is to behold during the first few sections of the game where you walk around and explore the world of Columbia. The floating buildings, the early 1900's atmosphere, the music, the lighting, it's all pleasant to the eye. The story leaves me asking questions, but mostly in a positive way, certain aspects not so. The ending is a bit inconclusive, but expected for a complex storyline that explores the concept of timelines. Gameplay? Maybe not the best, but very watered down compared to the first two Bioshock games I've played over and over again. Your'e limited to very few weapons, and the vigors/powerups feel a little less impactful, there's no upgrading either, besides your health pool, shield, and vigor points. Sure, there is gear you can equip, but it feels a bit lacking. Certain parts of the game feel like a pain in the ass, like a part where you battle a ghost woman that summons dead soldiers to fight for her, just feels like a typical damage sponge... and another where you are limited in ammo and have to fight these guys wearing masks. Enemy variety is to be desired, but improves later in the game, with the handymen being introduced and the various vigor/superpower users. There's more I could get into the story in it's issues, but I wouldn't want to spoil anything for readers. There's still certainly good things about this game, exploring each area feels lived in and always has something of note- there's of course the other main character, Elizabeth. She's a great character, feels fleshed out and not annoying really nor does it feel like a drag escorting her throughout the majority of the game. She helps out, can revive you, toss ammo, supplies, you name it- she's helpful. Just an overall super-likeable character, which makes the story have impact even more when you actually can care for a character. This doesn't really feel like a Bioshock game traditionally speaking, but still a nice play altogether. Can't get enough of this game.",1691186818,1691186818,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First off gameplay-wise this game plays alright, it's still a little clunky with certain button placements but it's way easier to hop in and play this than going back to older Bioshocks. The game however is pretty linear, it does open up a little later for one or two zones but really you're going from point A to point B to maybe a puzzle in between.

I do like when the sky hooks get introduced into the combat sections but I can count of my one-hand the amount of times you get to play the game like this. 

What this game does still have however is vibes, Columbia is a fantastic setting and great for just wondering around the empty streets sometimes and whilst maybe Rapture had some of the stronger designs like the Big Daddy just being miles better than the Handyman. Bioshock Infinite does its own thing. 

Guns are on a two weapon limit which is unfortunate and whilst you do technically have every Plasmid, you can only have two of these equipped at a time. 

This applies to the older games but it's a shame Bioshock never solved this issue for me of making it so the game doesn't pause every five seconds due to you having to switch stuff out. 

Then the story...

 The story has so many problems that I can't believe the city can float with this many plotholes. 

- The Booker / Comstock spoiler is silly because they look so different, yes I know there's an explanation but it's silly.

- That exact version of Booker from before the Baptism sacrificing himself seems silly too. This doesn't even stop every version of Comstock so Elizabeth is just incorrect. 

I'm sure there's more but these spring to mind off the bat.

Also the DLC's exist I guess, it's cool to go back to Rapture in Burial at Sea but these DLC's are honestly so bad story wise and damage the first Bioshock to the point that I think most people consider them non-canon.

 I'd love to do another playthrough of this game with the idea in mind that the there just aren't infinite multiverses and see if that fixes a lot of the plot holes. I think it's fair to say though that this game had something crazy like five full games worth of cut content so it's not a surprise the story is cobbled together like this. 

All in all I see why the game was celebrated in 2013, a decade later I can see why it's not.

For what it's worth though I still leave this review as recommended as it's really easy to get this game for under $10.",1690291846,1690913564,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

The art direction of this game is absolutely amazing, the whole beaux-arts/art noveau aesthetics is so unique and beautiful, the mix of early 20th century america and Sci-Fi is so interesting and the fact that it's set in a city in the sky is just something I've never ever seen in other medias before. The art style absolutely carried the game, if this game looked like a realistic 1910s american city that just happens to be in the sky, I would've never cared about this game. 

The story itself had mixed receptions in recent years, but for me personally, I absolutely love it. What makes the story a bit problematic is entirely on the way the game potrayed the Vox Populi, which is a revolutionary and anarchist militant, the way they made the Vox Populi as an antagonist is just a shallow attempt of the typical centrist ""both sides are bad"" rhetoric. The game framed Vox Populi ""as bad"" as Comstock which is the leader of a theocratic, ultra-nationalist, white supremacist society that is Columbia, while the Vox Populi is just a group that rebelled against this said society that oppressed them, making them the second antagonist is just so obviously forced and makes no sense. Other than this portrayal which was done as a way to criticizes revolutionaries, the game also extensively criticizes, nationalism, religious fanaticism and capitalism. In a way Columbia is used as a satire of the US.

Well, despite the whole Vox Populi thing, I still think this game has an amazing story, arguably one of the best in video games history. I've always been a sucker for multiverse and time travel stories and this game had really done it right. The plot twists at the end was just so mind-blowing that I really have to take a minute to process it all.

And of course it's a game, so I have to talk about the gameplay too. This game is an FPS, while I'm not really a big fan of shooters, I don't really hate them either. This game has a unique spin by giving the player different powers called vigors alongside the guns, which all are very interesting, but for most of the game I've only used two of the vigors. all I can say is that the gameplay is decent, I've played better shooters and I've played worst.

I honestly really loved the art direction and story so much that I'm giving this game a 10/10. I've only played a little bit of BioShock 1, but after finishing this game I'm going to go back and finish both Bioshock 1 and 2.",1690700887,1690702863,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

What I didn't like in Bioshock Infinite? Simply put - story.

Only two guns at once. This is so Liz can hand you ammo.

[b]BioShock Infinite gets a 9.8 / 10.[/b]

It's easier to tell you what detracts .2 points from this game for me:
• I feel there's a lack of combat early on (first 1/3rd) in favour of cinematic depth (adventure, voice lines, scenery, exploration) - I love this, but I [i]do[/i] feel like some extra transitional battles would have been helpful. This quickly resolves itself, of course, once you get into it, but I could see some combat-heavy players being turned off while waiting for fights. (0.1 points.)
• If anything, there is [i]too much[/i] chance to restock; adding into the below, I feel you could have less ammo, salts and health without issue in the world, as with so many options for restocking (finding things, Elizabeth, vending machines and Tears) you rarely need to worry about these.
• Animations are high-quality for the time but look a little clip-y and hand-imated compared to a quality mo-cap and touched-up anim like you might see in Apex or Overwatch. 
• Graphically, BioShock Inifite holds up great, but you can definitely see the lower-res in places. It still kicks ass.
• The Unreal Engine's 6-entity limitation makes it tricky for battles to feel intense, however, is enough to keep fights mostly high quality. If anything, they're usually too short. 
• There might be [i]too many[/i] ways to move and fight - so many guns, so many perks, so many vigors, so many places to go - I feel like I need a battlefield to use them all! This ties into the above point for me. (0.1 points for all above.)

BioShock Infinite is about as close to a perfect game for me as you can get. I cannot gush enough about it: the story is complex enough to be engaging yet explained enough to actually translate to a moron like me. The gameplay balances cinema with storytelling, character and world building with motion and fighting. Gunplay is fun and solid, and much more natural compared to the game's predecessors. Vigors are intriguing and useful and, while there may be a lot of options to play with, if you can decide what challenge you want to go for - ""hmm, maybe I'll go for all explosives wherever I can!"" or ""non-auto guns only!"" - I feel it aids that option, rather than force unwanted choice onto you. 

Audio is great. The music is nearly iconic, and the voice acting is stellar - my only qualm being that I feel Elisabeth sounds a little older than her character's actual age, but that said, I think it adds to her depth as you watch her play out across time. The enemies are solid, not tanky and not pathetically easy. I'd have liked to see more mini-bosses used, but don't think their scarcity detracts from the game. For an 'old-timer' setting, the wide variety of machinery, technology, vehicles and travel options are wonderful and look and sound incredible. 

The runtime is great, long enough to sink teeth into yet not so long as to make me want to just get it done with (I felt this way with H:ZD, for example.) What in other games would feel like the end-game climax, changing your location and really upping the stakes and scale of your gameplay, this game's only a third of the way in, and just keeps climbing. It performs like a flawlessly written three-act movie, and I adore it. 

Of course, the acclaim it received at it's release still applies: Elizabeth is intelligent, involved and alive, really heightening her companionship. Her lack of involvement in combat doesn't detract, especially as a pacifist for the majority of her storyline - but her assistance helps to explain everything from ammo to respawning and her attitude really increases this world's value and attraction. 

Columbia is gorgeous. The story is moving and delivers such a powerful punch as you learn the truth of this world. Your travel, when it could get so confusing, is surprisingly linear and smooth. The worlds and scenery are touching, horrifying, beautiful and marvellous. I even love the overlays; attention to detail is everything, and everything here has been carefully crafted to keep you in the greater world of this 10's-20's steampunk-esque space. 

The DLC, Burial at Sea (Parts 1 & 2) only builds on this. I loved returning to this world, seeing Rapture through Booker's eyes and linking the worlds together. Both stories are moving and intense. I'm not sure I've cried at the end of any other game in my life, but both BioShock Infinite and it's DLC moved me to tears. I adore them. 

BioShock Infinite, depending on the day, may come a close second or even usurp classics like Half-Life or Portal. It is [i]CERTAINLY[/i] alongside them, and if I had a showcase of all-time favourites on my wall, BioShock Infinite might well be in the centre, with pride. It is a 9.8/10 at it's poorest measurement, and I give it a standing ovation well beyond the disappearance of the final word of the credits. You will be hard-pressed to find a better game, and I dare you to try. 
Well done, BioShock Infinite. 

<<< My original review is below. >>>

The game starts off unbecoming and doesn't really give much of itself away, but by the end you realise you just sat through one of the most twisted, incredible, well written and well built games to come out this side of the millenia. It doesn't top the list; perhaps there could have been better attention paid to the fine details, ensuring the player didn't occasionally get stuck or a key wouldn't actually sit inside the lock, but none of these issues are either game breaking, ruining, or just bad craftsmanship. Instead, the visuals, the story, the animation and the audio - that sweet symphony of voices, cues, ambient auras and ship distress alarms - paint a perfectly concocted narrative around you. And while I did find myself somewhat lost, and some nights spending much more time walking about and searching every single visible location for goodies and hidden doors and spamming the F key like a man with Parkinsons', despite the fact that I failed to pick up on the true depth and theme of the story until much to late and left myself somewhat befuddled, and, despite dropping interest in the game early on through my first time playing to play other things with friends, none of that stands a candle to the inferno that this game turned out to be, and each and every one of these faults, if you could call them that, relate to anything other than user error, or simple preference on my part. 

The fact stands, after all has been said and done: this game carries ticks in all the boxes. It's a tight and seamless FPS game, with solid gunplay and challenging enemies, intriguing bad-ass weaponry and the opportunity for upgrades for your favourite ones. Vigors are fun, stunning, and even more bad-ass than the guns, and in combination turn you into a M'F'ing warrior dashing around and snapping necks faster than a team of Genjis. The story is fantstic, less linear and predictable than DOOM for me, a point that was one of my more meh points about that game, and it is held aloft by the audio and video the game provides, a veritable candy-store of beautiful models, shining worlds and crisp details. Elizabeth is beautiful - the Vox are animalistic - Comstock is fatherly, and eveyone else fits in to the cast like a brilliantly cast play. As I said above, and reitorate here; any faults this game has are far, far outshone by it's wildly successful strengths.

If you have not played this, I cannot more highly reccomend you do. It is well, well worth the price, and is, being older now, priced much better than other AAA titles you may be considering - perhaps DOOM, as an example - would be. 

So until you delve into the world of Booker DeWitt, I leave you with this;
Will you bring us the girl, and wipe away the debt?

[u]What makes this game so great:[/u]
- the shooting is so smooth and satisfying 
- the fighting is so dynamic with the skylines
- a great story (especially with the DLCs ""Burial at Sea 1&2"")
- the game drops you so many hints towards the plottwists and secrets of the story that you almost feel stupid, when they are finally revealed to you
- the characters have such a great character developement

[u]What the game lacks:[/u]
- if you are expecting a horror shooter similiar to Bioshock 1 and 2 you will be disappointed, the game is very bright and only has a few ""scary"" elements
- the stupid fucking blue ribbons in the ""clash in the clouds"" DLC are so annoying to get that it's not even fun anymore

The word ""Bioshock"" is certainly in the title, and that alone should be enough to generate a certain expectation from the people who have played a Bioshock game before. This is not a franchise like Final Fantasy, where everyone understands that every game has its own different world, characters, and story while sharing many common elements among them all.

When I see the word ""Bioshock"" in the title, I think of Rapture, Andrew Ryan, Jack... even Subject Delta! But what I got with Infinite was something radically different: a city in the sky and a protagonist who can't walk 10 steps without making a comment about his surroundings. It was perfectly fine at first, to be honest, an exciting and mysterious new beginning for the franchise. But as the levels go by, the fact that this game has nothing to do with the world of Bioshock becomes painfully apparent.

The game introduces the player to many familiar gameplay elements, now with different terms such as ""Vigors"" and ""Salts,"" and does not make any effort to properly introduce these new concepts like the original Bioshock did, banking on the fact that fans will recognize them as ""Plasmids"" and ""Eve"" right away. At no point in the story could one make any connection to the world of Rapture. So in the end, we ended up with a Final Fantasy game, where the story and the characters are their own, but many recognizable elements from the previous entry still remain.

Bioshock doesn't have to be solely about Rapture; it's fine, really. In fact, the first game ends in a way that leaves the door open for stories such as the one told in Infinite; going back to Rapture in Bioshock 2 feels forced in comparison. Ah, but then the Burial at Sea DLC comes along and says, ""Actually, this is how everything connects back to Rapture, my friends! Alternate universes! See? Infinite was a part of the Bioshock world all along! The guys behind Plasmids, Vigors and Big Daddies were working together BETWEEN DIMENSIONS!!!"" Well, I mean, sure, but you can't tell me this doesn't sound like some lazy fanfiction slapped together in 10 minutes. I enjoyed both the main game and the DLC stories for what they are, but man, this is such a mess.

The one thing that can't be overlooked is the art direction; the game looks breathtaking almost at all times. Gameplay is a solid 7/10 though. A regular FPS with some Bioshock sprinkled on top.",1688385054,1688385445,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is more linear like Bioshock 2 but some transitions allow you to go backwards to previous areas. Although, it's not always clear which transitions are a one way trip so you end up scavenging the whole area before progressing.

They do limit you to 2 weapons at a time. While it would be nice to have access to the whole arsenal when you like, the limit wasn't a huge problem to me. None of the weapons have alternate ammunition, so you're not losing access to trap ammo like in the previous games.

Most Vigors(Plasmids) are fairly similar to previous games but differ in function. There are a couple new ones as well as most having the ability to be placed as a proximity trap. There are also some combinations that can be performed. It does feel like the damage has been reduced and stuns have been added or increased, probably to encourage or at least allow the combinations to be performed, but this does push the game towards a more weapon heavy playstyle.

The only issues that I can think of are that there were some minor parts where the animations were a bit off and when you upgrade your guns, it doesn't add any sort of visual representation on the gun when it's in your hand like the previous games. Also, if you hug the walls and objects a lot, you'll get kinda stuck and you just have to reverse/backtrack out of it. Oh, and sometimes there are like invisible walls around things that make picking up cash and items difficult but also register shots on enemies in weird ways.",1464234372,1688333990,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★★★★

BioShock Infinite breaks free from the ocean's depths and ascends to the dizzying heights of the floating city of Columbia, delivering an experience that is nothing short of extraordinary. It stands as a shining example of the power of video games as a storytelling medium, masterfully blending a captivating narrative, dynamic gameplay, and an extraordinarily realized setting into a compelling whole.

In Columbia, we find a world that is as awe-inspiring as Rapture but bathed in the bright blues of the sky instead of the deep blues of the sea. This stunning setting is a character in itself, with its early 20th-century architecture and vibrant city life set against a backdrop of floating airships and whirling skylines. It's a testament to the game's art direction that Columbia manages to feel at once beautiful and deeply unsettling.

The story of BioShock Infinite is a complex, tightly woven narrative tapestry. The tale of Booker DeWitt and Elizabeth is full of twists and turns, political intrigue, philosophical dilemmas, and emotional beats that resonate deeply. The voice acting performances are top-notch, with particular praise deserved by Troy Baker and Courtnee Draper for their heartfelt portrayals of Booker and Elizabeth, respectively.

BioShock Infinite's gameplay also shines. It iterates on the series' existing mechanics while introducing several new elements. The skyline combat sequences add a unique vertical dimension to the gameplay, and the addition of Elizabeth as an AI companion enriches the combat without turning the game into an extended escort mission. Her ability to manipulate the environment, along with her character development, make her a welcome presence rather than a burden.

The range of weapons and vigors (this game's version of BioShock's plasmids) offers a plethora of tactical options, encouraging experimentation. Whether you're possessing a mechanical patriot, setting a group of enemies on fire, or pulling foes into a vortex, there's a myriad of ways to approach each encounter.

The game's sound design and music deserve special mention. The soundtrack, filled with period pieces and anachronistic covers of modern songs, adds layers of immersion to the game. The sound effects and ambient noises complete the illusion of a living, breathing city in the sky.

BioShock Infinite is a triumph in every sense of the word. It pushes the boundaries of interactive storytelling and presents a stunning, fully-realized world filled with rich detail and complex characters. It is a game that will linger in your thoughts long after the credits roll, a testament to its powerful narrative and the emotional journey it takes you on. A masterclass in game design, BioShock Infinite rightfully earns a perfect score.",1688145794,1688145794,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is one of my all-time favourite games, so I’m clearly recommending it. But before doing that, let’s go through its weakest points.

First, this game is a bit short. Enough that I recommend playing it on hard if it is your first time, because if you play it on easy it will barely give you enough time to process it. And almost on the same point the game is also a bit… Small, so to say.

In retrospective, once you beat it, it will probably feel like you haven’t been to that many places nor you’ve taken that much time to travel the whole world. And even if it seems sometimes like scenarios are really opened and have lots of secrets to explore… Well, it’s a bit superficial and not always true. If you are going for a heads-on shooting experience you probably won’t pay that much mind to this… But if you are a person that enjoys looking around, exploring, looking for secrets… You may be a bit disappointed; Columbia is introduced as this behemoth of city, really interesting on its own, beautiful and eery, with both shiny and shady spots… But the game doesn’t let you go off-road that much.

This also puts in perspective the balance of the game. As I said, if you have any experience with shooters, you should play it on the max difficulty. Because easy is way too easy. And yet… Bigger difficulties aren’t that well balanced either.

For instance, I wanted to go through the first DLC a bit more chilled, so I tried to play it in normal. All of the sudden it felt more difficult than the main campaign on hard. It feels like they don’t know their balance too well. And the fact that the resources you get (money and ammo) are also reduced for the higher difficulties when not even on easy you get enough to buy all the upgrades feels a bit weird. I get that being able to upgrade -everything- kinda takes away the fun of making impactful sacrifices. But come on, I had what was probably close to the maximum amount of money you could get in a run and couldn’t even buy half of all the upgrades available for the weapons. I thought I was doing something wrong on hard the first time, but hell, not even easy lets you go a bit crazy.

Yet economics apart, what really bugs me about this game is the lack of proper boss fights. I kinda feel like this was missing from it. Yeah, you get to fight “hard-hitting” enemies from time to time, that have special powers and all, but besides one or two gimmicky attacks they are nothing but bullet-sponges. And the fact that they later appear within crowds of common enemies tells me that they are not designed to be proper bosses anyways.

The gunplay and action in this game are great, but it’s really missing that cherry on top. Some colossal mechanical machine that would have fit perfectly with the game’s aesthetic. Yet the closest thing to a boss fight is protecting certain item from being shot from hordes of enemies. Not the most inspired part of the game.

Yet I can’t even recall how many times have I beaten this game and enjoyed every bit of it from beginning to end.

The fighting, although it was never taken to the max with proper boss fights, feels awesome as it is. Guns feel so good, the protagonist is just agile enough and the girl that you are rescuing, who accompanies you, is basically the best side character of any game. She tags important enemies, she hands you ammo, mana and health... (without making you anything close to immortal, of course). All the pieces fit together to create fights that flow really well. This makes the fact that there aren’t any bosses forgivable, because it’s clear to the eye that they really polished these fights through the game.

Add to this the use of skylines, that -although a bit underused, due to the length of the game too- add a nice dimension to some of the sections. You can look for high vantage points, speed through the rails to take down your enemies while flying through a sea of bullets or jump on them for an aerial take-down. Usually, I tend to be a long-range player in shooters, but this game makes it so fun to go for close-quarters that I couldn’t avoid it.

This is also due to how powerful the weapons and Plasmids… err Vigors feel, paired to some extremely violent melee executions (that could have used a couple more different animations, but eh, good enough).

And also, Vigors. The Bioshock staple of paranormal powers returns with this entry, of course. There are slightly less than in the first games (11 vs 8), but it didn’t really feel like they were too few. Actually, there might be too much even. Some don’t feel that necessary, cause you kinda get used to using two or three of them and don’t bother with the rest later on.

These powers include possession of machines and -later- humans to gain temporary allies, creating fires, sparks or killing crows, locking enemies in the air or throwing them of your course. And even if I feel like you don’t need to exploit them all, they add a really nice dynamism to the fights. Specially possession, it’s really great to gain an edge before even engaging, or to create a breathing room for yourself. To this, add the fact that you can create traps with all of these powers, save one of them, that instead summons a tentacle to grab enemies and throw them around (I’ve seen enough hen-…).

What I’m trying to convey is that the fights are one of the most engaging experiences you can get in modern FPS. They play well, they feel well, they can be challenging (albeit keeping in mind the weird balance this game’s economy has). Something you must experience if you like non-tactical shooters.

And of course, one cannot talk about Bioshock Infinite without talking about its story. Now for returning Bioshock fans, this story is a bit different. And maybe play the DLCs with a bit of salt sprinkled.

I love the story of the main game and I enjoy the closure that the DLCs provide (the second part more than the first one, gotta say). But Infinite was my first Bioshock experience, so in a way that plays against my criteria. And taking a step back, there’s a certain idea that this game presents that overshadows the first game, and it becomes a bit far-fetched under a greater perspective. I can see some fans of the classic Bioshock being rightfully disappointed. And this even without playing DLCs, because the approach for this game’s main story is a bit different.

Now, as an isolated experience and if this is your first contact with the franchise… Prepare for a story that’s really gonna stick to you, even if some things might go over your head the first time. Although I see this as a positive, because it has a really nice story and subtle hints through its progression that make it really enjoyable to replay, both the story bits and, of course, the action-filled ones.

To sum up, a shooting experience that, if it gets to you, will probably have you wishing to return for a run every couple years. A classic worth every cent, that nowadays you can get really cheap on sales. A must have for any fan of either action-packed shooters or story-rich games.",1688078997,1688079467,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unlike the first and second BioShock games, BioShock Infinite World is now in the sky, there is no Rapture anymore, there is only Columbia.

BioShock Infinite plays differently than its predecessor; no more roaming in a maze-like city; in this game, you are gliding around on the skylines, no more saving or protecting Little Sister, now you are protecting only one person, one girl, Elizabeth. Yeah, this game is a big escort mission, BUT don't worry, she won't hinder you; in fact, she will be a big help, throwing you ammo and supplies.

also you won't have a tonnes of weapons like the first and second games, in Infinite you will only get 2, but don't worry because those weapons can be upgraded with money, yes in this game you can upgrade your weapons with money instead of finding hidden weapon upgrade stations

But what about the Rapture, you ask? Don't worry, you'll be back in the DLC ""Burial at Sea.""

Overall, BioShock Infinite is a breath of fresh air—refreshing but still fun.

This is an updated review of the game BioShock Infinite from me.

This is one of the reasons I don't buy Ubishit games, because I fucking hate an additional launcher inside a fucking launcher. This practise should be banned on Steam. Why the fuck do we have to install a launcher when we already have a launcher that is Steam itself?
fucking imbeciles think that we pirated games on Steam or what? Even though 2 retarded K already fixed some of its shitty launcher problems in their QoL updates, it doesn't change the fact that I still fucking hate an additional launcher.

Introduction

Bioshock Infinite stands as a shining example of the artistic and narrative potential of video games. Developed by Irrational Games and released in 2013, this critically acclaimed first-person shooter transcends the boundaries of traditional gaming experiences. With its immersive world-building, thought-provoking themes, and masterful storytelling, Bioshock Infinite delivers an unforgettable and intellectually stimulating adventure.

The Setting: Columbia, a Skyborne Utopia

Set in the early 20th century, Bioshock Infinite transports players to the floating city of Columbia, a marvel of human achievement suspended in the clouds. The meticulously designed cityscape, with its grand architecture, vibrant colors, and attention to historical detail, creates an immersive environment that captivates players from the moment they step foot into this extraordinary world. As players explore Columbia's streets, interiors, and skylines, they uncover the dark secrets lurking beneath its seemingly idyllic façade.

Themes that Resonate: American Exceptionalism, Racism, and Religion

Bioshock Infinite is not just a visually stunning game; it also grapples with complex and thought-provoking themes. The narrative explores notions of American exceptionalism, shedding light on the dark undercurrents of nationalism and blind patriotism. Racism is confronted head-on, as the game confronts the systemic oppression and segregation that pervades Columbia. Religion, too, is a central theme, with the game delving into the dangers of religious fanaticism and the manipulation of faith for personal gain.

The Protagonist: Booker DeWitt and the Mysteries of His Past

The player assumes the role of Booker DeWitt, a former Pinkerton agent burdened by a troubled past. As the story unfolds, players accompany Booker on a mission to rescue Elizabeth, a young woman with extraordinary abilities who becomes his enigmatic companion. Booker's journey becomes an introspective exploration of guilt, redemption, and the consequences of one's actions. The character development is exceptional, and the emotional depth with which Booker is portrayed adds a layer of complexity to the overall narrative.

Elizabeth: A Companion Who Transcends Expectations

Elizabeth, the game's central character, is a triumph of character design and development. Her presence and interactions with the player are seamlessly integrated into the gameplay, making her an invaluable and compelling companion. Elizabeth's multidimensional personality, her endearing innocence, and her evolving relationship with Booker create a genuine emotional connection, immersing players in their shared journey.

Gameplay: A Fusion of Action and Intellect

Bioshock Infinite's gameplay mechanics strike a balance between heart-pounding action and cerebral engagement. Armed with an arsenal of unique weapons and powers, players engage in intense gunfights while utilizing ""tears,"" interdimensional rifts that alter the environment and offer strategic advantages. The exhilarating combat sequences are complemented by mind-bending puzzles and thought-provoking moral choices, forcing players to confront the consequences of their actions.

Visuals and Sound Design:
The visual design of Bioshock Infinite is nothing short of breathtaking. The city of Columbia is rendered with meticulous attention to detail, from its grand architecture to its vibrant landscapes. The art direction combines a nostalgic Americana aesthetic with steampunk elements, creating a unique and visually stunning world. The musical score, composed by Garry Schyman, perfectly complements the game's atmosphere, evoking a wide range of emotions, from awe-inspiring orchestral pieces to haunting melodies that enhance the game's most poignant moments.

Conclusion:
Bioshock Infinite is a masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of traditional storytelling and gaming. Its thought-provoking narrative, immersive gameplay mechanics, and stunning visuals create an unforgettable experience that challenges players intellectually and emotionally.

It stands on its own as a masterpiece of storytelling, gameplay, and visual design, transcending any comparisons or distractions.

It's gameplay is this weird confused hybrid of linear shooter and immersive sim that leans too heavily on its linear setpieces to justify its immersive sim elements. Frequently the game will give you an optional objective that will require you to backtrack to unlock little item closets full of goodies, and encourage you to comb the environments for equipment and resources, but the breakneck pace of the story and gameplay and the linear setpiece based structure really discourages you from actually doing any of that. Also it seems all of the gameplay decisions you make are VERY temporary. Because of the lack of inventory and Elizabeth fetching supplies for you the only resource or item that carries over from encounter to encounter is money which is never in short supply. Contrast this to Bio 1&2 where ammo, Eve hypos, health kits, and hacked security bots all carry over from one encounter to the next in addition to money. Bioshock 2 even lets you repair security bots which when unlocked also gives your security bots names so you grow attached to them. Bioshock Infinite has no resource management or persistent rewards beyond weapon and vigor upgrades. Also the two weapon limit is BAFFLING in the context of a game that allows you to buy ammo. The two weapon limit is great for forcing you to constantly change up your arsenal as you adapt to using what your enemies are using, but since I could buy ammo for the guns I was most comfortable using (and when I couldn't Elizabeth would just toss me some) I never switched away from the carbine and repeater combo which severely limited my experience with the combat systems.

Narratively Infinite is also weaker. It's got some interesting ideas but it's not great at fully exploring them. For the whole first half of the game it seems to want to interrogate the role violence plays in both preserving and fighting injustice, and notably whether violence is justified in the pursuit of ending injustice. But it doesn't really resolve these themes before refocusing entirely on its convoluted multiverse plot. 
This multiverse plot has a pretty neat twist but I remember it being underwhelming when I played it the first time almost a decade ago. I remember comparing it to a Dr. Who plot at the time. My opinion has shifted only slightly toward the positive. I have a better understanding of what the game is trying to say about guilt and forgiveness now, and it does a good job of telling that story. When viewing the work as a whole, however, it feels like the second half of the game is so thematically disconnected from the first half. Like this was two game ideas jammed together. I would have preferred a story about the Vox Populi and Comstock's struggle for Columbia with Booker as an interloper that really digs into and explores the moral complications of an armed revolution OR a story about Booker and Elizabeth's struggle against Comstock's Columbia that really digs into [spoiler]Booker's transformation into Comstock, and how the acceptance of guilt is a necessity for growth.[/spoiler] Attempting to do both however spreads the game's focus too thin, and Bioshock Infinite really suffers as a whole. 

Bioshock Infinite is a mess. A perfectly fine game, but being pulled in so many different directions that it almost falls apart. It wants to be an immersive sim AND a linear shooter structured around setpieces. It wants to be a grand story about broad philosophies and sociological ideas about violence AND a personal story about the importance of guilt and forgiveness. It winds up doing a better job at the latter aspects than the former, but it should have committed to one or the other.

8870,140561880,76561198004858066,0,17,3028,0,3028,1686651416,"A ""smart"" game for ""smart"" gamers. 
I made the mistake of buying this game on release. Didn't like it then, didn't like it now. 

 In terms of gameplay, it is not very good. It takes BioShock 1 and 2, and throws all of it out the window. You are limited to two guns. the weapon upgrade system is simplified to have you buy upgrades at a station, but you can't ""rush"" a weapon you like, like you could in the previous game. No, you have to wait until you progress far enough in the story to spend your scavenged money on upgrades. Plasmids are not as satisfying as they were in the second game. Base shock jockey and murder of crows is really all you need.

There are spoilers below, so, don't read if you don't want them.

The game tries to come off as deeper than it is, by throwing alternate universes and time travel at you in an attempt to make you forget about the egregious errors in regards to existentialism, psychology, and what makes a man a man?

The game repeatedly shouts at you the differences of Comstock, and DeWitt. How Comstock pretended to be a soldier at the Boxer Rebellion and Wounded Knee, with another NPC confirming DeWitt was there, Comstock was not, and that Comstock is a revisionist lying in order to further sell his utopia and stoke the flames of fanaticism. Admittedly, the over the top racism and bigotry that would make HP Lovecraft blush aged like a fine wine, sadly. I'll admit the game was ahead of it's time there.

Back to the original point, the game tries to sell you Comstock and DeWitt are different, yet the same, because of time travel paradoxes and alternate universe BS that if you dumb it down to it's core parts, still doesnt make sense.

Take two genetically identical individuals. Have one live a life of prejudice, hate, sheltered. Have the other live a more humble life, join the military, fight for causes they don't believe in, go into crippling debt.

Are these two individuals, shaped by their life experiences, still the same? Basic existentialism and psychology would say ""no.""

So at the end of the day, the lovable partner in crime Elizabeth Comstock, turns out to be just as fucked up as Comstock because she straight up murders DeWitt. There are no alternate endings, because of this alternate universe BS they tried to implement but chickened out to make one ending, for one timeline/universe.

Save your money, play BioShock and BioShock 2 again, or maybe pick up the System Shock remake.",1687536760,1687536760,False,1,2,0,0,True,False,False

8870,134990375,76561199216079135,65,14,9582,0,2328,1688140722,"Commercial Heaven flying with fun, products, and shops seems to be a complete lesson about how to decorate public places in a city. People are controlled by Comstock the prophet figure also controls slavery to build the city. Mr Booker Dewitt entered the city Name Columbia baptized to pay off his gambling debts in New York. The mission is to rescue the abducted bastard daughter of prophet Comstock and hand her over in New York.  

The game starts with picking things from bins, shops, restaurants, and roadside benches by Mr Dewitt who might be wondering how happy people are in the flying city. The mission has a photo of a destination called monument island where the daughter Elizabeth is abducted and a key to free her from the Monument Tower. Trouble starts with a fight with police at the Raffle fair after the welcome centre of the city and since then Mr Dewitt keeps fighting against various kinds of characters including police, guards and the army of Comstock. Characters like fire man, patriot, crow man, giant robot the Handyman are stubborn in nature. As like as other two parts of BIOSHOCK, the mad machine guns are in every corner. A very common nature of this game is characters move very fast and randomly, the aim was barely visible to kill them. I would say some fights are designed to use your sixth sense to kill random enemies. Flying boats, flying balloons with machine guns, no end of catastrophe in this game.   

On your side, you have 8 kinds of vigour; you can use two at a time selecting from them also can update their effectiveness. I found the crows trap and electric shock most useful. In your right hand, you get plenty of variety of ammo. The thing is the game is printed in colour sketches, so guns are looking like toys until you start using them seriously. The job in BIOSHOCK is to slow the enemies down with left-hand vigour and then shoot them with right-hand guns. There is a button for melee attack when they come close and also a button to get directions arrow on the screen. Also, a magnetic device is given in this part to fly on skylines. 

As usual, after rescuing Elizabeth, it became difficult for Dewitt to take her out from Columbia to New York even though she wanted to be free. Once Dewitt told her about his mission in the First Lady Ship, Elizabeth simply ran away putting him into another gambling. The boat they need to travel to New York is now in the hands of slave leaders ( Vox & Daisy Fitzroy) who will only give it back if Dewitt can find the gunsmith Chan Ling who can supply guns to free the slaves. Elizabeth was really useful during fights because she was picking up supplies. The game has tear(s) in the screen which Elizabeth can open and bring supplies from other worlds. Finally gunsmith was found, slaves were freed and now Elizabeth had to leave with the Songbird to save Dewitt as the big metallic bird was about to kill him. Now Dewitt picked up a code from the ghost of Elizabeth’s dead mother which finally helped them to capture the big metallic Songbird which used to be the guardian of Elizabeth in the monument tower. Here I must say that the discovery of the ghost mother (Lady Comstock) of Elizabeth in the graveyard started a disturbing episode where dead things started coming alive. Until you can have some good aims in the source ghost it keeps growing in the scene. In three episodes Lady Comstock was killed.  

As like the first two parts, the game doesn’t end at the last scene of unprecedented fighting in the command deck of Comstock’s zeppelin. Finally, the prophet was killed in the deck of his zeppelin then the escape gets stuck and probably will let you finish the whole army of Comstock and Vox before you leave. Here to mention, “Vox Populi” the people freed from slavery become enemies as the game was entering different worlds through tears. Anyway, I have been playing chapter by chapter backward to upgrade everything up to the end to find out how to end the game.",1679253105,1687430669,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The contrast between harmony and disarray of violence throughout Columbia can already be seen upon launching the game. The peaceful nature of the main menu is very contradictory to the violence Booker DeWitt causes throughout the game. 

Even though, the concept of a utopia with a dark twist has already been used many times, this game can still be very atmospheric. Especially, because the world and the environment are one of the game's best features.

Due to the multiverse being a hard concept to explain I had some trouble understanding the plot on my first playthrough. It also doesn't help much that the game's timeline is occasionally all over the place.

The combat is fun and there is a big variety in weapons and open areas. It's also worth mentioning that one of the biggest positives of Bioshock Infinite is that it connects to the first two games, even if it doesn't seem like it at first.

One of the game's strongest points is its story. It is a complex and thought-provoking tale that deals with heavy themes such as racism, nationalism, and the consequences of unchecked power. The game's narrative is masterfully crafted and kept me engaged throughout my entire playthrough. The ending is also one of the most memorable and impactful conclusions to a video game I have ever experienced.

The gameplay is equally impressive. Bioshock Infinite features a perfect balance of shooting, strategy, and supernatural powers, giving the player a lot of options for how to approach each encounter. The combat is fast-paced and exciting, with plenty of weapons and abilities to unlock and upgrade as you progress through the game.

It is a very accessible game, even for those with low-end computers. It runs smoothly even on modest hardware, which is a rare feat for such a visually stunning game.

Overall, Bioshock Infinite is a true masterpiece that deserves all the praise it has received. Its gripping story, engaging gameplay, unforgettable characters, and low specs needed to play make it a must-play game for anyone who loves first-person shooters, RPGs, or immersive storytelling.",1682844478,1686121466,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I can't even begin to express how captivated I was by the game's gripping storytelling and immersive gameplay. Developed by Irrational Games and released in 2013, this game takes you on an unforgettable journey through the floating city of Columbia, delivering an experience that is both thought-provoking and thrilling.

The story of BioShock Infinite is nothing short of extraordinary. Set in an alternate reality in 1912, you step into the shoes of Booker DeWitt, a former Pinkerton agent with a mission to find a young woman named Elizabeth and hand her over to a mysterious group known as the Vox Populi. But as you dive deeper into the story, you'll discover that Columbia is a city teeming with secrets, political strife, and a deeply entrenched racism that drives the conflicts within.

I have to say, the narrative in BioShock Infinite is absolutely mind-blowing. It's like unravelling a complex tapestry of American exceptionalism, religious zealotry, and the consequences of unchecked power. The characters are incredibly well-developed, and the relationship between Booker and Elizabeth forms the heart and soul of the game. Elizabeth, in particular, is an astonishing companion, with her own agency and unique abilities that greatly impact the gameplay dynamics.

Speaking of gameplay, BioShock Infinite seamlessly blends first-person shooter mechanics with a set of special abilities called Vigors. These Vigors give Booker extraordinary powers, such as telekinesis and the ability to control swarms of crows, adding a strategic twist to combat encounters. The gunplay is satisfying, with an impressive array of weapons that each offer a distinct feel. And let's not forget the level design, which strikes a perfect balance between expansive environments and carefully crafted spaces that invite exploration and experimentation.

But what truly blew me away about BioShock Infinite was its setting—the awe-inspiring city of Columbia. The level of detail is truly astonishing, with its vibrant art deco architecture, bustling streets, and sweeping skylines. It feels like a living, breathing city, with its inhabitants going about their daily lives, and it serves as a powerful commentary on the darker aspects of American history. The stark contrast between its picturesque facade and the underlying bigotry and oppression is both mesmerizing and deeply unsettling.

Visually, BioShock Infinite is an absolute feast for the eyes. From breathtaking vistas to meticulously designed environments, the game is a visual spectacle from start to finish. The audio design is equally impressive, with a phenomenal soundtrack that captures the essence of the time period. The voice acting is outstanding as well, especially Troy Baker's portrayal of Booker and Courtnee Draper's performance as Elizabeth. They infuse their characters with such depth and emotion that it's impossible not to be fully invested in their journey.

One of the most remarkable aspects of BioShock Infinite is its thought-provoking themes and social commentary. The game fearlessly tackles issues such as racism, xenophobia, and the dangers of religious fanaticism, forcing players to confront uncomfortable truths about society. It poses profound questions about the nature of choice, redemption, and the consequences of our actions.

Now, I won't deny that BioShock Infinite isn't flawless. Some players might find the combat encounters a tad repetitive, and there are moments when the difficulty spikes can be frustrating. And let's not forget the ending—it's an absolute mind-bender that leaves you with more questions than answers. While it's undoubtedly thought-provoking and thematically resonant, it may leave some players feeling a bit bewildered or even unsatisfied.

The Good

- Though there are fewer of them in this game the plasmids, or vigors, as they're called now are overall much better in this game. They cut down on a lot of the bloat of redundant and useless plasmids in the first two games and every vigor that was in the main game and the DLC actually felt useful and powerful. I'd say almost too powerful once you start to upgrade them to become stronger and have chain effects.

-I want to have sex with Elizabeth. Not much more to say there.

-As far as video game escort quests go, Elizabeth is one of the better ones.

The Bad

-Columbia really feels like a step down in terms of a setting when compared to Rapture. Some areas were pretty cool, but overall nothing in Columbia was as interesting or unique as Rapture.

-Being able to only carry two guns at once sucks. I get that this was probably just trend chasing because at the time a two gun carry limit was the standard in FPS games. The gun upgrading also sucked compared the the prior two games because there were no visual changes to the weapons as a result of upgrading them (weird complaint I know, but I really liked the idea of gun upgrades being reflected on the gun model) and the fact the you have such a limited capacity for ammo means you'll frequently have to ditch your upgraded weapons in favor of whatever is available.

-The game is too linear and has no respect for player agency or intelligence. I wouldn't say that any of the Bioshock games were exactly non-linear, but one thing I noticed as I played through each game in the series is that the games got more linear with less optional side exploration as they went on. In this game the developers so desperately don't want you to miss any of the little set pieces or extras they put in that the amount of exploration you can do in areas outside of places you'd have to go anyway are almost now existent and usually confined to single rooms behind a door you have to lock-pick. This is in contrast to the first Bioshock which had entire sections of levels that were entirely optional.

-The story is incredibly stupid. I know it's Bioshock, not some literary classic, but the first two games at least had decent enough plots. In this game I pretty much tuned out as soon as the time travel/dimension hopping shit started. Those are concepts that even a good writer would struggle to make work well and sufficed to say a hack like Ken Levine was not up to the task. By the time I got the end I really didn't care anymore. They were clearly proud of the story and thought it was great too based on the cinematic presentation of the game and how often the rest control away from the player for the sake of cinematics, something the first two games didn't do that often.

The Ugly

-Basically the entirety of the the Burial At Sea DLC is awful. Very briefly I thought is was neat to see rapture pre-fall, but I quickly lost my enthusiasm when I saw the direction they were taking things. The desperation of Ken Levine to try and connect Infinite to the previous games via this DLC not only retroactively ruins the plot of the first two games, but also ruins some of the only good parts of the plot of Infinite. If you have to play Infinite, just skip the Burial At Sea DLC and pretend it doesn't exist.





On The Series As A Whole

If I had to rank the games it would be as follows:

BioShock 2 > Bioshock > Bioshock Infinite

Bioshock 2 is the high watermark of the series in my opinion if only for the improvements in gameplay over the original. Infinite is far and away the worst. I do find it funny that of the three games in the franchise the best one is the one Ken Levine had nothing to do with.

Instead of having ""incinerate"" you get ""Devil's Kiss"" etc. The whole game just feels forced.

The part that probably irks me the most: This game was postponed YEARS so they would have time to perfect it. Instead, on Ultra PC settings, this game still has screen tearing. The water looks worse than it did in Bioshock 1. And we are left with a bad taste in our mouth at the end of the game because the story was not imaginative.

The more you look at it, the more things stop working and feel like empty allegories.

One of the main aspects in Bioshock 1 and 2 was the deep political discussions that were organic and ""grounded"", Rapture was a place built by humans that were to obsessed with progress, they had flawed perspectives and beliefs and they end up being destroyed by their radical progressive with no boundaries, capitalist ideology. Objectivism is heavily criticized in this game and the result of their demise was based on their choices.

In Bioshock Infinite all of this is scraped by some multiverse story where no political allegories are explored properly because they heavily focus on Booker and Elizabeth's story. They're quantum time travelers and they have influence over every universe, and for every consequence and decision they partake, it influences over every story, including Bioshock 1. 

Yes, it was Booker DeWitt and Elizabeth all along, they sparkled the entire first and second game plot, they're the magic beings that exist over every universe.

Another thing that bothers me a lot is that a lot of the story is just pointless, the revolution and Daisy Fitzroy, they're never really explored, they're just there and nothing really comes from it. They just change realities and she is suddenly evil and wants to kill a child. The songbird is pointless and it's just there in cutscenes, and in a stupid short battle, he's probably the most disappointing part of this game. 

And for the thing that bothers me the most, the gameplay... It's really... alright, I don't know what else to say. You can carry only two weapons, the weapons have no visual or significative mechanical changes, they're generally boring compared to the other games. When you upgrade them it's just stats, the enemies are not interesting or good as the splicers were, the daddies of this game are not interesting and they're planned encounters, I can only feel apathy for the combat of this game.

I would definitely say that time was not a good friend of Bioshock Infinite. As if it's worth it or not, if you never played this game it's still well made and enjoyable, like the start of the game and the presentation of Columbia, but the game falls flat the more you look into it. Specially the end gaming. And if you played the other games, I would say for you to only play this game for the sake of completion, since you played the other games. It's an okay game with high points and it's still better than most triple AAA games from now.

That's because this most recent instalment of the series tones down the level of interactivity and player expression even more than the original [i]Bioshock[/i] already did compared to the series' spiritual granddaddy [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/238210/System_Shock_2]System Shock 2[/url][/i]. [b]There are very few immersive sim elements left this time around, moving the third Bioshock game even further into pure shooter gameplay territory. But as you keep playing and you come to appreciate Bioshock Infinite on its own terms, it turns into one of the more interesting gaming experiences with one of the most interesting settings and narratives you've seen in video games[/b].

Much like Rapture in [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/409710/BioShock_Remastered]Bioshock[/url][/i] and [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/409720/BioShock_2_Remastered]Bioshock 2[/url][/i], the floating city of Columbia in Bioshock Infinite is built on a real-life ideological foundation turned to its logical extremes. This time around, we turn our eye on institutionalised racism, American exceptionalism and Evangelical zealotry in an alternate history 1910s USA. [b]Once again, this makes the setting of the game feel more grounded than a floating city would otherwise feel, and it lends the plot a lot of gravity[/b] (man, the jokes are just flying today), as the failings of these ideologies are quickly laid bare. Interestingly, the main plot of Bioshock Infinite isn't specifically about any of these topics, but rather interwoven with their associated themes. [b]The up-front ideological satire/tragedy takes a back seat as we explore the implications of multiverse theory and the game's central topic of redemption – whether it be religious or secular in nature[/b].

One of the defining features of Bioshock Infinite is Elizabeth, the main character's near-constant companion as they fight through Columbia. [b]Elizabeth is probably one of the best implementations of a non-intrusive companion I've seen since[/b] [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/19980/Prince_of_Persia]Prince of Persia[/url][/i] (2008), as she points out interesting things in the environment, summons objects such as friendly turrets out of thin air and throws you resources when you need them. And she does all that without becoming a liability, since she's effectively invulnerable in gameplay terms. I know some people don't like that she can just waltz across the battlefield without anyone taking a shot at her, but I'd much rather have it this way than have the entire game turn into an extended escort mission.

Most importantly, Elizabeth is central to the plot and a great way of furthering the narrative through dialogue with the player character, Booker DeWitt. I don't want to go into more detail when it comes to the plot, as this is arguably the most important and most engaging aspect of the game. All I'll say is that, [b]while some scenes aren't interwoven with the gameplay in the best way they probably could have been (like holding seemingly time-sensitive scenes indefinitely until you press the interact button), the overall story will stick with you for a while[/b]. Not least because of its mind-bending existential horror undercurrent, its emotional impact and the chances it takes from time to time (such as Bioshock Infinite's honestly pretty courageous ending for a 'AAA' title).

If you've enjoyed the Bioshock series so far and you don't mind Bioshock Infinite being an arguably even more linear experience focused even more on straight-up shooting, this is a must-play. [b]Even if you don't like the new gameplay direction, I think its strong themes, characters and narrative more than make up for it[/b].

In this game, you play as Booker DeWitt, a guy who had to repay a debt and save a girl, from a flying city called Columbia, a perfect city in the sky, far from the filth on the ground, but despite being your first time here, you are well known and everyone want's you dead to prevent you to find back the girl.

This time, good bye the horrible mutated splicer from Rapture and hello the Huge clockwork fighting robot.
The game, on many point, is similar to the previous Bioshock.
Weapons, Plasmids (Now called Vigors) and core element are still here.
Big changes here are the take on the story, where a lot of things happen, and can be desorienting at some point but the DLCs explain all of them.

The Ambiance is also very changed, it's not anymore the dark underwater World of Rapture, it's more like the light bright world of Columbia, but things are still also going bad as much.

Story wise, the characters are all interesting with multiple layers of what's going on.
You learn a lot about our character, his past, what happened before the elements of the game and it does great to the game.

However, despite it's qualities, the story can be quite flawed towards the middle of the game. Infinite is ambitious and tries to include a lot of mature topics and themes, something the series has done with 1 and 2, but it stretches way too far and doesn't add any nuances and feels very, very surface level (and harmful). Especially in 2023, 10 years after the game has been released, there's some story elements that have not aged well and leaves a sour taste in my mouth. However, despite that major flaw that can ruin the middle part of the game for me, Infinite is great and redeems itself with a very impactful and jaw dropping ending.

8/10 - An amazing game that I really enjoyed, just wish some parts of the story were changed as it has aged badly in 2023

It is a huge improvement from the previous 2 games in terms of graphics, combat, weapons responsiveness, abilities management, AI behavior, looting system, upgrading system and so on, but it also has some let downs that I'm not sure why the devs didn't consider: a map, some tutorials -> I didn't know there is an inventory or how to open it, I didn't know you can ADS weapons before getting the sniper, I didn't know you can use any weapon at any time before getting into dlcs when I realized I don't have enough ammo with only 2 weapons and the default buttons does not help at all, it's very unintuitive.
If you played the predecessor games, you may find this one being completely different and you may wonder how is it related to the underwater universe, but only in the Burial at Sea you'll find out how well is the story connected to Raptor. The artstyle is amazing, the new mechanics, weapons and plasmids (named vigors here) were refreshing, the story was very confusing with an even more confusing ending, but everything was clear after finishing the dlc.

So first of all, I only recently, like this week, played Bioshock for the first time. Bioshock 1 that is. I played through the first two games, and i freaking looooooved it. Original Bioshock has this really dark ambiance, this feeling of dread and gloom, this semi horror game feel. You, and your character, have no idea what is down there, and it was a true exploration of the place, discovering plots and insane technology at the bottom of the ocean. Combine that with it feeling like a metroidvania, with secrets and puzzles all over, with unlockable bonuses and lore that felt extremely rewarding to find and discover. Playing on the hardest difficulty, you really had to scrounge for resources, always sizing up the next big fight, wondering if i should find some more medpacks and wanting to find secrets to refill my stock. Wondering if its worth to go for the terrifying optional bosses early, and if i did go for it, planing out an escape route and putting up little traps on the way to chip away at their health. I, fu**ing, loved it. And then those two games were done. I had finished the story, i had found all the secrets. And so i installed Bioshock Infinite.

Bioshock infinite is about Nathan Fake (Booker Dewitt), generic rugged action hero, in what amounts so far (i only played for ca 4 hours), to a nonstop action sequence. Just the intro was such an extreme showcase of how different this game is from the originals. You have a long sequence of exploration, getting a feel for this cool and kinda tranquil place, and suddenly, as if someone flipped a switch, the game goes into overgear, showing that its in fact not tranquil, and in the first minute of getting a weapon you have killed about 20 enemies. The game then continues with about an hour long sequence of you killing hundreds of enemies, with this intense action music playing all the while, with every enemy always knowing where you are, until you finally get to the door that leads to the next area and the continuation of the story that takes 15 minutes, and then your back into the action sequence again. And look, i get that that is fun. I loooooved Doom when it came out, and Wolfenstein: new order was badass, I enjoy the S**t out of those kinds of games as well!
...when i havent just spent the last week playing a different genre of game and being super excited to play more of it.  

I think in the end, if Bioshock infinite had been a movie, then i would've been completely sold. alternatively, had the game not had the name Bioshock infront of it, had the game been called something on the line of ""Aethershock"" instead,  similar to Systemshock before Bioshock, then i could have completely understood that it is a story set in a similar world but with a different theme. Systemshock in space, bioshock under the sea, and Aethershock (name pending) in the sky. That would have made sense. As it stands, it just didn't fit into what i wanted it to be. And there is the crux of my dilemma of what rating to give. On its own, the game in itself is fine. Its good, its absolutely solid as an action shooter with a good story. But it isn't a successor to Bioshock 1 and 2. It is an action movie masquerading as one. 

TL:DR: If you want a good storydriven action shooter with actionpacked gameplay, then get this game. If you want another Bioshock after playing 1 and 2, then this isnt the right game for you.",1684772526,1684772526,False,2,0,0.504999995231628418,0,True,False,False

When seeing Crowbcat's Bioshock Infinite video and playing this game with and without nostalgia glasses, this game is good, great in fact. But there could be more.

But this game had to be dumbed down for consoles and PC's at the time because of the lack of the limitations that they had. The game we got now is still good, but the idea of what it could have been keeps my mind spinning. As a first person shooter, its great. As a Bioshock and immersive sim game, its passable.

Oh yeah, you also fight a ghost in a graveyard for no real reason.
The game has very little to say while trying to say a lot, spread its story too thin to make a good narrative. Is it a condemnation of american exceptionalism?

I think the biggest reason why I felt so overwhelmed back then is because the game does not have a satisfying ending. It has a set of HUGE twists toward the end and at the end of the game that can be hard to understand, but the problem is that it just doesn't resolve properly afterward, or at least it doesn't solve satisfactorily.
I JUST WANT A FATHER AND DAUGHTER TO BE HAPPY TOGETHER OK. I wanted a happy ending, and I get it blah blah bioshock something something but idk Bioshock 2 has a happy ending why can't this game, you spend all this time making us deeply invested in and care about Booker and Elizabeth and their relationship why not have them live happily ever after. 

Anyways, played it on 1999 mode. I actually enjoyed being forced into cover and getting shot down in like 2 shots, made me play very strategically. I want to say that the combat scenerios you're put in is pretty great and the AI for time of release is pretty great.
A few problems. The checkpoint system is absolute fucking garbage. You will never know how far back you'll get sent, and whenever I die I go back to checkpoint. ""Oh why would you do that why not just pay for the revive"", it's really simple, you need money for upgrades, and upgrades make you powerful and makes the super hard 1999 mode less impossible, plus I get to keep my ammo. Idk why they didn't have a checkpoint machine or at least some kind of HUD indicator for when a checkpoint was reached.
Gunplay is absolutely great, agree with my younger self there. Grinding on rails feels good (though is a lot less useful in 1999 mode other than evading handymen), and while being limited to 2 guns is VERY limiting it avoids clutter and encourages picking things up on the fly which feels awesome. HOWEVER. It's very easy to fall into using only two weapons and being ammo starved with them, because if you drop them you never know when you're going to be able to find them again. This playthrough I did sniper and hand cannon (sweet sweet headshots) which worked greats, and because of their low ammo pool I switched sometimes, but I switched right back after the battle was over. I get that Bioshock and ESPECIALLY Bioshock 2 had an issue of having waaaay too many weapons and ammo types, but fuck at least you had them available to you at all times, if you wanted to use something that suited the situations or set up a trap (which you often could successfully do in 2) then you simply could, no need to find the gun you want again.
The vigors were ok. I gotta say that plasmids and vigors never really impressed me much throughout the series. My main two was Possession (makes an enemy attack other enemies, divert their attention, and they may kill themselves afterward?? super OP), and shock jockey (free stuns). I used bronco for the firemen because they're annoying otherwise. More than what I did with plasmids honestly. 

Edit: Wow this is a super cringy review I made right after playing it. The story is interesting but it's really not that mind boggling or complicated, in fact the story in terms of making sense is kinda flawed. But whatever. Gameplay and aesthetic is still amazing.

Uhm...
Excellent story commentating on political, religious, and society fronts... With some time travel and multiple universe complexes going on...

Superb gunplay that flows well, and doesn't fog up on making the player feel like a clever badass, with things like grinding on rails and having a good array of weapons (even if you can only use two different weapons at a time. The game was clearly designed for a controller.)

Some technical hiccups as with the first two Bioshock games is that you'll have to do some configuring on the PC version if you want the exact settings you want. (For me, I wanted to get rid of mouse smoothing and turn on  raw input. Doing so wasn't with ease.) 
However, Bioshock is very well optimized so I would not be surprised if the game will run flawlessly even on mediocre graphics cards.

When i first played with this game it was on a 60hz monitor on a laptop that was unable to keep it steady 60fps.
And i hated it. Finished just for the sake of the story but doesnt liked it at all.

Now that i finished on a 144hz monitor i can say that yes this is actually a fun shooter.
Its action packed more than the previous bioshocks, and the game let you play as you want. 
You have about a dozen weapon all of them uniqe for the role they fufill you have almost the same amount of vigors or plasmids or magic call it what you want. You have a sky hook that allow you travel around fast and strike down with great vengance and furious anger. Oh and you have elizabeth who can tear up reality and give other benefits.
So yeah shooting is solid gold in this game, do it either with mouse an keyboard or controller.

Story is  good, you gotta let it flow, dont get caught up how impossible the whole thing is just enjoy the world they made for you.

Graphic is okay albeit its a little dated and not that well optimized but still okay. The whole design has this i dunno strange fantasy painting feeling.

This should have been called Call of Duty Infinite.
Hand holding, railed campaign through linear maps that retcons the original games into ashes.
On top of that, the story has so many contradictions its a wonder my computer hasn't turned into a universe destroying singularity.
Plasmids and weapons are greatly streamlined and simplified, for the worse, making them incredibly boring and lackluster to use.

Enemies are a complete snoozefest too. Where Rapture's enemies are memorable and varied, like houdini, brute and leadhead splicers, Infinite's enemies are just plain guys with guns. The sole exception are the handymen enemies, who are clearly intended to be this games Big Daddy, but who are just bullet sponges that are neither memorable or a key part of the world like the Big Daddies are.

As a first-person shooter, it offers a unique blend of action and narrative that sets it apart from other games in the genre.

From the opening scene, the game immerses you in the world of Columbia, a city in the clouds that seems too good to be true. As you explore the city and uncover its secrets, you'll encounter a cast of memorable characters, including the enigmatic Elizabeth, whose abilities will prove crucial to your success.

The gameplay is fast-paced and thrilling, with a variety of weapons and abilities at your disposal. The use of the Skyhook, a grappling hook that allows you to ride along the city's rails, adds a new dimension to the combat and allows for some truly impressive set pieces.

But where Bioshock Infinite truly shines is in its storytelling. The game tackles weighty themes such as racism, nationalism, and the dangers of blind faith, all while keeping the player engaged with a twisting and turning plot that will keep you guessing until the very end.

The voice acting is top-notch, with Troy Baker delivering a standout performance as the protagonist, Booker DeWitt. The game's soundtrack is also a standout, featuring haunting choral arrangements and period-appropriate songs that add to the atmosphere of the game.

Visually, Bioshock Infinite is a stunning achievement, with its vivid colors and art deco-inspired design creating a world that is both beautiful and unsettling. The attention to detail is impressive, with every corner of the city feeling like it has a story to tell.

Overall, Bioshock Infinite is a must-play for fans of first-person shooters and narrative-driven games. Its blend of action and storytelling is unmatched, and the world of Columbia is a place you'll want to get lost in again and again.",1613044182,1683044029,True,4,0,0.517006814479827881,0,True,False,False

[b]Long Review[/b]
Late to the party, the Bioshock series was my first real FPS experience. So while not the best judge of gameplay, in terms of the trilogy I consider Infinite to have executed it best. Many players found ability to carry only two firearms a hindrance, but I found it a strategic challenge bearing a certain level of realism—only now did I realise we would somehow haul an entire arsenal around with us in previous games—which actively demanded different strategies, as opposed to: I ran out of ammo... oh well, guess I'll shoot them with this other ammo then change over to one of my seven other guns, all of which require me to get up close and personal with my opponent anyway and go boom. The Plasmids/Vigors are also far more engaging and balanced. And, finally, no more dumb hacking minigames. Huzzah.

The graphics remain excellent a decade later, and nothing betrays the game's age in that department—with the exception of my device being easily capable of running the game at its highest settings without sounding like an aeroplane at takeoff. The change from Rapture to Columbia was a welcome one, as Rapture's post-catastrophic ambience was starting to get a little old, which was quite a drawback as environments are the primary means of Bioshock's storytelling. The soundtrack was great. Voice acting was also solid, with no background character cringe. Troy Baker (unsurprisingly) did well as Booker, and so did Courtnee Draper as Elizabeth.

Overall, Infinite easily leaves the original duo in the dust, in all but three aspects: the lowered difficulty, lack of player agency, and conclusion. 

(Minor Spoilers Ahoy)

Compared to the previous titles, Infinite felt a little too easy; my first death came in almost halfway into the game. I assumed the difficulty drop was due to the lack of vitachambers, and the game would send you back to your last checkpoi-you're revived three metres away from where you died? I don't normally prefer games on very high difficulties, but compared to the previous Bioshock games, this one felt like a walk in the park. That could be attributed to the far more streamlined gameplay, alongside the lack of the Big Daddy-esque bosses.

My biggest gripe with Infinite, however, was the only set of credits rolling in just over ten hours. Would it have been longer had I played it on a harder mode? Sure. But seeing as I had only played two FPS titles before it, I assumed Normal difficulty was the way to go as to not shoot myself in the foot. Constant death is an artificial way of narrative pacing anyway.

I didn't mind the lack of multiple endings, and it did make more sense plot-wise. That, however, [spoiler] alongside the conclusion's completely nihilistic nature, while I didn't mind it in terms of storytelling [/spoiler] makes replayability hugely redundant; there is hardly any story-related reason to return to this title. Maybe just to see how much more difficult the game can get, and get some achievements.

[b]Conclusion:[/b] Play this fucking game with its excellent storytelling and engaging (although done to death) social commentary. While not without fault, it's worth your time, and your money, and really highlights how lots of contemporary gaming has become very dull given that, plot predictability aside, had someone told me this game came out this year I would have believed them.

From the moment you step into the city of Columbia, you are immediately drawn into its stunningly realized world. The attention to detail in every corner of the city is simply breathtaking, from the gorgeous architecture to the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack.

But what really sets Bioshock Infinite apart is its incredible storytelling. The game's plot is masterfully crafted, and the characters you encounter along the way are some of the most memorable and well-developed in all of gaming.

As a story, it functions fine for the most part. The game itself is fairly good but i do not think this will be remembered by the fans of the originals. Due to it's complete annexing of many elements that made the originals so special, it creates a more hollowed out dumbed down experience. 

That's not to say that Infinite does not have it's merits. The artistry and talent that has gone into this game is not to be understated.Combat feels good even in it's shallowness. The story is constantly having you guess what is happening and that's a great thing, Elizabeth as a character is a friendly welcome reprieve most of the time. However all of these elements are a far cry from the heights of the series and i'd argue even antithetical to the core of what Bioshock 1/2 was. The game is ultimately regressive which is a massive shame when you think of all of the empty elements that could have been filled. That could have been explored in the enemies and environments of columbia.

Bioshock Infinite is an apt name for the game an exploration of what is, what has been and what has been. It's essentially a game built on the exploration of the many world's theory. While that works for the story's narrative, thinking outside of the metaphorical schrodinger's box means that the story doesn't feel quites as palitable as it's previous entries. It's a fun adventure but at the end of the day, it does not execute on those elements what so ever in gameplay. It's a linear path, with linear corridors and ultimately your choices matter for nothing. Kill or Don't? Cage or Bird? Throw the Ball or Don't? It doesn't matter, the conclusion remains static. The beginning middle and end doesn't change or if it does, it's a trivial change. Titles like Prey and it's DLC Mooncrash do an excellent job of creating this sort of gameplay dynamic of playing against the player expectations when it comes to continuity, even deathloop does a better job of getting this across. Bioshock Infinite feels like a game that forgets it's a game at time, like a traintrack without a signaller to change it's direction.

Bioshock Infinite divorces itself from quite a few elements of the original and it's sequel. Plasmids/Vigors no longer serve as a narrative tool to build the world. Very little is done to explain how and why they function or why people have superpowers in this world. In addition, Columbia as a city is also a void of where that narrative storytelling was taken place. You never learn about the people who built columbia, you might see them but it's often a two line tale. Quantum Mechanics itself is a plot device that is given as an explanation but without much of a way in elaborating itself. Multiple times. Much of the strength of the narrative art told through posters and propaganda is cut short. Much shy of realising columbia as a place that can exist. In addition, the game itself does not function as an immersive sim. It's a FPS Shooter primarily. You might see RPG weapon numbers and the like but they can be for the most part ignored. There isn't as much depth as Bioshock 1 or 2 by a countrymile. Victory is handed to you on a plate, even more so than in the past. You are funneled so many resources practically served to you it means that combat has very little actual depth to it. Why bother choosing a sniper rifle over a shotgun for ammo economy when you have a mechanic that literally shoves it into your hands at the drop of a button?

Will you enjoy Bioshock Infinite, ultimately i can see people walking away from it being satisifed. If you enjoy Action FPS shooters, you're in for the ride. If you enjoy Immersive Sims, if you are a big fan of how the originals played. Then you're going to be very sorely disappointed. I like infinite but ultimately it could have been so much more and it just isn't.

I took the time recently to go through the Bioshock collection including Minerva's Den and was pleasantly surprised at the quality and care that was taken to ensure that the first two games in the series were as good as they could be. Then I got to this game and was unpleasantly let down HARD. I do not understand the amount of people who played the first two games including Minerva's Den in their entirety and then get to this game and think this game is as good or even BETTER than it's predecessors, it ASTOUNDS me beyond belief. Even if you try to view this game as a standalone it's subpar at best. I find it hard to believe anyone with a modicum of brain function can sit through this and genuinely say they enjoyed this snoozefest. I'll start with the gameplay first because trying to wrap my head around the story and put it into words right now on how absolutely horrendous and brain hemorrhaging it is after finishing it recently will strain my patience more so than it already was while playing this dumpster fire of a game.

Gameplay: For starters, This is LITERALLY a COD campaign, you are paying for a COD campaign with the Bioshock title slapped on it. Everything about the first two games is thrown right out the window, you no longer have your own guns that you can carry with you to change on the fly with unique ammo types meant to deal with different enemy types, instead you're forced to scavenge for other guns when you inevitably run out of ammo. Although, to be fair, I did carry the same carbine and sniper up until about the end of Comstock's house chapter. Did I mention there's a TWO weapon limit by the way? As opposed to the collection of weapons you carried in the first two and their versatility in combat. The weapon upgrades also work differently in this game and honestly for the worse. I don't mind not being to upgrade all the weapons but there are thirteen weapons in this game each having four upgrades to go through, a lot of them being completely useless as well because they either don't really make a difference because the gun was already fine without it or you will just never use that gun. I never once, aside from times where I just wanted to test them out, used the Vox weapons because they are downgrades of the weapons used by the Founders' soldiers. You find yourself going through the game buying ammo for the two weapons you have at every vending machine you see or swapping between the same four weapons because the other weapons are just that bad and not worth using. The vigors are this game's version of plasmids but honestly they're a downgrade as well, I found myself using the flame vigor the most because the counterparts for everything else was so completely garbage and useless in the middle of combat outside of a few situational moments or just used up too much of your salts to actually be effective. You also don't carry your own medkits or salts to recharge your vigor uses, instead you have to rely on drops scattered around an area or wait for Elizabeth to see that you're low and hopefully throw you the item you need the most. I almost forgot to mention the shield. I played on medium so I didn't really see a big problem with it. It's pretty insignificant without the infusion upgrades and it's really just a buffer between your health getting shredded instantly but I've heard on hard it's pretty much useless and just a way to take a single bullet while you poke out of cover to shoot at enemies and repeat the process until everything on the screen is dead. This game's equivalent to gene tonics was pretty underwhelming as well and it takes the form of ""gear"" which you can only equip four of at a time in certain slots for each. Your health, salt and shield upgrades take form in infusions which are scattered around the map and pretty hard to miss if you aren't exploring the already limited map or can't use your brain and you can fully max two out of three upgrades. Truthfully, salt upgrades are useless and you should be going for health and shield upgrades first. I haven't even talked about how redundant the gameplay loop is either. Every area you go through is just shoot bad man, progress a little bit forward, shoot more bad men, continue until the end of the chapter where you go through a ""new"" area that looks nearly identical to the last one where you shoot more bad men. I don't think I can recall any interesting side objectives or quests where you spent any longer than 5 minutes doing something for someone that amounts to something meaningful, probably because there are literally none from my memory. Again, this is literally just a prolonged COD campaign with Bioshock's skinned face on it.

Story: Honestly, I don't even want to get in depth with the story, just watch an unbiased review, my patience for this game has been expended. This story is full of plot holes and unanswered questions lined with pseudo-intellectualism, convoluted dimension hopping and time travel. It physically hurts my brain to even think about it's so obnoxious, it amazes me a group of people sat down and decided this was the best story they could come up with. It feels the need to beat you over the head with the story at every turn instead of letting the world tell the story itself like in the first two. There are  points in the game where Elizabeth has to lockpick a door with a lock that doesn't even need to have a lock on it and is literally only there so the game can dump exposition on you, I called them exposition doors. In fact, it isn't even always doors, the game will just randomly stop you from playing the game to dump some more of the story on you. You can think about the story and the events that happen for a few seconds and it falls apart at the seams.

While doing a bit of research and learning about this game and it's development, I have learned that Ken Levine, the creator of Bioshock and director of the 1st game and Infinite, possibly purposely sabotaged the series with this game because he didn't like the fact other people were using the series' name and characters without him. If you weren't aware, he had no hand in Bioshock 2 and I guess he was extremely bitter about that. Not even mentioning the incredible amount of concepts and ideas that were scrapped for no good reason out of the game other than the fact that he just didn't like them, even if it would have genuinely offered more to the game and fit into the world gameplay and narrative wise. The fact anyone could still support him or even justify this heaping mess of a game is pure insanity. Hope his next game flops.

As for the story DLC, it is absolutely a slog to push yourself through. The Burial at Sea EP 1 plays basically the same as the base game except you can carry more than 1 gun for whatever reason now, that being said it is still incredibly boring and almost feels like Bioshock 1 again but falls flat on it's face for almost every reason the base game did. EP 2 however is a STEALTH SECTION, the ENTIRE GAME is a STEALTH SECTION and it is as scuffed as it sounds. If it was refined more it probably could have been better, I honestly enjoyed it more than the base game and first DLC and it almost reminded me of Dishonored. This DLC also retcons the entire series, so if you enjoyed the world and story of these games, INCLUDING this game, this DLC is here to bring that crashing down for you.

This game and it's DLC are an absolute bastardization of Bioshock. I cannot express enough that this game is not even worth getting on sale, save your money for something else and just play the first two games or watch someone else play through this dog vomit. Please, don't touch this game with a 10 ft pole. The time I spent on this game genuinely felt like the biggest waste of time I've ever spent on anything. I wouldn't even wish this game on my worst enemy.",1642402049,1682511337,False,5,2,0.486200422048568726,0,True,False,False

Burial at Sea excels at this, and i applaud it for showing us a glimpse of Rapture before it fell into decay. yet as much as i enjoyed Infinite, i can't deny feeling like it was a bit undeserving of its title. it's the least Bioshock game yet and lacks so many of the characteristics that gave Bioshock its distinct identity. compared to the first Bioshock, it's arguably less creative and undoubtedly less innovative. so many of Infinite's shortcomings come from the simple issue of trying to appeal to the market as opposed to remaining steadfast in the execution of an original vision.

that being said, i appreciate it for what it is. i appreciate it for how it expanded the lore and universe of Bioshock. i appreciate it for trying to stand out and act as a proper farewell to the series, even if it was neutered by the demands of its publisher.

You shoot things, you move forward, you use abilities etc. But it's not a Bioshock game. I don't bemoan the lack of RPG aspects (Bioshock was terrible as an RPG) but there's something overly on-the-rails about Infinite that I feel suffocating. This in comparison to the slow exploration and dread within the original Bioshock and even the System Shock games that inspired it. There's a large dissonance between gameplay and plot, and I feel like half of the time I'm playing in service of the plot. The gameplay is not varied nor does it give me much options to approach. It literally plays like a run of the mill shooter. And then the story itself is not really that engaging as a videogame. You have no choices nor ability to impact the story. 

Games should really excel in one or the other - give me very good and tight gameplay that's enjoyable to go through and I could care less about plot (Sekiro, or Skyrim, or Resident Evil games), or give me a way to impact the plot and I'll slog through even the most dull gameplay (Witcher 3, Disco Elysium, etc). Infinite doesn't work because the gameplay is dull and the plot is linear. It feels like going through a Call-of-Duty campaign. I would commend the writing, which is interesting and engaging. It's just that all this could have been told through a movie or a TV series, where I would not have to slog through playing it. 

Obviously this is my personal opinion, and a lot of people have a lot of praise for 'games that are good movies' like the Last of Us. Honestly, I would give one caveat to this: I loved Uncharted as games. But that's because I always watched Indiana Jones and thought 'damn I wish I could play through that action set-piece'.

For its age Bioshock Infinite still looks like a AAA title that could easily have been released in the last 6 months. Graphics are stunning, and very well optimized for PC. The story integrates well with the previous Bioshock games as seen in the game, although I am yet to try Burial at Sea, which of course takes you back to the iconic Rapture environment. The floating city of Columbia and the character of Booker makes the game unique, although the variety of different collectables and challenges make 100% completion for a completionist like myself rather difficult and sometimes tedious. Rail riding is an interesting game mechanic, but like Doom's glory kill mechanic becomes less of a fun engaging tactic and more repetitive than I would like.

And the Songbird sings
(It's Infinite)

[Verse1] 
This is for the voices who are unheard
who never back-talked one word
to the Songbird
This is for the second class citizens
and prisoners locked alone
I bring a list of things
the Prophet wants you not to know
I've got to blow the propaganda
out the box and so
Open up the rift and put this
disc into your Voxophone
I'll take your brain to
places it doesn't often go
So brace yourself for take
off and watch the show
I'm properly known as Booker DeWitt
And I've had enough of this shit
Fed up of being stuck in a rut
So I'm looking to rough
up a couple of pricks
And accomplish a mission to look
for a woman imprisoned and stuck
in a city where something's amiss
Like the rhythm the government's
drumming to whip
the anger of the people
Daily handling the stress
While I've just ambled in from
gambling and landed in a mess
And I'm telling ya, Elizabeth
isn't a damsel in distress
She's the damn best wingman
to ever don a dress, yes!
To be honest, we've loads of things
In common, we both can bring an opening
We're probably closer twins
Than Robert and Rosalind
I throw my grapple and aim
To blow the back of your brain out
And contemplate on why we
play those irrational games
My main foe is Zachary Hale Comstock
The day his reign begun, a
fundamental bomb dropped
Columbia's on lockdown
Every day they're destroying
somebody, so what now?
Send for Daisy Fitzroy
The rich get fatter, while the
slums are getting hungrier
It's a matter of time before
they pull the rug from under you
We'll make your money disappear
from you like a conjurer
And overthrow the fundies
that are plundering Columbia

And the Songbird sings
(It's Infinite)

[Verse 2]
So, I know this is absurd
and sounds bananas
But have you observed the way
they worship founding fathers?
That's why the Vox Populi
have hurtled out the darkness
Emerged, about to start to turn
around and clout this heartlessness
If this disc is flying, you'll
be dying like you're Hyacinth
Hirelings or higher things
Vox Populi's guys or Jeremiah Fink's
If they pile in on me, then
they'll receive undying violence
I'll lynch the pious kings
with the silent wire strings
From the tiny violins that won't be
crying when they're lying singed
Ignite the tinder,
set the sky
alight in flights of cinders
And let freedom ring inside
your cries like the singer
That's like trying to hide your
violent injuries, as if they're
minor things, by keeping just
a tiny thimble on your finger
One hand holds Vigors
The other pulls triggers
I'm a multi-tasking action man
with a glass full of malt liquor
Salt licker
Rapture's contraptions are fantastic
But don't exist yet, so that
is how we pack Plasmids
No need to hack gadgets
The manner in which I battle a
Handyman is akin to black magic
My life's a play where
every act's tragic

Personally, i really like the way those games tells the stories. Other than going through the main storyline, you also able to collect radio messages that reveals some part of the deep lore of the series. Bioshock 1 and 2 tells a really beautifully written story about the events and each characters. The gameplay also feels very fun and challenging. For bioshock inf, for me it feels like they trying to go deeper with the story but still managed to pull out an amazing story and a lot of unexpected plot twist (ngl i kinda expect some plot twist already before even starting the dlc lol) although the story can be confusing for me to understand [spoiler]due to the fact that it involves multiverse[/spoiler]. The gameplay also feels more challenging than previous games due to the limit usage of weapons and vigors but still manageable i guess.

Decided to restart the series since getting my PC, and all has been going pretty great so far, but the lack of good and proper subtitles in Infinite alone is very much upsetting. The subtitles we do get are so small they're almost useless, the art subtitles is equally as minuscule, but for some reason is also hidden in the top left corner of the screen, and the Voxophone dialogue just has no subtitles at all.
The keyboard remapping options are for some reason very limited. There's no way to cycle through Vigors the way you could Plasmids in previous games.
And my final point of critique for now is that screens are often super small for no reason. The pause menu is tiny, making the already barely legible text that much smaller with it, the video demos when you get a new vigor and those silent movies all around the game are equally as absurdly tiny for how much space my monitor has to use.

An almost polar opposite art style to the first two Bioshock games, but having Colombia so perfectly contrast with Rapture makes Bioshock Infinite feel like Bioshock, as it takes an entirely different approach at representing the same idea of dystopia.

It's an experience that transcends the boundaries of traditional gaming and leaves a lasting impression on the player.

The world of Bioshock Infinite is breathtaking, with its floating city of Columbia and the stunning architecture that makes it feel like a real, lived-in place. The attention to detail is evident in every aspect of the game, from the music to the sound effects, which help to create an atmosphere that is both eerie and captivating.

The gameplay is equally impressive, with a satisfying mix of gunplay, exploration, and puzzle-solving. But what really sets Bioshock Infinite apart is its characters. The game's themes of redemption, forgiveness, and sacrifice are explored in depth, and the relationship between the two main characters, Booker and Elizabeth, is one of the most touching and memorable in gaming history. From the lovable Elizabeth to the enigmatic Comstock, each character is fleshed out and given a unique backstory that adds depth and complexity to the game's narrative.

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

An amazing, yet flawed, work of art that is a must play, atleast once. But in this special case, it is best played only once. This game does a lot perfectly. The presentation, the music, the characters, the visuals, the setpieces, the feel and the overall presentation is all done very very well. But the cracks will start to show on subsequent playthroughs. Despite how messy and flawed the story can be, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Left me genuinely spellbound at the ending. Try to not focus too much on the logic and science of it. I would love to play this for the first time again in the future if i could. Regardless, I do feel that I will find myself back in the game sooner or later. Columbia is a gorgeous place and the tale of Booker DeWitt is a great one. 

The DLC is well done, confuses the story a lot, but overall ties everything up very nicely. The new gameplay elements are especially good and just coming back to Rapture after Bioshock 1 is just a pure delight. Do play it after the game. But I have to say, TREAT IT LIKE AN ALTERNATE ENDING.

The game takes place in the city of Columbia, which is set in the clouds and has incredibly detailed and fantastic graphics. The main character of the game is Booker DeWitt, a former Pinkerton Agency agent who is hired to rescue a girl named Elizabeth from the tower where she has been held for her entire life. And it is this girl, Elizabeth, that makes BioShock Infinite a unique experience.

Elizabeth is one of the most iconic and touching characters in gaming history. She's smart, funny, and has incredible abilities that help the player throughout the game. Her relationship with Booker is very compelling and develops on multiple levels, giving the game depth and emotional gravity.

The story of the game itself is very complex and full of surprises. It covers various themes such as racism, religion, freedom and destiny. The game takes you to multiple dimensions and different timelines, making BioShock Infinite one of the most amazing gaming experiences.

The game's graphics are incredibly detailed and atmospheric, drawing you into the world of Columbia and making you feel like you are in the time when the city was founded. The gameplay is also very well designed, allowing players to use a variety of weapons and plasmids to survive in a hostile environment.

Overall, BioShock Infinite is one of the best story-driven games of all time. With memorable characters, a complex storyline and fantastic graphics, the game offers an experience that will completely immerse you.

I asked him why the gameplay for Bioshock Infinite was so fun but the story was such a step down from the other two games. Then we ranted about the missed opportunity of the game for at least an hour. He gave me an original sketch from Bioshock 2 which was incredibly thoughtful. One of the nicest people I've ever met.  

That being said, the gameplay still holds up today, but damn the story is horrible. It's written so awkwardly and everytime I play it it gets worse. Elizabeth is mad one second and fine the other. One minute Booker doesn't know what he wants but then all of a sudden he's a good guy. There's a spot where Booker tells Elizabeth why he's there in the game, but when he repeats it in the cutscene now Elizabeth is mad. You might be thinking that this is nitpicking for a game that came out in 2013, but Bioshock 1 had better character building for a character that doesn't even talk.

While Bioshock 1 and 2 famously set up heavily political worlds and scenarios for you to march through, it was always very clear the game had an opinion on the extremely Ayn Randian politics of Rapture and what it has to say about unhinged capitalist-libertarianism, and it was additionally clear what message the player was supposed to take away from the experience, and even the moral choice system of the game fed into the experience of the morals of Bioshock 1 and 2: are you just as vile as the rest because you are allowed to be, or do you attempt to remain good even in a society where morality seems to have failed?

Bioshock Infinite, despite creating an almost obsessively detailed and accurate depiction of early 20th century racism as well as robber-baron cronyism, in addition to having a side narrative about a main character ashamed of his role in the Wounded Knee massacre and a people's liberation movement, somehow winds up with nothing to say about any of the world and characters it has so meticulously constructed other than the tired and extremely uninformed perspective of ""the oppressed fighting back against their oppressors is just as bad as the oppression itself"". On top of this, all of the potential in the world for the main character to tie his highly political backstory into the highly political themes of the game is never touched.

Overall, Bioshock Infinite fails miserably at having anything to say with its story, set-up, or characters, almost dumbfoundingly so, when compared to how much effort was clearly put into constructing those elements. You might as well play a Call of Duty game, which, much like Bioshock Infinite, has nothing to say other than ""follow the dotted line and shoot the things that pop up along the way"".

If you're reading this, odds are that you have some opinion of BioShock Infinite, and it's likely to be a passionate one. When it released in March 2013, it generated enormous fanfare, inspiring strong stances from both excited series fans and those who felt let down by the final product. It continues to garner polarized reactions 10 years later, perhaps to an alarming extent. Once you go beyond the social media furor and the thwarted expectations, you have a game that ultimately failed to live up to the identity of its own series--and one that deserves neither the seemingly-bottomless stores of love and hate that some still heap on it.

The by-the-numbers nature of BioShock Infinite is perhaps most apparent in its moment-to-moment gameplay. Though ostensibly intended as the true successor to the original BioShock, Infinite simplifies the mechanics of the ""immersive sim""-inspired series to the absolute minimum. The FPS part of this so-called ""FPS RPG"" series is tuned to max, and the RPG part is nearly cast away entirely.

Not only does it have fewer Vigors than both previous BioShock entries had Plasmids, it replaces the Gene Tonics system with a generic Gear system that allows for much less customization than in BioShock 1 and 2. Infinite also lacks the research camera system, a key non-combat mechanic of the original two games, and an important part of their identity. Infinite removes several other staples of the immersive sim genre, including the ability to hack objects--there's no Pipedream-inspired minigame here.

While there's nothing wrong with changing the mechanics of a series, Infinite doesn't add much to replace them. Sure, there's the Skyhook traversal system, which allows the game's gunfights more scale and verticality, but it's not used to its full potential. Elizabeth's tear powers are somewhat interesting at first glance, but they basically boil down to giving you either cover or resources, and it gets old fast. Similarly, the fact that Booker is limited to carrying two weapons at a time (one of the all-time worst design conceits in FPS history) means that you're usually stuck using the same guns over and over, even when you'd prefer to try something new.

Over the years, director Ken Levine and others have acknowledged that BioShock Infinite experienced significant design troubles during its lengthy development. For example, originally, the player would pick up individual Tonics by exploring the world, with each bottle being a single use. This was replaced with a more generic mana pool system in the final game. Other major changes included the reworking of Nostrums into Gear, which were set to be Infinite's version of Gene Tonics, as well as additional weapons, enemies, and levels left on the cutting room floor.

Perhaps the biggest casualty of the game's final stretch of development was Levine's ambitious plans for 1999 Mode. This would have transformed the game into something like System Shock 2, complete with the player choosing a class at its outset, and being unable to remove the Nostrums/Gear that they equipped, making every choice a major commitment. In the final game, 1999 Mode is a fairly standard ultra-hard difficulty that has very few of these aspects, retaining only a mild monetary cost for death.

It's easy to understand how these RPG elements were stripped from BioShock Infinite. In 2013, the immersive sim genre was at its lowest ebb, and it wasn't clear if there was much demand for these kinds of mechanics in FPS games. In the years since, games like 2017's Prey, Deathloop, and indie shooter Cruelty Squad have shown that there is indeed a market for more crunchy ""imsim""-inspired fare. The System Shock reboot coming in May 2023 will be another test for the genre, which has always had question marks around its sales numbers.

This isn't to say that BioShock Infinite doesn't have its strong points, of course. Columbia is an extremely well-realized setting, all gilded streets and bright banners. The game also features some of the best-written characters of its era, from heroine Elizabeth to the delightful insanity of the Lutece twins. Spectacle is Infinite's strong suit--but nuance is its greatest weakness. The political themes that the series is perhaps best-known for are perhaps the most widely criticized aspect of its third entry, but that's for good reason.

One of BioShock Infinite's most telling scenes occurs less than 30 minutes into its runtime. Our intrepid hero, Booker DeWitt, wanders into a raffle in the floating marvel that is the city of Columbia, where he draws the winning ball, lucky number 77. When he steps forward to claim his prize, the curtain rises to reveal a bound interracial couple amidst clearly racist carnival imagery, such as monkeys carrying wedding rings. The ugly truth is revealed: This raffle is nothing but an excuse to punish those who refuse to bow to white supremacy. The game then prompts you to either throw the ball at the couple or at the announcer. Regardless of the choice you make, a nearby guard grabs Booker's arm, recognizing his tattoo as the sign of the ""false shepherd,"" and the first-person shooting begins in earnest.

On paper, this scene is intended to serve as an early revelation as to the true nature of Columbia, similar to the famous twist at the end of Shirley Jackson's short story ""The Lottery.""

Like many other moments in BioShock Infinite, however, the scene is so one-note and over-the-top that it feels that it's the game hitting you over the head with the ball. The studio behind Infinite, Irrational Games, seems so committed to reminding you that racism is bad every five minutes--a statement so bland and uncontroversial that it's barely worth saying more than once--that it ends up drowning out almost anything else that the game has to say.

This scene reveals one of the fundamental problems with BioShock Infinite: It has very little to offer about racism or America beyond this obvious truth. Sure, the seminal BioShock 1 is not exactly subtle in its critique of libertarianism and writer Ayn Rand's greater worldview, but there are many people in the world who sincerely believe in that ideology and would like to see it enacted. Though there is no doubt that we still live in a racist society, the faces and parties that promote those policies are those that oppose open, more overt racism--for now, at least.

Though there's plenty of room for video games that explore the particulars of structural racism, BioShock Infinite is not one of them--instead, it's blaring a klaxon that's so uncontroversial that its political edge is hopelessly blunted in the process. And when the game descends into ""both-sides"" pandering when the Vox Populi plot becomes a wrong-footed critique of revolutionary politics near its conclusion--an aspect of the game that has been mocked and dissected and retconned so thoroughly that it hardly seems worth discussing--you can't help but wonder if the game had anything to say in the first place.

When played today, more than anything, BioShock Infinite feels like the product of its era. A well-made but ultimately compromised AAA series entry that tried to appeal to everyone, it could be convincingly argued that Infinite succeeded in its aims: It sold millions of copies and garnered rave reviews on release. That said, the passing of a decade has not been kind to Infinite, and I doubt the next will be any nicer. The industry has changed a lot since 2013, and I suspect that a BioShock 4 that leans more into the series' core identity would do better today than revisiting the half-hearted Infinite approach.",1679894388,1679894388,True,1,0,0.496240615844726563,0,True,False,False

bioshock: infinite is a fps adventure game developed by irrational games and published by 2k in march of 2013. you play as booker dewitt, voiced by troy baker, as he heads to an colorful airborne steampunk city called columbia to retrieve a girl named elizabeth. after bioshock (2007), ken levine (creative director of irrational games) wanted to make a game like infinite, however, they eventually made a deal with 2k where a new studio would be created under 2k and they would develop bioshock 2, irrational games then started working on infinite around the same time the new studio at 2k was working on bioshock 2.

it was february 2008 when they had started concept work on infinite, and 2k had given irrational game a large amount of creative freedom. ken levine had a notoriously infamous creative process which has been described as ""brilliant but time-consuming."" he focused on very small details and would change his mind on the fly after spending hours (or days or weeks) on a singular aspect of the game. they finally announced infinite two and a half years after they started working on it in august of 2010, and in the next two and a half years leading up to the 2013 release, irrational went through a period of sustained crunch while a ton of stuff was cut from the final product. the game ultimately took about 5 years total to make, and would be the last game irrational games made before they rebranded as ghost story games (still led by ken levine).

infinite takes place in 1912 and is set in a floating steampunk city called ""columbia"" which was founded by a self-proclaimed prophet. the city was funded by the american government as a floating display of american exceptionalism. columbia eventually would secede from the united states and become a theocratic police state where the founding fathers are religious icons. racism and elitism run rampant throughout the city, as the lower class is almost entirely comprised of minorities who are extremely marginalized in columbia. right around the events of the game where you go to columbia, a civil war is on the verge of braking out between the elite and a resistance group that fights for the rights of the marginalized.

infinite is a fps but does incorporate rpg elements, as it adapts the gameplay loop of bioshock (2007) with similar guns/weapons and powers. also featured is a voiced protagonist, as the first two bioshock games had silent protagonists. in my opinion, infinite has the best story and art style of all three bioshock games, and infinite has been praised as having one of the better stories in video game history. one common thought is infinite didn't lose momentum after a certain plot point like the first bioshock did after the big twist reveal. the setting of columbia has also been widely praised and has similarly been considered one of the best settings in gaming history. rapture was great in it's own right, but columbia had the color and vibrance that rapture lacked. everything you encounter in columbia contributes to your understanding of the world and society in columbia, whether it's a horrifying event happening to you or someone around you, listening to an audio log, or just looking at propaganda that is all over the city.

overall, bioshock infinite is a spectacular title from the early-to-mid 2010s that has strong themes that are open to interpretation and speculation. it tackles topics such as religion and does so admirably. the fact you can get it for $7.49 on sale regularly is insane and an absolute steal for a masterpiece of a video game and the pinnacle of the bioshock franchise.",1679369101,1679369101,True,1,0,0.46257627010345459,0,True,False,False

Elizabeth did make the game interesting, and the story was decent, weapons were awesome.  Besides that, the things I didn't care for:

First: Columbia is NOT Rapture (obviously), but I just couldn't get into the whole atmosphere of this ""City in the Sky"" thing.  Take me back to the sea!

Second:  The whole travel by grabbing a skyhook thing sucked (MY opinion) and whirled you around so fast that you often don't know just where to jump off or whether it was just the same platform that you started on.

Third: NO MANUAL SAVE!!  That is a big one for me because the automatic save points seemed to be stretched too far apart sometimes and you have to go back and play half a level if you die.

The next 8-9 hours play out really smoothly. Great gunplay. Great new Plasmids. Great story and interactions between you and Elizabeth.

A gruff male with the pleasantly old-timey name of Booker DeWitt travels by rocket chair to Columbia, a flying city where people make 20 second recordings of their deepest secrets and leave them lying around in cupboards. He has been sent to retrieve a woman named Elizabeth, who has the magical ability to summon a box full of first aid kits from an alternate dimension.

Booker wanders around in awe, observing the racist population as they throw machine gun ammunition in the trash and stare silently at nothing. But his sightseeing is cut short when a policeman tries to grab him and he's forced to explode 1000 heads with a giant rotating hook in self-defence.

After exploding enough heads, Booker is taken to an alternate reality where the underclass of Columbia has risen up in rebellion. ""These revolutionaries are as bad as their racist oppressors,"" says the deadliest serial killer in the history of human civilization, ""because they are violent."" Fortunately, the entire setting is erased from existence and nothing of consequence ever happens. Metacritic rating 95 (94 on Xbox).

You have to find this mystery girl named Elizabeth and are supposed to bring her back to this certain person and they will ""wipe away the debt"". And the rest is history, i'm not one to think video game characters are hot but man Elizabeth is smoking lol xD. But this game is awesome! Great story, great and beautiful atmosphere, memorable characters, great gameplay, and great soundtrack this game absolutely check all the boxes of what a great game needs to be successful. The dlc in this game are pretty cool burial at sea episode 1 and 2, they will definitely throw you for a loop that's all i'm gonna say about that. And i had to save the best for last ""CITC"" Clash In The Clouds its a pretty fun wave based mode with 4 different maps, the more waves you go the harder it gets. But overall i like it and its pretty fun! However if you find yourself wanting to 100% this game there is one achievement that is time consuming and rage inducing. I'm talking about ""Blue Ribbon Champ"" Man this achievement took me sooo many hours to get. Constant restarting from Wave 14 or 15. Very rage inducing and annoying if you ask me but hey i did it lol. Basically every map has 15 waves, in those 15 waves every wave has a certain challenge you need to complete to get the blue ribbon as they call it. But say you've gotten up to wave 15 the last wave and your fail the challenge you have to start allllll over again from wave 1. Its a pretty infuriating achievement to get its definitely a grind but its worth it to say ""Im the blue ribbom champ"" lol. However don't let this discourage your from playing Bioshock Infinite, its a awesome game and its absolutely worth a play in 2023!!!

8870,132721541,76561198086721268,948,97,3008,0,1807,1678610476,"I played a lot before writing a review, and I still have mixed feelings about BioShock Infinite.

I dislike nearly every character in the game. The game's story is incoherent, which is fine, but it wants me to feel deeply sympathetic to some truly awful people, which is not. Aesthetically, the environments and animations are breathtakingly beautiful; mechanically, the shooting [i]feels[/i] great: it's so clear that everyone tried [i]so[/i] hard to make this a great game. It is not.

I do not regret my time playing. I just wish that it had been a better game, with more to say as a whole work of art, rather than leaving me to appreciate all the composite pieces and wonder what might have been.

In an alternate universe, this game is ""Columbia Infinite"" and is mostly loved, and likewise I'd probably just let most of these criticisms slide. By making Infinite a BioShock game, then not executing on the core BioShock-isms that made BioShock distinct art, it makes me frustrated that it could have and should have been a lot more than it was.

Or at least it could have made good sense, instead of making goofy profundities like ""constants and variables"" stand in for a real functioning plotline. Allusions are not plot. Easter eggs are not plot. I think this game will be immortalized for having killed off the series. [spoiler]Now that I've finished Burial at Sea, I can confirm, this was definitely the point of Infinite. It almost feels mean-spirited, like someone in management really tried hard to kill off BioShock as a franchise on purpose by cleaving all possible reentry points into the series one by one.[/spoiler]

The difficulty is quite unusual, spiking quite abruptly at times, but usually [b]too[/b] easy (especially if you, like me, are looting every tucked-away secret the whole game through).

Don't care for Clash in the Clouds, it's basically just PvE with arbitrary extra challenges. The museum is kind of nice, but I'd rather just have had access to the museum rather than having to grind for a few hours to eyeball some paintings and statues. The music was really fun to listen to, though.

Haven't yet played Burial at Sea, but I imagine it will be at least alright. Update: Wow. I have now played Burial at Sea. I have opinions, and they are [b]even more deeply mixed[/b]. On the other hand, this is how I always imagined Rapture with people in it. Just, beautiful, but painfully clear that the people who inhabit it are fundamentally broken and unable to be happy. [spoiler]Plus they clearly dusted off their hands and declared job done on the whole series. Except instead of being internally consistent with the first two games, they used Infinite as a framework into which the main games fit. So it really, really ruins all three games without either completely ignoring Infinite and Burial at Sea altogether or rebooting the whole franchise and hoping [i]that[/i] goes well.[/spoiler]

I did not purchase Columbia's Finest. The base game is so easy that you won't need it at all. Maybe the gear helps for 1999 mode or speedruns.

I'm saying a lot of bad-sounding things, but they really did try their damnedest to make this a great game, and I appreciate that their presentation was so well done that I actually thought actively about the game, it's setting, it's connection to our timeline and the Rapture timelines, the nature of redemption, and so many other things. I don't know how they did all this, and still managed to make the bigotry plot elements so clunky. To make one of the main bad guys be literally named ""Fink"". To bring up labor issues [i]in a game with cyborgs and vigors[/i] and not really do anything with it except put up posters and have some NPC convos you can eavesdrop upon.

- Elizabeth, universally agreed upon as one of the greatest narrative companions in any action game.

- Troy Bakers Booker DeWitt
- Absolutely stunning world and visuals
- Great worldbuilding, ambience and lovely music
- Extremely talented voice actors
- Amazing story, despite controversy about final act and some narrative tunnel vision in the later half

When I heard Bioshock Infinite was approaching its 10th year anniversary I felt sheepish at how long I had managed to put things off.  I was in a bit of a lull period on a weekend so I loaded it up, after checking Infinite was a standalone game.

The first thing I felt was the presentation even at the level of the game menus was the best I had ever seen in a game, maybe only Syberia had approached it in my experience.  The music was amazing too, and the game didn't try to wow me with flash or action to start.  No, it had a quiet understated confidence and integrity that was compelling and nailed the mood and setting.

Like most good books or scripts it starts with a good opening hook too.
Elizabeth: ""Booker, are you afraid of God?""
Booker: ""No, but I'm afraid of you.""

The voice acting is spot on from the start and I have nothing but praise to share about that too.

The graphics despite being 10 years old now, hold up well.  The look of the characters can take some getting used to, but upon reading up on it, it was very intentional.  At first a realistic Elizabeth was used, with motion capture.  Player feedback on it though said people ignored her a lot during gameplay so they entirely scrapped all that work and redid it with exaggerated facial features you could tell their expressions at longer distances and keyframed all the animations by hand.

If that sounds excessive, that is par for the course for director Kevin Levine commonly said to be an auteur (from filmaking someone so involved of every aspect of the creation of a movie they are said to be the author) of the video game world.  Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock are examples.  He reported that about 2 games worth of things were scrapped during production and he's well known to be a perfectionist and stubborn in sticking to his vision.  On the negative side, he has a high employee burnout rate due to demoralization in part from having so many things scrapped.  His games also take a very long time to make.  (Judas coming out was in development for over 7 years). 

The music draws from a lot of existing songs, but all are renditions that fit the theme and tone of the game or the moment they appear.  There's also dynamic battle music, that has things that insert themselves dramatically when there's headshots and other events.  Elizabeth also aids you in battle, and the world comes alive in part through your interaction with her and her interactions with the world. 

I can't say much more for it without giving away too much, but I think Bioshock Infinite is a game you need to experience to understand.  For me it's one of my favorite games now and I'm going to play the expansion soon.  A lot of people commented that Bioshock games proved to them video games can be art, I don't think personally that was ever up for question, but if someone doubts it then perhaps have them play this game.",1678079295,1678079313,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Only able to carry two guns, having a regenerating shield, and other dumb tropes in every generic FPS game! Stay away from this mediocre experience and go play Bioshock 2, objectively the best game in the franchise! Elizabeth's super power is literally opening plot holes in the story. They transverse universes to complete a simply fetch quest because they're so stupid they didn't think about how they were going to transport a pile of guns. Then they go to a universe where they already delivered the guns, so everything that happened in the previous universe was pointless. In the scene where Elizabeth attempts to bash Booker's head in with a book, the book in question is has the title ""The Principles of Quantum Mechanics"" by Rosalind Lutece. This is symbolic of how the game literally beats the crux of its narrative into your head.

The game starts of really strong with an interesting premise and beautiful world. It really is fun to just walk around and look at everything and discover lore and characters. Using the guns and powers together is cool and so are a few of the enemies.

Real quick on the story.....it's okay. It starts off strong and then about 3/4 of the way through it really goes off the rails. It sort of gets it together towards the end, but at that point i found myself just waiting for them to wrap it up. 

MY BIGGEST PROBLEM with the game is the difficulty difference. I played on Hard for the majority of the game, until the lack of money you get on hard mode made it so I never got to upgrade my powers or most weapons. So I hit a point where the gameplay became a chore. Highly recommend playing on normal. Much better game. You can actually have fun with the powers and weapons.

Pros: 
* Great environment / graphics. Game looks very nice, especially for a 2013-era game. Columbia is a great setting, bright and grandiose with great visuals.
* Uh.....

Cons: 
* Linear gameplay. Compared to 1 and 2, this game is much more linear. Events are scripted, the areas are always a straight path with the occasional open area (1 entrance, 1 exit), for combat purposes. Bioshock 1 and 2 had goals you had to accomplish, but much more open level plans where you could meander and explore before accomplishing said objectives.

* Below-average gunplay/gameplay loop: Gunplay was severely mediocre in this game. A lot of guns were very samey, with very simplistic upgrades of +damage or +reload speed. There was a melee weapon which really wasn't that interesting. Not much to say here. Very underwhelming compared to the drill / various upgrades from 1+2. For some god-forsaken reason, you can only have 2 guns at a time, swapping whenever and enemy drops them. Perhaps you're into that, but for me it was incredibly restricting and didn't even make sense. You bought an upgrade for a certain gun, then threw it away? You get to keep it the next time you pick one off an enemy! I guess those enemies coincidentally had the same upgrades you bought 3 stages ago?

* Tying into above, the ""plasmid"" (vigor) systems. In bioshock 1+2, plasmids/ADAM/Eve were all cohesively part of the story and made sense. They tied into eachother and were all relevant throughout the game, relating to the plot in a significant way. In Infinite, Vigors are there because...... it's a bioshock game I guess? They could have removed vigors and the game would be almost exactly the same. They don't tie into the plot in the slightest, and are a completely ""modular"" part to the game.

In addition, plasmids (vigors) were incredibly less useful and samey. Every single power fell into ""Press right click to do primary projectile! Hold right click to set trap!"" (Except ram/charge I guess?). They were much less useful in Infinite, in addition to not having any connection story/lore-wise. 

* Story: The overall story seemed incredibly contrived and a tad bit pretentious. It alternated between being about slavery/race relations, time travel/alternate dimensions, and making fun of religious/libertarian types, and did none of these topic/satires justice. They touched on these topics on a very shallow level, but there really aren't any lessons to take from these. None of these topics are explored in significant depth, and the game really tries to pretend it's some artistic masterpiece with a deep, moral lesson to be learned. It's *incredibly* shallow and a bit insulting.

* Voice acting / dialogue / character development: There's something about Booker / Elizabeth's acting/development that just doesn't *work*. Their dialogue is usually cringy and out of place. Hard to say without spoiling exactly, but (usually) elizabeth will make some sort of cringe-worthy comment emotional/developmental comment, then immediately go back to being an emotionless robot. It's very weird to describe, but the dialogue and character development feels *extremely* inorganic, as nobody in these 2 peoples shoes would react in the way that Booker and Elizabeth did. It's difficult to describe.

* Elizabeth in a gameplay sense. Props to the developers for not making her an escort mission and keeping her out of fights - honestly, good work. But she really only exists to toss you money / ammo / health / EVE at a constant rate. It's kind of jarring how her only gameplay purpose is just a glorified item dispensary. Dunno how to describe this well, but it was weird.

There are a few more things I could go into, but Infinite was incredibly mediocre - 5/10. I would not recommend it over 1 or 2 remastered, It's a decent *game*, but a fairly bad *bioshock* game.",1677982625,1677982625,False,1,0,0.479843109846115112,0,True,False,False

First off for a bias, I am really not a fan of longer games without the option for manual saves (I like to be able to call it a night without having to slog to an autosave point, plus in my last play through the cat jumped on the keyboard and locked me into proceeding to the endgame section). Additionally the game crashed (only twice, thankfully), which was very frustrating to then slog back through a section. When your game is on the longer side without a great narrative reason (ex: some horror games) to not have manual saves it irritates me. 

Gameplay and story-wise, it is a expansion of the lore set up by the previous Bioshock titles (of course Burial at Sea really does this more). It may be overly pretentious at points, but hey-it's still a fun time. It does make some changes from previous titles such as a 2 weapon limit which did take some getting used to, but I eventually got over it.

Who doesn't love shooting crows out of their hands? Seriously, that's some next-level superhero stuff.

The floating city of Columbia is like nothing you've seen before. Sure, it's a dystopian society rife with violence and oppression, but it's pretty to look at!

You get to team up with Elizabeth, a companion with a personality and backstory that puts most other video game characters to shame. Plus, she can open up tears in space-time, which is pretty handy.

The storyline is a mind-bending trip that will have you questioning everything you thought you knew about reality. Who needs drugs when you have Bioshock Infinite?

The game's soundtrack is pretty darn good. You might even find yourself humming ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken"" long after you've finished playing.

The final battle is one of the most epic and visually stunning moments in gaming history. Seriously, you'll feel like a total badass taking on the forces of evil.

The game depicts a multiverse in which an infinite number of universes exist, each with their own unique attributes resulting from different events. In this case, the pivotal event is the protagonist's baptism at a specific point in time. The universe where the protagonist is baptized becomes the universe of Comstock and Columbia, while the universe where he is not baptized becomes the universe of Booker and Ana.

Comstock, who exists in the universe where the protagonist is baptized, is unable to have children and ultimately travels to the universe where he is not baptized to take Ana from Booker. Booker, on the other hand, returns to the universe where he is not baptized to rescue his daughter and kill Comstock. However, he discovers that this universe is also one of countless others that have diverged due to the baptism event, which is split into universe A and B.

Don't buy it. The publisher 2K is doing their best to make future digital purchases of their games a bad idea.
You are forced to install the 2K-games launcher and create an accout on their platform.
So far, you can  add:
""BioShockInfinite"" -run %command% 
to the launch options of the game to circumvent this, 
but who knows how long it takes for 2K to patch this out?
At that point, you are no longer purchashing the game, but only the permission to play it. 
And what gurantee do you have with this new license agreement that they will not make further changes to the title?

If you are interested in the game: Look for a (used) physical  copy; if possible with the expansions included.
That way, you will have a save copy.
The developers were already payed for the game. Only the greedy publisher is still profiting from this title nowadays. If you want to support the makers of the game, support the indivuals that made it, and whatever projects they are working on nowadays.
If you already have the game, back up the files so 2K can't screw with the game any further.

For Bioshock Infinite itself: It's good. Solid 8/10, despite it's flaws.
It's still a well made, enjoyable game. The setting is fleshed out, the maps offer incredible detail. The gameplay is fun. The story is engaging. You will be engrossed in the story and it's charactes, and it's messages are mostly conveyed well.
It only starts showing it's cracks when you look at it in depth, which the game's ending asks you to do.

[spoiler]
While Bioshock Infinite is nowehere near is genre defining as it's predecessors,
it's still memorable in it's own right. The setpieces and presentation are exceptional.
And while it's still old, the game's extreme amount of detail still rivals modern releases, whith art design helping a lot to keep the game timeless despite it havng aged graphically.

The game ditched many of the light RPG features of prior games and focused more on being a First Person Action Shooter.

But, like those prior Bioshock games, the game is incredible ambitious - something modern games lack.
Irrational games wanted not to just make another action game. They wanted to elevate great gameplay with a thought provoking story. A triple-A game with genuine political themes and critiques about certain apsects of society and history.

And like the critique about Objectivism previous titles had, Infinite, too, wants to emerge the player in it's details.
This time, it's about American Exceptionalism, Religous Fanaticism, R-cism and fighting personal trauma.

This does not always work, especially due to game's industry influences of the time. For example: 
RPGs work best with a silent protagonist, as it allows the player to fill in the blanks the best.
With the light-RPG elements gone, so goes the risk of clashing player intent with the narrative too much.
Irrational games had the opportunity to make the protagonist an intersting part of the narrative.
Instead, Booker DeWit is the epitome of early 2010s game protagonist writing: The ""tragic, rough, tough guy with a heart of gold"" trope in it's extreme. A shallow trope created to make the violent gameplay not clash with the story too much.
Having an uninteresting protagonist is going to make any story suffer.
Next, the game is about as subtle as a jackhammer with it's messaging. As mentioned above, Infinite has a lot of ideas.
But with the messaging being hammered in your face, it lacks any of the thought provoking qualities prior titles had.
There is still intrigue to be had, but it stems more from the mystery elements of the story, and less it's hamfisted messaging.
And lastly: Bioshock 1+2, part of the story heavily revolved arround gameplay mechanics, such as the implications of an easy-to-access magic system in a world without morales.
But in Bioshock Infinite, gameplay mechanics feel completly dissonant from the story.
Ironically, the game has more themes and ideas than it's prequels, but it fails to actually implement them in the gameplay itself.  And furthermore, the story telling is also not done within gameplay itself. The gameplay switches between two modes: 1) slow story moments, which are essentially interactive cutscenes, and 2) - bombastic action movie scenes.
Speaking off: Those combat sequences are exceptional. Even if the survival horror elements are gone and the challenge being far lower than prior titles, it's still top notch action fps gameplay; even 10 years later.

In the end, despite it's flaws, the game is still absolutly good,
and an easy recommendation to anyone who enjoys a good story-driven FPS.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a Virtual Youtuber empire for over a year now and using me as his recruiter. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my Live2D knowledge to recruit talents, which he would then hire using his connections in the Japanese utaite world. Connections that he made through his career with Niconico. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small indie channel could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Motoaki ""Yagoo"" Tanigo, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Yagoo threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Yagoo had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Yagoo flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Yagoo was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Riku Tazumi , he plotted to kill Yagoo, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Cover Corp, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my vtubing activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore.

Firstly, let's talk about the story. Bioshock Infinite's narrative is ambitious, to say the least. It deals with complex themes like racism, nationalism, and the nature of reality itself. And for the most part, it handles these themes with a deft touch. The game's setting, the floating city of Columbia, is a sight to behold. The attention to detail is remarkable, and the city's inhabitants are an interesting bunch.

But, as with any ambitious story, there are a few missteps. The game's ending, in particular, is divisive. Some love it, some hate it. Personally, I'm in the latter camp. The ending feels like a bit of a cop-out, and the game's attempts to tie up all the loose ends feel rushed and unsatisfying.

Moving on to gameplay, Bioshock Infinite is a mixed bag. The shooting mechanics are solid, and the vigors (the game's equivalent of plasmids) are fun to use. But the game's biggest flaw is its repetitiveness. The game falls into a pattern of ""go to location A, kill everyone, move on to location B, kill everyone,"" and it gets old fast. The game's attempts to mix things up with ""tear"" abilities (which allow you to manipulate the environment) and the skylines (which allow you to travel quickly around the city) are admirable, but they don't do enough to alleviate the monotony.

And finally, let's talk about the characters. Bioshock Infinite's cast is one of its strongest assets. Elizabeth, in particular, is a standout. She's a well-written, well-acted character, and her relationship with Booker is the heart of the game. Booker himself is a bit of a cipher, but his interactions with Elizabeth make him more interesting than he would be otherwise. The villains, on the other hand, are a mixed bag. Comstock is a compelling antagonist, but the other villains feel like they're just there to be killed.

In conclusion, Bioshock Infinite is a flawed but ambitious game. Its story and characters are strong, but its gameplay can feel repetitive, and its ending is divisive. If you're a fan of the original Bioshock, it's worth checking out. But if you're looking for a game that's a step above its predecessor, you might be disappointed.",1677406717,1677406717,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay was a little too linear to me, it took too much inspiration from other FPS games at the time as well. The plot really has too much going on for it to land everything properly in my opinion. The plot-lines of political struggle, racism, multiple dimensions + time travel all feel underdeveloped and lack focus. The DLC Burial At Sea does make some major improvements (especially regarding weapon limit), and the story feels much more focused. However, I really dislike the amount of retconning of events in the main story and the ""Star Wars prequelizing"" of BioShock 1. I actually think Burial At Sea actively damages and ruins a lot of the plot in the original BioShock by over-explaining and re-contextualising things in that game. I also personally experienced severe crashing issues, just like BioShock 1 and 2 Remastered. On the positive side, I think Columbia is still a beautiful location, the voice acting is still great, and the gameplay is still very enjoyable especially compared to other FPS games at the time.

My reason for a negative review is that this is ""Not"" a BioShock Game.
Its really only appearing to be one.
It does it really well, but it is at the end of the day not a BioShock Game.

The main reasons it fails to be a quote end quote ""BioShock"" Game boils down to a few simple things.

Reason 1: Choice
In the previous games, Choice has lasting impact at the end of the game and gave the player to ""choose"" how they wanted to play/end their game.
They could have the feeling, even if surface level, abiltiy to play/role-play the ""villian/anti-hero""
The choices changed charger behaviours, story beats, and events. Mainly the endings in which would allow the player to ""make"" their own cannon, while the devs could create the "" actual cannon"".
BioShock 2 I believe did this the best, if to a fault by having alot of endings at the cost of not feeling as impactful or different form each, with not enough choices in the game to allow for them to work.
Think it would have been better with just the flat 3.

Reason 2. Tone & Atmosphere.
This one is up for argument, as the tone of the new setting does feel like the alt-timeline that Bio-Shock, Fallout, and many other are well known for.
However, given the past games, the more darker feeling is completly replaced for a more ""cheery/sadistic""
nature, gives everything almost a manaquine cold smile feel.
While works, just doesnt have the same energy as the previous Bio-Shocks.

Reason 3 The Art Style
This has nothing in of itself to deal with Ole-American, full send, Patriotism that is has going on, but more of that actual art of the characters, the way they are modeled, and the shading they have.
They all match extreamly well with the new setting, and are faily well detailed, lot of great well done animated writing and characters that you only see once.
However, as previously mentioned, this tone is not Bio-Shock.

Reason 4 Characters/Enemies
Bio-Shocks have been well known for the great cast of characters, very well known for their persoanlity and unqiue quirks.
The different enemy types and the vast list of lore that each enemy created and had. From eliets, Big-Daddys, Big-Sisters, Splicers, Sander, Alas/Fontain, Lamb, Ryan, etc.
You first found the spider splicers in the markets area in neptunes bounty, they wore clothes that match they had sea wear, hooks, and fit the athestetic.  
In Infinite, you get rarely and of these enemies, and types. Most are just humans, either reskined guards or thugs, then your only other break up are the firemen, and the handymen who you see very too and far between.
The lack their unqiue writing from past games, where you could come across a splicer that was lost ranting, looting, or in a firefight with a Big-Daddy breathing life into the world.
Infinite throws most of that out, as its far more  liniar in its gameplay and writing. Which works really well for this game, but its not Bio-Shock nearly as much as previous games.

Reason 5 The Gear System
This is a very interesting System the could work really well, however many of the gear is vastly stronger than the others and are not well designed. It feels very surface level and the way to change them all feel like an imcomplete system that never really took off, but most of it was done, so it was kept in.
In previous games, we had the tonics system as well as the slot which worked great as it forced the player to make ""choices"" in their playthrough, and go about their way of playing, and in infinite, just like the ending, there is really only 1 way to play.
Replacing Adam in general, is a very strange design choice, even if fitting for lore, but at the cost of gameplay, The need to almost complelty reply on money to get everything feels very forced, In previous games if you took your time looking everywhere you could fill your wallet and never need to really worry about ammo, hp etc and you explored and were wealthy rewarded, here it forces you almost to look every nook and cranny just to get by.

Burial at sea completes the Story and is the best part about this game, however as the form of a DLC and seperate from the Main Game I can not help but feel cheated that we could not have gotten this story back in rapture but instead you need to pay extra to get what you really wanted and that is Bio-Shock, not Interdimentional rift making, fary tale, sunflower, rainbows and sunshine glitter that is the 3rd game in the series.

These are my main reasons as well as tons of very small ones that stack to form my opinion.
It is a great, solid game, just does not feel like Bio-Shock.
I hope in the future games if any, will keep the same tones, and atmosphere while telling its new story.
The characters here are great, well written, have great awesome VA, and animations etc.
Its just not Bio-Shock.
I think dispite the need for Bio-Shock to be in the name as part of the story, I think it would have been better off being a new idea, rather than keep the Bio-Shock name.
The story for me barely works and goes alot farther out of its way then in the previous games which is not bad, but again the tone feels way-off from the previous games.

I think Working so hard to make Elisabeth work, and she does work, very well in fact, that alot of the games other aspects fell short of what I think made the others so great, So if I come back to Infinite, it would only be to enjoy the small and well made interactions with her character. The rest feels flat, when looking back at the other Titles. 
Her character carries this game so hard, that without her, the game would just quite frankly fail to achive what made Bio-Shock so great.

For the first update this game has seen in over 6 years, it’s a slap in the face. Personally I have nothing wrong with developers having their own launchers or store fronts. Except when it makes the game unplayable for people who already own a copy of the game or who wish to buy it.

For those on Linux who wish to play this masterpiece, I recommended picking up a DRM free copy of it on GOG. Otherwise you should probably wait until they fix it or the community finds a workaround.

From a technical standpoint, it is linear, repetitive, and a typical console port, which means checkpoint saves.  Checkpoint saves are awful, and should be outlawed in PC games.  It's like the developers don't recognize that we actually have a life outside their precious game, and don't appreciate replaying the same scenario over and over and over.  Good grief.  It wouldn't be so bad if it was like Halo, were the saves come every 3-5 minutes.  But here, you can go sometimes be 60-90 minutes between saves!  Ridiculous.  One time my player got stuck on a mesh and had no choice but to reload the save, losing nearly an hours worth of progress.  Did I mention ridiculous?

From a story standpoint, I was not convinced.  [Spoilers ahead]

I simply can't stand games with wormholes, alternative realities, and time travel. Not only does it introduce plot holes, but it's a pathetic plot device that only serves one purpose - get out of a jam.  And that happens numerous times here.  I couldn't roll my eyes enough at the ending cut scene.

Save your time.

The game takes place in the floating city of Columbia, a breathtakingly beautiful and unique environment that is unlike anything you've seen before.

The story is a masterclass in narrative design, with a well-written script that keeps you engaged from start to finish. You play as Booker DeWitt, a former Pinkerton agent tasked with rescuing Elizabeth, a mysterious young woman with extraordinary abilities. The relationship between Booker and Elizabeth is one of the highlights of the game, and their journey together is full of twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

The gameplay mechanics are top-notch, with a focus on fluid and intuitive combat, and a wide range of powers and abilities that allow players to tailor their playstyle. The new vigor system, which replaces the plasmids of the previous games, adds a new level of depth and strategy to the game.

The game mechanics are well-balanced, providing a satisfying challenge without becoming too difficult. The DLC, Burial at Sea, is also a standout, offering a new perspective on the world of BioShock and adding even more depth to the story.

Though one qualm I share with this game like I do with the other Bioshock games is that the gunplay feels a bit weak. The guns dont feel as impactful and instead feel more like toy guns. Thankfully other parts of the game make this bearable and the whole world with its colourful art redeems it.

Set in the floating city of Columbia, the game follows the story of Booker DeWitt as he searches for a mysterious girl named Elizabeth. The game's unique setting, captivating story, and thought-provoking themes make it one of the best games of its generation.

One of the standout elements of Bioshock Infinite is its world-building. The city of Columbia is a marvel to behold, filled with intricate details and a rich history that players can uncover as they explore. The game's art style, with its bright and vivid colors, also sets it apart from other shooters and creates a truly immersive experience.

The game's story is equally impressive, expertly weaving together themes of American exceptionalism, racism, and religion. The relationship between Booker and Elizabeth is also a standout, with the two characters growing and evolving over the course of the game. The game's ending, which ties together the game's themes and plot elements in a surprising and satisfying way, has become the stuff of legend.

All these elements come together to make Bioshock Infinite not only the best game in the Bioshock series, but one of the best games of all time. Its combination of stunning visuals, thought-provoking storytelling, and thrilling gameplay make it a must-play for any fan of the genre.",1635756296,1675595136,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

If a well-written story-driven game with a linear narrative is what you're after, Bioshock Infinite is one of the best games out there for you.

The plot is filled with tiny details scattered throughout, which forces you to pay attention to the game, or you risk not understanding the story. The plot is quite complex, and the characters extraordinarily compelling, and there's just so much rich world-building that makes the world of Columbia a delight to explore.

When you play this game, however, I also highly recommend you play the 2 story DLCs, Burial at Sea Episodes 1 and 2, because they tie back to the original Bioshock game. This is a connected universe, and the DLC stories are absolutely incredible (particularly Episode 2).

I will say this, though: I started off not enjoying this game a whole lot. The combat was okay, the story seemed to be too subtle and felt like it was going nowhere.

Visuals: Extremely beautiful world with a perfectly executed theme. The sets are exactly what a dystopian steampunk world should look like. The items in game are also within the steampunk universe. The speech is done in a steampunk way too. The visual and auditory immersion is here.

Story: I didn't entirely pay attention the story, but I thought it was kinda confusing. This might differ depending on how actively you see out optional collectibles that contextualize some plot points. After Googling a bit, I found it quite interesting. But if you're looking for a story that just lays itself out for you, I don't think it's here. This story is for imaginative people.

Gameplay: It's very fun at first. The weapons are pretty standard but it's fun. The Vigors or powerups are fun to experiment with but I found myself using the same one over and over. The gameplay loop is somewhat bland and there's not much variety in enemies past the halfway mark. I wish there were more big spectacle playable moments. The majority of the fun comes in the first half, when you don't have many upgrades and you play more strategically.

Misc: Elizabeth, your AI companion, is absolutely amazing. She feels like a real person and actively helps you in combat, passing health potions or ammo, etc. The voice acting is also amazing. Beautiful performance by Elizabeth's voice actress. The game itself isn't very difficult. On a super super casual playthrough, you won't struggle at all. The death penalty is almost nonexistent and with decent aim, you can easily get through the normal difficulty.

8/10 game. Great visual and auditory presentation. Story is a little confusing to follow. Gameplay gets a little stale at the end.

To start it out the bat, this game is kinda mid. Look, I like the polish, the story and SOME parts of the gameplay. But coming from Bioshock 1 & 2, it's not good compared to them, which is a shame, cause the 1st 2 games are legitimately the most fun I've ever had in a game. But, the aspects of Bioshock Infinite drags it down by a lot so I'll go over some of the stuff I do not like.
- Weapons: I do not like the fact you can only hold 2 weapons, it reeks of copying modern shooters and not finding a work around for holding many weapons, I'd understand if they limited the weapons you got to 4 or 5 cause swapping weapons in B1 or 2 was a real pain but holding only 2 is really cringe and should've been executed differently.

- Exploration: I really hate the exploration, because ADAM, weapon upgrade stations and hacking tools have been removed all you get is a stat increase bottle, money or lock picks. Which gets really tiring after a bit cause it doesn't feel very rewarding for getting money that doesn't let you get a new upgrade, you have to get a BUNCH of money to upgrade, speaking of..

- Upgrading: It is really stupid how they made upgrading money only so you have to juggle towards upgrading a weapon that you barely run into or for your plasmid which you never have salt for.

- Plasmids: The plasmids are just underwhelming, I played on hard and the only plasmids I ever used were electricity and possession. The other plasmids feel useless or do no damage whatsoever, man if only I could upgrade them with a different source that wasn't used for weapons.

-Handyman: Fuck this enemy, they are just a boring big daddy that are not fun to fight ever, it takes 5 minutes to take 1 down while you're trying to juggle enemies with them, I do not like them at all and when they showed up I played like a weasel.

- Depth: After the 1st 2 games I feel as if the depth was just destroyed from removing different ammo types, slowing the animations, forcing the player to choose only 2 weapons at a time and making exploration feel shallow and pointless. 

That being said, is the game good? YYYYYYeeeeesss? I don't know, maybe it is and I'm just bitter on how much they changed to reboot the series. We needed change so rapture wouldn't be overdone and so people wouldn't get tired of the formula but this was WAY too much. To me, this game is just mid, it's not super offensive but it just feels annoying to play sometimes. I plan to try out the DLC sooner or later when I have the funds but from what I hear it's B1/2 level design with B:Infinite combat which doesn't seem that appealing.

Without notice, 2K has implemented their useless DRM launcher into many of their titles on Steam, including some of the older ones. They're masquerading it as a ""Quality Of Life Update,"" but all they're doing is adding another DRM layer to your games to track and collect data on you, while peddling their worthless online storefront. So, you've got to have both the Steam and 2K launchers open at the same time, at all times, in order to play these 2K games on Steam. 2 DRM launchers for one game is one of the reasons why I buy the majority of my games on GOG.",1662335443,1674702227,False,8,0,0.500656068325042725,0,True,False,False

I want to like this game, but it feels like a largely mistepped advancement in the Bioshock franchise, with its saving grace hidden behind two separate DLC packages that literally double the cost of the game. The starting ""puzzle"" is a sign of things to come. I have mixed feelings, but I want to focus on the very lack of focus that this game seems to have. And because of the huge paywall for the Burial at Sea DLC, I'm not reviewing those.

[b] The Good: [/b]
[list]
    [*]Booker is a great character, with great voice acting and is very satisfying to play as, and experience his story. It's a big change coming from the largely silent protaganist of Bioshock 1, and very much changes the style of story telling, breaking the silent protagonist rule and lacking some of that immersion, but all of the cutscenes are firstperson, and the world is seemless, keeping players invested in Booker's story.
    [*]Similar to Rapture, Columbia is a storied, detailed, beautifully crafted setting, and is a world of many opposites to Rapture. I prefer Rapture's dark, seedy, and immediately violent and troubled setting, but I will not defy the acheievements to the world of relgiion to the setting of Columbia, and it still looks great even today with a very strong art direction.
    [*]The firearms and Vigors feel very satisfying to use, as is a hallmark of the Bioshock series and it holds true to that.
    [*]The ideas that went into this game have a lot of potential, and were very popular in the time of this game's release, with this game contributing to their popularity.
[/list]

There is certainly a lot to like, but this review is negative so the real meat of the review isn't in the positive aspects, but I want to show the game some love, not just hate.

[b] The Bad: [/b]
[list]
    [*]Perhaps my biggest single and very addressable complaint is the sheer lack of ammo reserves/ammunition availability, and the remedy to this matter is that Elizabeth pulls ammo out of her @$$ at numerous moments.
    [*]Extremely hamfisted with the themes of American values and American exceptionalism. It feels odd, considering the very premise of the founding of Columbia. I do think it's very intentional, but it comes off as extremely surface level commentary, with little depth behind it beyond THIS THING BAD.
    [*]Time traveling, multi-dimensional non-sense. The more you think about it, the more it falls apart. Rick and Morty has a million times more depth to it with regard to abandoning your current universe for another, and alternate timelines, and while that might seem incredulous, it's because it explores those aspects in depth, while Elizabeth will use it to pull resources out of thin air and get you guys out of a shitshow. For being the ""emotional center of the game"", her inclusion feels like a Deus ex machina in every way, she is the reason the story even exists, and she is the reason you will survive, get revived, tranport into a new dimension, magically transporting you to Rapture, or [spoiler] having a bunch of them showup at the end and drown you, to somehow prevent Comstock from existing, which creates a time paradox solved by infinity?[/spoiler] It feels rushed, a bit edgy for the sake of edgy, and like it has no constraints.
    [*]The story feels like it writes itself into a corner, providing some kind of meta commentary of the choices of games or the way it comes across as complex when it doesn't feel richly complex like a tiramisu, but complex like a ""I mixed all of my leftovers into a single dish to use up all the food that was going bad"" way.[spoiler] Making Elizabeth the daughter of Comstock feels forced, and the other universes shouldn't have been something you could go into but rather grab things from.[/spoiler] The world of Columbia feels like it gets pushed aside as Elizabeth's powers become much more of a keystone holding the story together. I think it has the focus and setting that is unique but feels like a major step back, not knowing what to say with the subject matter compared to its predecessors. It's offset by the great world building, but not enough to draw me in personally. It feels like a frankenstien of ideas. 
    [*]2k DRM, which has single handedly ruined many's experience with simply playing the game.
[/list]

On my first playthrough I was so annoyed that this game is barely a Bioshock game and I still stand by that. I was hugely disappointing with the direction of the story because I wanted a continuation of the Bioshock story and I still stand by that. I think this game would operate much better as a game set in the Bioshock universe without having the Bioshock name attached (which would make a certain location visited at the end of the game much more impactful) HOWEVER: looking at this game not considering it as part of the series then the story is incredible and the gameplay is almost always fun (With the exception of the stealth portion near the end of the game which is total bs lmao) The graphics still hold up amazingly well and I think the themes explored are very interesting and engaging. Whilst the story is incredible I think there were a lot of uncooked elements though with the main two being the Vox Populi and Lady Comstock. Still, I heavily underrated the game on my first review and it didn't feel right to not redo it because I would 100% recommend this game.",1665087020,1674508800,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The central theme of this game for 3/4 of its run time is:
Armed rebellion against a racist, totalitarian, jingoistic society for the abuses and inequality it represents is barbaric and morally just as bad if not worse than engaging in those racist, jingoistic societal systems as a willing participant.

The central theme for the last 1/4 of the game is:
We skimmed the wikipedia entries for Multiverse Theory and Quantum Mechanics and we thought they were pretty cool.

I really wish the game was just the latter, because I got pretty sick to my stomach when one of the main characters literally espoused the former idea in dialogue.

Oh the plot of Burial at Sea is:
We decided to make our female lead worse in every conceivable way, give her less agency in her own story, and drop the whole multiverse/quantum mechanics thing because we apparently couldn't keep it straight within our own narrative.

I was impressed by the world-building in this game. Columbia felt like a fully realized, living and breathing place that could actually exist. The attention to detail was staggering, from the grandiose architecture to the smallest of objects scattered throughout the environment.

I found the story to be one of the most thought-provoking and well-written in any video game I have played. It touched on themes of racism, religion, and politics, and had me questioning my own beliefs by the time the credits rolled.

I found the gameplay to be a perfect blend of first-person shooter and RPG elements. I had a wide variety of weapons and powers at my disposal, and the combat was fast-paced and intense. But it was also strategic, as I needed to use cover and plan my approach to take out enemies.

I like the environments in all the Bioshock games for their originality and overall design, and Infinite is no exception.  This game has beautiful graphics for sure. The sound, music, and voice acting are all excellent with special praises deserved for the main actors, who were just superb.  

The combat plays out better than previous Bioshock games, but you’re limited to two plasmids and two weapons at a time.  There were only two of the plasmids that I really liked and used them 99% of the way through the game. The combat still gets very chaotic at times, though not quite nearly to the clusterf*ck level of the first two games.  

The overall story is kind of blah and really starts to drag about ¾ of the way through and it was hard for me to stay interested.  After a while, I felt like all I was doing was listening to the characters talk, listening to Elizabeth’s heels clip-clop everywhere, shooting at something, searching through things (many of which you couldn’t use or pickup because you had too many of that item already), and listening to voice logs which added little to the overall story.  By the time I reached the end, I honestly didn’t care what happened.

I definitely had fun with it, but somehow expected more.  The Burial At Sea add-ons are just OK but nothing special.  

I will give the game a thumbs up for the voice acting and environments, but the rest…meh.

Right from the start, when I first saw Columbia, I was hooked. Everything about this game is amazing, the setting, the visuals, the story, the gameplay. I find the controls a lot simpler too, just seems smoother. It's just improved so much and huge step-up since Bioshock 1. This is by far, my favourite in the series.

The story follows Booker Dewitt and his escapades as a hired gun in the hyper-American airpunk city of Colombia. While the political messages in this game are confusing at times, the story itself is compelling and enjoyable.

Bioshock: Infinite -- The city of Colombia & meeting Elizabeth
GAMEPLAY 6/10 -- A decent shooter with lots of routes and options to adopt for combat. Rather than having scarce ammunition like in the former entries, Bioshock: Infinite allows the player to only hold two weapons at a time. This posits a lot of variety for gun use. The same cannot be said about the vigors, of which many are just clearly better than others.
STORY 7/10 -- I actually like the story, sort of. I think that the ""both sides are bad"" mentality holds the game from truly being minted as definitely good story-wise. That being said, the collectibles and whatnot (including the voxophones) paint a really interesting and unique story.
BEAUTY 8/10 -- Conceptually and visually, the Bioshock: Infinite world is fascinating and beautiful. The style is decent, though could have been executed better.
[OVERALL] 7/10 -- The game is good.
~15 HOURS TO 100% (1998 MODE WITH VOXOPHONES IS HARD)


[DLC] City in the Sky -- Arcade
GAMEPLAY 7/10 -- There are four different maps with numerous variables and 15 rounds of combat each. Each map is very unique and interesting, differentiating each other effectively, Each round of combat is designed intently. While achieving all the special conditions is rather time-consuming, I enjoyed doing it.
STORY N/A -- This is an arcade mode.
BEAUTY 5/10 -- It's an arcade mode. However, some of the scenery is unique and I like that this mode has its own special maps.
[OVERALL 5/10] -- It's fun, but I wouldn't recommend it if you didn't like the initial game's gunplay.
~12 HOURS TO 100%


[DLCs] Burial at Sea (part 1 & 2)
GAMEPLAY 8/10 -- Rapture is generally a more interesting map and I really enjoyed the different methods of approach, mostly due to the focus on stealth in part 2.
STORY 8/10 -- Caps off the story of Bioshock: Infinite and grants some insight into how the three games are all interlinked. It's also fun to be in Rapture before chaos strikes.
BEAUTY 9/10 -- Rapture is a beautiful city conceptually. The map you traverse is drastically different from Colombia, which was genuinely a little baffling to me.
[OVERALL 9/10] -- This is one of the best DLCs for a game I've ever played. The DLCs in combination is about 3/4th the size of the main campaign. Less maps & areas generally, but each map is much more elaborately designed, allowing for lots of sightseeing.
~4 HOURS TO 100%

It had such a strong start--I really thought they were going to make some strong statements about capitalism being inherently racist, and they were almost there when suddenly the game does a sharp 180 and [spoiler] you end up killing the black leader of the rebellion against the white, confederate, fascist state. [/spoiler] The game really doesn't get any better from there--[spoiler] the dimension/parallel universe hopping seems thrown in there just for the sake of making the game feel more science-fictiony, the appearance of Rapture feels like the devs were going ""Look! Remember Rapture? It's a BioShock game, remember?"" But you literally don't do anything in Rapture--you're there for maybe 2 minutes before you're jumping into another dimension, and another, and another, until finally you discover you're Zachary Comstock and you kill yourself to prevent the game from ever happening. It's a rushed ending that retcons everything you did in the game to begin with, making the replay value quite low compared to the first two BioShock games. [/spoiler] I'm also not sure why they chose to only allow you to use two weapons at a time. My guess is they wanted to give Elizabeth something to do during combat, and if you're lugging around ~10 weapons, you'd just be able to switch to the next one when you run out of ammo rather than Elizabeth providing you with reloads. But from what I understand, they returned to allowing you to carry all of the weapons in the dlcs, so again...odd choice. The plasmids (or vigors in this game) are pretty uninteresting compared to the first two games, too. I used Devil's Kiss and Shock Jockey the most simply because while Possession and Return to Sender are useful, they cost way too many Salts even with the upgrades to make them cost less, and even with Elizabeth constantly throwing me Salts.

I just wish so much that they had stuck to one theme with this game. If they wanted to do a dimension-hopping game that spends some time in Rapture, they should have done that. If they wanted to do a completely new story that [i] maybe [/i] takes place in the same universe, but focuses on racism/the many faults of capitalism, they should have done that. As it is, it feels like they were trying to tell two different stories here that got jumbled in the middle.

All of this being said, it would be nice to see another BioShock game eventually, even if it retcons some stuff that happened in 2 and Infinite.",1673667433,1673667433,False,0,0,0.433194577693939209,0,True,False,False

Even if the game dropped to $15 dollars, I still couldn't recommend it to anyone. Even with Steam's generous refund policy, DO NOT play this game, as the only good portions are before the first 2 hours. The rest is a slog.

GAMEPLAY:
-I bought into the epic feeling of flying around on the sky-rails, not knowing the rest of the game was as linear as the tracks.

-The environments are beautiful, but they also drag you along on a very narrow path with poor obstacles to replace invisible walls, and the interactivity you have with the environment is almost non-existent. Level design is lacking and doesn't support the narrative at all.

-Elisabeth is useless except to interrupt the flow of combat in an already incredibly easy, mediocre linear shooter. The things she throws you interrupt whatever it is you're doing, and her powers are worthless.

-Enemy damage is pitiful and your health shield is very powerful.

-You have two weapon slots. You will never run out of ammo for either of them unless you use a grenade launcher at all times.

-By the time you find your first explosive weapon, the game is over. One shot can kill almost everything in a room, outside of a few elite enemies. Ammunition isn't that rare for it, and one shot trivializes entire encounters.

-The hard mode is not harder. Resources are a bit more scarce, but not enough for it to count. You may have to drop one gun for another.

-Your character's powers are extremely underwhelming and always inferior to un-upgraded firearms, and in some cases, melee strikes. They have destroyed one of the defining parts of the IP.

-""Boss battles"" are recurring enemies later, with no real power spikes for the player to help defeat them easier. The worst part is, they're genuinely non-threatening the first time you encounter them. You're teased with several epic battles that never happen, because they're resolved in cut-scenes.

STORY:

-Elisabeth is a really bad example of likable companions. She was nothing but an annoyance for the entire game, delay the resolution of the plot, pad out the game-time with poorly written, shallow moments that are supposed to define her.  Her every action felt like an interruption to the narrative flow, and as cute as they tried to make it, she's too much of a selfish, unlikable, arrogant child for that to work in the game's favor. All of her powers were huge examples of wasted potential narrative and in gameplay.

-CADbortion levels of shifting tones throughout the story make it really difficult to keep up with the ham-handed bludgeoning of the half-assed social commentary everywhere in the story.

-The antagonist is fought in a cut scene that, thankfully, doesn't have QTEs, but I think this might be the sole exception for where they'd be acceptable so you might feel some involvement in the story being resolved rather than feeling like you're in an out of body experience.
 
-Imagine an six year old trying to make up a ghost story on the spot. The game is like that. It's meandering, thoughtless, uninspired, and can't keep a single train of thought.  The thing they expected to be a plot was so full of holes it couldn't even pass for a functioning screen door, let alone a $50 game.

-Elizabeth was a two dimensional plot device in a complicated, disjointed, rambling, thinly veiled, aggressively Americanized Dr. Who fan-fiction. The ending to the game cements that fact. There's no satisfaction, or resolution to the story, only disappointment. Booker's time was a waste, everything he did was for nothing, and the reason why is so stupid you're left staring at the credit screen feeling the exact same way: Feeling you just wasted an entire day of your life for nothing.

    This game's kind of story is like putting a piece of puzzle. You done it one-by-one. Most of the thing that you see seems doesn't make sense at first, but once you put all the missing pieces together, you can finally see the bigger picture on what the story is about. 
    It's surprising that perhaps, nothing on this game that doesn't make sense, I mean it. Even the scene where you are died and coming back to life (respawning) has some kind of logic put into it.
    The other thing about this game that amazes me the most is the world/level design, it's so unique, this comes from someone who have played tons of games in the past.

Firstly, Bioshock:Infinite brought all the ideas from 1 and 2 improved them.

From the powers to the gunplay, and even 
extra actions like the skyrail and elizabeth power added new more fun way to explore and play the game.

It improved not just from the gameplay perspective but also story. It added story ideas from 1 and 2 of
the 'protector' and the 'chosen child' into a mindblowing complicated but somehow make sense, story.

The hard mode is really challenging this time arround, tho I do really like Bioshock 2 trap weapon system
like the lines and the mines, but I think the new powers and Elizabeth 'tears' make up for that.

I just love the world and the theme of this game.

From oldies cover of 70-80s hit, the whole physic and science tech aesthetics, clashes of ideologies and moralities in people. The game is just so god damn perfect, there is still nothing like it from the gameplay, 
the stories, and even the worldbuidling to this day.

One of the very best game ever made.

10/10 Music (I love the oldies cover)
10/10 Visual
10/10 Action(especially the hard mode)
10/10 Story (tho it gets confusing sometimes, but really smart if you understood it like how the luteces' uses morse code to communicate between realities)
10/10 Aesthetic(nothing is yet to challenge Bioshock: Infinite Aesthetic as of Jan 2023)

In DLC Burial at the Sea the most infuriating part is the game didn't even tell you there is a weapon wheel which means you can carry all weapons now instead of just 2. So half of the EP 1 I was just crouching and hiding as I thought i only have 2 weapons, not just that the ammo you carry is way lesser than in the main game.
 In EP 2 is now a clear stealth game as you play as Elizabeth carrying even way lesser ammo, encouraging you more on being sneaky to get from next objective.

The first 2 games where dark and gloomy, horror/thriller in genre, and most notable; underwater. And had a dark Steampunk-ish feel to it. Bioshock Infinite is bright, and looks cheerful, it has ""Steampunk"" type elements and is set in 1912, in a time where for example racism is still alive. Instead of underwater, Bioshock Infinite is played in the sky, and allows a whole different type of gameplay. Like the first 2 games, you can make choices in the game, although the choices in Infinite, don't really matter as there is only one ending, I still like that I get to make a choice. It gives me a feeling of importance in how the playable character (Booker DeWitt) is. It also changes small dialog in how the NPC buddy (Elizabeth) will act towards you.

[b] Buddy System:[/b]
The NPC buddy is made really well, I can't shoot her, she collects things for me, I don't have to protect her, and most of all; she is not blocking me or standing in the way. Which happens a lot with games that have a buddy NPC character, It's frustrating to be running somewhere and the NPC that is supposed to help you, blocks you're path instead. Shes a very likeable character, fascinating an has a fascinating story.

I really don't have anything bad to say about this game, It's well made, well though about. For someone that doesn't enjoy most shooter games, I absolutely loved this game. And would go as far as to call this one of my favorite games. You don't have to play the first 2 games, to understand this one, as this game is so different then the first 2 made. If you want to get into shooter game, with a good story, I would most definitely recommend this game.

If you love steampunk, play this game. If you like an amazing story, play this game. If you are ready for insane plot twists, play this game! 

This game is absolutely amazing in the story, the lore of how certain things work in Colombia, and when you explore the levels, you could find Voxophones which hold even more details about the story! 

While I was playing the game, I noticed the song ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"" by Cyndi Lauper was playing during the festival. It threw me off because the song was made in 1983 while the game is set in 1912 (71 year difference). I was confused until I picked up a Voxophone in a part of the game that gives more details about certain things (I don't want to spoil anything) and then I was shocked and amazed by it all!! 
Any detail in this game has a reason and I love that about this game.

I highly recommend this game because of the amazing story, the characters are memorable, and overall it's a masterpiece of a game!

PROS: fun gunplay, story was interesting with a cool twist (that gets tiresome/overdone in the DLC), main characters (booker and elizabeth) were overall likeable, and columbia was gorgeous. main game was very fun and didn't overstay its welcome. lastly, this game has one of, if not the best, companions in any game. elizabeth is not only endearing and interesting in the main game, but is helpful during and outside of combat without being annoying/intrusive!

CONS: extremely repetitive character models, some guns feel like peashooters, little to no choices in the game and what choices you do have make 0 impact, imo lacks a lot of the bioshock staples (art deco, big daddies, little sisters, ADAM, splicers, commentary on society that is actually nuanced/not just one-dimensional). also, the burial at sea DLC sucked in my opinion and created a lot of plotholes/forced narratives for bioshock as a whole that i'm just choosing to ignore.

overall, bioshock: infinte is fun for the 10 hours it takes to beat, but it feels like a standalone bioshock-adjacent game as opposed to the third bioshock game. the DLC i can live without, but i know some people really love it.

After Bioshock 2, I was kind of done with the Rapture theme. Although I can play the first two Bioshock games over and over again without it ever boring me, if there was ever to be a new game, I wanted some fresh new ideas. My wish had been granted when Bioshock Infinite hit the shelves. 

Instead of playing on the bottom of the world, you are now playing high in the sky, almost touching space. Bioshock Infinite takes places in a new city Columbia. It floats high in the air by massive fans and, just like Rapture, keeps hidden from existence. You play as Booker DeWitt, a new character and a good one I might add. Just like Jack from the first Bioshock, you immediately feel some sort of connection with him because of his excellent dialogue, expression and overall interaction. 

Irrational studios has done it again. They produced another excellent game with another excellent story. It is what the Bioshock games are known for and they did not disappoint with this game. Because of this reason, I will not review any part of the story in this review, this is something that you need to experience for yourself, especially in combination with the two DLC episodes “Burial at Sea”.

The mechanics of the game work very similar to the first games. You got a selection of new different weapons and instead of using Plasmids, like the previous games, you use Vigors and Salts. The Vigors have the same idea as the Plasmids but are still completely unique. You can shoot a horde of murderous crows at your enemies, posses them so they attack other enemies and then shoot a bullet trough their brains or splash them away with water and tentacles. 

For money, you collect the national currency of Columbia, the Silver Dollar.

The new enemies in the game are also very well created and a lot of thought did go into them. You got your standard police officers and other human enemies, but then, out of the blue, you got attacked by a big, mechanical patriot doll, complete in the style of George Washington. And if that is not enough, you got the Handymans, humans in a big exoskeletons with their hearts outside of their bodies, encased in the middle of their suits. The only thing they do is Hulk Smash so they are predictable, but when they hit you, you just bought yourself a one way ticket back to earth.

I like the combat, besides shooting and bewitch enemies, you can also knock them off Columbia. If there is a ledge and you have your trusty Broncho Vigor selected, let them fly! 

Speaking of flying, the new rail mechanic, in which you can use kilometers of metal railing to quickly travel to other places, or giving you the advantage in a fight, is really cool. You collect some sort of grappling hook early in the game and can attach it to the railing whenever you want. You even got a nice attack when disengaging from the rail and jumping towards an enemy. 

The controls in the game work flawless and the new mechanics, Vigors and rail sliding is easy to understand and master. You just feel like you are in control.
The graphics in Bioshock Infinite are beautiful and the environments and attention to detail is just stunning. The lighting is also very well done and gives objects, enemies and scenery a nice finishing touch.

I must say that the ambient music and fight tracks when sh!t hits the fan, are a little disappointing from what I was used to from the previous games. They are just generic and “all right” .However, this did impact my positive experience with the game. 

I really don’t have any complaints or minor issues with Bioshock Infinite, it is just another game in the series that impressed me just as much as the previous installments.",1454327027,1671128804,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h2] Gameplay [/h2] 
I believe the gameplay core was there. There were interesting elements, new mechanics and lots of fun times. But I feel like there should have been more. For the purpose of keeping this review short, I'll group a few categories together. In terms of gunplay too, I never felt the need to upgrade any of my weapons at all. I could scavenge enough ammo or swap weapons often enough to not have any difficulties. One of the coolest things I think about the gameplay was the skyhooks you could travel around the levels on. This was something done really well. The guns didn't handle badly, but I also think they weren't very strong. 

Finally, I think the powerups you received throughout the game honestly weren't that good. Some of them were, but I found myself only one or two, or none at all. It was an after thought while in combat, and I didn't care much to use them. In the original two bioshock games, I feel like they were natural and belonged in the world. In Infinite, they felt more like they were only added to keep continuity between the games. 

[h2] Story and Characters [/h2]
For the story, I was not invested in what was going on at all. I didn't care who Booker DeWitt was or who Comstock was. I was just a mindless character trudging along in the gameworld doing what I wanted. Elizabeth was more interesting than the others, but she seemed under utilized. Someone who was finally able to escape from a cage, and yet she didn't care very much. For some of the other characters, they seemed believable with the themes they carried, but I never got attached. The story was interesting at first, and the setting was very cool. But I just lost interest about half way through and it never caught be again. 

[h2] Score [/h2]
Overall, I would give this game a 6.5/10. Definitely not as good as the previous two installments, but I don't think that is to the devs' miscredit. They had some truly great ideas but maybe because of their highers rushing them or budget cuts, they couldn't realize their true dream.

BioShock Infinite is nothing like the first two games. No Rapture, no Plasmids, no Little Sisters or Big Daddies and certainly the city is not under water. It brings a new look set in a new world with things familiar yet foreign enough to not be connected to what we know from first two games. Although Vigors act in the same way as Plasmids did they're less varied in elements with enemies less varied in their own elemental properties, that the majority of the game is simplified and most likely played with weapons only, even on 1999 difficulty. Story itself doesn't really get you personally involved with the female companion, making her just someone who's part of the job you're on a mission to do, until the very last part of the game where your own involvement to her is revealed, too little, too late. Songbird on the other hand is the one with the most personality yet it is a bird with no dialogue and its ending the most heartbreaking.
The new addition to the franchise that is a lot of fun to use is the Sky-Hook which is used to traverse certain parts of the city the current mission keeps you in, as well as a melee weapon which ends up being a bit redundant since the open parts of the city keep enemies far away from you, sniping you from the distance rather than engaging in close combat since the game is focused more on combat rather than stealth. Unfortunately with no way to go back to parts of the city explored previously Sky-Hook ends up being very limited in how and when it's used which is a real shame. The game would've benefited with having parts of the map connected by Sky-Hook travel system, allowing both returning to areas and more fun time spent on the rails. Overall it's a good game in the franchise, but it stands out so much with new things not used as much as they could've been that it makes it feel and play like a completely new franchise more focused on action than stealthy horror elements.

Burial At Sea DLC sees us return to Rapture, as well as give us back Plasmids, limited in number and only ones with elemental properties, with Sky-Hook making a comeback too, although once again limited though for good reason. The stealth-horror is back, especially in Episode 2, and the open sky replaced once again with water and enclosed space, a welcomed change from the main game, and seeing the return of both Little Sisters and Big Daddies hitting right in the feels. The story makes a full circle back to the original game, tying everything up nicely with a fulfilling ending.
The only shaky part is Elizabeth's story which the game would've worked beautifully without, but it doesn't ruin it (much) to be counted as a negative. 
Clash of the Clouds DLC however is a different beast altogether. As much fun as it is trying to get through the waves and get ribbons it's soon apparent it punishes more than it rewards. It's one thing to be challenging, but another to completely remove the entertaining aspect of doing the waves when there's no repeat option for a single wave to try and get the missing ribbon, making the achievement connected to them tedious and grinding too much that it ends up being a negative.

Overall BioShock Infinite and its DLCs are a nice ending to the franchise which serve as its beginning as well, with such a unique story, characters and world one can't help but replay them all, all over again.",1644506177,1670760654,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game was released in 2013 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC. It is the third game in the Bioshock series, and is set in an alternate reality in 1912.

The game's story follows the protagonist, Booker DeWitt, as he is sent to the floating city of Columbia to rescue a young woman named Elizabeth. Booker quickly discovers that Columbia is a city with a dark past, and that Elizabeth is being held captive by the city's tyrannical ruler, Zachary Comstock. As the game progresses, Booker and Elizabeth must navigate the dangerous streets of Columbia and uncover the city's secrets.

Bioshock Infinite introduces several new gameplay elements to the series. The game features a new ""vigors"" system, which allows the player to use various supernatural powers, such as telekinesis and fire blasts. The game also introduces a new ""skyhook"" mechanic, which allows the player to travel around Columbia by riding on rails and grappling hooks.

One of the key features of Bioshock Infinite is its complex and engaging story. The game's narrative is told through a combination of cutscenes, in-game dialogue, and environmental storytelling. The game's characters are well-written and well-acted, and the game's setting is richly detailed and immersive.

The game's graphics are impressive, with detailed character models and environments. The game's soundtrack is also noteworthy, featuring a mix of original compositions and period music.

Overall, Bioshock Infinite is a fantastic game. The game's vigors and skyhook mechanics add a new layer of depth to the gameplay, and the game's story is engaging and thought-provoking. The game's graphics and soundtrack are also top-notch, making for a truly immersive experience.",1670432275,1670432275,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
8870,51132418,76561198129784536,0,5,1611,0,1611,1560026679,"I really don't get this game...

Pros:

+ Varied gameplay. Bioshock's combat is a solid mix of gunplay, melee and ""superpowers"" (vigors/tears). You will also have to pay attention to the environment, hide behind covers, look for bottlenecks and use crowd control on your enemies.

+ Setting and art design. The overall art direction is unique, captivating and consistent throughout the entire game.

Cons:

- Terrible characters. Probably the game's main problem, you spend most of your time with the protagonist and his female companion, unfortunately this duo is really hard to like. Their motivations are very weak, they make dumb decisions and their chemistry is forced. You are supposed to care about them because the game tells you to, nothing more.

- Cringy dialogues. The artificial banter between the main duo is pretentious at best and torture at worst. Nothing is stated clearly, everything is veiled and ambiguous. On top of that the characters often talk over each other or the audiologs. There are some good, honest moments but they make only a small portion of the game.

- World execution. Bioshock Infinite's dystopian world offers some interesting social commentary, unfortunately our characters never address it in any meaningful way.

- Convoluted story. Fan fiction-level writing with odd pacing, no satisfying resolutions and a shock value ending. Characters are not able to sell the story, vital details are hidden in the audiologs instead of being presented throughout your actions.

- Linear. It's fine to have a linear shooter, but this game really teases you about making a couple of seemingly story changing choices that don't affect the final outcome at all.

In conclusion: An okay shooter with interesting mechanics, weak characters and a really disappointing story.",1560065398,1670430856,False,3,1,0.44726252555847168,0,True,False,False

This game now comes with a Launcher as of Sept. 2022 with its own store etc. after 5 years of this game being out! Why do these companies continue to try to push their crappy 3rd party applications that I DID NOT want on my computer?! What kind of data are they now harvesting? For the above concerns I am changing my review. Its a shame. I really liked playing this game.


Original Review -

Excellent game with fun engaging 1st person combat. Very much enjoy the combos the different vigors can do once chained together. The story also serves as a critique on the issues from unfettered capitalism which I found very interesting. Some of the villains can be traced back to industrial and objectivist figures like Henry Ford and Ayn Rand. With some of the architecture pulled straight from the descriptions of Rand's books. This game is definitely worth your time.",1656098040,1670119229,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It's a perfect example of being able to craft a believable, living world in a linear game. I felt like I was really in its featured floating city of Columbia. There is a great balance of exploration and combat- but I would say the combat felt a bit easy. Not that the enemies died easily, but that I rarely found a need to use the powers or different guns in different situations. I pretty much used 2 guns and 3 or 4 of the 8 powers throughout the game.

The writing is amazing, I really couldn't put this down. I was thinking about it even when I wasn't playing it. After finishing it, I'm still thinking about the story and the world.

Anyway the game is still playable on linux via proton, but still asshole move 2K. 

As for the actual game it's kinda meh, compared to the previous Bioshock's a lot of gameplay stuff is removed, or simplified for no reason. The weapon wheel is gone, you can now only have two weapons at once. The weapon upgrades are now just purchases in the vending machines, same for the powers upgrades. The amount of gear is lowered to only four. You can no longer carry mana and health packs. Which all seems a bit necessary as those were simple things that made combat and exploration more fun. Now they do appear in the DLC in some for which makes it even weirder that they are not in the main game. The new tear mechanic is very simple and after it is introduced it does not change much, just press x to chose if you want some cover, health, weapons, or ally. There are also the new skyhooks that allow you to quickly move around and take out enemies which is pretty fun. If you get all the DLC you get some gear and upgrades at the start, which is pretty good so you might not care for the gear you find in game later. The Burial at Sea DLC changes gameplay quite a bit, Episode 1 is much closer to the gameplay of the first two games, and Episode 2 is a stealth game. Makes you really wish that the entire games has such variety.

The story is OK.
The companion, Elizabeth, is awesome, she doesn't feel like a drag you have to carry thru the game, and the interactions between Booker and her are quite fun. 
The story is pretty good but it relies a bit too much on long cutscenes or ""gameplay"" that is just you holding forward without being able to do much. There are only three choices and unlike in the previous Bioshock's, they do not matter at all, everyone gets the same ending no matter what. From what i can tell two of the choices only affect physical appearance. 
There are some inconsistencies in the gameplay sections and the cutscenes, a couple of times in my play thru the characters would talk about something and the completely forget they talked it in the cutscene.
The main game's story is not connected to the previous games, there are a couple of mentions here and there but for the most part it is not necessary to play the first two games, the Burial at Sea DLC however ties this game into the the previous games, and is a must if you want the full story.

Overall if you liked the first two Bioshock games, while this one might be a bit disappointing, it is still a good time.

Perceiving this game with abundant seriousness as some fans and haters do is like taking Verhoeven's movies at face value. From my perspective, in terms of its setting and narrative, Infinite falls under the pulp category, akin to adventure movies from the middle of the 20th century. It sure contains the same exceeding amount of racism, reproduced to be deconstructed in the spirit of our era and, of course, presented from a completely different angle, mocking and poetic in equal measures.

The first and last puzzle, which insulted everyone's intelligence, is an irrelevant meme at this point. But looks like it still stings, causing a divide in the masses. Although, I'd be a huge snob if I actually held it against the game and not its fanboys. Who resort to praising it for showing portals as well as a bunch of flying buildings and then having quantum physics mentioned briefly. Instead of magic, it's particles! Referencing ideas isn't the same as implementing or exploring them. The claim lacks a follow-through.

The science of it all remains a hocus-pocus mumbo-jumbo. It's fine, but the predicament reflects on the world we live in today, where merely stating that physics is good because it lets us see the world beyond our observational capabilities wows people with boldness. Yet, despite being used as a carte blanche for pseudo-intellectual swagger, it's a good message, considering all the anti-vaxxers and flat-earthers skulking around. Alas, it isn't profound or delivered in any kind of mind-blowing way by a long mile.

[h3]Artistry[/h3]
Let's describe something that describes itself. Stylistically, compared to older instalments, it's Baroque vs. Christian cheese all the way. Everything's baked-in, petrified, from lighting to geometry. The levels might as well have been pre-rendered, which is a fair price to pay for polish and gorgeous sights. The architecture is monumental! The city is blooming with striking colours, industrial hellscapes have their factory pipes smoking like guns, and the juxtaposition of luxury and poverty jumps you.

[quote]""Just because this city flies doesn't mean it doesn't have its share of fools.""[/quote]
Bioshock games always revolved around cults. They've shown the world that droves of gullible people don't even need tangible cult leaders and easily fall for mere virtual gobbledygook. Yet, reaching that height was an achievement on the writers' part. However multi-dimensional in his bigoted megalomania, Cumsock didn't come close to the meme status of his precursor. This is what you get when your idol is a racist coffin-dodger who grosses an entire nation out by endlessly preaching about his seed. Ew, gramps, shut it!

One of the biggest gripes I thought I'd have with the game was its heavy-handed anti-racist moral. I'm still not sure if they expected me to take it seriously or to burst into laughter due to the level of mustache-twirling overkill involved. Even the Irish aren't white enough for these brats! To top it, they jumpscare you with racist Chinese and Indian faces, which is just farcical. Yes, racist jumpscares are apparently a thing that exists. And... I loved this campy parody of religiously patriotic nonsense!

They ask you whether you want to help the freedom fighters while holding you by your suspenders over a concentration camp where prisoners wear cartoonishly striped uniforms. They don't hesitate to throw a child amputee your way. I dig the old reductio ad absurdum device, it's a plausible absurdity since real-world racism is grotesque by nature. And above all, Infinite draws a comprehensive picture of good intentions getting inevitably corrupted by allowing the bloodthirst of an overthrown dictatorship to persist in the new era.

Before playing, I was a bit annoyed with all the Elizabeth-worshiping fans and their ""she said ""multiverse"", she's my waifu now"", but at the end of the day, she isn't a vehicle for some virtue signaling but a well-written and exceptionally well-animated person - lively, hopeful, and her facial expressions are priceless. Dewitt and Liza share the best story beats and engage in enjoyable banter during which he doesn't act like he's Liza's daddy and she ain't no sissy herself. For one, you don't have to protect her and she's actually indispensable in and out of combat.

He's an ex-military man, a slayer of the working class in an infinite amount of worlds, and its hero in another infinity. It isn't a question of whether he is a murderer, because of course he is! The past tortures him, and not because he killed people, but because he killed the wrong people. The game doesn't make a wet blanket out of Liza either, touching these subjects in a brief, yet meaningful way. Until it seizes to be an option, she throws to the side her own PTSD and the heavy burden of responsibility her powers infer for the greater good. Respectable.

[h3]""There's survival... and there's finding pleasure in the act.""[/h3]
A Bioshocker in me squirmed at first since it doesn't play like a Bioshock game. Wouldn't even call it a streamlined version. The maps are linear, the variety is lacking, and the 2-weapon carrying limit is stupid. Hell, even the audio logs are shorter than ever! It's barely a looter-shooter, more like a shooter with light elements of limited, yet rewarding loot-incentivized exploration. But I quickly forgave it for not being an immersive sim and a true successor.

Because what remains is a tight, high-feedback arena shooter. Although you now have a regenerating energy shield, on Hard, the game baptized me in Kool-Aid more often than its predecessors did. No stimpack on a hotkey to keep you going forever, just Liza's inconsistent handouts and what you find on the battlefield. Enemies aren't bullet sponges, but they produce copious amounts of damage, so getting distracted often means certain death. Their roster isn't that diverse, but where else could you witness a mecha Washington from a parallel dimension spinning a hurdy-gurdy minigun, huh?

The game could use extended environmental interactivity, and although sliding on rails and hanging on hooks was kinda fun for a while, the feature is underused. It all comes to abusing corners and the high ground, especially since the most Bioshock trait of them all, extremely sluggish movement, was carefully preserved for some reason. Killing egomaniacs is another distinctive, and this time more positive, property of the series. As always, you'll have to wade through their theme parks to have the gratification of putting them down for good. One of them even tried to give me a job. The audacity!!!

All weapons are fantastic and the meaty gunplay makes said killing fun. The game incentivizes weapon juggling by curbing your ammo capacity, but I didn't have to switch often anyway, it isn't exactly Halo. I liked blasting so much that I even enjoyed the shooting gallery mini-games at the beginning! Not as much when I had to repeat them after closing the game in a hurry. The checkpoints are weird and redoing exploration sucks. Finally, there are upgrades and equipment, but they're nothing special. When it came to Plasmids, or Vigors, I almost never used anything but the lovely head-popping lightning.

[h3]End[/h3]
I enjoyed Infinite as a creative action flick, which narrative doesn't provide any kind of subtlety, replacing it with heartfelt violence and camp. Although, good writing doesn't have to be subtle or sophisticated. To devise something over the top, emotional, and so transparent that not even the densest of dimwits could possibly miss the point is a feat of its own. The story is beautiful and touching, yet even if it was crap, disregarding the gratifying action would be silly.

Everyone should definitely play this game. It has a good story, stunning graphics and amazing gameplay and also a fantastic fps shooter! The city in this game has sort of a nostalgic/steampunk kind of element to it which makes it pretty cool. I am halfway through the game and it is frickin cool.

Edit: I still think BioShock Infinite is a decent game but perhaps not as good as I thought it was. In some ways it's comparable to The Dark Knight Rises where the more you think about it(esp the ending) you start to dislike it over time.

The fact that I caught myself reminiscing about the game 5 years after my first playthrough just shows how much of an impact this game still has on me. That being said, this is definitely a long overdue review.

BioShock Infinite has a storyline that isn't like any other. The plot twist turned out to be so wild that there is absolutely no way one would see it coming. I remember the chills up my spine watching the final moments unfold for the first time. The best thing about the insane plot twist is that the game manages to make it make perfect sense. It's no secret that the BioShock series is known for its unexpected plot twists, but Infinite was the one that rendered me the most speechless.

Moving on to Elizabeth, she is hands down the best deuteragonist/side character I've seen in any of the games that I've played. She doesn't feel like a hassle or an AI but an actual sidekick and companion. She reacts and interacts with the environment, mostly stays out of the way during combat and knows how to take care of herself so you don't have to be putting up a fight with enemies while stressing about protecting her. She shows up exactly when she needs to in order to provide you with health and ammo and without spoiling, she also helps out with combat via different means, all despite her distance from you. Aside from her outstanding mechanics, Elizabeth just strikes me as an overall charismatic and easily likeable character from the get-go.

Other than that, I do feel that Booker's movements need improvement. The lowered sensitivity when switched to running and ADS was something that annoyed me so much and had almost gotten me killed numerous times.

In light of all that praise, it's pretty obvious that BioShock Infinite (or the series as a whole really) is one of my favourite games ever. Even though sadly, I've heard Ken Levine won't be involved in the next BioShock game, I'm still excited to see what more the series has to offer and I hope it somehow ties in and lives up to its legendary predecessors.",1514720168,1668791735,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is more reminiscent of Halo than Bioshock. An element that is exacerbated by the fact that the dynamic between Booker and Elizabeth is reminiscent of the relationship between Cortana and Master Chief despite this being inconsistent with Elizabeth's established backstory. The first person perspective is wasted on a Booker who talks far too much in first person to effectively serve as a self-insert character, which is the benefit of the first person perspective. The game could have improved this aspect by having Booker do most of his talking in third person cutscenes, much like Halo, or by simply making the game an over the shoulder third person shooter reminiscent of The Last of Us. The moral choice mechanic is completely squandered as the player has had no input in any of the decisions that are designed to shape the player's perception of Booker, e.g. his role in Wounded Knee and the choices the character makes have neither immediate in-game benefits nor long term impact on the story. If you're going to opt for this course making the game third person would make Booker more sympathetic. If the point is that you're not supposed to sympathize with the character then he shouldn't be the player character. The philosophy of Columbia is considerably shallower and less compelling than that of Rapture. Criticizing American exceptionalism is hardly an original stance in comparison with Rapture's critique of Randian philosophy. The impression this game gives is that more thought went into the multi-verse aspect of the game, which is still poorly thought out and opens quite a few plot holes. Exploration is considerably less rewarding in this game than it was in previous entries and resource management is considerably less important in this game than it was in the aforementioned previous entries, especially considering Elizabeth's constant provision of ammo whenever the player begins to run short. This is also compounded by the removal of health kits as a manageable resource in this title.

Biochock 1 and 2 gave us a large arsenal of varied and unique weapons, Infinite takes all that away in place of a more generic- or ""modern"" loadout with what feels like a half dozen reskins of an assault rifle.

Only having two weapons at any given time makes a nightmare for balancing and upgrading, when all upgrading is specific to each individual weapon.

Plasmids, particularly telekenesis, scout, and security command, are replaced with Vigors. The vast majority of said Vigors are variations of a stun spell, with its only variables being damage, cost, and visual flair. 
I simply can not understand why you would take something that worked so well in the previous game, and then reduce it to ""press mouse button 2 to drain blue bar and stun enemy for an arbitrary amount of time"". No longer can I warp behind enemy lines, or use telekenesis to build small forts and cover. Instead, if I press F to interact when the game occasionally lets me, I might be given the option of an ammo crate or some med kits. 

Speaking of, the developers must have thought that having to manage med kits and mana kits on the fly was too demanding of a process for the average gamer, so now you are simply given a ridiculous amount of health and mana, and have to scout the map for kits. Oh, and occasionally the vapid companion, Elizabeth, will randomly toss you health and ammo, which you again have to ""press F to interact"" to receive. 

Lastly, the story and world of Bioshock was, at least to me, completely ruined. Bioshock 1 and 2 presented the dystopia of Rapture. It drew some analogies to real life anarcho capitalism and what effects, positive or negative, that it might have on a society. Aside from the opening of Bioshock 1, it was never really in your face either, just an interesting back drop to the ongoing plot. I should also note that the world of Bioshock 1 and 2 never really deviated that far from science fiction, disregarding the origin of ADAM. Bioshock Infinite, on the other hand, becomes full blown, goofy fantasy. Columbia is a city far up in the sky that is made possible with QUANTUM SUSPENSION. In other words, the world is justified through Quantum Woo, and prays the player pays no more mind to it. It is patently ridiculous and is made even more so when the game is supposed to take place in an alternate-history 1912 America. 
Because it is a Bioshock sequel, it must obviously have some social commentary to boot, right? What social issue/system/structure would plausibly be relevant in a bland first person shooter set in a superscience utopia of a floating sky city? Why, Racism, of course! 
And to make it more unfortunate, it never goes any deeper than: Evil christian whitey did the oppression on the colored peoples!
It does not make much sense and it gets increasingly more silly as you play. The developers must have noticed this too, as the RACISM undertone gets dropped completely about halfway through the story, replaced with ""ideological dogma bad"". At the end of the day, none of your choices mattered, either, because Bioshock Infinite ends up being about the ""Many Worlds Theory"". Yes, it is indeed one of those games. At no point does the game deeply explore neither racism, corruption, many worlds, quantum science or even physics on its own, as these concepts only exist to veil a nonsensical and bland plot, and a profoundly inept story. 

If you like to press F to interact with video game, press mouse 1 to do the shootie, and press mouse 2 to do the magic gaming, Bioshock Infinite is the right choice for you (not that the combat itself ever gets good). And do not worry, for if you ever get distracted from juggling more than 1 thought at once in your head, game will do the key jangle with hot damsel in distress cutie, or EPIC combat music that plays every time you enter a fight. And if you ever start thinking that this game is not what its hyped up to be, we will provide you with mind-boggling, nigh-hypnotizing phrases like QUANTUM, PERPETUAL, INFINITE. 
What a fucking tragic joke of a game to end the franchise on.

The following things are broken by default;

1. Mouse sensitivity. There is absolutely no way to get a value that both feels good and is fundamentally stable with the slider provided. You must set a numerical value in your configuration files, as well as lock both the minimum and maximum values to that same value in order for it not to fuck up when you change other settings, or when you sprint, or when you aim down sights. Oh, by the way, no matter what you do, your sensitivity is drastically lowered when sprinting, and does not scale accordingly to your FOV change when zoomed with any weapon. Not only is it broken, but it's designed to feel terrible.
2. Field of View. The max field of view you can set is about 80 by default. 80 FOV, for a first person shooter from 2013. Wow. Thankfully you can bump this up by using the same exact method you used to fix you mouse. Oh yeah, it also doesn't scale for widescreen properly, so you have to alter yet another thingamabob in the .ini files. A 2013 game without native widescreen support. Wow.
3. There is aim assistance... for mouse users. Which, you guessed it, cannot be disabled without editing the game's files and setting them to read-only. Holy. ♥♥♥♥.
4. There are 5-6 logo screens when you open the game that you can only sometimes skip with rampant button mashing. With the power of .ini, you can thankfully delete all but one of these, the AMD logo. The AMD logo is unaffected by your game volume and will deafen you. Really just insult to injury when you're trying to configure this mess.

Anyway, after an hour and a half, I finally made it to the game! Without further ado, let's list what went right and what what wrong.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
• Columbia is a very pretty environment.
• Setpieces and scenery change just enough to keep you distracted with shock and awe throughout so you don't pay attention to the game's downfalls.
• Some of the special enemies' functionalities are interesting. Crow guys are cool. Handymen being able to shock the rails you're swinging from is cool. I don't know what firemen do but they talk funny so I like when they pop up.
• The rails you can swing around from are pretty fun and prevent complete combat stagnation, despite their clunkiness.
• The guns themselves feel decent enough to shoot.

[h2]The Bad[/h2]
• You only get two guns. It isn't even a proper gameplay limitation since arenas are littered with extra ones, and you get effectively infinite ammo for anything you desire since it's so cheap. It just makes things dissatisfying because of how long it takes to switch to a weapon on the floor if you /happen/ to need it for a particular bossfight or scripted encounter that exhausts your resources. You typically won't need to switch throughout the brunt of the game, though. None of the weapons have a specialized role, and it doesn't matter what you pick for general use since the DPS is more or less homogenized across the board. The gameplay would be exponentially better if you could hold more guns and each gun served a specialized purpose, but resources were rationed out in a handcrafted way. You know, like the other games in the series.
• You have regenerating heal- I mean shield. Combat encounters boil down to ducking behind cover until it regenerates. Maybe if the inputs weren't so awful you could run and gun, but I don't think that's how it's designed. This fundamentally isn't a retro shooter where your raw reaction and aim matter, nor is it an im-sim where you have to think ahead about how to approach encounters. The way everything is structured and the behaviors of the enemies do not allow for anything remotely approaching those. This is Call of Duty with a different coat of paint.
• Unlike Plasmids, Vigors play a very minor role in the combat. It's nice to have them, sure, but most encounters are easily resolved by popping heads, and since you can't manually refill your salts (unless Elizabeth tossing you some during larger fights  counts), you aren't incentivized to experiment. On a regular basis, I saw no reason to do anything except hack machines, spam crows, and charge toward folks to stun them. There's a single sniper section, and a single defense section where the bullet absorbing one helps.
• Instead of any manner of ammo/health/mana/money/resource management, you are literally handed everything you need constantly. Took a few too many hits? Here you go buddy, health kit. Didn't buff your salt pool or ration out your salts for this fight? Doesn't matter, here's a potion. Blew all your money on an upgrade for a weapon you haven't found in 20 minutes? Doesn't matter, Elizabeth just pulled 400 coins from her ass. Need lockpicks to open this door? Nah don't scavenge around for them, they're right in front of your face.
• If the extremely dull combat wasn't already insulting enough, there is no fail state. That's right, you get INFINITE lives! And you can't disable this feature like in other Bioshock games! Yay!

Final verdict? 7/10 walking simulator, 4/10 FPS, 0/10 Bioshock. Literally no point in playing it yourself, there isn't even the illusion of player agency. Watch a glitchless speedrun or something, same difference if you just wanted to absorb the ""story"", since that's all there really is to do. I guess that fits its deterministic outlook?

The claustrophobic and horrifying realization of being stuck in a deeper and darker atmosphere deep under the sea ""Rapture"" truly makes the player feel uneasy and is now replaced by fear of hights due to the game taking place in a bright floating city in the clouds ""Columbia"".
(There are DLC for the game that puts you back in the nostalgic city of Rapture which I highly recommend).
Infinite clearly focuses on the action rather than survival-horror and it clearly shows, but it's not a bad thing. This fits the games narrative as this is a story (no spoilers) of a man named Booker DeWitt trying to reach and rescue a woman from the floating city to clear his debt, but for them to leave the city, they have to fight their way through many obsticles along the way such as full on civil war if they ever wish to get back to the surface, back to freedom.

Side Note: If you are looking to 100% this game (DLC included) you're gonna have a bad time. All the campaigns are quite easy to finish even on 1999 Mode for an experienced Bioshock player, but when it comes to the Blue Ribbon Challenges (Survive waves of enemies and successfully complete all of the ribbons on every mission, oh man...

Attention, there may be spoilers.
I will add one thing. An alternate reality is an alternate reality. It didn't have to end like this. I think you lacked the knowledge of alternate reality and that's why it ended like that. Remember that an alternate reality is just the opposite.
So the ending is due either to a lack of knowledge of the alternate reality or the creator wanted us to see his version of events as he made up.
Just because someone goes crazy in another world doesn't mean that in everyone you have to kill every version of yourself.
Example:
You live on yourself, you go crazy after a while and you get angry. Alternative reality: You live your life, you are not crazy, you are good, you live normally.
Again, you don't have to kill every version of yourself.
The ending is too dramatic and exaggerated :) 
And here I am also talking about the fact that in an alternate reality the sky city exists and normally people live in it. There is no heresy, etc. Normal life like ours. This is called an alternate reality people
That's my opinion.

Editing, to Appendix Part 2

Despite its extremely obvious political nature and being set in a literal Confederate-loving White Supremacist Sky Kingdom, this game never felt preachy about a particular agenda and instead decided to tell its own story set in a fictional setting rather than being a hit piece on marginal political groups that the devs didn’t like.

Instead, the game manages to create a setting that is dynamic and genuine, where people get tossed around depending on the political climate like dolls, and you are to witness it firsthand in a tremendously compelling and in-depth narrative that only a few games managed to pull off (but that is given that you have the time to collect all the in-game collectible story pieces which, to be honest, kinda sucks for most people but I didn’t mind it that much).

I also love that there is no “good faction” to align yourself within the game, the first half was showing you how terrible and oppressive the regime in Columbia was and how it needed to be overthrown by the rebels. And then the game proceeds to spend the other half of the game showing how rebels’ concept of justice is simply mindless genocide under the pretext of retaliation, which draws uncomfortable parallels to real-life events and cleverly deconstructs the notions surrounding the romantic idea of a popular revolution against an oppressive system (although the DLC kind of ruined this part with a plot twist, but I won't spoil it for you.)

To me, Bioshock Infinite, like Bioshock 1 &2, is a political game done right and truly improves on the original, and although I would love to see more Bioshock titles, I am too afraid to ask for it, because of the possibility of some writer turning it into a political murder fantasy rather than meaningful commentary unlike all original Bioshock games.",1667507993,1667507993,True,0,0,0.494098246097564697,0,True,False,False

As an adolescent growing up in 2013, BioShock Infinite made a remarkable impression on me as a young boy. At release, the game was met with glowing responses from both critics and fans alike praising the game for its awe-inspiring depiction of Columbia, and its ability to tell a beautiful and emotionally gripping story of Booker and Elizabeth, the likes of which we had never seen before in a First Person Shooter game. To put it simply, BioShock Infinite was unprecedented. But fast forward almost ten years later, and the conversations surrounding this game couldn't be any more opposite. Criticized by fans in hindsight for its regressions in gameplay and convoluted story elements that introduced unnecessary plot holes into an otherwise beautiful narrative. time had not been kind to this once adoring gem. As for me, somebody who has recently played and finished the game almost ten years later, BioShock Infinite, despite its numerous shortcomings and imperfections, is still a game I hold very dearly in my heart. For all of its flaws, I utterly cannot bring myself to dislike it or even see it in an unfavorable light. Since this game deserves nothing less than my full attention, this is going to be a lengthy review. 

[b] The Positives [/b] ▼

[b] 1. Columbia Is Breathtaking [/b]
Seeing the flying city of Columbia for the first time is the closest anyone will ever come to having a religious experience playing a video game. And I mean it. Columbia might be the complete antithesis of Rapture but it is every bit as beautiful and creative as one could imagine. Roaming its patriotic halls and experiencing the history and culture was one of the great joys I had exploring this incredible world. 

[b] 2. Elizabeth [/b]
Amidst the breathtaking grandeur of Columbia, her beauty stood unparallel. Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt, this is Elizabeth's story as much as it is about Booker's. Her emotional journey in search of freedom along with Booker's arc for redemption is the glue that holds the entire experience together, and Irrational Games couldn't have done a more fantastic job with their lead characters. As if I haven't made it abundantly clear enough, I love Elizabeth. She's gorgeous, intelligent, capable, and compassionate, and the technical accomplishments that were required to bring her to life were nothing short of a miracle. Aside from being the emotional crux of the narrative, Elizabeth also proves to be an invaluable ally to Booker; She can open tears and bring in helps to aid during combat, decipher codes and open lock doors, and throw important consumables when the player is running low. Her presence in the game simply cannot be overstated, and she is without a doubt the most important element of the game and BioShock Infinite's greatest achievement. 

[b] 3. Incredible Acting Performances [/b]
When you're up against the likes of Troy Baker, Jennifer Hale, and Oliver Vaquer, it's going to take a great deal of talent to be the stand-out star who steals the show, but Courtnee Draper did it flawlessly. It's not an exaggeration to say that the success of BioShock Infinite rested heavily upon her shoulders. If she failed, the game failed. It's as simple as that. Now don't get me wrong, every vocal performance in this game is easily worth its weight in gold, but what Courtnee, who is the voice actress of Elizabeth, was able to do in terms of bringing her character to life is something that was simply extraordinary. Elizabeth is the very heart and soul of the game, and Courtnee was able to capture every aspect and nuance of her personality perfectly and did the character justice in subtle ways I don't think many actresses could with all due respect. In the end, I had nothing but praise for the entire cast of BioShock Infinite, and it was their incredible commitment to their roles that breathed life into the story. 

[b] 4. The Music Is Amazing [/b] 
I might catch flack for saying this, but BioShock Infinite might be my favorite score of the entire series. I mean, there's a reason why it won the best soundtrack of the year at the BAFTA. I didn't fall in love with every score that was written, but when I do, I fall hard. Frankly, it's some of the most unique and moving pieces of music that I've ever come across, and when looked through the emotional context of the story, it only gets better. 

[b] 5. Combat Feels Fun To Play [/b] 
It's not perfect, but it's a far cry from the ""Call of Duty knockoff"" that so many disgruntled fans love to accuse it of being. It's not as slow-paced and methodical as the previous two games were but in my opinion, that definitely doesn't make it automatically inferior or bad by default. The combat is high octane due to the introduction of the skyline, there are more enemies to populate the more spacious maps, and the flow of combat is fast-paced. Combine that with the multitudes of weapons and vigors that you come across as well as tears that you could use from Elizabeth, and the experience couldn't be any more distinctive than your average first-person shooter. 

[b] The Negatives [/b] ▼

• Level designs are too linear and narrowed when compared to their predecessor
• Time traveling, trans-dimensional travel, and the multi-world theory were handled poorly leading to many plot holes, time paradoxes, and unresolved questions within the story
• A lack of meaningful choices that lead to different outcomes
• Burial At Sea Episode 1 & Episode 2 are suicides in the forms of narratives and characters for Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite 
• The Vox Populi and Daisy Fitzroy didn't have enough screen time to fully flesh out their side of the story
• The visual differences when upgrading weapons are no longer present
• Carrying weapons is now limited to only two
• Tears aren't quite as strategic and impactful as they were intended to be
• Most of the gears you get are mediocre, boring, and sometimes even pointless
• Various other subtle storytelling tools and gameplay elements have regressed such as vigors not being interwoven into the world as seamlessly as plasmids, and enemies not being as interesting as splicers in terms of personality. 
• Vigors play much less of a role in how you explore the world than before
• Some vigors feel too similar to one another in terms of what they do such as Murder of Crows, Bucking Bronco, and Shock Jokey.

Before I move on to my final thoughts, I'd like to take this opportunity to recommend some very useful mods which not only improve how the game performs and feels but also how it looks as well. In my eyes, these mods are indispensable and essential in optimizing your experience, and I'd strongly suggest that you download them before playing the game. Furthermore, BioShock Infinite is an incredibly complex game to talk about, and one where no Steam review could ever do justice to the brilliance and flaws that it possesses. As a result, I'd like to also recommend some high-quality reviews (spoiler alert) for those who are interested in more in-depth discussions and analysis.

This was my first time playing the Bioshock games. I'm not usually a person who plays first person shooters, but I wanted to give this game a chance after hearing about it for years.

Coming from Bioshock 1 & 2, I was shocked over how different this game was, and it was a welcome change. The gloomy, foreboding feeling of the underwater city of Rapture was replaced with beautiful, hopeful city of the sky, Columbia, and exploring the different areas was euphoric to me, especially when I had a chance to look around and not get shot at.

I can't believe this game is almost 10 years old - it's so stunning. The game play is incredibly fun, and the lore - oh, the lore! - is just brilliant and intricate.

I loved Columbia so much more than I loved Rapture, even when it was at its worst. And I appreciated them including all the race issues (including how Irish and Chinese people were treated), although there were definite times when being able to shoot a racist t*** in the face would have been appreciated.

My only big issues with the game were a lack of a manual save, like the first 2 games had, and only being able to carry 2 weapons at once. They rectified the gun issue with the DLC, but I would like to have been able to do that in the actual main game. The manual save issue was the biggest for me - at one point, I explored an entire area for 45 min, only to have to close my game to go somewhere and I had to start all over. That was incredibly frustrating for me.

Overall, this is now one of my favorite games. I can't believe I'm saying that about an FPS. But it's an incredible game and I highly recommend it to all gamers.",1666584137,1666584137,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sadly the publisher 2K recently decided to add bloat to the game which literally nobody asked for: their own launcher, hoping that people who play BioShock Infinite would buy more content from them. 2K did this without any regard for their customers: on Windows gamers are angry because there is another artificial slowdown while launching the game, on Linux people can't even play the game which they BOUGHT anymore. This is unacceptable, if I could give a score for this game it would be a 0, because the game can't even be played at the moment. Worse, a solution which the community came with to skip the launcher doesn't even work anymore.

Columbia expanded on the idea of Rapture making it an overall more fleshed out city. And don't even get me started on the abilities (now called Salts). We get so many of them, each as good as the last one. I found the environments a little bit repetitive but the story more than made up for this anomaly. (Just wait for the ending). Had no problems with the launcher.

Now, so that I don't come across as being extremely unfair here, I never really thought about this game within the context of System shock 2, nor even the first bio shock. However, I did have expectations.

And those expectations were sadly not met. What we have here is a game that, for whatever reason, has a lot of narrative focus that doesn't translate into an actually interesting game to play. Sure, it's worth exploring some of the environments since they are pretty well realized. Hard to argue against the level of graphical and sound design on display here.

But none of it translated into a fun game to play. The combat loop in this game feels exceedingly generic and the gimmicks are lifted straight out of the better preceding entries in the series. Gone are the open environments that allow you to get immersed into the setting and gone is the feeling that the game really cares about immersion at all. It has a story to tell gosh darn it and you better do as it says so it can move the plot(?) along.

I do have a good example that can cut through all of this though, to illustrate just what kind of game this is. When you rummage through trash cans, they always only have 3 slots for whatever items. When you inspect a fallen foe, they also only have 3 slots for anything they're carrying, and so on. Now, some may call this streamlining, but I just call it a half-assed carry over from when the series gave incentives to actually check every object rather than it becoming a final-fight-like turkey in the trashcan for health nonsense.

And this is coming from a huge final fight fan, I love me some yummy trash turkey, but in a *shock game it feels really jarring.

The other aspect that is apparent is that the design of the gameplay is centered on arena set pieces (which are easily identifiable by the railings that you can use to move around in what can only be described as half-baked idea done as quickly as possible so as to be basically meaningless.) This works great in games that have a solid combat loop, but this game does not. The combat isn't eye-gouging bad by any means, but it's simply not good enough to justify basically ditching what made the *shock series what it was. It does work in favor of pushing you along from set piece to set piece so the game can show you its damn plot.

And oh boy what a plot. It certainly has some characters, and events happen. They really do. And then, there's also an ending, which is strange, but since the plot kind of prides itself in being strange from the get-go, it doesn't get any bonus points for being this predictable.

Watch the damn game on youtube, it's cheaper and it accomplishes what the developers wanted since there's very little actually playing the game will bring you compared to watching someone else play it, or even a montage of the first person cutscenes.",1666041766,1666042118,False,1,0,0.470588237047195435,0,True,False,False

The game play is fun and exciting, riding on rails and pouncing on my enemies was awesome, and the most of the vigors were very useful and the game did a good job at making you balance out what you used. As for the gun play, you can only hold two weapons at a time so it's best to pick what best suits your play style. I went with the sniper rifle and shotgun most of the time because I liked to pick off enemies from a distance while having a powerful close range weapon to take down anyone who got too close to me. Elizabeth, the girl who you spend most of the game with is very helpful with getting you ammo, salts(ammo for vigors), health, and money. Plus she can spawn in items or allies to help you in a battle. The main story has an excellent plot that does take some thinking to understand what is happening, but it is really interesting to learn about.

For the dlc, in my opinion it's still good but not as good as the main story, episode 1 of Burial at Sea feels not as fun as the main story since there isn't many rails for you to ride on. Episode 2 changes up the game play with making you focus on stealth first and only using combat as a last resort. I wasn't overly fancy about going all stealthy instead of fighting my enemies head on, but it paid off to have patience and not take serious amounts of damage. The story of episode 2 is better than what episode 1 starts with as it connects with the first bioshock in a satisfying way. 

Performance with the game ran pretty good for the most part. The game had it's moments where the frame rate would drop when looking at certain actions from Elizabeth or a fireplace burning, or whenever I booted up the game and started from my last save. To be fair I do not have the greatest hardware and the frame rate never dropped during important moments of game play.

What a disappointing sequel to a series I have so much love for. 

Bioshock Infinite has made a lot of mistakes. The creative choices that were made for this game scream ""compromise"" and the gameplay of this game compared to the games that take place in Rapture, scream ""watered-down shooter.""

Although Bioshock is a shooter, the first 2 entries didn't seem to be trying to feel like ""combat-shooters."" They felt like adventure games, explorations games, that just happened to have a first person shooter as their basis for gameplay. 

Infinite throws out what made the first 2 games special in my opinion, and it's a shame because Columbia had potential. 

The Setting- Columbia is an insane paradox, because it manages to look objectively pretty and interesting, yet is an incredibly boring, bloom-filled blur. I think part of the problem (and this is linked to gameplay) is that you are moving through the city so fast while utilizing the skyhook. In addition, each stage of the city, is spaced out and there's quite a bit of emptiness. 

What propelled BS1 and 2, was the setting of Rapture and the stories it created just by it's existence alone. Rapture was a gateway that led into the introduction of genuinely interesting characters shaped by it. 

Columbia feels like a setting. And that's it. It doesn't feel like the setting has shaped any of the actual characters, it feels like the plot and the setting are both weak, and could've only been worthwhile if they worked off each other. 

Gameplay/Combat- Infinite's combat is weak and unsatisfying- though I will admit the first time I smashed open an officer's head with the skyhook, was disturbingly delightful. The problem is, any satisfaction from the combat is fleeting and will not last you longer than halfway through the game. BS1 & 2 had a great balance of plasmids feeling good to use, and an environment that worked off them. Additionally, plasmids could be upgraded and combined in unique ways. It felt very classic among traditional FPS mechanics. 

I don't like going on tangents so I'm just going to say- Bioshock Infinite won't satisfy COD fans, and it sure as hell won't satisfy Bioshock fans. But something that needs to be understood is that Infinite is not a bad game, nothing about it is overtly offensive. It's just boring. It really is.

Ken Levine, the games’ director, takes the player on a journey across time and space, and concludes that historically there are “constants and variables.” White people along with their sense of nationalism and religion are always the prime movers of the Cycle of Oppression, while Jews and people of color are their victims. The latter may periodically engage in immoral behavior, but it is always in response to past oppression inflicted on them. BioShock Infinite uses a meta-design to attack the player both directly and indirectly, stating essentially that even if the player believes himself to be a good person who consciously adheres to the tenets of the new-age religion of egalitarianism, evil still resides within him waiting to be unleashed. He is in fact the very thing, he believes to be fighting against. In brief, BioShock Infinite conveys the message that the White male gamer’s only path to redemption is death.""

The main story definitely kept me going through the game, I must say this game features weaker story than Bioshock 2, although the dlc (Burial at Sea) is supper good! Not going to spoil anything, but Bioshock fans will love Burial at Sea!

You get an amazing left and right combination of magic and weapons, and magic/plasmids/tonics have 8 unique combinations with each other, so it's pretty dope! One thing that is sad about combat is you only allowed to have 2 weapons at a time, which you get used to. This is a video game, so why???

The graphics held really well! Graphics wise this was the game to get the year it came out.

Bioshock 1 and 2 are amazing games, and in my opinion Infinite is the weaker game in the series but still above average, and for true fans, it's a must get because of  Burial at Sea dlc

The story is way different than almost any other game but it is still done well. The characters feel like people who in this context could actually exist realistically. The game play doesn't feel unbalanced with one weapon shining above that you must need to play the game. My only complaint is the ending. One common one you'll hear is how it only has one despite it's theme. Though for me it was the fact that I didn't get it until after I searched it up but that could just be a me problem. The game's DLCs: Burial at Sea Episode 1 and 2 have also got to be some of the best DLCs in a lot of games that if it was somehow as long as the original could compete with how good it is. It does really require you to play the first one which you really should've done if you are playing this game but it fills in a lot of the story and even has a very great ending. I would say that Episode 2 is better than Episode 1 but that is my opinion.

It can be played without having played the other two, but you should play the other two Bioshocks BEFORE you play the DLC. 

Why don't I recommend? The game became unplayable to me because of an error of the 2k launcher. I tried every fix by scouring the internet, and it wasn't any hardware or software issue on my end. I ended up seeing a review here to launch the game in the steamapps folder (Steamapps-->common-->bioshock infinite-->binaries-->win32-->Bioshock infinite application) was the ONLY way to launch the game. This was AFTER I made it through the middle of the game (finktown) with ZERO issues launching through Steam until it decided it wouldn't launch anymore because of a dx error. 

I was able to finish the game and I really did enjoy it. The DLC is super buggy and unplayable though, like getting stuck in airlocks, elizabeth getting stuck and not triggering events, etc.

I was expecting the same impressive underwater city ambience (not already over use flying city), level up with adam (not money) and some new lore about character of the Bioshock 1 and 2 games. I wish they have done the opposite, keep what people love (scary underwater city, little sister hard decision, plasmid, adam, character and found a new interesting story. ) There is also no save, just overwrite checkpoint and they are sometime impressively far. 

DlC are not well design.
Very far checkpoint in these 2 DLC  and no save again. I did get a lot of bug. getting stuck, enable to move or get out. Door bug on opening animation ON BOTH SIDE and stay shut forever. Keep in mind, there is no save... or even reload XD, so you need to quit the game and reload 2k account Bulls***, reload the dlc content, reload your last checkpoint and loot again every single place you have done in the last hour or fight 15 round of enemy again. Also, Elisabeth is very annoying in these 2 DLC. She always block your path, stay in doorway, block your hiding spot, you cannot loop around an enemy and melee him without having Elisabeth get in your path in Burrial of the Sea, and she save at least a dozen enemy from free falling in clitc...

+ Decent enough graphics
+ Occasional vertical mobility through skylines makes combat more interesting
+ Elizabeth as one of the most engaging videogame companions
+ A wide enough selection of Vigors (most of which you will never use)

Cons

- Shooting elements are pretty average overall, not really standing out even by standards of its time
- being forced to have a 2K launcher for an already purchased game
- Nonsensical and depressing end-game plot twists that do not provide any satisfying conclusion (the whole story is not that interesting either)
- Not very fond of the historical revisionism (yes, it is a work of fiction, but the highly exaggerated tropes and heavy emphasis on only one side of the presented conflict is quite noteworthy)
- the true ending (one that is both unnecessary and worse than the normal one) is hidden behind several DLCs

Conclusion: A fairly average (and rather overhyped) game with a few noteworthy features, dragged down by its own story that provides very little nuance, forced third party launcher and forcing you to buy several DLCs just to get the true (and even worse) ending.

A MUST PLAY for FPS fans.



The only issue I have with this game is that there is a bug with keybinds in the DLC that has existed since 2013 and was never resolved, keybinds that work in the main game are bugged in the DLC and this can cause issues for some players, so beware of this. Again, main game not affected, only DLC.

(To be more specific: the ""interact"" button works as intended, but the ""loot all"" button, automatically tied to the same key, does not, as the ""loot all"" screen seems to reset to default keybinds every time you loot, i.e. it's bugged. Thusly, IF you have one of the default keys bound to another action, that action will be performed while in the loot screen whenever you try to ""loot all"" with your ""interact"" button. I'm fine with getting used to the default keys just for the DLC playthroughs, but this may not be the case for everyone. Buyer, beware! 

To be even more specific: here is a sample thread on steam, that also links to the 2K forums thread from 2013: https://steamcommunity.com/app/8870/discussions/0/666826251029777181/ )",1664395859,1664395859,True,1,1,0.489624232053756714,0,True,False,False

Graphically, bioshock did an endlessly great job. Ok, it doesn't have very realistic graphics, but it has graphics that reflect the world it is in very well. From time to time, it is impossible not to admire the landscapes that come your way.

Bioshock Infinite is a game that can be considered long enough for its type in terms of gameplay time. If you go straight, it takes around 8-10 hours, if you walk around and search for hidden things, it takes 15-20 hours. The vending machines in the first bioshocks are also in infinite. These tools are one of our biggest helpers in the game. Thanks to Vending Machines, we can improve our vigor, fill our lives, get the salt necessary for vigor and the bullets necessary for our weapons. Speaking of weapons, there are many weapons in the game.

This game is good but disappointing.  number 1 This game suffers from being shown off way to early.  The game went through three different versions . one was the 2010 demo which was more horror related and felt more like bioshock. and the 2010 one still kind of had a horror vibe and showed off a ton of cool features that were cut that fundmentally made infinte a different game. the two different factions the vox and founders were going to be a bigger part of the plot then they were both suppost to equally as bad but thats not  really show in the game and neither is the on going conflict. there was suppose to be moral choice mechincs in the game and choices whether to remain out of combat or not. songbird was suppose a mini boss like the big daddy in bioshock 1 .  Bioshock infinites heavy hitter like the boys of silence were supposed to function differently and be heavy featured in the game. The game was also suppose more of a semi open world like bioshock 1 with rapture but feels like corridor shooter. slight spoiler head. the twist ending just feels like in was tacted on just to have one as it makes no sense and is filled with plot holes and whats more insulting is that you kind of have to get the dlc to explain the ending and even that is filled with plot holes and doesn't do a good job. I feel that this game was an attempt to make bioshock appeal to casuals as the box art and the combat actually shows.  a lot of people say cyberpunk 2077 was falsely advertized but cyberpunk I wasn't as disppointed with besides the buggy mess. This game was falsey adveritsed  because it was shown off way too early  as its a complety different game than was originally pitched on shown of.  I ultimately think some of the choices made to cut certain features was done not because of techincal limitations but to appeal to the casual shooter fan and that is a shame. again false adveritsing I don't think they did on purpose but it was a mistake to show off the game  when most of the stuff got cut.  The good the game looks graphicly amazing and the skylines are a fun addition and combat fun when using the powers and skylines. I still reccomend the game as it is fun but just not as good  as it could have been or show off. songbird unfortuntally is little more than a cutscene and and end of the game mechinic rather than a proper threat or boss that was promised.,1641438927,1664138421,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It was nice to have a protagonist with a backstory such as Booker DeWitt. He felt like the opposite of Jack from the first game, instead of rescuing all the little girls, Booker loses his own and drinks himself to death. That is until the Lutece twins come along and set the plot in motion. The Lutece twins feel a lot like Half Life's Gman, a human with powers beyond human comprehension and the architects of fate itself.

Elizabeth is one of the best companions in a video game, period. She's insanely helpful, giving you ammo, health, salts, and the ability to open tears that have so many goodies in them. The best part is that she takes care of herself, meaning that you can just enjoy your time killing everything. Speaking of Half Life, I enjoy Elizabeth more than Alyx Vance.

Unlike Halo Infinite, Bioshock is ACTUALLY Infinite. Elizabeth and Booker have been trying to escape this time loop that keeps this series' plot replaying. Confused? Yeah me too. And remember when I said that the game felt like deja vu? That's because it is. Columbia exists in a world without Rapture, and Rapture exists in a world without Columbia. With the addition of Burial at Sea, you get to see an alternate timeline where Comstock is in Rapture and Elizabeth kills him. Shit I forgot to mention Comstock was Booker! Well in the end, everyone played their part to start the events of the first Bioshock, which leads to Bioshock 2, which had to be started when Booker got reborn as Comstock after the events at Wounded Knee and then worked with Lutece to open up parallel universes, and so on.

I know my explanation isn't the best with this series, but one of the best things about Bioshock Infinite is exploring all of the possible scenarios of how this plot unfolds, and the possibility that there is one scenario that finally breaks this cycle.

Bravo Ken Levine.""

J'arrive sur ce jeu en ayant fraîchement terminé, et beaucoup apprécié, Bioshock 1 et 2. Arrivé sur ce Infinite, j'ai évidemment tout de suite constaté le changement de ton dans la palette graphique, car on passe d'une cité sombre et déliquescente au fond des océans à une cité steampunk dans les nuages, forcément l'ambiance s'en est ressentie en passant d'un jeu d'exploration semi-horrifique à un shooter bourrin et forcené. Pourquoi pas, mais si ça n'a pas le style d'un Bioshock, le gameplay d'un Bioshock, ou l'univers d'un Bioshock, pourquoi appeler cela Bioshock ? 

Qu'on se le dise, c'est un très, très beau jeu graphiquement, qui a je trouve plutôt bien vieilli et qui tient la dragée haute à Borderlands. Les décors sont splendides, la ville flottante est superbe, les PNJs sont parfois un peu bizarres mais en plissant les yeux, ça passe. Le gameplay remplit bien son rôle de shooter bourrin même si je trouve étrange de ne pas pouvoir porter plus de deux armes simultanément pour un jeu où on va passer 95% de son temps à flinguer tout ce qui bouge vu qu'il y a des ennemis partout, qu'on a un bouclier, et que les pouvoirs sont à peu près inutiles. Elizabeth, le compagnon féminin qui va vous accompagner pendant la quasi-totalité de l'aventure, est un personnage profondément attachant, dont l'évolution des relations avec Booker DeWitt, votre personnage principal, tout au long du jeu, est traitée avec beaucoup de délicatesse ; et l'aide qu'elle apporte en terme de gameplay est précieuse.

Et puis il y a le reste. 

Le gameplay est long et pénible. On sort, on absorbe les balles avec le boubou, pew pew, on tue le vilain, on se cache le temps que le bouclier recharge, on recommence. De temps en temps on utilise un pouvoir de stun de groupe. Puis vient la phase d'exploration où on fouille dans chaque recoin pour trouver 3 pauvres Silver Eagles, qui combinés aux 1497 autres nous permettront d'acheter l'amélioration suivante. Plus de mini-jeu, plus de hacking. On rince et on répète. Et au bout du compte, l'ennui total. Le tout renforcé par l'impossibilité de sauvegarder manuellement la partie en cours, ce qui est une gêne inutile. La philosophie est une critique de l'Exceptionalisme Américain, tout comme le 1 était une critique de l'Objectivisme et le 2 une critique du Collectivisme. Cependant, là où ces critiques dans les deux premiers opus sont faits de façon subtile, en montrant la glissade progressive opérée par, respectivement, Andrew Ryan et Sophia Lamb, jusqu'au moment où la nature humaine reprend inéluctablement le dessus et les deux leaders susmentionnés trahissent leurs propres idéaux lorsqu'ils sont confrontés à la réalité, conduisant au monde de cauchemar qu'est la version post-apo de Rapture, ici cette critique nous est enfoncée dans le crâne à grands coups de marteau et d'images de pauvres noirs caillassés, maintenus en esclavage et ségrégués. ""la religion cé mal, le nassionalism cé mal, le racisme cé mal oci, mon jeu est tellement edgy"" Le scénario, basé sur un multivers et des voyages dans l'espace-temps, finit, comme tous les scénarii qui utilisent ces ficelles, par s'emmêler les pinceaux, au point que le dernier quart du scénar a visiblement été écrit par un scénariste débutant en plein trip à l'acide pour arriver à une fin qui n'a aucun sens, ni moralement ni scénaristiquement. (Spoiler mineur : A la question ""Suis-je responsable des actions et atrocités commises par les variantes de moi-même provenant d'autres univers ?"", ce jeu a visiblement décidé de répondre résolument ""Oui"" ; je vous laisse juger de la stupidité de cette assertion, à moins qu'il s'agisse d'une allégorie du white-shaming post-colonial, auquel cas on a juste affaire à une infecte propagande wokiste). Vos choix n'auront, évidemment, aucune incidence sur le déroulement du jeu. Pas question d'influencer le développement moral d'Elizabeth, pas question de contrôler votre personnage et de faire des choix pour lui dans les moments-clés du jeu, bref pas question d'avoir le moindre contrôle sur l'histoire, contrairement au 1 et 2 qui avaient des justifications pour fonctionner en couloir scénaristique mais laissaient pourtant plus de liberté au joueur pour en influencer le déroulement. Et tout cela nous conduira à une fin qui est absurde, qui aurait pu être facilement évitée, et dont le joueur ne veut pas, puisqu'elle est basée sur des prémisses philosophiques fausses et des incohérences scénaristiques gigantesques. Et bien évidemment le récent launcher 2K est une daube absolue. Je ne comprends pas comment ce jeu a pu avoir autant d'avis dithyrambiques.

En conclusion, voici mon conseil : si vous voulez vraiment y jouer, achetez ce jeu en solde, et arrêtez-vous juste avant d'enfin rencontrer Comstock. Ne vous infligez pas inutilement cette fin incompréhensible et insensée.",1663804274,1663806346,False,6,0,0.502762436866760254,0,True,False,False

For me, when I played this game I had not touched a single player game in years. I finally decided to play this game and oh my god my experience with it was amazing. I did not have a good computer at the time but even playing it lowest settings at 20-28  FPS max was a wonderful experience. If I had the time to go back and play this maxed out like i can now, I know it would be even better. The story is actually really good, I haven't played the DLC so maybe that will give me a reason to go back to this game, but the base game itself is fun, its enjoyable and my actual favorite thing, the music is fantastic. yes, there is better than this, but I believe it earns a solid 8/10.

Graphics: better than ever before. Not exactly groundbreaking or impressive, but it was made in 2013 so I'll give it some leeway. 
Art style: eh, I mean it's pretty cool, I guess? Not quite my cup of tea. Rapture was better imo. 
Genre: not really horror, more adventure/action than anything else. A shame. 
Escort missions: used to be radically difficult, now your escortee gives you ammo and you don't have to worry about protecting her. Win win. 
Story: incomprehensible, with a side of incredulity. Decent at the start, middling at the middle, and dissolved into lunacy by the end. Twist endings are typical of the series, and this game is no exception. But at least the other two's twists were easily understood and clearly defined. This one, I shut down the game after the end, stared at my steam page for a solid minute, and then feverishly researched theories and explanations because I had no earthly idea what had just transpired.
Combat: great weapons and combat mechanics! Skyhook is your best friend! But you can only have two weapons at a time, which just discourages experimentation and fosters a false sense of desperation as you scrounge and desperately hope Elizabeth will bail you out. 
Plasmids: there's plasmids. That's about all I can say. 
Absolute no-doubt-about-it-plusses: the twins. The gear/clothing system. The fact that you now have shields. 

All in all, I respect what the devs tried to do. They kept the heart of what Bioshock games are at their core -- themes of family, themes of identity, a setting of an impossible city in a place where humans shouldn't be -- and they took a major step away from the franchise and tried to breathe something new into the series. And a part of me respects that. But the rest of me just dislikes how they went about doing that. I feel like the game would have been better received by fans of the series if it hadn't been attached to the Bioshock name. It's not a great Bioshock game, but it's a pretty decent game just by itself. It's only when you try to compare it to its predecessors that it falls short. So, the best way to play and still appreciate the game is to try to view it as its own game as much as possible.",1663620766,1663620766,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After having played both bioshock 1 and 2, I felt quite disappointed with this one. BS Ultimate feels dull both in characters and dynamics. The only thing I really liked was the final plot twist and the burial at sea DLCs story. The gameplay was significantly worse than any of the other 2. The fact that you can only carry 2 weapons at a time is a bad decision that I really don’t understand (this changed in the DLCs). At some points you find yourself in a situation with 2 empty weapons and nothing to do, as you cannot change it for anything else unless some enemy drops another one off. Also, using vigor is extremely restricted. If in BS 1 and 2 you had 9 levels to “reload”, in infinite you basically use the vigor a few times and that’s it until you find more salts. There is no map so although it is pretty linear, for exploration purposes, it is a pain as you don’t know where you are, especially in big areas, leaving many things behind. The menu is small and pretty bad visually speaking in my opinion. The auto save system is terrible, you cannot save anytime as in BS1 and BS2 and only change locations or basically have a major event happening if you want to save your progress. Finally, there is an alarming lack of puzzles, in BS1and 2 you at least had the hacking thing, here the vending machines are extremely poor and simple. In general, I felt it was a downgraded version of the original games, except for the graphics everything was worse. The DLCs are the only part of the game that is really worth it.",1663491375,1663491375,False,7,0,0.496748268604278564,0,True,False,False

The enemies and the areas are far less memorable, the only thing that will make you remember an area will be some event you either really liked or hated. For a decent chunk of the game you are just going back and forth from one area to another and even three times in the exact same place just to get to your goal, this ended up being boring and even tho some very interesting things happened with the plot in this time it did not save it. The enemies lost their unique character and the game doesn't have the hard ethical question that made the previous two games what they are. The Handymen are a cheap replacement for the big daddies but they are far far worse. If they hit you your whole screen is usually taken over by their body so you don't even know what is going on. The few choices that you have in the game don't actually make any difference and there also a God awful boss fight against the First Lady, she is a bullet spunge and one of the most unfun bosses I've ever fought. The ending of the game is somewhat familiar to BioShock 2 in the way that is a repetitive fight against lots of enemies with the difference being that in BioShock 2 it was actually interesting cause of Eleanor and Sinclair. The death of the songbird also felt cheap cause: 1. Elizabeth did not need to take it with us through the tear, 2. I felt nothing about the bird, 3. The fact that it got angry just cause the thing we used to ""control"" fell out of our hand feels stupid. Very minor thing that could be better: I would have liked it if Elizabeth had slightly different dialogue as the way she sees Booker changes through the story and it would also be nice if she reacted when you upgraded your Vigors and weapons like the Little Sisters in BioShock 2. Also it would be nice IF I COULD HAVE MORE THAN TWO GODDAMN WEAPONS. (it's technically one cause let's be honest the shotgun will take one of those slots).
I liked the game quite a bit... Elizabeth was a really good character and the story, even if it was too convoluted for its own good, was good even tho the worldbuilding and combat did let me down and there were no interesting side characters. Even tho I would suggest it if you just wanna try it out and really like shooters (not the DLC, please for the love of God don't buy that) I wouldn't give it more than 6.5-7/10",1651316074,1663438902,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You are blocked from going back into the ship so that maybe you could get the Return to Sender. Ah well. Just play from the beginning, eh?

That final battle is just basically wave after wave after wave after wave while protecting (well, trying to protect--you are not going to win in the end) a device that is important but strangely just out there in the open with no installed protection to speak of (and on the Prophet's gunship---you'd think it better protected). Seriously, that was just a head-scratcher. Even if you have the Return to Sender. It's ridiculous the waves after waves after waves. The ending seemed like a lazy way to create a boss fight. Ah well, the rest of the game was interesting. And I did play it before and won, just didn't this second time because I forgot to make sure I had Return to Sender. When you do slog through this tiresome final boss fight you do to get to the finale where you learn more about the story, an interesting reveal, conclusion.

yeah, not going to replay the game. They back-added a launcher on top of the game. The 2K launcher adds another layer of glitches to the game. And DRM. And you have  to create yet another account (because we don't have enough of those--I've reached saturation I guess or maybe it's that while I have an interest to play the game again, it is not great enough of an interest to overcome the 2K launcher being added after the fact. Quality of Life update--not my definition of quality of life.

I tried some workarounds to bypass the launcher but they didn't work for me (going to the game exe directly and launching, -ihatelaunchers %command% after the exe). Ah well, I do need to work on my game backlog! So, moving on to other games.

However, I feel, like others have stated, that adding the launcher, forcing us to create an account to use a game we [b]ALREADY[/b] purchased years ago should be [b]ILLEGAL[/b].

The launcher should be optional at most for previously purchased games. For new purchases, I guess it is the publisher's right to add in the launcher requirement, but revising previous orders, no.

If you don't mind yet another launcher, and, thus, yet another program to take its time to run before you can get to your game, and another way your game can have issues, then go ahead, especially if you have never played the game. I mean, I actually do find a certain enjoyment to troubleshooting computer hardware and software issues, but not quite as much as I used to. Maybe less energy in my old age :-). And this launcher just adds issues when, well, why? I'm not going to go out of my way to add problems to troubleshoot. 

I wish there was an ambivalent choice for recommending. I love the first two games and would otherwise recommend playing them, but I do not recommend the 2K launcher. if you have not ""updated"" your game yet, don't do it! But if you never have purchased the games before, sadly you will be forced to use the buggy 2K launcher and create a 2K account, so keep that in mind. Do a search for 2K launcher issues and make up your mind after that. So, in my present frame of mind, I am choosing not recommending this game. I make that choice reluctantly.",1574100066,1663381113,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A larger focus on movement, traversal and fluid use of plasmids(ahem vigors) over being a walking arsenal. Having only two guns feels fine, if not makes each gun and gun upgrade a more meaningful choice.

The Story:
Stronger than it's level design, the story that holds everything together and takes you along this wild ride is... wild. It has so much subtle foreshadowing that can just be taken as video game logic but it is expertly crafted in there. The other two stories were more settings than a story told.

The Visuals:
Absolutely great. The level design and atmosphere are  the best in the industry as it is so powerful to how it affects the rest of the game. The characters are also very pleasant to look at and well of course better looking than their predecessors.

The Sound:
The voice acting is done superbly and very easily demonstrates what our protagonists are going through in a believable immersive story. The music is great and in a lot of ways more memorable, especially the song that plays once you finally see Columbia, it is much more pronounced.


The Experience:
This game was a true masterpiece. While I loved the previous games this was the one that generated a true response of wonder and awe. I actually cared about the protagonists AND the world they lived in. The previous two felt like you were just along for the ride with mostly the antagonist egging you on and talking to themselves at you. The setting was was also a beautiful touch that makes it a counter balance to Rapture which some could see as Hell.  However the big meat of the story was done incredibly well and honestly left me speechless, the other games were neat, but they did not hit the same. This was their magnus opus.

It is a huge shame that 2K decided to put their launcher on all their previous games making startup awkward and giving me another window. That isn't enough for a negative review but it is kinda sad that this is the only Bioshock in the series that didn't crash. 2K should really think about fixing those games if they are going to throw it on a launcher. as an update.",1662598367,1663204411,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

1) BioShock Infinite lacks the quality of the original game. It falls short of the overall philosophy built into the original game. It does strive to achieve a sense of atmosphere within the game but, lacking that overarching philosophy, it doesn't reach the heights of the original.

2) It is a short game. I finished the game in 15 hours. I've paid less for games that provided double the hours of satisfying game play. So, watch for a sale if interested?

Caveats out of the way, BioShock Infinite is a fun FPS with some challenging fights. Those into Steampunk will likely enjoy the game's setting and design. Characters and plot are interesting enough - certainly more interesting than many FPS games I've played. I played with keyboard and mouse, and the controls were smooth and - once learned - instinctive within game play.

While it doesn't reach the heights of the original BioShock, if approached as its own entity, it can be a satisfying - if short - diversion. (I did like the murder of crows ability.)",1662479949,1662480081,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was looking forward to a new Bioshock game but with the new change I will have to consider not picking it up anymore for 3 reasons - 1.)

The new change makes me think that they will add micro-transactions to the new game even though you are paying the triple A price for the game. 3.) the new launcher does not work on linux the OS I use and while there might be a way around it I don't think it is worth all the effort just because a few higher ups think it is a good idea to add a launcher that adds no value to the game.",1662403202,1662403202,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

The gameplay is the usual mix of conventional weapons and creative use of your Plas- excuse me, your Vigors and the environment. The skylines make it a lot easier to get around the battle stages, and the tears add even more potential for crazy chaos, although they sometimes feel like they're there just so Elizabeth has something to do. I'm not a big fan of the carry limit on guns though; like a lot of modern shooters, Bioshock Infinite allows you to only carry 2 guns with you at any time. In a game series that's all about creative combat, this feels like an odd choice (although the number of different guns in the game is huge), and fortunately the devs chose to go back to letting you carry all weapons at once for Burial At Sea.

The game is less about scavenging than the first one. You still get some freedom about the way you explore an area (and going straight for the objective will mean you miss out on a lot), but it lacks the sense of desolation that you get in Bioshock 1 and 2, simply because in those two games, you walk around in Rapture after the civil war, while Infinite takes place before/during the civil war in Columbia. It makes sense but I still miss it.

The graphics are stunning. Columbia looks absolutely gorgeous, the first time you see the city is very reminiscent of the first time you see Rapture in the original Bioshock (and also an obvious call-back to that famous scene, only the bathysphere is a rocket this time). Rapture also looks incredible in the Burial At Sea DLC.

Unfortunately, the game holds itself up considerably less well in terms of storyline and characters. Frankly, Father Comstock just isn't nearly as interesting a villain as Andrew Ryan, and the struggle between him and the Vox almost boring compared to the battle between Ryan and Atlas. In that regard, Fink feels like he would have made for a much better big bad. This becomes even more painfully obvious in Burial At Sea, when old characters make their returns.
The Luteces, on the other hand, are absolutely brilliantly voiced by Courtnee Draper and Troy Baker as two bickering siblings, and the moments in the game where you encounter them are among my favourite.

I'm not going to say much about the ending to the main story. Yes, it sucks. As for the ending to Burial At Sea, well... That made a lot more sense, actually.

Altogether Bioshock Infinite is not a perfect game, but I had a LOT of fun playing it, and I fully recommend it and the Burial At Sea DLC.",1411730355,1662397545,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For some, this alleged “quality of life update” has made the game unplayable, yet I still don’t believe the questionable practices of the company a decade on from release should reflect on the game the way it does at the moment. For a while, I’ve been toying with the idea of reviewing my favourite game, BioShock Infinite, and now seems like a perfect time to convince any newcomers to the series to give it a shot, despite the negativity surrounding it at the moment. I wish this review to be as spoiler free as possible, but I will be discussing certain aspects of the games like characters and the setting, so if you prefer to go into games blind, please take my sincerest recommendation and enjoy. I’ll refrain from talking about the main points of the story, however, I would like to just add that this game (like its predecessors) has an amazing narrative, which can only be achieved through the medium of video games, and would be lost in other forms of media.

So, let’s begin with the characters, shall we? You inhabit the character of Booker DeWitt, a private investigator and former Pinkerton agent. For those who are familiar with the Pinkertons history in real life, you’ll understand that to be kicked out of such a group implies that he’s done a lot of bad in the world, and he feels like he owes penance to society. He is presented an opportunity to do so in the beginning of the game, which he at first views as nothing but a normal job. This leads him to a person of equal importance in the story, Elizabeth, who is more of a deuteragonist rather than just another side character. The evolving relationship between the two throughout the story is incredibly well done, and will have you feeling for both characters during their struggles. What’s great about Elizabeth’s character is that she’s by your side throughout the majority of the story. And already, I know what you may be thinking. A game based around an escort quest? Lame, no thanks. But you’d be wrong, because for once, Irrational Games (rip) made an escort quest enjoyable, and I’ll touch a bit more on that in the next paragraph. Other than our two protagonists, there are a number of various side characters, all with intricately important roles in the story. However, discussing them here would be spoiler-ish, so once again I shall refrain. If you are interested in knowing how these side characters were received, one of them was awarded “Character of the Year” at the 2013 Spike video game awards.

Now, I’ll discuss the gameplay. The gunplay handles well, and the range of different weapons you can use is vast, all with their own unique feel. You are also given a melee weapon in the form of a “skyhook,” which allows you to travel these cargo rails found high-up across the city, which grants a level of verticality not often found in other first person shooters. Alongside your weapons, you are granted an arsenal of “vigors” which are a series of varying powers you can dual wield with in your other hand. The addition of these vigors separates the game from other formulaic shooters which oversaturate the market, and gives the gameplay a unique feel and playstyle. You can zap enemies to stun them before closing in, or send them floating off the map to their demise. One vigor called “charge” allows you to fly at your enemy like a whirlwind, meaning you can close the gap between you and your foe in a quick dash and finish them with a shotgun, for what I like to call the Mass Effect vanguard experience. In combat, Elizabeth isn’t a distraction for you to be worried about, but rather a noticeable asset. She supplies ammunition, when you’re running low, and also makes sure to keep you patched up when your health starts to dip. Once you become accustomed to having her at your side in a fight, you’ll find yourself fearing for your life if she isn’t there to help. Putting my rose-tinted glasses aside for a moment, there are some valid criticisms against the gameplay that you may find an annoyance. For example, in previous titles, once you unlocked a weapon you had it in your inventory for the rest of the game (think something similar to Half Life). In Infinite, you can only hold two weapons at a time. Personally for me, this was a non-issue as I dislike having to scroll through my entire list of weapons to select one with ammo whilst I’m being attacked, but for some players this was a major concern. Another issue is that combat in the middle of the game I found can feel like a bit of a slog, particularly when replaying the game. Technically you can actually run from a lot of fights, but I’d advise against that even though you wouldn’t miss anything like experience points for example, since such a system does not exist in the game. A lot of joy in the game can be found by simply exploring and taking in the world around you, which brings me to my next discussion point.

The setting of BioShock Infinite is by far the most enjoyable part of the game. In the original, we explored Rapture, an underwater city which was once the pride of objectivist values, now reduced to a run down city crawling with lunatics. Unlike previous titles, Infinite decided to shake things up and looked upward, literally. The game is set in the flying city of Columbia, which was originally constructed as a floating world’s fair, based on the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago (1893). Despite the game being nearly a decade old, its gorgeous art style still holds up by today's standards, and proves that a visually distinct game will always age better than attempts at photorealism. I challenge you to try and not wear out the screenshot button. In the rare moments of peace from the fighting, make sure you take in the scenery and enjoy the short lived bliss, before the next hectic shootout consumes your focus. Columbia is not just the setting of the game, but it’s essentially a character within itself. The world is fleshed out creatively through the use of “voxophones,” which are voiced recordings used to relay short stories or worldbuilding snippets for the player’s enjoyment. If you find reading large text walls of information to be tedious (like this review!), then don’t fret, because voxophones will give you your lore fix in an easy to digest format, all whilst you carry on and play the game!

Anyway, I’ve rambled on too long. I think I’ve made my point clearly that I think BioShock Infinite is a worthwhile game, despite current circumstances regarding the increasingly infamous update. If you find the game unable to launch via Steam, I’ve read that booting it up via the .exe file directly is a temporary workaround. My main point is don’t let the current reviews regarding the launcher deter you, the game is worth the effort. 

For some, it’s not Christmas until Hans Gruber falls from Nakatomi Plaza. For me, it’s when I boot up this game and “After You’ve Gone” kicks in.",1662372772,1662372772,True,0,1,0.433098822832107544,0,True,False,False

Enemies are also quiet samey, and the new boogeymen you encounter, the Handymen, lack the ominous presence of the Big Daddies. You also never get to fight Songbird which is totally bizarre for such a unique villain. 

The skylines are a great addition and add a necessary sense of verticality to the flying city setting. The new plasmids (""vigors"" now) are interesting but the concept has no reason to exist in Columbia. Hacking has, mercifully, been removed entirely. 

Elizabeth isn't an escort NPC but a fully-fledged party member, requiring no coddling or protection, ending up as a net gain to your capabilities by finding resources for you and modifying the environment in- sadly- limited ways. Her voice actor does a great job and she has an interesting relationship with Booker, Bioshocks first protagonist with his own honest-to-god personality. He sounds like Troy Baker because that's what Troy Baker sounds like.

The story is pretty barebones on anything but a surface level and the ending makes no sense at all if you think about it for longer than 5 seconds. But if you can overlook that and just enjoy the emotional beats it's fine.

The DLC is more of a love letter to the original Bioshock than a logical continuation of Infinite, but it does a nice job tying up loose ends and I got to hear ME WEE BABY Atlas again, so.

I went back and forth a lot on this one.  The shooting is a lot better than its predecessors, but you can only carry 2 guns at a time.  You get all of the magic automatically, but I found it even less useful than before.  The game is even more linear then BioShock 2, because there is next to no exploration for 90% of the game.  The setting of a city in the sky was a great idea, but it turned out to be a lot less visually interesting than I'd thought it would be.  1912 is also an interesting setting, but you didn't get as immersed in the culture as you might've been, especially with the main characters talking just like people from 2012, instead.

The story starts off pretty rough, too; you're not in Columbia (the sky city; not South America) long before you realize what's going on.  The racism going on is so blatant that it actually goes does more harm than good toward the anti-racist movement of today; when you paint racism as the over-the-top caricature of white hoods goose-stepping while clubbing minorities and spewing slurs, it makes today's more subtle racism seem like not such a big deal.  ""Oh boy,"" I thought, ""this is even less subtle than the first game's message.  Well, at least I know what it is that's been bothering me about BioShock's writing for the last few games.""  From there, you have a ""twist"" that's very poorly explored, the characters reach a conclusion before you do without any real evidence, and it's ""proven"" by actions so out-of-character they might as well have been ripped from Legend of Kyrandia 3.  Uhh... kids, ask your parents.  The writing is worse than ever, and my cynicism has built an entire labyrinth of walls between myself and immersion, and lit them on fire.

And then, the story goes all WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT, and all of a sudden, I'm interested again.  It wasn't exactly deep, but it was [b]weird[/b], and I was SO invested in what was going on.  It brushed it off like nothing, and we were back to boring again.  AND THEN, IT CAME BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!  I was prepared to write this off as another pedantic installment that elicited a number of unearned gasps, and the ending still blew me away.  Plot twists are so often a lazy writing device used to attempt to inject some intrigue into a story that's nothing special to begin with, but Bioshock Infinite understands the one thing that really matters: it [i]does something[/i] with it.  It isn't perfect, and I hate to be [i]that[/i] person, but stay with it until the very end; you'll likely find a worthwhile payoff for it all.",1614752889,1662229835,False,0,0,0.526749014854431152,0,True,False,False

I don't condone adding random launchers and data collection systems. No matter how good a game is, that doesn't give publishers to right to screw around with content that people have previously purchased. (The fact that when you buy on steam you're not purchasing, just licensing, is a symptom of the same problem and also does not excuse this behaviour).

For posterity, and should the publisher reverse this decision, or if you choose to buy and bypass the new launcher, here is my original review:

Infinite is a great third game to the Bioshock Series. I initially had my reservations with it, at it seemed to take the game in a completely different direction, both in terms of gameplay and storytelling. But it completely won me over very soon into the game.

Gameplay: This game has some pretty major differences to the previous games in the series. Most of these are pretty good. 
- You're restricted to only two weapons at a time, which I think gives you a more realistic FPs than one where you can lug around an entire armoury on your shoulders.
- New vigours or plasmids. These mix up the special powers into something much more imaginative and magical.
- No more fiddling around with gene splicing. This game makes the process of upgrading yourself a bit simpler. You can have as many upgrades as you want active, provided you have enough coin to buy them. There are some 'magic gears' that you can get and wear. I'm not entirely sure I like them, as they randomly generate and are hidden around levels, but they provide extra abilities if you want them.
- Sky Hooks. One of the great things in this game is the sky hook. This, with the lines you can zip around on and jump everywhere give a sense of freedom to the environment that takes advantage of the fact that this game feels very 'open', even though it's played fairly linearly. It reminds me a lot of what I felt playing mirrors edge.
- Much larger levels. This game has much larger levels and gives you more freedom of movement between them. It also makes good use of 'tears', which allow you to modify the combat field in imaginative ways.
- Elizabeth. The game introduces what I think is one of the best 'companions' in an FPS I've ever played. She provides you help in combat that goes beyond just shooting back at enemies, but actively scouts for loot so you don't have to. The game also makes use of some pretty good AI which, even though Elizabeth is just following you around, makes it seem as if she is actively makign choices on her own, and actually feels 'alive'.
Given all of these changes, I feel as if the game play in this game is a great improvement on the previous bioshock games.

Story: 
This game takes a big departure from the previous bioshock storytelling. Rather than following someone on a radio, you are more directly involved with the events that are playing out before you.
This game has a pretty deep story, that I won't go too much into because of plot spoily reasons, but it involves a lot of great themes like [spoiler]parallel universes, family relationships, and hard choices.[/spoiler]
Plus, the characters in the game all seem to be very real, and rather than having your standard villain that you need to beat, everyone is on a spectrum of good to evil.
The game also helps to add depth to the story by the use of tape\record\video collecting to tell the stories of some background characters, if you want to seek them out, like in previous games.

Graphics: The graphics in this game are amazing.
The environments of all of the structures are beautifully crafted, with buildings that give a real atmosphere of everything from a lived-in 1900s american city, to a civil-war style battleground, all surrounded by steampunk floaty island-ness.
The main characters have some great design to them, both from a perspective of their general appearance, and the design of the costumes\clothes\armour they are wearing.
I did see a fair bit of copy\paste in the background civilians, but the game did include a few stand-out background characters even though they appear only briefly [like the barbershop quartet].
The post processing was a bit much at times for my tastes, but that can be fine tunes if you want.

The worst part of this game: Checkpoints.
Checkpoints are awful.
The previous games allowed you to save anywhere you wanted, but this game restricts you to only saving at given checkpoints. This provides a problem as if, like me, you like to explore every nook and cranny of a level, you can spend a long time between checkpoints. And if, for life reasons, you need to take a break, your options are all awful.

It would be great if someone at 2K games were able to implement this, but unfortunately, you're just going to have to deal with it.

Bioshock Infinite is maybe the most soulless game I've ever played.

The gunplay is clunky garbage. Movement is, often quite literally, on rails. Enemies are all damage sponges. The powers are bizarre and somehow never feel very effective, interesting or congruent with the rest of the setting, almost like you're playing a Chinese knock off of Bioshock. It feels like a different game shoehorned into a template of what someone who never played Bioshock thinks Bioshock is. My working assumption is that Ken Levine ate a tombstone piledriver onto solid concrete in the late 2000s and never recovered mentally. This isn't the revamp anyone wanted. I rate this gameplay a zzz/10 for being a sleep aid.

The plot doesn't fare any better either, despite being the biggest source of bloviating approval. It doesn't really make any sense and even if it did, it wouldn't be very compelling because there are no real stakes and characterization is flat-to-nonexistent. The protagonist is bland which means the antagonist is also bland, because they're secretly the same character. Furthermore, imagine being so high on your own farts you write a side antagonist called 'Mr. Fink' who is a moustache twirling factory owner virtually plagiarized from Dickens. Unless you're some sort of incel neckbeard fishing for material to construct a headcanon 'waifu' you can daydream about, this game contains zero characters of interest. (Un)surprising, since there's only about 4 in the game to begin with: Booker, Elizabeth, Fink and the lady scientist who's supposed to be important but I forgot her name to make room for more important trivia. Did you know Baku is the capital of Azerbaijan?

Now if you thought writing a story with zero characters was impressive, you haven't even begun to grasp the levels of incompetence involved in the construction of the setting itself. Most obviously it's an intentional pastiche of classic Americana, but undercuts any kind of depth or structure by presenting its world as a Disney theme park. On purpose. It's supposed to look like a series of lifeless amusement ride facades by design, grappling hook rollercoasters and all, because the same fart-huffer who wrote Fink thought ""World's Fair as presentational metacommentary for the superficiality of American exceptionalism"" was VERY smart. Oh, and the nefariousness lurking behind those facades? It's just racism. Tell me when you start caring about either of these stale political takes. Also, we already have a racist version of Disney: it's literally Disney. The game disappears so far up its own ass it accidentally becomes the thing it's satirizing, a far cry from the objectivist dystopia of Bioshock which skewered Ayn Rand in a way that didn't age like milk. Ironically, Bioshock Infinite is a game that presents a multiverse but manages to be one-dimensional in every respect.

First, the gameplay does feel fun, the different vigors you get feel smooth with the gunplay. The guns feel okay I guess, not super memorable compared to previous games. The game looks so visually pleasing at parts, loved the colors and scenes that made you want to screenshot (bloom and lighting can be a little much).  The economy feels kinds odd, you have to choose if you want to upgrade your gun or abilities, while you hardly ever need supplies. The setting is cool for sure and immersive, however the feeling of isolation rapture gives you is unmatched imo. The enemies feel so bland and gimmicky compared to the insanity that was splicers. The big mechs (I cant even remember their names off the top) were lifeless compared to big daddies. Another nitpick is I miss hacking. The story...really was not for me.  Booker is pushed so hard to be badass and Elizabeth this Rapunzelish character that can feel awkward at times. The dialogue between the two really took away from some scenes. The ending was the cherry on top, felt like it was trying so hard to be deep and the shock value of things being revealed. The inclusion of a certain setting felt like fan service. The shock value of religion and politics was also not my favorite. Overall, if this game is on sale or in a bundle and you played the first two, go for it. However, this game feels like it was inspired by bioshock, not a mainline game. The dlc being set in rapture was such a tease, the story could have been interesting if made into a whole game. I was not the biggest fan of the wave based mode compared to protector trails and the first games side mode. I do feel like if this game did not have the Bioshock title, I would have gone easier on it.

We feel it our obligation to make the public aware of the other offerings that 2K can provide so that we may ease this suffering and this struggle of constantly searching for something that will replace Bioshock Infinite.

I have no idea. 2K has forced an update download that completely fucks your installation of any of their games (I tried it with ""Mafia"", and the same thing happened). Apparently, it's some sort of online thing that I don't understand. Basically, it goes like this:

Play a game once; the launcher doesn't recognize what's going on. Thus, you can play the game perfectly as normal and not notice anything wrong. Close the game and then try to play it again, and it won't even open. Honest to goodness, you can't even launch Bioshock Infinite (or any of their other games) after that from the 2nd attempt onwards. The game literally won't even turn on.

At first, I thought this must have been some sort of a hardware issue, so I tried restarting my computer. Didn't work. So then, I looked up ""bioshock infinite steam not launching"" on Google to see if anybody else has had this issue. There were posts from 2018 and also from 2020 about having to reinstall Windows. So, I tried wiping the `$PATH/compatdata/<pfxid>/` records (as I'm on Linux and not Windows) to start with a clean prefix. Also didn't work. Then I went to this very game page on Steam and scrolled down to the reviews. There are lots of negative reviews from just the past few days (I'm writing this review on Sept. 2nd, 2022) cursing the game development company about their new shitty launcher.

I'm very terribly sad and angry about this. Bioshock is a beautiful game. I'd just barely started playing the first half-hour or so of ""Bioshock Infinite"", and I couldn't wait to see how the story unfolded. It obviously has something to do with religion somehow. That much at least is super, super clear even just from the first half-hour or so. The aesthetic of a floating city with semi-jointed suburbs is just beautiful. Again, I didn't really get to see anything regarding the story, so I can't comment. 

It was getting late and i had to go to bed, so I turned the game off, thinking, ""Wow, this game is beautiful. I can't wait to play it again tomorrow!"" Cue the narrator's voice in the background: ""As our hero would soon discover, there was no tomorrow.""

Anyway, it looks like a great game. I just wish I'd been able to play it. So, as much as I actually do love the beautiful aesthetic of Bioshock Infinite, and as much as I was really excited to experience the story, I have to give this negative review because game companies need to learn that they can't fuck their customers like this. We need to get the message to them somehow.

In summary, fuck 2K, and especially fuck whoever signed off on this new bullshit launcher that doesn't even allow you to play the game.",1662157721,1662157721,False,8,0,0.554140090942382813,0,True,False,False

I've started replacing my Steam library with games from GOG (and other places) because they don't do this. Your games bought on Steam will never be safe, you never know when this will happen or to what game. And if you've loved the game for years? Tough break, no refund because it's past the two-weeks-since-purchase refund period for Steam. This will be the third game that I paid for, downloaded, enjoyed for years, and then lost to unreliable 3rd party software forced on me through Steam. Thanks Steam, that's really uncool. None of my games library feels safe now. What are you going to take from me next? 

Get this game from somewhere other than Steam if you want to play it. Steam will sell you one thing, then turn around and add a bunch of garbage without asking or even informing you first. How long will it take them to mess up your save files with something that wasn't part of the original purchase, added without your permission? One week? One Month? One year? If it's longer than two weeks, no refund for you. But there's no two-week cap on how long developers can use their game as an excuse to force proprietary software onto your computer. Software that may die when it's no longer profitable to support, cutting off your access to the game entirely. Software that may track your behavior, like how long you play, when you play, your IP address and where you're located geographically, who else you play with, and anything else they can get. Software that was never essential to play the game until the parent company decided they could squeeze a few more bucks out of you. This has been going on for years.

2K added a launcher to our games and -if you don't know how to bypass- can make the game give us an ERROR message instead of fun.

The story made sense 1/2 of the way through, but in the second half turned into convoluted garbage. They threw too many things in there, such as ghosts, infinite worlds, class warfare, double identities, that it is all too much to keep track of. The dramatic voice acting didn't even hit any emotional notes for me because I had no clue why the current story point was important. Why is Elizabeth's mother a ghost but also a representation of herself? Why does Elizabeth keep creating new worlds? Why is the main villain of Comstock so quickly brushed over? Why is Dewitt also Comstock? And to make mattters worse, the ending dragged on and on, never ending, and confusing me even more.

[h1]  ⚠️        RUMOR CHECKING:[/h1]
* By installing and using the Software, you consent to the information collection ➜ This is not true!

* No classic features (No more Security Camera, Hacking, Crafting, Carry Health Kits, Manually save, Map for a guideline) ➜ True, but I have seen many of us ok with the changes. Now there is a DLC that return most of the feature from classic Bioshock

* Uninspired combat system: limited to carry only 2 weapons and it doesn't fit with melee execution, regenerating shield, collecting lockpick pin ➜ Those look fine!

Well, it's a tepid thumbs up. Several times through the story, I had to ask myself: is the game just ok, or is it just old? I don't really know because I completely missed my childhood, but at least I am not blinded by nostalgia. Honestly, I am dragging my feet to write this review.

The gameplay holds up, I guess, to 2010's standards, but as another review commented, some of the boss fights really halt your momentum to progress through the story. At the last one, after many many attempts, I just said f*** it, and went from Hard to Easy to continue the story. The game is generous with supplies until it isn't, and that was one such case for me. Sorry, but I'm not going to beat multiple waves of George Washington mechs on Hard with 4 pistol ammo and an RPG. You're going to have to throw me a bone.

The main attachment point for the player is the story and your companion Elizabeth. I'm a big fan of Many Worlds / Everett's Quantum Theory BS as a plot line, and I'd say it was executed alright here, but my disappointment is it's really only hinted at throughout the story. Although the ending is good, and does do a good job to make you think, I wish there had been more investment in this MW concept throughout the game instead of just slapping you across the face with the ending.

I'd say I see how the game is a classic, but I'd personally suggest just buying it on sale and running through it quickly on Normal difficulty or below. I don't think playing Hard was worth it, and neither was finding audio logs or getting achievements.

[h1]Notes:[/h1]
[olist]
[*] As time passes, I find [i]Bioshock: Infinite[/i] to be steadily disappointing. From the nonsense storyline to the streamlined mechanics to completely screwed-the-pooch boss fights, this is a game whose goodwill got by entirely on presentation.
[*] ... and this game's presentation is certainly incredible. The initial view of Columbia is magnificent, and the little anachronisms at first hit you as a ""huh, that's weird"" sort of deal before the story unfolds. It's beautiful - really. However, [i]Bioshock[/i] felt like each plasmid and bit of dialogue or design had a place in the world... and for [i]Bioshock: Infinite[/i], it becomes quickly clear that most of the world design is a fresh coat of paint rather than an actual fleshed-out world. What, you're telling me there's a tonic being sold whose purpose is to just... hack vending machines? Or possess people? The narrative explanation in the first game stated that your normal splicer [i]couldn't[/i] use plasmids that way (which is why houdini splicers were so scary - they could!), whereas in [i]Bioshock: Infinite[/i], we've just completely thrown out caring about that I guess. The Fraternal Order of the Raven is the most egregious example. Sure, one could say ""just turn off your mind and play the FPS"", but isn't this game supposed to have a great, grand narrative?
[*] The ""normal enemy"" mechanics feel pretty solid. Handymen and firemen are both fun to fight and sad to behold, and the general mook is far smarter (though still occasionally janky for 2013 games) than the other two series entries.
[*] Boss fights are atrocious bullet sponges. This starts slow with the Motorized Patriots being easy to fight but long to kill, and gets really [i]really[/i] bad with a certain Siren boss fight whom you have to kill three times. Boss fights in this game are a complete annoyance that frequently stop the game's momentum. Again, the ""turn off your mind"" people might quickly see that this game isn't actually that mechanically deep on the FPS side.
[*] The first [i]Bioshock[/i] game got flack for taking out some of the 0451 characteristics of predecessors and sisters like [i]System Shock 2[/i] and [i]Deus Ex[/i]. In the third installment, we're just a straight-up FPS. There really isn't any different or exciting way to play this, and the clothing options are a bit of a joke.
[*] Elizabeth is a legitimately good companion who should be the typecast for escort missions everywhere. Could you imagine playing this game and actually worrying about her safety as a damsel in distress? No, she's a perfectly capable woman on her own... even if that's kind of strange considering she's supposed to have been locked up all her life yet immediately acclimates upon release. But hey, that's expecting a consistent story.
[*] The story is.... well, again, presentation is the ringer here. But if you were to read this game's script without the flash, you would quickly see how plot hole-ridden and frankly idiotic it is. It's kind of hard to talk about this particular twist in a post-2016 American political landscape, but the certain line ""the only difference between Comstock and <character> is how you spell their names"" is just so ivory-tower nonsense that I'm surprised Troy Baker didn't refuse to say it on principle. It reflects this general shallow approach that [i]Bioshock: Infinite[/i] has despite expecting you to be wowed at every turn and twist, or getting by on the pathos of playing ""Let the Circle Be Unbroken"" ten times. And sure, maybe I'm overthinking philosophy in an FPS... but wasn't that the point of [i]Bioshock[/i] games?
[*] When I first beat [i]Bioshock: Infinite[/i], I thought it was one of the greatest experiences in gaming I've ever had. I was genuinely moved by the ending in particular, with the chemistry between Troy Baker and Courtnee Draper being phenomenal. But since then, with just a little bit of thought applied to the game as a whole - it utterly falls apart for the mechanically and narratively shallow experience it is.

im gonna be honest, i was gonna make an in-depth review about this game but its CoD with super powers and a terrible story. i genuinely can't recommend this game after playing the rest of the Bioshock series, its Bioshock in name only.

if you honestly believe this game is good you've either never played the first two games or you have terrible taste. there's literally no reason to play this over the other two games unless you hate yourself

1 play through on hard, no dlc so far

Good story, but a little bit cliche when it comes to the twists
Gameplay is about the same as bioshock 1 & 2

Graphics are almost exactly the same as the trailer shows

bosses are set up pretty well, except for the ghost - that bankrupted my character.

Upon replaying Bioshock Infinite almost 4 years after first beating it, I have a new found perspective of this game and have a little more I would like to add beyond my initial review. This game is without a doubt, one of the most beautiful games I’ve ever played. Aesthetically, it works wonderfully for me. While not every level is filled with amazing detail or visual storytelling like in other games such as Fallout or even Bioshock 1, spending time in the world of Columbia is a treat. The colors, saturation, and world building it engages in are really well done. The game is clearly a relic of early 1900s America and it clearly still struggles with class divide and racial segregation. In fact, this country prides itself on white power and capitalism to the point where it plays a central role in the story. NPC dialogue, propaganda posters, and other elements throughout the world all help flesh out the world and are fun to stop and engage with. 
	One of the main subplots of the game plays into this class divide with a proletariat uprising. This violent uprising uproots the white elite of Columbia and through the combined effort of minority groups and the exploited worker class. This conflict places you on the side of the proletariat, mostly out of necessity, as you attempt to find a ride off of Columbia. Initially, the game takes a very anti capitalist approach, using 1900’s imagery of overworked and underpaid workers being exploited by self indulgent and larger than life bosses. Upon the proletariat victory, the game takes a much different approach, showing the communist leader, Daisy Fitzroy becoming the same violent and power hungry leader she sought to destroy. It definitely aims to show these two “extremes” as equal which is ultimately disappointing as one is white nationalist religious zealots and the other is working class uprising. Although many deem a violent uprising necessary for systemic economic change, it’s unfortunate how Daisy Fitzroy are merely pushed to the side, becoming enemies that are no greater than their oppressors.
	About halfway through the game, the revolution aspect of the game is completely abandoned, without any real meaningful conclusion. Elizabeth, of all people, kills Daisy Fitzroy, which essentially sends the revolution into a frenzy since it no longer has its face. Although it was kill or be killed with Daisy at that point, I thought Elizabeth would have resonated with their struggle a little more. The second half of the game deviates into a rather interesting many worlds theory type of story. It is here where the true nature of our main characters are revealed. Having played the game twice and watching videos on the subject, I am able to piece everything together a little bit better, but it is certainly the type of ending that will have you looking up explanations. It is a very high concept and some may view it as “pretentious”, but I for one have come to enjoy the ending. It does a fantastic job at concluding the story regarding Booker Dewitt, Comstock, and Elizabeth. Beyond the communist revolution and aesthetic of Columbia, it seems like this was the story they were truly trying to tell.
	One of my favorite aspects of the game was the relationship between Booker and Elizabeth. They start out as complete strangers and over the course of the game, they slowly learn how to trust each other. There are plenty of times throughout the game where Booker’s selfishness or Elizabeth’s headstrong attitude conflict with each other, but it always leads to growth in their relationship. By the end of the game, they truly do have a father-daughter relationship, where Booker would do anything to save Elizabeth. I don’t think their relationship is as natural as Atreus and Kratos in God of War, but I did find that Elizabeth and Booker had more chemistry.. Their interactions throughout the game are perfectly acted and add a lot to the atmosphere of the game. Having a character by your side, who is naive to the outside world, slowly discovering her purpose in life is a treat to watch unfold. The end of the game has an off putting tonal shift in which Elizabeth becomes this all knowing, and almost godlike that goes on to explain the ending of the game to Booker. Within the context of the ending I suppose it makes sense, but it is still weird nonetheless.. Comstock plays a compelling villain to Booker and Elizabeth. I love how clearly vulnerable they make him despite how worshiped he is in Colombia. He is clearly scarred by his past involvement in wounded knee and attempts to cover up his sins with religion, which is quite the opposite of how Booker handled that situation. 
The pacing of this game is incredible. The plot is constantly moving forward, with the only exception being the Lady Comstock fight, which slows the pacing down to a halt. This section isn’t that long, but on harder difficulties, it can definitely be frustrating . Besides this slight mishap in pacing, these is little to no backtracking or filler in the game. Naturally, that leads to a shorter game of about 12-15 hours, but it is 12-15 hours of riveting story that is never dull. Upon a second playthrough, on the 1999 mode (hardest difficulty), I found the shooting and fighting set pieces to be exciting. The rail system allows for a great amount of verticality to the game. You can approach fights in countless different ways, using height to your advantage. The vigors were also useful and I found myself relying on them more on the harder difficulty. At some points, I found the hitboxes of certain benches, staircases, etc to be unforgiving. Booker would often be stopped in his tracks and I’d be forced to move around the smallest obstacle. I also found that trying to jump on and off of the rails quickly would often be unresponsive or glitchy, making it difficult to exit and enter the railing. Despite these problems I found the game to be exciting and rewarding, especially on harder difficulties 
Despite some jarring 180 degree  story changes, spotty social messaging, and infuriating boss fights, there is something magical about playing Bioshock Infinite. The beautiful coloring of the world coupled with the mystery and mythos of Columbia, create one of my fondest gaming memories. The ending is really well done and each main character gets closure to their story (especially Elizabeth in the DLC). There’s a reason why people still make videos on this game almost 10 years after it came out. 9/10

The first two games are ""Infinitely"" (get it?) better, with the first one still being the champion. The story here was ridiculous. The call of duty gunplay, while fun and snappy most of the time, doesn't mesh well with the bioshock health-sponge enemies it occasionally throws at you. Handymen are particularly egregious in that the amount of screen shake applied to their mere presence turns the game into an unplayable mess until you manage to kill them. Luckily there are only a few of them that I encountered. 

Again, ridiculous story, the end actually made me laugh out loud, and I gave up on trying to enjoy it about halfway through, I think, when you start dimension hopping and that pretty much indicates to me the writers just gave up. I should have seen this coming when the start of the game has to make you not like the villain by just making him a big racist, and throwing around a bunch of white power propaganda for shock value.

✅	Pleasant artstyle
✅	Very enjoyable world (nice looking, fancy) (Never liked aquatic themed things like first games had)
✅	As usual great narrative presentation, did enjoy the story itself as well this time
✅	Elizabeth sidekick is cute and how she interacts with stuff/idle animations are cute
✅	No more switching between 100 weapons constantly because of running out of ammo 
✅	With Elizabeth combat is more dynamic and interesting (give free stuff, opens rifts that give you combat assistance
✅	Gore is nice
✅	Abilities have projectile and trap mode
✅	Love the mystery eccentric duo
✅	Skylines are fun
✅	Executions
[h1]CONs:[/h1]
❌	Some missing graphic settings that you are force to tweak in config (i.e motion blur, DoF, UI scaling)
❌	Don’t like the Charlie Chaplin styled lore reels
❌	Wish “enter” could be rebinded… literally only key I have to travel across the keyboard to do things..
❌	Mouse sensitivity is lowered a lot when sprinting
❌	Story’wise Elizabeth can be quite obnoxious (but overall she was great)
❌	No manual saving
❌	Whats with ammo quantity at the later part of the game…
❌	Ability based key interaction were minimal / introductionary 
[h1]Comments:[/h1]
Pretty comical how Elizabeth warps around the moment you turn around camera. I somehow managed to get myself stuck as well in the first 30min of gameplay (jumped on stuff then got eventually stuck)
One thing that I found annoying but were at start like “hmm that’s nice”. Is the ammo management. First half of the game or even more, you get ammo everywhere and Elizabeth also gives you free ammo… but after certain threshold in game ammo becomes suddenly so scarce, which was really annoying. I mostly were forced to melee around as I hate collecting random guns on the ground from enemies as not only I haven’t upgraded em, but also that ruins my meta gameplay. I usually end up choosing guns I like the most, upgrading them and using the whole game, which was really nice at first half of the game as I got 0 ammo issues.
With weapon upgrades you have to be picky. As throughout the game I could upgrade only 2 weapons fully.
If compared to previous installations…. I enjoyed this the most. Artstyle was more pleasant, enjoyable sidekick, more entertaining characters and world was much much more fun and pleasant to explore. Sky islands with skylines was tons of fun. Also gunplay wasn’t so obnoxious. As you essentially could pick between plenty of weapons that you like the most and upgrade them. Plus boost your choice of gunplay with gear and abilities. By the end I rolled with rifle and RPG with projectile shield and crows as ability. Damn crows were OP, they essentially disabled the whole arena, especially once you get upgrades for it. Another thing that made gunplay more fun is that you didn’t have to constantly switch between weapons as you got plenty of ammo and with gear could get even more. Previous bioshock stories were maybe more “realistic” in a sense… had sense of mystery.. but this was simply purer form of entertainment. There were fun twists, eccentric elements and more straightforward premise.
As for DLCs there is challenge mode I couldn’t be bothered and story DLC of different parallel world. In story DLC we back to aquatic world sadly…. And ammo became cancer again. I ran out of ammo so often that were forced to melee shit… Also think I liked this Elizabeth the most, she hot.
Part 2 intro was, interesting for sure I guess for lelz? Lockpicking minigames, going through vents, sneak killing enemies, using enemies against each other is essentially part 2.
Part 1 of DLC focuses on action/gunplay, part 2 focuses on stealth

The gunplay is satisfying and the freedom to move across rails and leap from great heights gives the combat a fluid and dynamic feel. What steals the show is the first ever competent NPC I think we've ever seen in a FPS, Elizabeth. They've managed to make sure she doesn't block your movement, she intuitively stays near you either ahead or behind but never blocks your path, she alerts you to items in your area and in combat will even seek out things you need and throw them to you, they truly set a new standard for NPC design in this game. The story is intruiging, it keeps you constantly interested with a cast of eccentric characters and balances the pacing of story and combat extremely well.

I have limited expeirence with these games as I only played Bioshock 1 on ps3 YEARS ago, and only a few hours of System Shock 2. It could've been something far better, judging by what we got in those older trailers. While I did enjoy playing it, it fell flat in certain areas. Not just that, but it was hyped to infinity back in 2012-2013. could not even go one commercial break on TV without that ""beast of America"" ad playing.

_________________________________________________________________________________

Here's what I liked;

The atmosphere.

Columbia is a fabulous world with such amazing architecture and soul. The whole turn of the century look is one of my favorite things out there so to see it so realized in video game form is quite amusing.

The main characters

I absolutely loved Booker and Liz's dynamic. Specifically at Battleship Bay and the rescue in Monument island

The Music

All those song remakes were fun to listen to, and a personal favorite of mine is the OST that plays when songbird first pursues you.

The animations

I liked the weird animations that would play whenever you'd drink a plasmid and it starts messing up your body.
_________________________________________________________________________________

Here's what I disliked;

Many plot elements.

Multiverse as always is a finicky concept as best to work with in a plot, but it's just all the more odd here.

Combat

It literally feels like a COD game where you can only use 2 firearms at any one time. The game feels like it's trying to appeal to a greater audience and while I don't dislike COD, it doesn't work in this series. Along with that, the hook being confined to a button instead of being it's own individual weapon slot is annoying too.

Lady comstock boss fights

Need I say more? It was more annoying than most other bosses I've fought before and went on too long.

Too Linear

Compare it from System Shock 1 all the way to Bioshock 2, the overworld in this game feels more like connected paths you follow and not as open ended, so despite taking place in the endless sky, it manages to feel more confining than the halls of rapture or the citadel.

180's

From columbia being seen as a nice gorgeous and wondrous spectacle of a city with citizens being kind to each other, to then be shown right AFTER the raffle as a corrupt xenophobic culture chock full of unsubtle propaganda and many citizens making rude comments towards everything came off as weird, especially since there were pretty much 0 signs of it prior to the raffle.
along with that, Daisy becoming a child killer out of nowhere and the Vox turning on you was just dumb. ""both sides are bad"" never works in these types of situations, the plot was just asking for more melodrama at that point. It's even dumber because no more than 1 map earlier, you and the Vox were allied with each other.

The ending.

Perhaps it was ""2deep4me"" or I just didn't get it but that was one of the strangest endings I've ever seen.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching some tiktok videos. So i decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me so many happy memories.

8870,119919230,76561198013024213,0,4,3851,0,3851,1658059008,"So, i played Bioshock 1, 2, and Infinite all within the span of like a week, working on all of the achievements for each game so i could experience everything this series has to offer.

++ Bioshock: Infinite as a standalone was a really fun game, the change of scenery, as well as the changes to how the combat works and plasmids are dished out, called ""Vigors"" in this installation of the series. This series always provides such an interesting look into different time periods and putting them into such fantastic scenarios. However considering the game by itself, i still believe that the first two games offered more in exploration, combat, and general action. I LOVED using the rails around Columbia to get around and gain an advantage over my enemies, but i was a little disappointed in they ways they used the rails, they were super cool, and i loved them, but i think they probably could've utilized them a little better.

++ Bioshock: Infinite alongside its DLC, Burial at Sea, was the best experience I've had. It wrapped up most, if not all of the loose ends of the series, and provided tons of interesting ways that the series could continue. With all of the scenery changes, game play changes, in tandem with all of the new content that Infinite already offered, was seriously cool and i loved every second of it. Including the DLC, Infinite takes the cake as my favorite Bioshock game. It was emotional, it was beautiful, and it was fun.

++ The game was gorgeous, the visuals were breathtaking, playing this game on an ultra wide monitor was an incredibly cinematic experience, it was like i was playing a part in an action film.

++ The Clash in the Clouds, blue ribbon challenges were one of the hardest, but most exciting challenges i had to complete.
they were hard, they were time consuming, they really could've benefited from a checkpoint system, but i learned so much in unique ways to utilize the weapons and powers in Bioshock: Infinite, that i couldn't help but come out of the experience super pumped and with a great sense of accomplishment.

++ Bioshock is always very honest in its telling of different eras in our time, sometimes this leads to some uncomfortable topics being brought up in the story of Bioshock. To me, these moments are welcome, they help add realism to the incredible storytelling of this series, and i respect the developers refusal to shy away from harsh facts of American history.

-- The crashing issue that i noticed in the past 2 Bioshock remasters, is still prevalent in Bioshock: Infinite. However, i will say that i crashed the least in this game, i also lost the least amount of progress from crashes in this game compared to the other two. This is still my biggest complaint of the series, these crashes were the only real issue i had when playing them all.

-- I was really disappointed in how the hacking system has fallen apart through the series, in Bioshock 1, the hacking was challenging, but fun. In Bioshock 2, the hacking system was made so much simpler and easier, to the point that it was almost too easy, but i was happy that i could still hack things to my advantage. In Bioshock: Infinite however, the hacking system was reduced down to just a vigor that's much harder to predict and control than hacking. I think this would've been an awesome change if they included the hacking and possession abilities together, kind of like they did in the past, but with hacking pretty much gone i was sad to see it.

OVERALL ++ Playing through the Bioshock series from start to finish, including all of the DLC and challenge maps, completing all of the achievements along the way, was INCREDIBLE. The storytelling between the games was all mostly linear, and i finished the series with very little questions, and a lot of answers. Despite the crashing issues across all of the games, i still, loved every second. Bioshock is an awesome example of a fun, classic feeling game, there was never a point where i felt overly bored or frustrated. I recommend this series 100% to anyone that enjoys a good ole fashioned beat em up shooter.

[b]BioShock Infinite[/b] is the third title in the successful franchise from [b]2K Games[/b]. Bringing a proposal to change the setting of the series and evolution of the gaming experience, Infinite features a complex and intelligent plot, incredible graphics and renewed gameplay.

[h1]From the bottom of the sea to the top of the clouds[/h1]
BioShock Infinite's first scene pretty much sums up the game's stance towards its two predecessors. The new protagonist, agent [b]Booker DeWitt[/b], appears in a small boat in the middle of the sea and heads towards a kind of launch capsule, which projects him to the heights, taking him to Columbia, a floating city. The metaphor of leaving the ocean and heading for the sky is quite clear and shows both a willingness to change and respect for what has already been done in [b]BioShock[/b] and [b]BioShock 2[/b].

Throughout the game it is possible to notice that the heavy atmosphere of the claustrophobic corridors of Rapture has been left behind, giving way to the bright and bright Columbia. Gradually the curious city reveals its secrets to us through the eyes of the character DeWitt, who represented another change in the series. Booker breaks the silence of the former protagonists and actively participates in the game's dialogue, showing his strong personality.

[h1]Exciting and refined gameplay[/h1]
Initially the impression is that the gameplay is practically unchanged in [b]BioShock Infinite[/b]. The firearms, the powers, the items scattered all over the place, the radio messages, the health and energy bars, everything is present. However, with the arrival of Elizabeth in the plot, the real changes present themselves, and please.

Just before finding [b]Elizabeth[/b], [b]DeWitt[/b] gets into a mess and soon we realize he can only carry two guns at a time. The change may seem punitive, but it actually ends up contributing to the dynamics of the game. It will no longer be possible to choose your three or four favorite weapons and play from start to finish with them. You'll have to adapt to the game's various challenges and make smart choices about which weapons to carry with you. For example, in a part of the story with distance shooting, it doesn't make sense to have a shotgun, but a grenade launcher or a rifle for long distances. The novelty forces the player to 'make do' with weapons that he doesn't master so well, needing to improvise to keep Booker alive.

The great innovations are presented with the arrival of [b]Elizabeth[/b] in the plot. Fortunately, the character doesn't do the 'helpless damsel in distress' type and doesn't need to be saved every fight. In fact, it's Elizabeth who helps us in times of need, whether it's looking for extra ammo, warning of the arrival of enemies or using her special ability. Elizabeth is able to open portals that warp time and space and can bring entire objects from other realities into the battlefield, like an automated balloon that shoots her enemies.

[h1]Improved death/rebirth system.[/h1]
Unlike the other BioShocks, in which the player was respawned with what was left of ammo and energy (Eve), in Infinite you return (again with the help of Elizabeth) with the resources you had before the last fight started. In this way, it is possible to rethink your strategy and start practically from scratch, instead of simply fighting with what's left of the last beating you took in the game.

A factor that also deserves to be mentioned is the rail system. Using a hand hook (which also serves as a weapon) it is possible to travel at high speed along the Columbia rails, reaching higher places and surprising enemies from above. The mechanism adds a lot of agility to the game's combat and serves as a different way to explore the scenario, avoiding the long walks of [b]BioShock[/b] and [b]BioShock 2[/b].

[b]The skills are very interesting, such as the powerful crows and the fun power of levitating enemies, and the equipment works automatically, you just have to choose the effects that you like the most. In addition, the Big Daddy and Big Sister leave the scene, and the Handymen, the Patriots, the Incendiaries, the gigantic Songbird and others enter. To make it a little more difficult, most of them are immune to some ability (Igniters are not affected by Devil's Kiss bombs, for example).[/b]

The increase in the variety of mini-bosses forces you to prioritize your targets better during combat, taking down the ones that pose the most danger first, since throughout the game they tend to appear in packs.

[h1]Parallel worlds and many questions to be answered[/h1]
The story of BioShock Infinite takes place before the events of the first BioShock. The plot brings some well-known elements of the franchise, such as the protagonist initially without a past and the theme of dystopia, represented by the decay of a society full of fanatical followers led by a tyrant. In Infinite the story revolves around three axes, the pasts of DeWitt and Elizabeth and the history of the mysterious city, Columbia. Add to that the maiden's power to alter reality and the result is a complex web that links parallel universes that converge on a main plot.

[b]Patriarch Comstock represents the authoritarian leader of Columbia and fights the rebel group Vox Populi, led by activist Fitzroy. Both sides have their share of followers who fight each other, turning Columbia into a floating battleground. However, when traveling between the different realities through Elizabeth's power, it is possible to see different versions of the story, in which the roles are reversed. Therefore, there is not a villain and a good guy, but there is meaning in the plot, which is gradually revealed with the twists and discoveries of the characters.[/b]

Being one of BioShock Infinite's strongest points, the story is dense and well-crafted, with revelations well distributed throughout the campaign, which keeps the
 our high interest during game hours. In this way, Infinite will appeal to you who are looking for more than just shooting in a game.

[h1]Columbia delights in every detail[/h1]
BioShock Infinite's graphics and sound are simply impeccable. The city of Columbia is stunning in every detail, be it the lighting, the richness of objects in the scene or the fluid movement of the characters. It all demonstrates great dedication and care from the game's development team. In addition, the city seems to have a life of its own. In a square, for example, people walk and talk aloud, and not just when you approach and click on characters. DeWitt and Elizabeth are also communicative and initiate conversations with others spontaneously, without our intervention. All this helps in the immersion experience provided by the game.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[b]BioShock Infinite[/b] brings the innovations we wanted to see in [b]BioShock 2[/b] and surprises us by taking the franchise to a new and higher level of quality. The presence of the character Elizabeth is one of the great successes of the game, allowing a fluid interaction with the protagonist both in the complex and intelligent story, as in the frantic combats. The graphics are another asset of Infinite, with impeccable lighting, detail levels and movement.",1657426857,1658986432,True,21,0,0.664358675479888916,0,True,False,False

I have played all 3 and I consider the 3rd to be the worse. They all had their problems but I could not enjoy the 3rd instalment. 

Overall the game is too easy, it won't let you choose the hardest difficulty from the start and the hard setting can be cleared even by a monkey. Hard is supposed to be hard, period.
Ammo is literally unlimited, never had to buy any at all. The shield is busted, all you have to do is take cover until it regenerates and carry on killing enemies by said tactic from afar. In very few instances you get forced to play close and if so you have some overpowered builds with charge and so on. It reminds me of Tomb raider where I had to drop since it literally was holding my hand. If you like Uncharted/Tomb Raider holding hand difficulty Bioshock Infinite is the same. Not my cup of tea. 

At least you don't have to solve these annoying puzzles like BS1 and the turrets are way less (DLC included).
Also, I find it frustrating that you have to keep spamming interact to collect the overabundant items hidden all over the place. This game style hasn't been fixed since the BS1 and I mean fixed because I find hard to believe that anyone enjoys collecting 5 different items repeatedly on small area spaces. 

Story is a mess. I dislike time/space relate stories because everything is open to interpretation and you can get away with it. Bioshock infinite was advertised as a different game, different story but eventually for some reasons we got a different game.

On the dlc Elizabeth tends to bodyblock you a lot. On an instance she bodyblocked me while I was crouching waiting to ambush 2 enemies. Had to jump to get out revealing myself and dying...

I am a huge fan of the Bioshock series, so when this game was announced I watched every single update, trailer, sneak peek, demo and leak. The beta game footage in the trailers was incredible, so i preordered the game and waited anxiously for the game to come out.
but, little did I know that most of the interesting mechanics and cool setpieces that I saw in the trailers had been stripped out of the game. not only that but [spoiler] the story starts to get really bad halfway through, when Booker and Elizabeth travel to a parallel universe, and the ending sucks, seriously it makes no sense, the games writer does NOT understand quantum physics [/spoiler] those problems with the story were probably caused by the numerous rewrites and redesigns that the game had.
but, beyond my disappointment, the gameplay we were left with is all right. it was good enough that i played it a couple times even before it got the DLC. the visuals are really good for the time it came out, and they hold up  well because of the stylized character designs.
The first DLC was Really good. it actually fixed most of the problems I had with the main games gameplay and some of the problems I had with the story. but the second DLC wasn't as good. it ruined a lot of the story improvements from the first DLC and it spoiled and retconed the first game in the series. still, it was cool seeing the characters from the first Bioshock in HD, but the way they disregard the lore from the second game in the DLCs was also really disappointing.
I'd recommend you get the game only if its on sale, and only if you've already played the first game, because of the spoilers in the DLC.

This game was fun, but I still wish we had gotten the version shown in the early trailers, because that version looked like it would have been legendary.",1432904142,1658917834,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Developers made a few steps back from Bioshock 2, end even the first one.
The biggest one is a 2 weapons limit. This forces players to unnecessarily choose between weapons while in the previous games we could have sizeable arsenals at all time. At one point it really hurts the experience. Without spoilers, there is this one enemy that is a major bullet sponge. A few extra guns would really make a world of difference.
The ending is pretty out there, even for Bioshock standards. I wasn't fully satisfied with how the game ended. It, and the final boss fight felt rushed. All of those things drag the game down a notch or two below B1 and B2 (yes, I'm saying it: Bioshock 2 is better than Inifinite, in both story and game play :D).

All the above aside, this is still a great game, well worth playing. While the ending may not fully deliver, it's not out right bad. And for the most part the story is quite fun to follow. I also like the characters, especially Elizabeth. She is very well written and portrayed during the game. Also, as AI managed companions go, she is quite useful in fights :). Her mid-to-late game ability is really fun to use. Too bad it's limited to scripted locations.

I also very much like the setting. Rapture is awesome, iconic underwater city, but to me personally Columbia, a city in the sky, beats it hands down. It's an outlandish idea (what isn't in Bioshock games). But it also looks so damn epic. Great place to have an out there story like this one.

On the technical side everything was fine. It's an older game now, so don't expect visual fireworks. Still, the graphics holds down quite well.

The gameplay changes a LOT from Bioshock 1 and 2, and not for the better. While the shooting itself feels a more crisp, the aspect of resource management from the first two games is completely gone. Instead of having a health bar with medkits, you just have one massive health bar and restorative items are used immediately upon picking them up. The game showers you with ammo, meaning you don't really need to think about how you're using it. This also means that money is pointless except for buying the major upgrades for your guns and vigors. There's also a new shield mechanic that works the same as Halo, except it's pretty pointless as it barely blocks anything. The vigors (which are the replacement for plasmids from the first two games) just aren't as fun or creative as the plasmids from the first two games, as I don't feel like I need to use them creatively. Additionally, the basic enemies are just a huge downgrade from what we had previously. Splicers in the older titles were aggressive and had good AI, while the soldiers in Bioshock Infinite feel more like braindead mooks from a Call of Duty campaign. Honestly, a whole squad of soldiers in this game is less threatening than a single splicer from Bioshock 1 and 2. As such, the game really isn't challenging until nearly the end of the game (and I was playing on Hard BTW). Level design is also a lot more linear with not much opportunity to explore off the beaten path.

It's not all bad though. While the basic soldiers are boring, when the game throws special enemies at you, they are fun to fight. The automatons, patriots, handymen, and firemen are all fun to fight. The combat also flows fairly well. I also enjoy the sky hook mechanic, which adds a cool dynamic to fights. The tear mechanic adds a hint of strategy to the game, allowing youu to make choices such as sky hook points for faster traversal, extra weapons and restorative items, friendly machines to fight alongside you, etc.

Then there's the story. There are some things I love about it. The city of Columbia is a really interesting setting that I absolutely adore. Another high point are the characters, who are interesting and well written, and I especially love the dynamic between Booker Dewitt and Elizabeth. However, the actual plot is a complete mess. it pulls in way too many directions at once, trying to focus on many things but succeeding at virtually none of them, and it only gets more confusing the longer it goes on. After beating it, I had to look up explanations on the internet just to [strike]enjoy[/strike] understand what was going on, and even then I'm still having trouble wrapping my head around it, mostly because about halfway through the game, they decided to bring in multiple universes into the plot for some reason. Also, besides one throwaway scene of absolutely no significance, this game does not connect to the other games in a meaningful way.

TL;DR: Bioshock Infinite takes many steps back from its predecessors in terms of gameplay and story, but it's not entirely bad, as I enjoyed it enough to actually beat the game. I'd say get it on sale if you're interested, but don't expect it to be as good as the first two games.",1658703439,1658703746,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The slow exploration of the first two games are mostly removed for a more fast-paced, action, oriented experience, reminds me more of a Wolfenstein or Doom game rather than what Bioshock has been previously.   Highly Recommended.

aim assist you can't turn off

default aim button is binded to your scroll wheel button.

game won't run with any performance monitoring software. (MSI Afterburner Rivatuner will get you a black screen onstartup with no explanation as to why unless you look it up)

overall, the aim assist makes aiming a chore and unfun, you have to fight it to get headshots, besides that I suppose the game is okay, its definitely not as good as bioshock 2 and if you liked bioshock 2's gameplay a lot, you won't be so familiar with this one.

The ""Vigor"" controls are unintuitive, I hardly used them and honestly forgot about them until I needed to use them to advance, the game's pacing is significantly more open and dynamic compared to previous games. However this means you can sometimes get lost in a level and things aren't so clear a lot of the time. You won't get the magic arrow on the top of your screen anymore.

[i]Barriers to Trans-Dimensional Travel[/i],
— R. Lutece, 1889

I just want to precede this by saying that I went into this game completely blind, knowing nothing aside the ""city in the clouds"" bit, and I suggest you do too. Don't read this review. Go play it. I'm not going to directly compare it to either of the previous games because it's so different, but if I had to make a bold statement, I think it's the best of the series, I have almost as many hours in it as in the first two combined, and the fact that I replayed it at all, when I had little inclination to replay either of the first two, should speak volumes. Bioshock Infinite is fucking awesome. 



Note: I beat the game once on Hard, went through and played through the DLCs on Hard, then went back and beat the main story again in 1999 Mode -- the only major achievement I didn't do was to revisit Burial at Sea: Episode 2 in 1998 Mode.

The beginning is probably the best opening sequence I've ever played. The first few minutes are weird and mysterious, with a very similar style to the first game, as you arrive at a lighthouse with ominous religious phrases inside. You land in what seems to be a church, and soon enough, from there you enter the city of Columbia.

At this point I saw that this is the most visually impressive game I've ever played. The graphics and art style fit perfectly together, and your entrance into Columbia is magical. There's a fair bustling around you, full of exhibits to see and minigames to play. Since Infinite starts as a walking simulator, I was practically spamming Alt so that I could walk through it as slowly as possible. (Though, ""spamming"" partly because Walk doesn't like to stick for some reason.) I easily spent an hour just taking it all in. The citizens are having all their side conversations, and there are references to things that seem important ⁠— ""Vox Populi"", and ""False Shepherd"", for example ⁠— but they're just mentioned, not exposited upon, leaving you to wonder. These are just subtle hints that there is something more than meets the eye to this place. Once the sinister underbelly truly reveals itself, the real game begins hitting the ground running: you are the prophesized False Shepherd, and the (racist) society of Columbia wants you dead. (Well, the police do. Most of the civilians just poof into thin air, which is a bit odd.)

Before I continue talking about the story, let's talk gameplay. Infinite takes quite a turn from the previous games in that it's mostly linear. You could argue that this is a downgrade from the more sprawling, exploratory gameplay of the first games, but let's be real, the main difference is whether the linearity is hidden or not. Personally, I didn't mind Infinite's approach, and it's refreshing in a way — this game dares to stray from the ""BioShock formula.""

Instead of plasmids, you're now equipped with vigors, and the weapon control scheme is much like BioShock 2, with the one caveat that you can only hold two guns at a time now. Personally, I actually think this an improvement. When you have seven weapons available at once, it feels like bad game design if you're using one almost exclusively. Infinite accepts that weapons are not created equal, and if you don't want a weapon, you don't have to ever use it, allowing you to tune your loadout to your playstyle. Yet, at the same time, when ammo is scarce, it forces you to take risks, to switch weapons mid-battle and adapt on the fly. (Also, I do think gunplay overall is better than the first two games.) On the other hand, you still have access to all vigors all the time (though I didn't notice this for a few hours). I didn't end up using Devil's Kiss or Murder of Crows frequently, but most everything else I found distinct uses for. Although fundamentally some of them are reskins of familiar plasmids, things like Undertow and Return to Sender add new, fairly deep mechanics. When I played through in 1999 Mode, I gained a real appreciation for Bucking Bronco, Undertow, and Return to Sender, and figuring out how to use these vigors properly gave me a huge edge in combat. 

Zooming out a bit, I would say combat is overall the most polished of the series. Yes, I do miss Big Daddy and Big Sister fights in a way, there's no longer any element of a terrifying, roaming mini-boss, and no, Motorized Patriots and Handymen are nowhere near as interesting, neither as enemies nor lore-wise. Yes, most of the human enemies are kind of same-y, though Infinite's enemies are generally an improvement over splicers in that they use the full spectrum of weapons. What makes Infinite unique is that it has frantic, high-octane combat, which it leans into mechanically, and to that end it has Tears and the Sky-Hook. Elizabeth's Tears make the battlefield dynamic, and require on-the-fly thinking to harness to their full potential. You can have a freight hook, [b]or[/b] you can have a turret to help, [b]or[/b] you can have health and ammo supplies: pick one. But then a few seconds later, you can pick another, and so on. It forces you to constantly assess your position and the positions of the enemies. With the Sky-Hook you can use freight hooks and the Sky-Line, which really add to the verticality and mobility to combat, respectively. But, you're vulnerable when using them, so there's added strategy there.

Some miscellaneous criticisms:
- There's not many civilian player models, and sometimes you can see a whole group of people with the same model in one place. It's uncanny.
- When you grab onto a hook or Skyline, the camera has to settle in a certain direction before you're allowed to move it again. It's kind of annoying.
- Enemy visibility can be a bit tricky sometimes, soldiers' colors don't always stand out.
- Some dialogue is bugged and two characters will talk at once during important scenes.
- [spoiler]The Boys of Silence are just cameras and have nothing to do with silence. I realize this is due to development hell, but still, silence-based stealth would have made more sense.[/spoiler]

It's about time that I mention that [b]Elizabeth is absolutely the pinnacle achievement of this game. This is how to do a companion[/b]. With a Disney princess-like ""girl in the tower"" backstory, she has exactly the personality to fit. Her voice acting and mo-cap are fantastic; she walks around the environment looking at things like newspapers; she makes small talk; she points out items for you; she opens Tears; she picks locks; she throws you ammo, salts, and health kits during combat, apologizing if she can't find anything... I could go on, but she actually seems like [b]a person[/b]. Most importantly, [i]Elizabeth will actually copy your movement speed[/i]! Hallelujah. Also, the [spoiler]""Will the Circle Be Unbroken"" scene in Shantytown[/spoiler] is a highlight for me.

My second favorite character(s) would have to be the Luteces. With sarcastic, absurdist dialogue straight out of ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,"" accompanied by their distinct accordion tune, they're both comic relief, yet genuinely important characters, [spoiler]seeing as how they're the masterminds behind basically the entire game[/spoiler].

I'm almost out of space and there's many things I haven't talked about, but the last thing I really want to mention is the ending. I think it's awesome and it actually works. Major spoilers. [spoiler]The first time I beat it, seeing everything fall into place, I was basically frozen in my seat with my mouth hanging open. That final piano note gave me chills. It's a ton to process, but it ties up nearly all of the plot holes. I defer to this video that I think explains it mostly well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhjKW1S1xvk.[/spoiler]

Its the final entry of the Bioshock franchise, which i honestly think is one of the WAAY better immersive sims to come out back then. But uh.. you saw the thumb. This will be split into 5 sections instead of a really cluttered essay.


1. THE GAMEPLAY

The gameplay is really bad. It also feels way more streamlined than bioshock. Many mechanics were added in with no rhyme or reason besides ""They were in the last two"", or ""They were in the popular games"" and if thats the choice they wanted, why change the gameplay so much? Lets address the call of duty sized elephant- There is a fucking sprint button. Now, do i think this is inherently a bad change? No, a sprint can still work. But do i think its a good change for the bioshock  franchise? No, because the last two bioshock games were designed to make you feel disempowered to some extent. You had to creep around, using your most disposable weapons no matter what so you didnt face an encounter with your worst gun. It makes the game less of a careful immersive simulator, and more like a ""get shot, shoot more back"" game. 


2. THE GAMEPLAY (PART 2)

My main problem with it is the lack of weapons. Since this released in the same year as COD: Ghosts, you have only two weapons on your person. Yet for some reason, they KEPT the upgrade system. That doesnt work since your wasting hard earned money (yes, no more adam and regular cash, you get your vigors, upgrades, everything with money.) on something that will be unuseable by the next level. This gets worse during the vox period where you get reskinned versions of the same weapons you upgraded, but they dont HAVE those upgrades. Why make a upgrade system if you arent gonna give it a weapon wheel of sorts where you hold all your weapons? In Bioshock, you  would upgrade your gear so you could use your best weapons when you needed them. You bought different types of ammo for your proximity mine launcher to take on a big daddy for adam easier. In Bioshock 2, you would upgrade your gear to become a weapon of mass destruction. In Bioshock Infinite, you would upgrade your gear just to be told off when you wanted to keep using the weapon you paid to be stronger.


3. THE GAMEPLAY (PART 3)

Now then, since this is a streamlined call of duty clone- i mean bioshock game, they had to make it so they wouldnt be sued for the game being so difficult a 7 year old would toss there xbox controller at the wall and it bounces back and breaks there skull. So, they introduced Elizabeth, a plot important character as she can open ""tears"" into different realities or points in time. But the intresting thing is that this is a game mechanic, and not JUST a plot point. Meaning that she can make tears for cover, ammo, weapons, health, freight hooks, turrets, even patriots! She can also ""scavenge"" (stand behind a piece of cover and do nothing)  for guns, weapons, and money, and even health if your low on it! She is quite litterally, just a glorified assist mode.


4. THE STORY (light tread on it)

The story has two sides, one side of the coin is this timeline altering, marvel style quantum physics, and other random stuff. The other side is so miniscule and worthless that if you flip a coin and it lands on this, you transform into a white writer instantly. The side i wanna talk about is the racism side. It doesnt have anything deep about it because they do NOTHING WITH IT. Only thing they do with it is shove imagery down your throat and OH LOOK OH MY GOD ITS A BLACK GUY ON HIS KNEES SHINING SHOES OR CLEANING SOMETHING! WOOOOAH! Now, im not going to say that racism isnt something to cover in media, but its just distasteful to do THIS with it. Also, a large portion of the story can be described with the grandfather paradox. Basically, if you went into the past to kill your grandfather, you would be unable to exist since in the future, you killed your grandfather, but since you dont exist, how could  you kill your grandfather in the first place? Its very weird.


5. CONCLUSION 

Overall, Bioshock infinite is a mediocre video game, and a terrible bioshock game. Everything about it feels copied from a different game  without any thought about what it would do to the other parts of the game. Its story is weak and forgettable (had to read the wiki to remember it), It has shallow undertones of racism, and its gameplay is thoughtless and feels less like a bioshock game, and feels like it'd fit better as a replacement to call of duty ghosts.",1645653416,1657590700,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Like the original Bioshock, this game has an incredibly imaginative story and richly detailed environment, but this time it all takes place in the airborne city of Columbia in 1912. The action is significantly better than the original Bioshock, but once again I felt like the biggest motivation for playing this game was to further explore the city and uncover the next plot point in the amazing story. And just as it was with the first Bioshock, the climax and finale are exceptional. As for the optional DLC, the first Burial at Sea episode is good and the second is excellent.",1604380632,1657559333,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love how the heavy hitters are actually hard to kill, but somewhat not designed to make me feel they are overpowered. Vigor combos are extremely fun and satisfying to use once you get the hang of it.

The story was hard to grasp for me but has a lot of depth in retrospective analysis. Elizabeth is best girl.

This time around I took my leisure to explore around gathering lockpicks and loots because I know each time you die in 1999 mode you'll lose 100$ so I stacked my greens as much as I can, upgrade only the weapons that I'll be using most of the time, and it helps a lot. My tips for you, if you're going to play in 1999 mode, be conservative on your spending and don't afraid to invest upgrade in only 2-3 weapons, since Ammo cost is cheap anyway so you just need to find circus of values to restock all the ammo.

Is it hard? damn right it is (not really), often times it feels unfair and you are always fighting against the odds, enemies are a lot stronger, when you die, enemy health return to full (yes, the boss health will return to normal when you re-spawn), so I depended a lot to a shotgun in close combat and sniping enemies from afar (since if you try to melee and get melee-d by enemy instead, your shield is instantly broke)--the final fight is the greatest pain in the ass because you literally have to become one man army to defeat wave after wave after wave of enemies with often without salt stock and wondering are your weapon even do damage the enemies at all (despite shooting right in their faces), I'm losing my mind because one time, when I got out a the room setting up my defenses and like entire country shooting at me from every direction. 

You have to find your play style and adapt to fight certain enemies that will not be affected by your current play style and look into their weaknesses to beat them. I strongly advise to use and upgrade sniper, and if you good at landing head-shots it will helps a lot to lessen the enemies count before you're facing them head to head (especially those annoying fireman and the likes of them, they can be killed with one head-shot but took forever to kill if you shoot them in the body).

In the end, I come to appreciate even more the work that developer has worked on the game, I explored the nooks and cranny of Columbia each level, enjoyed every single details that I found in the game. Thank you, Irrational Games and 2K, this is a lifetime experience, and I feel bad because I can't just erase my memory and play this game again without knowing anything like the first time.",1597375402,1657251590,True,0,1,0.473684221506118774,0,True,False,False

I had gotten the game for free back in the day when the Xbox 360 was still relevant. When I first played it, I really didn't have any expectations going into my play through on the Xbox 360. I had only known about Bioshock 1 & 2 through internet reviews and media outlets at the time but had never came around to play neither of them until recently. When I finished Infinite for the first time the story had mind fucked me so hard as a 14 year old kid in 8th Grade that I was mentally affected for two days. The one thing that I still remembered after 7 years since my last play through (besides the ending) was that the outside world of Columbia was so damn mesmerizing and beautiful for its time of release. I'm always surprised to see that it wasn't received as well as I would have expected back then but I guess I was just so enthralled in the story and world that what many consider to be average gameplay didn't deter me at all- I just so deeply yearned for answers at the time. After playing through the remasters and finishing them completely, I only had infinite left to play. I was so excited to play infinite because even though I had only completed it once on the 360, I felt like since I had gotten older and had now played Bioshock 1 & 2 that I would finally get the full picture. After all those years the game really gave me that same feeling It did when I had first played it back when I was middle school. The atmosphere, the story telling, and the graphics is still great and it felt like I was 14 all over again. After finishing infinite and the Burial At Sea DLC, I can now say that infinite (In My Opinion) is the best in the trilogy. Infinite will always have a special place in my heart and is one of the few games to ever make me cry like a baby after finishing the Burial At Sea DLC. I highly recommend this game to anyone and I also recommend Playing thru Bioshock 1 & 2 if you plan on getting the Burial At Sea DLC(that it makes sense to you).",1657188784,1657188784,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Basically a game with awesome combat and gameplay system, beautiful graphics that have aged really well and a plot with great twists and a head scratching ending, what more do you want?

No God's, Only Man.

Booker, do you fear God?... No, but I fear You.

Lives, Lived, Will Live.. Dieing, Dead, Will Die.

Bioshock, one of the greatest series EVER, unrivaled in unique First person horror Shooter with an excellent story narrative and progression / Atmosphere.

You, Booker DeWitt, the false Shepard.. the Tin Man.. play this incredible story out from start to finish, I can't tell you a single goddamn thing.. it will ruin this for you.

Play the game, buy the game.. pick all three, its worth every second and I look forward to the next installment.

10/10 - the very best trilogy in gaming history in my opinion, I beat these game multiple times each, tons of Replayability.

UPDATE

Burial at Sea 1 & 2 playthrough review

Ok, I completed both expansions for infinite and I honestly have to say.. it felt very different from the base game without being different if you can catch what I'm saying...

B@S 1 - very short, maybe 2 hours long so all the  cool vigor upgrades are useless because you will have beaten it before you even get to figure out a play style you like.. ammo is slashed big time and you can be killed in 2 or 3 shots on normal difficulty.. very weird feeling but still unique and fresh, you find a new weapon called the radar which can cook and explode enemies from a far, pretty fun actually. The ending very a bit surprising but left me completely confused till I started the second expansion.

B@S 2 - so you just got the feel for the first expansion which changes things around quite a bit eh.. well, unfortunately part 2 changes the game play style up again, right click no longer iron sights but shoots your vigor, you get completely new vigors and thie biggest addition has you play as elizabeth.. she has to use stealth or will die very easily, you can now use small vents.. its very different put it that way.

All three games feel different which.. is an off thing to do, they should have just made a stand alone spin-off for Elizabeth instead of DLC that does not feel like the base game.

All and all it is still a great experience but for a fraction of the regular price

The reason I say that is all due to story which is probably the most important aspect of a BioShock game.  Let me start with the positives first though.  Graphically I think this game still looks really good, even though it's nearly a decade old at this point.  The setting is unique and a historical time period that's barely ever touched upon in gaming.  Playing on Linux I can say that it and BioShock 2 were far more stable than the first game.  I can't even remember ever once having the game crash on me.  Having said that, I did have to disable the opening logo movies to get it to launch.  Other than that, no major technical hurdles to overcome.  I raised the UI font since it was a bit small to read on a 1080p display, but that's more personal preference really.  I think the characters in this game were well developed and not all despicable like in BioShock 2.  Though the ones that were bad were REALLY bad.  Hehe.

Gameplay wise this game is a bit of a mixed bag.  It feels like a step back compared to the two other entries especially being limited to two weapons at a time only.  Even the developers thought this was the case as they changed that in the Buried at Sea DLCs.  The vigors are pretty decent, but I don't think they have the same impact as the plasmids.  BioShock 2 had the best plasmid system by far.  I'm not a big fan of the whole needing money to resurrect aspect either.  I know there were the vita-chambers in the previous games which were similar, but I played through both of the games with those disabled.  This game?  It's designed where you ARE going to die, but the guys you killed don't come back.

And this may be the more controversial aspect of my review, but the story falls apart about halfway through the game.  Maybe they could have made the whole multiverse idea work somehow, but then they decided to mix that with time travel and I HATE time travel.  Having said that, you can't really mix both of those concepts and have the idea work.  In fact, the whole twist of the game happens at the very end and it just falls flat on its face.  I understand they wanted to give a shock to the player like in the first game, but it just doesn't work.  The first two games didn't use either of those concepts and they're stronger from a narrative perspective for it.  Even the DLC contradicts the time travel stuff.  It's just a mess.  Honestly, I could have looked over all of the other things I mentioned before if the story was strong, but it's not.  It's a shame too because this game had massive potential that just got squandered by a nonsensical plot twist.  Both of the Burial at Sea DLC's had depressing endings too.  It's still a good game and worth your time, but the story severely hurts it.",1656352195,1656352195,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Clash in The Clouds DLC sucks if you're trying to get every achievement. It's a set of challenges to kill enemies a certain way, which sounds fun, but if you fail you have to start from the very beginning of the wave if you want a blue ribbon for the achievement. So if you need one of the blue ribbons from wave 14, you have to start from wave 1 and work your way up to wave 14. This makes the process tedious and really annoying. 

My other problem with the game is with Elizabeth in combat. 9 times out 10 she won't give me the item I need, like if I'm low on salts she'll throw me a weapon even if the weapon I am using has a ton of ammo. I found her as a support character quite useless, because if she's not giving me an item I don't need, she's giving me nothing at all. (Thanks Elizabeth, I guess I'll just die!)

Also using the Possession Vigor on more than just a base enemy type is quite useless. Using it on turrets is hit or miss, but in most cases the turrets have the accuracy of a Storm Trooper and enemies take them out in a blink of an eye. Using Possession on a Motorised Patriot makes them look every where but where the action is, and they somehow forget to fire their weapons. It's not very helpful to use Possession on them anyways as you can only utilize them for ten seconds.

I can KINDA understand some fans being disappointed that this game is very much an action adventure, in contrast to the franchises horror survival roots, but the fans insistence that this meant that the game was fundamentally BAD or BORING is ridiculous. Infinite is insanely fun, and in my humble opinion, is more fun than the first installment. Oh I enjoy Bio-shock 1 well enough, it's certainly revolutionary for the time, but I have had almost no inclination to pick it up again since finishing it the first time. Infinite on the other hand is incredibly addictive

The gun-play is satisfying, the build variety is surprisingly large for an FPS from 10 years ago (or even today) the vigors are honestly more creative and fun than the original plasmids, and the use of the sky-hook and tears adds a whole new dimension to combat. How this game was ever called TOO HARD also confuses me. Now I'm far from the type of person to say ""git gud"" or ""skill issue"" (I rarely play games on difficulties harder than normal) But this game is only actually hard when, well, you play it on the Hard and above difficulty! ""the Handy Mans were too difficult!"" WHAT?!?!? on normal mode they die in like 5-10 shots depending on your build! yes the game is harder than Bio-Shock 1, but that game is honestly TOO easy. 

But the combat is just one facet of the experience. the steampunk/Art-Nouveau/Neo-Classical/turn-o-the-century aesthetics and architecture are to die for. I know that I'm supposed to hate this place but, like Rapture, I can't help but want to live in the flying towers of Columbia, and the game takes full advantage of the technology of the time to showcase the city in mesmerizing colors and lightnings. Booker and Elizabeth's characters and chemistry also make for a superior game experience over the mute and lonely Jack. Their relationship grows heartwarming and their dialogue witty , without any of the eye roll worthy garbage you hear in many modern movies and games when the writers want to sound ""smart"" or ""relatable"" 

Bio-shock Infinite is quite possibly my favorite game, or at least my favorite story driven shooter and I definitely think it will be worth your time, though obviously you should play it AFTER having played at least Bio-shock 1 which usually comes with it in the ""collection which always has amazing sales here on steam

You play as Booker Dewitt, a private investigator who also happens to have impressive combat abilities due to the fact he was a soldier prior. He is tasked with retrieving a girl named Elizabeth so that his debts would be wiped away.

This game was definitely a fun experience. There are a variety of skills (called Vigors in the game) that you could unlock by playing through the game. You won't be able to miss any, and all of them have their own distinct uses. Another noteworthy thing is that you could combine the usage of two vigors to create fun and deadly combos. One example would be using Bucking Bronco to make enemies levitate then using Undertow to grab an enemy mid-air to throw them off the edge of the floating city.

The base game's atmosphere is totally different from the previous Bioshock games. The connection between this game and its predecessors doesn't seem to be clear at first, but playing through the DLCs will explain it. Though, I think this game should be a separate game unrelated to the previous games as it takes place in a completely different setting with a new set of characters.

I would recommend playing this game for those interested in a fun shooter game with a decent story. The voice acting and dialogue between characters are top notch as well.

I sincerely advise any and all potential buyers of Bioshock Infinite to play the campaigns of the first two games as those actually have reasonable lore and are the definitive games that set the mood for the franchise anyway.
TL;DR: The devs basically said ""Let's take our previous two very successful games... And do NONE OF THAT"".

Consistent Themes shared by all the games:
1. Play style choice - In all the games, the player is free to make a playstyle for themselves practically on the fly.
2. Entrapment - The first two games involve being underwater, while Infinite involves being high in the sky away from the ""sodom"" below.
3. Religion - All the games have some religious/anti-religious messaging, portraying things like Christianity as rather cult-like (which I like about the game because I used to be a Christian).
4. Men with too much power - Not much to say here. The protagonist is pretty much tasked with taking down these men.

Offset Themes taken by Bioshock Infinite:
1. Quantum theory - This plays heavily into the game by the end and not only becomes confusing, but (frankly) stupid as it completely differs from the previous two games.
I'd put more here, but I'd be spoiling too much.

All I can say now is that the first two games were more sensible and had dimension, depth and tangibility unlike this one.

If I had to recommend based off of the gameplay alone, I'd still say that the previous two games are better. Bioshock Infinite may have a few neat features that the others didn't have, but they're lazier than the previous two.",1643709502,1655887922,False,2,1,0.451866418123245239,0,True,False,False

This game awnsers a lot of questions and brings out new ones making the story more intresting and captivating.
I know all of this might sound corny and all but it is a very good game.

Guns feel amazing in this game, Music is beatiful and honsetly carrys the game and plot even more.
The movement is also decent and the are many different npcs you have to defeat, The graphics are astounding even for today and the artwork fits perfectly with the theme of the game.

I love replaying this game and all the other ones, It has such a special place in my heart and it will always be like that.
I still feel the same joy playing this game the same way I played it on my ps4 for the first time when it first came out.

This game is another classic. This is my favorite Bioshock game, but maybe that's just because I don't like horror. The story of this game kinda makes sense but then doesn't, but once you understand it, it makes you feel smart. Graphics are a large upgrade over the previous games. The overall atmosphere of this game is brighter and not dark and scary like the first two.

An interesting thing about this game is Elizabeth. Her AI is pretty well designed, and her use in gameplay is well done. You don't have to protect her, and she finds ammo for you and picks locks.

This game is also very well optimized and should be able to run on pretty much anything.

+ Beautiful aesthetic & setting (Columbia)
+ Elizabeth keeps up & helps in a pinch
+ Tears were enjoyable to experience, whether helpful or entertaining

Cons:
- The settings felt hollow. This extended from the NPCs (not being able to interact with most people) to the level design (many levels felt like a hallway of buildings and not an actual place). It would have been nice for Elizabeth, or anyone, to make small talk not directly related to the plot and to create a more believable world.
- Did you know pressing ""O"" opens the gameplay menu, allowing you to see your objectives, equip gear, and more? Google told me. If it's mentioned at the beginning of the game, it's mentioned once and never again. Not helpful lol
- The pacing got sluggish near the end. Hoping the game would be finished after the third Siren fight (about 80% complete) was not great.
- The two gun limit. Elizabeth can't hold an extra gun for me?
- Infinite timelines mean an infinite number of potential plot holes / paradoxes.",1654823178,1654823178,False,11,1,0.579285025596618652,0,True,False,False

I liked Elizabeth, the gameplay was decent and the graphics were beautiful, but that was it. It isn't a bad game but it felt mediocre, and the story just felt convoluted towards the end.

The biggest problem I had was with how the Vox Populi and Daisy Fitzroy were treated - they were really not handled well, and came across as a case of bad centrism. America is literally a country that had to go through an entire civil war to decide that yes, slavery should be illegal - please don't slap on a ""it goes both ways"" message on it. The fact that the stark depictions of racism in the beginning went absolutely unresolved makes it seem more of a shock factor than genuine criticism too; I feel like it genuinely would have been better if they just focused on Booker and Elizabeth's story, since the whole thing with the Vox Populi disappears from the second half of the game and they just replace Columbia's police/military as generic baddies.

Massive fan of the Bioshock franchise and Columbia is one of the most beautiful worlds I have ever explored in gaming. I would absolutely die for a new game exploring this fantastic location. 

I know a lot of people will compare Infinite to Bioshock 1 and 2 however honestly I dont think they deserve comparison at all. The game shares enough of the base mechanics to be a Bioshock game yet is very clearly its own entity at the same time.
The attention to story building and lore is fantastic, the way it slowly transitions from a beautiful metropolis to a ruined creepy city in the sky. The characters and their voice actors are immersive and interesting enough to want to explore more.

In all other games I am someone who skips cut scenes and dialogue but here I was actively seeking out all the additional recordings and interactions.
Its one of very few games where I have watched countless videos of peoples interpretations of the detail of the game within the engaging story line which reveals itself over time. 

It fits a genre that appeals to me, a fast pace action adventure game which has an immersive storyline. This factor alienated the original Bioshock fans as the element of horror and real threat is essentially removed for around 90% of the game.

When it comes to visuals the game is beautiful and colourful, the city of Columbia is an interesting setting with some creative ideas and it can be mesmerising to simply look at the scenery from time to time. The problem lied in the level design, the exploration wasn't really interesting while it had some decent parts the lack of interactions with the environment rendered the experience a bit bland.

The writing is good, it's story-driven so it's a change of pace from its predecessors but it was well executed even with how convoluted it was. The characters were interesting with the chemistry between Booker and Elizabeth as the best part but the Lucetes were quite entertaining as well. The only problem I have here is the lack of player agency, it feels like a drawback for a Bioshock game. 

Now this is the crux of my problems with Infinite, the gameplay is streamlined in many ways. There is no more bullet types (instead of 3 per gun) , the gun variety is lacking, there is a carrying capacity of 2 guns (instead of no limit), the upgrades felt mostly insignificant, the amount of customization with upgrades is severely limited, the vigors(plasmids) felt tacked on, the more interesting vigors are found way too late into the game and vigor upgrades felt mostly insignificant. The gunplay was alright but because of there are no more bullet types and a lack of gun variety the enemies are also handled the same way every time so there is no more strategy to maximise bullet efficiency or how to approach tougher enemies. Another issue is how it's basically going from one arena to the other, most of the combat is the player entering an area which gets locked up until everything is dead with as little exploration or down time as possible in-between. There is also no more hacking and there is a lack of interactions with vigors and the environment. It's not too unbearable and I can still find some enjoyment out of it but it's certainly a letdown. 

Some positives for gameplay are the tears that can sort of summon allies, supplies or an environmental element to help in combat and the sky-lines were fun to make fights more fast paced in large areas.

Overall, I think it's worth playing and can recommend it but be aware that it's noticeably different from Bioshock 1 and 2 if you had a lot of love for them you might get a little homesick but if you can overcome that there is a fun experience to be had.",1653838521,1653838521,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
