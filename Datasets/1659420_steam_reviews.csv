Uncharted 4 is no different; I loved every part of this game, from beginning to end. I swear, every Uncharted game is an absolute banger.
As always, the graphics and story were absolutely incredible and left me on the edge of my seat the entire time. (Story spoilers->) [spoiler] Getting to see Nate's story come to an end was an absolutely incredible and surreal experience. I really feel like I was along for the ride and know all of these characters so well, its actually a little bittersweet that I have to say goodbye now. But at the same time, in today's world I'm super glad that Uncharted got a definitive, concrete, and incredibly rewarding and fulfilling ending. You just don't see stuff like that anymore. I remember hearing about how Uncharted 4 is the end of the series, and that unlike some other adventure heroes in pop culture, Nate's story actually has an end. When I heard that, I got excited and worried because I genuinely didnt know if Nate was going to make it out of this one alive - and the cover art wasn't helping me either lol. But Im glad Nate's story ended the way it did, and [/spoiler] I'm so glad I got to play through all of the Uncharted games, they're some of the best games I have ever played!

I also loved the new driving, grapple hook, and piton mechanics that were added to the game! I find it amazing that the game was introducing new mechanics to me so far into the game, and was excited to get to use all of them! I particularly found the driving to be the most fun of the new mechanics; the cars controlled so well and I loved riding around in the plains and jungle with Nate and his crew. I also loved the handbrake and the winch, and am definitely glad Sully spent the extra money to get it lol.

Overall, I found Uncharted 4 to be an amazing game and an excellent way to end off the series! This game, along with the rest of the Uncharted games, will forever be some of my favorite games of all time.",1708813035,1708813035,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are some wonderful moments in this game involving Nate when he is young, or the scene where his true desire is so perfectly communicated to the player when he spaces out during dinner, or the wonderful epilogue. While these moments are emotional in a way that games generally aren't, the overall direction the plot goes in is extremely predicable, and not unique at all. That's not to say that's an issue, but because the plot felt like something I'd seen plenty of times before in films and games, it began to feel like a slower-pace [i]Tomb Raider[/i] or [i]Far Cry[/i].

Uncharted still had some really fun moments, particularly combat scenarios. I played on Hard (Unfortunately you need to beat hard to unlock Crushing) and it was generally pretty fun. It never felt super challenging outside of specific combat sections where the checkpoint is very poorly designed, or you start with no ammo; in these situations the challenge felt more like it was coming from poor design than well-crafted encounters, which is something I despise. However, those situations were uncommon, and combat was still my favorite part of the game. Traversal sometimes feels uninteresting - the wall climbing is the same industry standard system you've seen in every Sony game, [i]Assassin's Creed[/i], etc. Although crossing larger scale maps in vehicles was more interesting. The puzzles are pretty simple and often boring, it feels as it they're meant to switch-up the pace rather than get you thinking.  I've got to mention the crazy vehicle sequences, which were extremely over-the-top, but still entertaining and fun to play. One of the best of these was in The Lost Legacy. 

To sum it up here is what I'll say; these Uncharted games are fun, and quality. However, don't expect them to be the unique masterpieces that the Playstation crowd and many others have made them out to be. Uncharted is more like a Fast and Furious movie; you're going to have fun and be entertained by it's massive action set-pieces and emotional moments, but the overall story is nothing special and many elements of it are worse than many current action films in the same genre.

Rating: ★★★★★

I have had the pleasure of immersing myself in the intriguing world of ""Uncharted Legacy of Thieves,"" and I feel obligated to share my overwhelmingly positive experience with this amazing game. As a long-time fan of the Uncharted series, this latest installment, ""The Thieves' End,"" not only met but exceeded my expectations in every way.

The first thing that struck me was the flawlessly written narrative. The plot creates a tapestry of mystery, emotion, and adventure, demonstrating Naughty Dog's storytelling prowess. Every twist and turn in the plot is skillfully accomplished, keeping players on the edge of their seats and emotionally invested in the destiny of their favorite characters.

The gameplay, which has been a trademark of the Uncharted series, reaches new heights in ""Legacy of Thieves."" The seamless blend of exploration, puzzle-solving, and adrenaline-pumping action is nothing short of spectacular. The level design's attention to detail, combined with the straightforward controls, makes every second of gameplay enjoyable. From daring escapes to furious firefights, each set piece demonstrates the developers' devotion to provide an unrivaled gaming experience.

What distinguishes ""The Thieves' End"" is its exceptional replayability. I felt drawn to return to the game, not only for the magnificent visuals and intense gameplay, but also to explore deeper into the storyline. The story intricacies and character development are so complex that a second playthrough just adds to the overall experience. It's a rare accomplishment when a game not only survives but thrives under the examination of numerous playthroughs.

Then there's the finale, a suitable and emotionally poignant end to the Uncharted series. Without giving away any surprises, I can confidently say that ""The Thieves' End"" delivers the closure that fans have been waiting for. It ties up loose ends, delves into the characters' relationships, and provides players with a great sense of satisfaction. Naughty Dog has actually created a finale that honors the franchise' past while setting the path for a new era in gaming.

In the end, ""Uncharted Legacy of Thieves: The Thieves' End"" exemplifies what a video game masterpiece should be. Naughty Dog's farewell to the Uncharted series is fitting, with a beautifully woven plot, outstanding gameplay, and the capacity to engage players throughout several playthroughs. Whether you're a seasoned fan or a beginner to the brand, this game is a must-play.",1708241438,1708312144,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Maybe I shouldn't have started out on hard but I feel like it is one of those games that the controls are so bad that that is what makes it difficult.  The game is just slowly puzzle climb followed by awful shooting sequence followed by more climbing puzzles followed by frustrating gun play followed by a cut scene falsely explaining that the treasure is just a step away.

English:
The UNCHARTED™: Legacy of Thieves Collection is like the Hollywood blockbuster of video games - a rollercoaster ride full of adrenaline, spectacular stunts, and a pinch of sarcasm that makes it all the more flavorful.

The story is so gripping that you almost forget you're just sitting on the couch and not traveling the world on a wild treasure hunt. Nathan Drake and his crew are so charismatic that you could listen to them for hours, even if they were only talking about the weather (which they never do, because they're too busy chasing lost treasures).

The gameplay is so action-packed that you feel like you've taken on a role in an action movie - you run, jump, climb, and shoot your way through breathtaking locations as if there's no tomorrow. And the puzzles are so tricky that sometimes you almost wish you could just take a break and grab a bag of popcorn to ponder over them.

All in all, the UNCHARTED™: Legacy of Thieves Collection is an absolute must for anyone looking for an adventure that's as entertaining as a blockbuster movie - just for playing!



Deutsch:

Die UNCHARTED™: Legacy of Thieves Collection ist wie der Hollywood-Blockbuster unter den Videospielen - eine Achterbahnfahrt voller Adrenalin, spektakulärer Stunts und einer Prise Sarkasmus, die das Ganze noch würziger macht.

Die Story ist so fesselnd, dass man fast vergisst, dass man eigentlich nur auf dem Sofa sitzt und nicht auf einer wilden Schatzsuche um die Welt reist. Nathan Drake und sein Gefolge sind so charismatisch, dass man ihnen stundenlang zuhören könnte, selbst wenn sie nur über das Wetter reden würden (was sie natürlich nie tun, weil sie viel zu beschäftigt damit sind, verlorene Schätze zu jagen).

Das Gameplay ist so actiongeladen, dass man sich fühlt, als hätte man eine Rolle in einem Actionfilm übernommen - man rennt, springt, klettert und schießt sich durch atemberaubende Schauplätze, als gäbe es kein Morgen. Und die Rätsel sind so knifflig, dass man manchmal fast wünscht, man könnte einfach eine Pause einlegen und sich eine Tüte Popcorn schnappen, um über sie nachzudenken.

Alles in allem ist die UNCHARTED™: Legacy of Thieves Collection ein absolutes Muss für jeden, der nach einem Abenteuer sucht, das so unterhaltsam ist wie ein Blockbuster-Film - nur eben zum Spielen!",1707486511,1707486757,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sometimes, however, the climbing can feel a bit tedious and seems to be included solely to extend the length of the game.
The gunplay is mid cause enemy variety is non excisting. if you play on difficult sometimes you get shoot by him beeing stuck in a animation or going into the wrong cover etc... Also some enemys are just damage sponges. (edit: the endig is bad. The story is also pretty mid)

A fantastic adventure, showcasing the spectacular landscapes crafted by the teams at Naughty Dog, Sony Santa Monica, and the other collaborators in the creation of this game.
The soundtrack by Henry Jackman includes many exciting pieces, including the title theme, A Thief's End, a piece that never fails to perfectly convey the feel of this game.
The whole experience of this game was a real pleasure to play, and I'll never forget the feeling of riding far too fast through a jungle in a jeep, fending off potential rivals to the treasure with a sniper rifle, or [SPOILER] dueling Rafe amid the flaming ruins of a ship of gold, nor the real vertigo of climbing across a cliff face, fifty meters over the dense jungle of a forgotten island.

There are healthy doses of combat, exploration and platforming, which prevent the titles from ever feeling stale.

The cover-based, third-person shooter combat in these two titles is as good as the series gets. The enemies’ aggressive nature forces you to move from cover to cover frequently. If you try to hunker down in one spot, you’ll soon find yourself flanked or flushed out by a grenade or rocket launcher. Melee combat has also undergone an upgrade, making it easier to pound a foe’s face in if they get too close. And whenever possible, stealth is also a viable option. Though it's not as refined as the likes of Metal Gear Solid or Hitman, creeping up on an unsuspecting baddie from behind and snapping their neck feels immensely satisfying.

While the gameplay is virtually identical between the two titles, Lost Legacy feels more fluid than Uncharted 4. The latter isn’t sluggish, but it’s clear that Naughty Dog refined the controls between titles. Or perhaps Chloe handles better because she’s lighter and nimbler than Nathan. Whatever the case, the controls in Lost Legacy are exceptional, and easily the best of the entire franchise.

""Uncharted: Lost Legacy offers a thrilling adventure that manages to capture the essence of the Uncharted series while introducing new characters and locales. The visuals are stunning, with detailed landscapes and realistic character animations that make the game visually immersive.

Chloe Frazer and Nadine Ross make for a dynamic duo, bringing a fresh perspective to the Uncharted universe. The storyline is engaging, filled with unexpected twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat. The pacing is well-executed, balancing intense action sequences with moments of character development.

Gameplay-wise, Lost Legacy maintains the series' signature mix of exploration, puzzle-solving, and exhilarating combat. The addition of the open-world environment adds a layer of freedom, allowing players to tackle objectives in their preferred order. However, some may find the game slightly shorter than its predecessors.

Overall, Uncharted: Lost Legacy is a worthy addition to the franchise, offering an exciting journey with impressive visuals, captivating characters, and a satisfying blend of action and exploration.""

Uncharted 4: A Thief's End (4.1/5):

""Uncharted 4: A Thief's End marks the conclusion of Nathan Drake's epic journey, delivering a fitting end to the beloved character's story. The game's graphics are breathtaking, showcasing the capabilities of the PlayStation 4 and providing a cinematic experience that rivals Hollywood blockbusters.

The narrative is emotionally charged, delving into Drake's past and exploring themes of family and redemption. The voice acting is top-notch, bringing the characters to life with believable performances. The relationships between characters are well-developed, adding depth to the storytelling.

Gameplay in A Thief's End retains the series' trademark blend of climbing, puzzle-solving, and intense gunfights. The addition of more open-ended environments allows for strategic approaches to combat, giving players a sense of freedom. The multiplayer mode adds replayability, though some may find it less engaging compared to the single-player campaign.

While A Thief's End delivers a satisfying conclusion to the Uncharted saga, some might argue that certain sections feel drawn out, affecting the overall pacing. Nevertheless, the game succeeds in providing a memorable and emotional farewell to Nathan Drake.""

This game is the final chapter of the Nathan Drake saga with a small side adventure starring Uncharted 2's Chloe Frazer. It's hard to recommend this if you haven't played the first three Uncharted games, which are not available on PC at the time of writing this review but you are given the chance I'd recommend playing them first.

The stories are fun adventures starring fun and fleshed out characters from the previous games along with some standout new ones. The main game being set across the globe from Europe and Africa and Lost Legacy taking place completely in India, but both games include stunning imagery and locations with tons of lost civilisations to climb around on. The main game's story is also a heartfelt sendoff to the character of Nathan Drake told amazingly by the actors and story direction.

The gameplay itself is more smooth and exciting than it's ever been with the added tool of the grapple rope which has been added to the combat, traversal and puzzle solving bits of the game. The combat has been much improved from previous instalments with more focus on stealth mechanics that are a successor to The Last of Us' stealth gameplay. The gunplay especially has seen welcome improvements with more fluid movement and a wider variety of weapons. The puzzles and traversal have seen bigger improvements with the refinemnt of the climbing system and the introduction of the rope.

All in all Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is the ultimate package of the final chapter in the Uncharted series and a flawless port of one of the best games of the PS4 generation.

Then I changed my rating to thumbs down because I had to succeed this to continue and thought I would not get to see the end of this story.  Then I tried again after a good night's sleep, coffee and some online hints and almost accidentally managed to get past this, so it's back to thumbs up because except for this one challenge its' a really fun game with engaging characters and story.  There was one other fight after this where I had to phone a friend whose better at FPS games to get me past it, and otherwise my pitiful fighting skills were adequate on the normal setting and I really enjoyed the game.  Looking forward to the second game in this collection!

First review:
I love the integration of animation and game play, the sometimes humorous interaction between the characters, and the variety of game styles it accommodates.  I use stealth when possible, but charge in and shoot works too if you're good at that.  I like the variety of challenges so far in the game, and that there are typically multiple ways and directions to approach something but the game doesn't let you go too far astray without one of your companions making an observation or suggestion that can get you back on track.  My only wish so far is that I could run or sprint rather than always just walking!  If you like to explore, prepare to take your time getting back to where the game wants you to go.",1703631464,1706324720,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Basically I did not encounter any technical issue (ok, I got one crash in 30 hours), the game is beautiful and runs smoothly, a lot of work in the environment, characters, etc... but the main game bored me to death (the Legacy DLC was much better because it was shorter): It's ultra linear, you spend your time climbing and jumping, now and then you have fighting sequences that forces you to keep changing weapon type because you can't find ammo for the thing you are currently using, the melee fighting and stealth are just simplistic gimmicks, but the worse part really is that a very significant part of the ""game"" is spent in cut scenes or dialogs, the puzzles are simplistic and if you are hesitating for like 10 seconds, you get a helpful comment about how to solve it, removing any kind of challenge.

So if you like ""cinematic"" games, that's probably for you, but for me it did not work. 

Sam Drake has about zero charisma, the whole treasure hunt quest is just dumb, and there is zero suspense, what will happen next is always obvious, so it's mostly grinding to the end doing the same thing again and again.

You have to buy both games and both games will install. With the consideration that I find A Thief's End to be the weakest Uncharted game and The Lost Legacy to be the most mediocre one, the only question I'd have for you if you're interested is, ""Did you play 1-3, and are you just itching for more.""

I played both games on PlayStation and to summarise my opinion of both. 

ATE is a bloated overrated mess of an experience bogged down by a story that drags its feet in an attempt to be an introspective deconstruction of Nathan Drake when he really never needed it. 
The introduction of his long lost brother out of nowhere is as hilariously stupid as it is in any media that introduces a long lost relative out of nowhere. 
The antagonists are, by far, the worst in the franchise, Featuring a rich kid named Rafe who has the intimating presence of a wet noodle, and Nadine, or as i like to call her, C**t. She's like someone really wanted their OC to feature in someone else's story and so just stuffed her and insufferable personality in as hard is they could. 
The Supernatural elements that were present in the older games a gone. They insist on there being a curse but it's clear it's intended as a more metaphorical aspect and is just speculation by the characters. 
More than any other game in the series, the amount of 'downtime' has significantly increased. This game has a lot of moments where character's just walk and talk with very little in the way of platforming or exploring to break it up. If forced walking section aren't your thing, then be cautious.
I will complement the game where it's due. Naughty Dog does know how to make their games visually impressive. everything from locations to set pieces are top notch and if you come to Uncharted Specifically for the spectacle, then you wont be disappointed... at least, once you get to them. 
There is also the gameplay, an aspect of Uncharted I find that seems to improve across the board with each game at the specific cost of the brawling system. Now that the gunplay, stealth and traversal are as smooth as they've ever been, it almost feels like the the melee system is embarrassed to exist. like they needed a game mode for when you have to duel someone without guns and they lazily came up with this Sh*t. An even more baffling decision when you consider that they use it for the final boss of both games.

Which brings me to TLL and the reason I bought this bundle... on sale of course, I don't hate myself. See when I first played TLL, I enjoyed it just enough to not have strong feelings about it. It's much like the first uncharted game, only more tame. the setting is a local area so there's no globe trotting. Chloe is basically Nathan but girl. Nadine is moderately less insufferable than she was in the previous game. Long lost brother Sam shows up to not be a long lost brother trope. And the villain has some actual gravitas to him. 
Even the story and dialogue isn't terrible... for the most part... So in the trilogy you had Nathan, Sully and Elena. A trio that worked because Nathan and Sully had the mentor dynamic and him and Elena had flirtatious romance brewing. Here... the dynamics are just awkward. It starts off fine but once Sam joins, all the characters characters turn into quip dispensers because that's all the writers could think of for, people who don't like each other need to work together. There is also flirting that's cringy because even the story wants you to think it's cringy. These character's don't seem like they'd be remotely interested in eachother but they insist on sprinkling a little of it in there.
The game itself is saved by being a sweet, short, classical adventure. Something the fourth game should have been taking note of.


So TL,DR: If I didn't REALLY like these games then the Idea that I bought them a second time should be madness. Well yes, because the only reason I got this bundle was because a mod came out for TLL replaced Chloe with Lara Croft and since I'm a Tomb Raider fan whose opinion of the reboot Trilogy has only gotten more and more sour as the years have gone by, I get to have this wonderful hot-take. 

The best modern day Tomb Raider experience is a mod for a mediocre Uncharted game.",1705523382,1705560123,False,2,1,0.481884032487869263,0,True,False,False

This review is mostly regarding the PC port and not the game itself, the game itself is one of my favorite games of all time and is a masterpiece in storytelling. But unfortunately the PC port just isnt amazing. I crashed to desktop 10 times within my 12 hour playthrough which is just unacceptable for a story-centric game like this.

While troubleshooting the issue thinking it seems a lot of people have similar crashes that i do, so it isnt just a one off thing that only im experiencing. Another issue ive ran into was the fact the game really wasnt intended to run above 60-120 frames, im lucky enough to have a high end GPU so getting 150+ FPS in this game isnt that difficult even at ultra. My guess is the engine cant handle that amount of frames so stuff starts to get wonky at times, like the bridge in the Madagascar section bugged out and sent me into orbit multiple times until i locked the game to 30 to get across the bridge.

Im going to recommend the game just due to how good the story is, but remember to lock the game at 60 before diving in as that can really help solve a lot of the weird technical issues this game has like crashing and physics glitches.",1705475615,1705475615,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Too many little problems that combine into frustration at times, I think. The way the character moves is just weird and clunky sometimes despite how smooth the game usually is. The amount of times terrain crumbles underneath me, or as I grab it, just gets tiresome after the first dozen times. The disorienting way Nathan peeks out of cover sometimes and throws off my aim. The way I can fall to my death when he refuses to grab a ledge, only for the exact same jump to work flawlessly when I respawn.

Those little things aside would probably be ok. The game looks great, and I find myself really enjoying sitting back and watching cutscenes, as well as the story generally. The truly damning thing, I think, is performance issues. I'm writing this after my game crashed out of nowhere. Just finished a cutscene, started exploring, less than ten seconds later crash to desktop. Crashes aren't usual, I will say, but I have had lag at times, and during a chase the game literally stopped while a little loading percentage popped up on screen, multiple times in the same chase. It just makes for a not ideal gameplay experience, which is a shame given the amount of work that clearly went into it all.

Edit after playing Lost Legacy: I still feel mostly the same about the game. Same performance issues, same little janky problems popping up in gameplay. I do feel Lost Legacy improved the flow of the game somewhat, and was a more enjoyable, perhaps more focused, experience, but still gets let down by a lack of QA.",1704408488,1705422853,False,2,0,0.47902485728263855,0,True,False,False

The addon, The Lost Legacy, is laughable. You play as two unlikable women running around in backwaters India, beating up hoards of men, often several at a time. You can really tell where Naught Dog went off the rails with their identity politics nonsense, esp. seen later in TLOU2. Uncharted 4 was their last strong game IMO, so I will focus my review on that (The Lost Legacy is NOT recommended).

The combat and cover mechanics are definitely of the casual console game-type, ie. being rather imprecise, locked to specific movement and cover patterns, which will get frustrating and feel clunky for a PC gamer. But otherwise, the overall attention to detail is absolute top tier, with impressive action sequences.

We get a ""strong"" female antagonist against Nathan Drake, who completely wipes the floor with him every time they get into a fist fight. However, when you start fighting her, the controls become unresponsive, so you are clearly not allowed to properly engage her. Why give the player a main opponent you can't fight back against? Identity politics is dumb.

The visuals are mostly stunning, but there is this fake-looking chromatic aberration and film-like filter, which distracts from the visuals. In certain chapters, where this filter is mostly off - like in the childhood chapters and epilogue, the game immediately looks much better. Unfortunately there is no way to turn this off (yes, I tried the hex edits). So unnecessary.

All in all, highly recommended, with a few caveats, if you like adventure games.",1705145099,1705336143,True,0,0,0.472676962614059448,0,True,False,False

What's there to say that hasn't been said about this game. Truly a timeless masterpiece that never gets boring no matter how many times I play it. And even then after all these years I still get that empty feeling inside of me after I finish a truly great game, knowing that it is all over. 

Uncharted 4: A Thieves End starts by showing us (the players) the retired treasure hunter Nathan Drake and his normal life. A simple life that many would treasure but Drake feels the absence and thrill of the adventure that gives him the rush that he misses. After seeing his dead brother still alive and somewhat well, Nathan is asked by his brother to help him find the lost treasures of Henry Avery, a famous and well known pirate that stole the gold off a ship called the Gunsway. Nathan is swung back into action trying to save his brother from a drug lord known as Hector Alcazar whom has an interest in the treasure considering that he saved Nate's brother from a panamanian jail whilst being his cellmate. 
Without spoiling too much of the story, Nathan realises that the thrill of the adventure is no longer important to him and no matter how many lost cities he discovers, how many fabled treasures he uncovers or how many historical figures he finds will be as important to him as his family and his wife Elena. A beautiful game that is an emotional rollercoaster but ends in a fulfilling way.
Uncharted 4: A Thieves End is the thrilling conclusion to Nathan Drake's story but the end leaves us with the want and thirst for more, even though it is the end. I can't help but feel as if though they tease us with the continuation as Sam Drake or even Nate's daughter Cassandra. As stated before this game is truly one of a kind and there's nothing like it. A timeless masterpiece that everyone can enjoy!

As a MASSIVE FAN of the Tomb Raider reboots, I can't help comparing this game to those--especially considering how each franchise has borrowed from the other over the years. With that out of the way, Uncharted 4 was a terrific experience. While the gameplay has a lot of similarities, Uncharted stands out as its own kind of adventure with more of a buddy file/action film vibe, as opposed to survival horror. The game is more linear and cinematic, and there's a lot of characterization and character growth. All-around, the writing and the acting is wonderful--brought to live by incredible motion capture. These characters feel real to me. 

The Tomb Raider games had a lot more exploration and customization options for weapons and skills, but Uncharted chooses to keep the pressure on and the action moving at a break neck pace. It's not that there aren't moment where you can take in the view, its just that the emphasis is on the action, especially the combat. In fact, get ready for a lot of that.

While its entirely possible to clear some encounters with stealth, you are limited to close range take-downs. No compound bows or silencers here (unless I missed something). Then there are encounters that force you to rely on guns, grenades, and cover mechanics. But its also often possible to disengage and re-enter stealth.

What's really fun is when the action scenes collide with the combat, leading to some very unique and memorable battles that feel organic with only a sparse amount of quick-time input (thankfully). 

Finally, the graphics, sound effects, and music are all amazing. And the default difficulty was spot-on. While I died a few times in combat, I rarely died during exploration. If i could change one thing, I might have like more challenging puzzles, but then again, I'm thankful they were always interesting and never tedious. 

I had a great time, and I hope the first 3 games in the series make it over to PC so I can check them out!",1704951880,1704952180,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I got hooked. Couldn't wait to get back from work and play. Showed my wife some of the spectacular views in the game from Italy and Madagascar.

First off, the visuals in this game are fantastic which is to be expected coming from Naughty Dog. I think the Drake brothers' part of the story had more weight to it than the treasure hunt itself, although that was still fun to unravel. There was one particular scene involving Elena in King's Bay that annoyed me though. The combat is fluid and chaotic but enemies could feel a repetitive at times.

It's a little different then the others in the series if you are familiar with them, telling a little more ""grounded"" story focusing more on just treasure and relationships rather than the supernatural aspects the others had (among other things). That being said, it's like Indiana Jones and The Goonies had a baby, being a large scale adventure all about pirate treasure in a cave (you will see what I mean). The characters are really what shine in the game, although the graphics and game play are nothing to scoff over. The witty banter is a huge highlight and the characters feel deep and real. Overall, easy recommendation to anyone that enjoys nice and fun adventure. Uncharted The Lost Legacy isn't as good, but it is still good. The absence of our star, Nathan Drake is a apparent, but Chloe handles her own well enough and has some pretty enjoyable moments with her partner Nadine.

      POSITIVE  1) The characters and dialogue are so well written and voice acted. Feels like you are watching genuine people, and they are all well done. My favorite out of the two games though is Chloe Frazer from Lost Legacy. Great character, cool voice and likeable. 
                        2) This is one of the most immersive games I have played. The visuals are stunning, and I was often blown away by the incredible set pieces and vistas, as well as the care taken to numerous small details like movement animations. Felt like I was playing an awesome movie I would love to see.

      WEAK NEGATIVE 1) Combat for me was infuriating at times. Lots of cool weapons though and everything handled well. But I don't know how many times I wanted to duck in cover and rolled into the open instead. The ai in this game is very tough - which is a positive, but holy man, prepare to die a lot. I played first half of A Thief's End on Hard difficulty, and had to lower it as I was getting spanked. Again, this isn't a bad thing necessarily, but it sucks achievements are linked to this. I can't imagine how infuriating Crushing difficulty would be. 

I highly recommend you play this game. Perfect for back seat gamers also - your significant other won't mind watching this.",1704565787,1704565787,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This was my first time playing a game in the Uncharted series. The main game, A Thief's End, was really good. Great scenery, made it feel like watching a movie at times. The parkour and stealth aspects were also fun. Had just enough puzzles to keep it interesting. It was weird not having a map, but you do eventually find your way each time. I liked how the game would eventually give you a prompt for a hint if you got stuck too long. The voice actors for Nathan and Sam were great. CONS: At times it looks like an open world type of game, but you can't interact with random objects, except to kick over goblets, pots, etc. And you can't stray far from the predetermined path.  I didn't bother trying to find all of the hidden treasures. I'm not sure anyone could find them all without looking up hints. 

The DLC content, The Lost Legacy, was quite the opposite. It was weird playing Chloe. They could have easily had you play as Sam, which would make a logical pairing from playing as Nathan in the main game. On top of that, they pair you with the ever-annoying Nadine from the main game. These two women are so over-the-top macho it's comical. At least they could have given your character the option to push Nadine off a cliff somewhere. Speaking of scenery, it all starts looking the same in Chapter 4, which goes on WAY too long. It becomes too much of, ""find these objects or you can't advance"". There are also too many tedious puzzles in this one versus the main game. The overall story line was also convoluted and hard to follow.

One of the standout features that left me in awe was the breathtaking landscapes. The meticulously crafted environments not only served as a stunning backdrop but also added a layer of immersion that made every moment memorable. The hidden monuments and cities scattered throughout the game added a sense of mystery and discovery, keeping me engaged as I explored the hidden corners of each location. 
The graphical fidelity of the collection is nothing short of impressive, especially considering that the game was initially released in 2016.
The narrative impact of A Thief's End was profound, pulling me into the emotional depths of Nathan Drake's journey. The storytelling was top-notch, and the character development left a lasting impression. On the other hand, The Lost Legacy excelled in delivering intense gameplay and a sense of adventure (and more from Nadine). Playing both parts together is highly recommended for a complete and fulfilling experience.

The game has a lot of these 'please help me get rid of this object' scenarios. After a while this gets a little bit boring, especially on multiple playthroughs. I wished they would get rid of those but I don't know if they have good reasons for them. It breaks the flow a little bit.

It is a shame that there is no sort of character progression to gain abilities or skills since that would help give the game some depth that it very much needs.

On a high spec PC it looks beautiful. The sound design is great, the controls are fine. The plot is bonkers, but that is to be expected!

There are a few graphical oddities, such as when the auction is going on and every time the scene cuts to a camera view with NPCs in it, their arms start off pointing out from the elbow and then move into position. Sometimes the roap just flaps around as if trying to find gravity. Not exactly AAA quality.

My main gripe is around steam deck performance and visuals. The game uses FSR 2, and it needs to run at leas then full resolution to keep close to 60 FPS. The FSR upscaling doesn't include later updates that remove the fuzzy halo and streaks that are very noticeable and distracting in this game. It seems to be that model complexity is too high (on the lowest setting). This isn't an issue in, for example, the Spiderman games where you can get a smooth and pretty game on deck.

Last grump is combat. Stealth kind of works, guns are just about fine, punching people feels like you are negotiating with the character to punch and block.

There were moments when I found myself compelled to halt gameplay just to appreciate the breathtaking visuals within my field of view. The puzzles, though not overly challenging, added a satisfying layer to the overall experience.

Fortunately, I didn't encounter the reported crashes that some others have mentioned. However, I did face issues with cutscenes, experiencing freezes and occasional hiccups. The only workaround I found was to pause, select to replay the scene, but even this solution wasn't foolproof. It would be fantastic if the developers could address and rectify this aspect.

As a fan of the series, I can't help but express a wish for Sony to consider bringing the next installment of Uncharted to PC.

Great another box on wheels to move to some location to get to a higher elevation. Another structure just crumbles to dust when stepped/driven on. And oh boy what a dumb story. The game shows some self-awareness (those brilliant pirate engineers with their magical mechanical contraptions). Absolutely absurd. Like with the pirate recruiting scale. If the candidate picks the statue instead of a coin the whole floor collapses with massive spikes underneath. Rebuilding would probably take many man-years. Explosive proximity mummies.

I bought this in the sale, I've never payed any of the older games, but have heard good things about it, so took the plunge after watching the trailer, it looked similar to Tomb Raider, and I love those games.
The graphics are good, could be better on today's machines but they are more than adequate and do look nice, especially in the tombs etc.
The driving is spot on, unlike so many NON CAR games that get it so wrong, this is really nice and balanced, the controls work really well. 
The jumping and climbing is exactly the same as Tomb Raider, and if the main character had been female, Eidos would have probably sued them for stealing it ;) If you like the Tomb Raider games, you should enjoy this, but beware there are button smashing parts in the fights, the fighting could be better for sure. This game is nowhere near as open world as the later TR games, which is a shame, I'd love to go driving doen the cliffs etc.
One of the nice features is if you're in conversation with a character and something happens to stop said convo, it carries on after, with a line like, what was you saying earlier about such and such, I really liked that, as in most games, say like ALL the Yakuza games, if you get interrupted, it's impossible to get the rest of the conversation without restarting that scene.
There are a few things that are very frustrating, like trying to get in cover when being shot at by an armoured truck, he just runs sideways and you die, then he'll take cover when you don't want him too, my god that's annoying....
If you collect some dynamite, and you don't use it, when you get to the next part where you need it, it's gone from your inventory, this is my biggest bug bear as it's hard to find more :/ 
I'm enjoying the banter between the characters, the story is great and could be a movie, we've all seen them where the good guy does all the work and baddie just walks in and takes everything, they never learn haha
I might update this as I play more, I'm only 12 hours in :)
If I screenshot, using the built in system, the photos are crap because I use HDR, they come out OVER EXPOSED, and so I use the Steam screenshot (F12) which bring sup another menu, which really needs fixing!

Ok, so just finished the first part, strangely, the graphics seem to get much better as you play it, there is a good part where you drive a jeep across the terrain, sides of rivers etc, I really enjoyed that, shame we could not do more open world exploring while driving, but I understand why they did not do that, the handing of the car was better a lot of driving games, so I was impressed! 
I do not understand why Photo Mode is OFF by default and every time you launch the game you have to turn it on, a bit stupid that, and I mentioned earlier the photo buttons are proper messed up.
 I'm not going post any spoilers but the part with swords, that was horrendous, as was a couple of parts where you have to run, and the controls go backwards - it just ruins the whole feel of the game, if you've done it, you'll know what I'm talking about ;) 

All in all great game, I am looking forward to doing part 2, which I'll start at the weekend :)

I've just finished Uncharted Lost Legacy, it was nowhere near as good as A Thief’s End, over very quick, the other woman was a crap character, with really bad dialogue, the fist fighting in the game was terrible and should not have been in the game at all. I would play Thief's End again, but no chance of that on Lost Legacy!

First of both of these games are like 6 years old and U4 is roughly 15 hours on normal difficulty and U:LL is like 7 hours at max. So the price for these games does not match the amount of content. On top of that these games don't have much outside their first play troughs and especially U:LL is just not good enough to make up for that. Also playing the first three games helps you understand the story better but they are not on PC. Just kind of overpriced for what they are worth.

Apart from the memory lane visits and occasional fun action sequences, it was rather baffling how little the game actually had to offer when it came down to it. Repetitive platforming, ridiculous narrative choices, obvious twists, etc. Am I just getting old and cynical? Or were the previous Uncharted games just simple and fun compared to this washed up nostalgia trip.

Let’s start with the story. For some reason, the writers thought it was necessary for this tale to have three (!) introductory chapters in a row: a medias in res action teaser (called “prologue”), a flashback chapter (chapter 1) and an actual prologue (chapter 2). If you’re looking for an off-putting way to immediately numb your audience with convoluted “we’re clever artists”-writing instead of having us actually play a game that gets us hooked from the get-go: this is it, you found it. Everything about that long intro just screams creative arrogance and doesn’t bode well for the rest of the experience. The whole “lost brother”-trope that they try to pull off falls hilariously on its face as well, as this is a painfully clear way to try and provide a new hook to the story by suddenly introducing new background to a character we have loved for an entire trilogy already. Somehow we are expected to believe that all of this information was always present and that is was never brought up during the three previous games, all the while undermining established character moments from those earlier instalments in the series.

And spoiler if you haven’t played the game yet, but absolutely one of my all time biggest pet peeves: fake flashbacks. The entire Hector Alvarez chapter, which is also actually some kind of prologue (yes, another one) for Sam, ultimately gets played off as a lie. So an entire chapter of gameplay is supposedly a figment of someone’s imagination. Are you kidding me? That’s such a cheap way to get your viewer on board with something, because naturally you consider everything you can actually PLAY as truth within your gaming experience. That’s the equivalent of having characters in a horror film go through something horrific only to reveal it was a dream afterwards, just to get value from the scare that the scene brought with it. Sam’s reveal of this betrayal made me ridiculously angry, not only due to me being against fake flashbacks in principle, but also because it’s just that lazy and pathetic “you lied to me”-moment that you’ve seen in dozens of films already. Quite laughable to be frank.

Uncharted 4 also takes pride in its complex relationships between characters. To be fair, those definitely are present and make the story more worthwhile. I definitely enjoy the interesting take on a fortune hunter coming to terms with his own mortality and responsibilities in life. The only problem with that is that the narrative really banks on these emotional scenes that resemble real life, while at the same time having you mass murder hundreds of nameless goons with assault rifles and rocket launchers during the action sequences. It's the tonal shift between deep character driven drama and yolo arcade shooter that really makes this game rather unbalanced. How am I supposed to get into an affecting cutscene in which Nate refuses to kill someone, when I know for a fact that I’ve been savagely killing people without even batting an eye a couple of minutes before? What, now you care? Because this character has an actual name? I know that stuff like that is an inherent vice of games in general, because of course a lot of unrealistic nonsense is involved in the medium. But as I mentioned, it’s the contrast between these shoot ‘m ups and cinematic filmlike character building that makes for an unbelievable cocktail in which I basically have to choose which style to focus on in order to make sense of these two juxtaposed realities. If the characters and story are also unrealistic, there’s no conflict. But exactly because they present these characters as real people with real issues in the cutscenes, the writers turn it into conflict. Last of Us does this way better for example, by making the nameless enemies in combat segments actually also feel like real people. The interactions and implications within the context of the story make those characters feel alive and make it seem realistic and believable that you are doing these horrible things to these people. Killing enemies in Uncharted makes you feel nothing, which really makes no narrative sense when combined with the emotional gravitas of every action and decision they try to imply during the important character driven cutscenes.

And in essence, what is the plot of this game? Going from one location to another so that the bad guys can arrive out of the blue to thwart your plans. It’s always the same thing: new clue, move to location, solve a thing, “aha we are also here!”-moment of the villains, escape. That’s the pattern that happens over and over again until the final climax breaks the cycle. The antagonists have the most impeccable sense of timing and always manage to be at the exact same location as our heroes. Supported by a seemingly inexhaustible supply of Shoreline mercenaries that just keep coming and coming, even in public without ever once suffering the consequences of international and local police forces that maybe should keep all these insane events in check. It’s all so predictable and silly. Even the platforming sections with the iconic climbing frustrate me to no end because it’s always the exact same thing: keep climbing until a brick or a branch unexpectedly comes loose. “Phew that was close, got to find another path”. It’s such empty rinse and repeat nonsense that needs to distract you with impressive set pieces such as the car chase in Madagascar (it is fantastic though) in order to convince you of the impression that you’re actually playing through a masterfully crafted story. I don't buy it sadly.

So yes, I do not consider this the so-called masterpiece many seem to think it is. I don’t even regard this a somewhat great game by Naughty Dog standards. Uncharted 4 is an superfluous and lacklustre addendum to an already excellent and finished trilogy, that more often than not likes to revel in how fantastic it thinks it is. It reeks of the same hubris that can be found in Last of Us 2. Neil Druckmann can make beautiful and brilliant games, but he really lets it go to his head when the public and critics blow his trumpet as the genius “auteur” behind it all. Resulting in the videogame equivalent of autofellatio.

Positives: the puzzles are fun and well made for an action adventure game. These parts usually involved me just having a lot of fun instead of rolling my eyes at the next ridiculous thing the story threw in my lap. The game is of course also one of the most gorgeous looking creations out there and the voice acting is superb.",1704132819,1704132819,False,2,0,0.459117352962493896,0,True,False,False

The game is simply a non-ending string of frustrations. I played on light mode, but the enemies were extremely hard. On most of the encounters you die at least 2 times. They attack you from all angles and having a good aim is next to irrelevant because all you have to do is run around and shoot aimlessly.  

The platforming stuff is just boring and tedious, whenever you reach some point, you just fall (because of how the game is scripted) and you end up doing the same platforming stuff, but on a different path. When you finally get the hang of it, you are interrupted by some lame cutscene...

This is more for laid back enjoyment, beautiful scenery, and a phenomenal story. The action is a lot of fun, don't get me wrong, but the thrill of the game is going on the adventure with the main characters. I myself had never even heard of this series, nor have I played Uncharted 1-3 . As a standalone collection, this is GREAT! I haven't played the LOST LEGACY yet, and am still feeling quite nostalgic over Uncharted 4, a thieves legacy. It's one of those games that I'm sad that the story is over, but I am thrilled to have lived the story. The only reason I was even aware of this game was due to the recent film that came out with Tom Holland and Mark Walhberg. If you are looking for a rich adventure story and some action and beautiful scenery, this one is a great pick! About 16 hours of game-play or so for the main story. I can't recommend this enough. I will definitely be playing the Lost Legacy and then I'll put the game down for a year or so and play this one again if I'm still around! It was great game play in that you are just enjoying the game and the scenery, you're not having to focus on collecting stupid stuff/etc, no grinding. Just enjoying the game, the characters, and the story.  I wish they made more games like this! For me personally, this game represents what gaming is all about for me, a nice escape from reality with a meaningful and positive story where you walk away feeling uplifted (and sad and nostalgic when it's over) LOL. that is all!

Both these games ([i]A Thief’s End[/i] & [i]The Lost Legacy[/i]) had spectacular & beautiful scenery, some interesting (though not thrilling or difficult) puzzles and some fun gameplay BUT they were both let down by my pet hate: suddenly wanting you to play by different rules.  This is really common in boss fights, but there were also examples of weird platform gaming in parts of these.  Maybe this was fine at the time, but it just seems bad now.  The absolute worst was the final sequence of [i]The Lost Legacy[/i] where you have to [spoiler]run up the top of a train falling off a bridge from a very restricted view above and in front of you.  We’re at the end.  Honestly, a cinematic and a jump would’ve been fine[/spoiler].  Very tricky with a keyboard and not fun to repeat again and again.  Just a really sh*tty way to end a game.  Even the fab Claudia Black couldn’t make up for that.

The final vista was also pretty bad/sketchy.

NPCs were OK in open areas, but really had a knack of getting in your way if you were exploring a smaller area.  The hint system and the NPCs are really intrusive and patronizing.  You could be just enjoying the area or searching for something and the game will decide you don’t know what you’re doing since you haven’t moved ahead in 10 seconds, so the NPC will straight out tell you where to go.  This sabotages a lot of the fun of working things out yourself, so that even when they’re not doing it, you’re wondering how long you’ve got before the NPC starts nagging you or playing the game for you.  This is an inexplicably poor decision by the devs.

OTOH there were several critical moments when I had no idea whatsoever what I was supposed to be doing.  For instance, when the dialogue was obliterated by the need to survive some gunfire.

On the whole, the characters were super whitebread in [i]A Thief’s End[/i] ([spoiler]Nathan has a daughter and grey hairs by the end[/spoiler]), but I still kinda bought into the brothers’ story and I mostly liked the disjointed way it was setup.  [i]The Lost Legacy[/i] is a bit different, having two women protagonists, but it’s a bit hard to warm to Nadine after she was one of the main enemies in [i]A Thief’s End[/i]—even knowing she ran a mercenary army [i]should[/i] give you pause.  I felt like the relationship was very carefully balanced so it could be read as lesbian, but with plausible sisterhood deniability.  Seemed a bit cowardly to be honest.

It mostly played fine under Proton, but music was very often stuttery; dialogue & FX were fine.  Quite a few cinematics played in bizarre way with models glitching around, sliding sideways or disappearing entirely, but choosing Restart Cinematic from the menu fixed it every time.  I had to kill the game three times, which wasn’t completely terrible over 53 hours.

Would I recommend?  If it’s cheap, you want some extremely cheezy fun & you’re prepared for some frustrations, sure.  As a full price game?  Maybe not.",1703766738,1703766738,False,0,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

It's a horrible way to implement it that makes the pace of the game feel extremely off. The movement is the only redeeming quality this game has, it's genuinely amazing. Yet that even has certain sections that are.. less than ideal. The way forward is only obvious about 80% of the time and then for that 20% i'm left having to restart checkpoint over and over because a fall that's obviously survivable apparently kills me instantly, and instead I have to see a tiny little surface i can grab that is easily missable. Also the fact the armored guys are apparently immune to a melee attack yet somehow can be stealth attacked with their helmet is another annoying detail. The devs constantly seem to be doubling back on themselves between scripted sections and gameplay. After the first quarter or so of gameplay all I've managed to be is just pissed off at how incapable my guy continues to be despite having proven otherwise countless times. I'm not asking for a power fantasy of a game, but god they could've made him not as weak in cutscenes and scripted fights.

First the Not-So-Great: This game absolutely feels like a port. The graphics are great and the settings an MnK support work as expected, but there are quirks and some crashes. I've gotten about one crash every 5 hours but the checkpoints are well placed and never was my save corrupted, so a crash just means restart and back in the action.
You will probably see trailings of moving objects, like when you drive in a car you can most of the time see the bottom of the rear bumper multiple times towards the bottom of the screen. If you know what to look for this happens nearly everywhere.
Other than that the graphics look great and performance is good too. (GTX 1070 ti | 1440p Ultrawide @ High ~ 60 FPS)

[b]Uncharted 4[/b]
I've played the first 3 Uncharted games on the PS3 and it was always my favorite game series. Uncharted 4 even improves on that with new mechanics and so much better graphics. The story is as to be expected phenomenal. My first playthrough took about 20 hours as there was so much to explore and try out.
The ending is absolutely fantastic for someone that grew up with the Uncharted games and a great farewell for Nathan Drake.

[b]Uncharted: The Lost Legacy[/b]
The Lost Legacy is very simmilar to Uncharted 4, while still bringing minor changes into the mix. Finally we have the possibility to discorver a big area on our own and progress with tasks in the order we want. The story is not as engaging and my first playthrough took about 10 hours, but the new setting with old characters work well together and keep you interested.",1703332487,1703332737,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As it stands now, I can't recommend it.

Cut-scenes are often laggy & jittery -- and there's commonly sudden frame-drops for seemingly no reason. Sometimes in cut-scenes sound-effects that should play once end up looping forever. Sometimes the voice-lines & subtitles in cut-scenes just don't trigger for some reason, even though I can clearly see the character's lips are moving. Characters will get stiff & still move around during every other cut-scene; like they're statues -- actual T-pose shit. Sometimes characters will move independently from their clothes.
All this is a huge problem, especially when this game is 50% cut-scenes.

During game-play it can suddenly jump from ~100FPS to 7FPS, and then back to 100FPS after 2 seconds... for seemingly no reason. It's really weird. I've tried messing with the settings but nothing seems to influence it directly. And it happens like every 15-30 minutes.
That weird mouse-smoothing & mouse-acceleration while aiming with KB/M controls is god awful. It makes me feel sick & yucky. It's so hard to aim, and I also get really dizzy for some reason.

And why did I have to wait 40-fucken-minutes for the shaders to load once I finally got into the game for my first time? Loading... loading... loading...
No other game I've ever played has done that nor needed that. Why?
Really... I got a job, got married, had kids, got divorced, died, and came back to life by the time the shaders were done installing.
All of this to realize that the game runs like dog ass.

I'm enjoying this game so far, no doubt. But I can't recommend it whatsoever as it stands now. Wait for a future patch.",1666356366,1703281157,False,20,1,0.581760525703430176,11,True,False,False

Its a brilliantly told story line, with stealth, puzzlesolving, action, shooting, jumping/climbing, rope acrobatics. The interplay between the two brothers is a wonder to experience - as single-player, you forget you're playing alone and not with another human. Naturally this is all very strongly scripted, but the magic is in the illusion. Graphics are not state-of-the-art, but so great you enjoy the natural beauty of the varied landscapes and scenes. Very varied scenes as well from place to place.

Only drawback is that it is very liniar - but how can it not be when its basically a movie experience telling a story, where you are the acting agent moving, shooting, etc etc. I can easily forgive that, as long as its a thrill to ride to the end.

Uncharted is a franchise that most people heard about and loved playing it on Playstation. Now that it is available on Steam I was very happy to jump on this as you get two games in this collection. I started with Uncharted 4 first with story about Nathan Drake and I was blown away by this game. The story was fantastic, graphics were beyond beautiful, and gameplay was spectacular. I really enjoyed playing as Nathan and his brother Samuel. The game had more mature approach and was focused on relationship with Nathan's brother and wife. It was a well told story that took me about 20 hours to finish. Afterwards I jumped into second game where I played as Chloe Frazer and with time I picked up 2 familiar characters from the previous game.  Game was just as beautiful as the first one but a bit shorter and more religious and political. Nevertheless, game had a great story, beautiful locations; however, I definitely prefer Nathan as protagonist.

[b]Pros[/b]
+ Beautiful graphics and beautiful locations
+ Great voice acting by every character
+ Story is just excellent
+ Good combat

[b]Cons[/b]
- Nothing negative to mention

Overall, Uncharted became one of the games I will remember and would love to see Uncharted Drake Collection (first 3 games) make it to Steam as well. I most definitely will jump on any other new release as it becomes available. It was absolute pleasure playing this game as it gave me a feeling of being Indiana Jones. I previously played Tomb Raider but I feel this game was much better treasure hunter experience.

Following Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, I've played Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and then Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. The PS3 trilogy by far was one of my favorite action/adventure games on the console from 2007 through 2011.

In 2016, I've played Uncharted 4: A Thief's End on the PS4 and I was amazed by the world Naughty Dog has created for Drake. From its graphics to art style, the music and gunplay, everything from the original trilogy was perfected.

In Uncharted 4, we get to play through Drake's late 30s - early 40s. As he marries Elena, they both decide to leave ''treasure seeking'' behind and start a ''normal'' life together. (Nathan first meets Elena in Uncharted: Drake's Fortune.) But things don't go as planned and soon Drake finds himself in pursuit of his long ''lost'' brother Sam Drake.

Upon Sam emerging from his long departure, he asks Nate to help him settle his ''debts.'' Little does Nate know things are about to turn out. Accepting Sam's favor, Nate gets dragged into his past life and Elena isn't really happy about this. Soon enough she gets involved in their adventure along with Sullivan.

In the Epilogue, Nate's story comes to a conclusion and because of this, Uncharted fans were kinda upset. To continue the Uncharted series, Naughty Dog decided to carry on the adventure with Chloe in Uncharted: The Lost Legacy in 2017.

Chloe first met Nate in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. They have a romantic relationship in the 2nd game. She is one of the main characters in the series.

In Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, Chloe and Nadine team up to seek the great treasure of the ancient Hoysala Empire in the South-Western coast of the Indian peninsula. Samuel Drake (Nathan Drake's brother) also has an appearance in The Lost Legacy.

When Naughty Dog released the PC version of Uncharted 4, they bundled it with The Lost Legacy and named it Legacy of Thieves Collection. If you've never played the original trilogy before, I highly recommend playing those before playing Uncharted 4 and The Lost Legacy. Because you'll be missing out on a lot.

I would hope to see Uncharted series continue at least with Chloe and Nadine or with Cassie. I know Nathan would be out because he is settled with Elena. I think Samuel Drake would be old too. Also I would highly doubt that Sullivan would still be around given his age.

Overall, I'd rate Uncharted 4 & The Lost Legacy both a solid 10/10. Thank you Naughty Dog.",1702967690,1702967690,True,40,1,0.746469259262084961,0,True,False,False

Both of them are enjoyable.

Summary:

- AI sux

+ It's fun nevertheless

Thieve's end:
Definitely the worse one of the two. Story is absolute garbage, boring characters and it contains a lot of unnecessary ""filler missions"" that are supposed to move the story (but since the story is total crap it's just waste of time) and even though it's quite fun about the first half, later it becomes just ridiculous.

Lost Legacy:
It's fun whole time, main character is way more interesting than ""dragon"" from the previous one and it's even funny sometimes. Story is a bit better but still a joke.",1702850429,1702850429,True,0,0,0.334272801876068115,0,True,False,False

The bad part first: the combat is by far the worst part, you could cut 90% of it and IMO the game wouldn't suffer for it. It's not terrible, but since the rest of it is so good, it stands out like a sore thumb, The other part is the PC performance, this game can go from 60 FPS to a slideshow and back on my system (which, comparisons sake, runs RDR2 really well in similar settings). I didn't like the typical ""hallway exploration"" other Sony titles like GoW also suffer from, but that's maybe personal taste.

That's basically it, the rest of it is superb on every level. The very likeable characters, the models, the voice actors, the little animations, the locations, the grand adventure, the ancient secrets, temples and mechanisms, the vistas, gorgeous graphics, it's amazing. If you're an 80s kid, this is like The Goonies and all the Indiana Jones movies distiled into one glorious romp. (Other than the combat), I enjoyed every minute of it.

Edit: After having completed Lost Legacy (which is IMO a separate story expansion even though it's touted as a separate game here), all points still stand: performance iffy (but substantially less so than in the main game), great sense of adventure and exploration, mediocre fighting (but here is was scaled back significanly, which I liked).

No matter what mission it is, you know it begins, ends and is  jumping from rock1 to rock2. 
Unsurprisingly, the next mission won't different; so only the locations change. Just like Mario, it doesn't matter what level it is; you need to jump over obstacles to pass this level and then jump over other obstacles in the next level.

UNCHARTED: The Lost Legacy. I didn't even play it; gonna be the same rock-to-rock jumping, but as a ""strong and independent dishwasher"". Nah, thanks.


Conclusion: Horribly overpriced, and absolutely average game. 
Let's be honest; you would never make yourself play this if you hadn't paid $50. You would drop it after two hours of jumping from rock1 to rock2. 
So, it's not an ""OMG, it's a masterpiece"" at all like Sony soy-boys riot, at least for us, PC gamers. We like games they like feces, everyone has their own preferences.

The gem of both game surely is the climbing system. You see it? You wanna get up there? No problem, just do it. Meanwhile, it isn't getting boring, even though both games used the same mechanic.
The graphics are pretty decent and the characters are nice to get to know. I played the game in hard mode with controller and have to admit that the enemy were not botlike. Sometime even pretty good/frustrating to lose against.
Overall I think it's worth the money, remember you get 2 games, which are both very nice.

You literally use a Playstation 1 on the TV. 

That is within an hour or two of the opening scene.   

The game is amazing. I mean Uncharted, not Crash Bandicoot. The story is movie-level (a great movie), the gameplay is equal parts combat and platforming/exploration, and the visuals easily rival games released this year (on max settings with Nvidia DLSS at 2k on a 32-inch HDR monitor). 

Unlike some people, I had no technical issues and the game easily stayed above 60 FPS in even the most intense scenes. But I’m using a new G16 laptop (12th Gen i9, 3070 ti, 32GB ram, SSD). A few months ago, I did try playing this game on a G7 from 2018, and it stuttered badly even on 1080p at medium settings (8th Gen i7, GTX 1060, 16GB ram, HDD). Hopefully that will give you some idea of the performance requirements.

You will not regret investing time in this. Especially if you are tired of open-world checklist-type games, or whatever the latest Call of Duty is, or another battle royale. 

Just an all-around spectacular experience.

If you ever want to compare AMAZING 3rd person action and shooting versus TRASH 3rd person action and shooting, play RE4 next to Uncharted 4.  

Is this a joke? Do you nubs and mindless fanboys seriously think these games provide good GAMEPLAY?  Uncharted 4 is a boring slog that couldn't even motivate me to finish the game. Horrid shooting that REQUIRES auto-aim on gamepad, whereas in RE4 I can aim Precisely, Perfectly, Instantly with the gamepad, no auto-aim.  Uncharted's ""sandboxes"" are generally annoying and tedious, as they all but require stealth most of the time, and you just end up reloading over and over and over when you're spotted, often because of minor mistakes in the janky cover system.  

Honestly, Uncharted 4 is little more than a dressed-up walking simulator for console droolers who need their hands held for the entire experience.  The puzzles are a JOKE, nothing but enhanced cut-scenes so the characters can drone on and on while you mindlessly trial-and-error your way to the ""solution""; which is exactly the same for the brainless ""traversal"" sections, there to break up the lame action so the characters can chat while you push buttons toward the yellow ledges... ""My brain is having fun!  This is so amazing!"" thinks the person who bought every single Sony console.

And of course, those world-famous Naughty Dog ""SET PIECES!""  Look at the car chase! Wow!  Well, when you actually PLAY IT for the first time (particularly if you try harder difficulties) it's just a TRIAL-AND-ERROR SLOG where you continually reload to figure out the correct path down the mountain, and when to jump to the next truck, or the next car, etc, because you HAVE TO DO ALL these things when Naughty Dog SAYS YOU HAVE TO.  You have to jump to the correct car, at the correct time, or IT'S RELOAD TIME.  Wow, fun!  

And this applies to all the set piece sequences.  Follow the correct path, at the correct time, or RELOAD.  It's only after multiple plays that people can make the game look perfectly smooth, like a movie.  And what an achievement that is!  Am I right, folks?  I mean, wow, it's Dragon's Lair!  

Amazing, Naughty Dog, you updated Dragon's Lair.  So fun.  Such tight mechanics and gameplay.

As a long-time fan of the Uncharted series, I was excited to experience the remastered versions of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. While the game succeeds in delivering a visually stunning and immersive experience that captures the essence of the original titles, I must express my concern regarding the presence of several bugs that significantly impact the overall gameplay and user experience.

First and foremost, the most glaring issue was the frequent occurrence of game crashes. Throughout my playthrough, I encountered multiple instances where the game unexpectedly froze or crashed, forcing me to restart from a previous checkpoint. This not only disrupted the flow of the narrative but also led to moments of frustration as I had to replay sections multiple times.

Additionally, there were several instances of character animation glitches, with characters getting stuck in awkward poses or exhibiting unnatural movements. These issues detracted from the otherwise seamless storytelling and character interactions that are a hallmark of the Uncharted series. The immersion-breaking nature of these glitches was particularly disappointing, as it hindered the emotional impact of certain scenes.

In conclusion, Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves, despite its unquestionable merits in terms of storytelling, visuals, and gameplay mechanics, is marred by a notable number of bugs that hinder the overall enjoyment of the experience.",1700592595,1700592595,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the cover system is annoying as always in games, but this one even more so. angles are a bit weird and i don't really use it. very consolish. i'm playing on the sofa on crushing difficulty and if a combat segment is a pain with the controller i just use the m/kb i have here real quick and headshot everything. sony needs to just use the steam controller API and stop requiring us to plug in/disable steam support/choose between what we want. currently you can plug in your dualsense and get haptics + dynamic triggers, but you don't get gyro unless you use it with steam controller API and add gyro. would be nice to get 100% support.

shame they just announced there won't be anymore uncharted games. this is a great game but this neil druckman guy seems like a huge loser. crazy anyone involved with this game worked on the trash of us.

EDIT: finally got around to beating it and would definitely recommend. i played on crushing and it seemed manual saving was pointless, so some long stretches without checkpoints were absolutely brutal. i wish optional conversations were done a bit better too. sometimes they were quick to disappear.

the achievements were pretty fun. lots of fun side ones with random events. collecting treasures was also very fun.

the climbing/rope stuff is very well done. i wish the game had wildlife similar to tomb raider, though. missed opportunity there.

 Here I was officially introduced to Nathan Drake, main character of UNCHARTED games. Charismatic, adventurous, athletic, humorous. Archaeology and treasure hunting are his main interests in life that lead to the big adventures. Big dangerous adventures.

 We take our time to go deeper in Nathan’s childhood, get used to controls and start an incredible journey.

  Fair to admit that games have spectacular views. Every small stone feels incredibly realistic. Developers managed to create beauty. However, better to say - capture the true beauty of nature. Environment made me feel like I’m right there. Each time I was immersed into the story. Completely absorbed. Literally didn’t notice how time went by. I’m thankful for the huge amount of details. 

  Made me want to learn archaeology and be fit like main characters to try climbing. I’m not into very old cultures, but I was totally interested and entertained.

At first I thought that it fixes some issues that I had with the main game - you are not getting lost since after prologue you get a map, the fights are rare and with silent pistol the stealth can be enjoyable, and you get a car to move around the map fast, and the story is pretty condensed and doesn't overstay it's welcome... That is before I finished the map and what waiting me wasn't a finale - as it turned out it wasn't even half way done. Overall I think I kinda enjoyed it, but it was soooo slow. Kinda same issue as with the main game - it's longer than it should be. very gorgeous - especially on an 2k oled hdr screen - but I still cannot recommend it due to the all the fillers and level design without obvious way forward (although it was better in the dlc, so much better than it was almost good. almost. I still found myself occasionally lost. Once I was even stuck due to the bug (the elephant didn't have a prompt, probably because my companion didn't follow me), but haven't realized that it was a bug since it is something I came to expect from the game xD). Both the dlc and the main game would've been perfect IMO if the cut them in half, added sprint button, added some way to locate the way forward (even some basic compass would've helped). As it is now - it's a game that wants to be the cinematic tomb raider, but it pales in comparison to the normal cinematic games (like dark picture anthology, detroit, quarry) and the tomb raider. hell even walking simulators like Firewatch gives better ""movie"" experience than this... Still very high fidelity graphic. Like it's crazy good, aside from 2d bushes and very ugly water in waterfalls (it looks like some kinda foamy slime-like cobwebs)

Original review:
I wasn’t expecting much, I heard that it was “an expensive Tomb Raider rip-off”, “good playable movie, bad game”. but I didn’t expect it to be THAT bad. The gameplay is terrible and the way the story unfolds isn’t much better. It would still be better if it was an interactive novel like Dark Picture anthology instead of trying to be a jack of all trades and successfully failing.

Pros:
+nice visuals
+minimalistic hud
+good visual cues for collectibles
+extremely good aim-assist and lock-on, it’s extremely pleasurable to play with a controller (although it is better off if you play with a keyboard)
+buying this game makes bloodborne more likely to get a PC release
Cons:
-story is lazily written. They turned a 7-8 hours game into 19-20 hours game by filling it with… well, fillers.
-plot and characters are quite boring
-Marry Sue like protagonist (i.e.Spoiler::for the whole game we don’t have access to any blades or knives but at the end he suddenly learns how to use a sword)
-traversal is boring, characters move too slowly for how big the map is. Also no Run/Crouch button.
-gameplay is extremely repetitive and boring, you will be doing the same few scenarios over and over again without even feeling accomplished.
-controls are unintuitive (in some unique situations you need to figure out what button to press or how to move your character from a tight spot. Spoiler:: I am talking about when you need to figure out where to move your character's hands to get out from under the car or when you need to evade Rafe’s blows a few times to progress the scene. you are not given any hints and you can only die a few times figuring out how to do this)
-hint button works only after a long time progresses - I was finding out the way out by aimlessly walking around before that happens.
-levels are designed poorly. they lack visuals cues for which way to progress, and those visual cues that are present most of the time leads to a dead end with no reward (Tomb Raider would’ve had a treasure or resources at those places). Also the levels themself (if you disregard the dead ends) are extremely linear.
-climbing feels like a slightly downgraded version of Tomb Raider. You have many similar ways to overcome obstacles like Lara Croft but worse.
-game wants to be realistic when it would make it more pleasurable for the player for it to be unrealistic and then becomes unrealistic in place when it could’ve given more enjoyment by being realistic.
-combat is terrible. it essentially “kill those goons, take their weapon, repeat”. Stealth is optional and only extends your playthrough without any benefits and you won’t even enjoy it (I usually like stealth in games).
-no replay value. I don’t want to ever replay this game or to play the dlc. Even rewatching the movie is a better choice.

Why I don’t recommend this game? I just don’t see a point in buying it if you can buy the new Tomb Raider trilogy on sale for half of this game’s price. And you will have enough money left to buy a few good indie games. It might have been a good choice for ps4 (especially given that there wasn’t an abundance of choice due to absence of reverse compatibility with ps3 games), but this game has no place on PC. If you want to play sony game that isn't Spider-Man, I recommend you to take a look at Days Gone. Not many people have played it, and I wouldn't normally recommend it (it has many cons as well), but at least I enjoyed playing it, unlike Uncharted 4.",1668291782,1699739203,False,5,2,0.485723614692687988,0,True,False,False

Even at the lowest settings, the graphics blew me away a few times.
Character interactions and general dialogue, while they do get a little stale half-way through, are still welcome and add real personality to the characters, which only made the game more enjoyable.
Level design is great, only got a bit stuck a few times - same with the puzzles, which were fun and fairly rewarding to do, [spoiler]especially getting the Queen's Ruby, which, quite frankly, carried my treasure finding in The Lost Legacy.[/spoiler]

The only real downside I would give to the game is the fact they put two games into one.
Download size is 125~ GB, which is something they easily could've avoided by piling the two games into a bundle, or sold them separately at half price.

Exciting and fun for both two stories. These two happened before and after, but there's not any necessary relationship between them. Only some of the characters are same. Overall both can get an easy 10/10.",1675959774,1699464946,True,92,10,0.795926451683044434,0,True,False,False
1659420,136865054,76561199056052634,173,31,1200,2,1110,1708551203,"""Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection"" is a compelling remastered package that includes two of the most acclaimed titles from the Uncharted series: ""Uncharted 4: A Thief's End"" and ""Uncharted: The Lost Legacy."" This collection offers an enhanced experience for both newcomers and returning fans, and here are the reasons why it should not be missed.

First off, the remaster brings technical improvements to both games, with enhanced graphics that make the already stunning visuals even more impressive. With the power of more advanced consoles, players can enjoy higher resolution textures, improved lighting, and smoother frame rates. These enhancements make the cinematic experience of the Uncharted series even more immersive and visually impactful.

The storytelling in both games is of the highest caliber. ""Uncharted 4"" concludes Nathan Drake's treasure-hunting saga with a deeply personal adventure that tests his limits and his relationships. ""The Lost Legacy,"" on the other hand, shines a spotlight on fan-favorite Chloe Frazer as she seeks the Tusk of Ganesh in India. Both narratives are filled with humor, drama, and moments that will stay with players long after the credits roll.

Gameplay in the ""Uncharted"" series has always been a mixture of exploration, puzzle-solving, and high-octane combat, and the ""Legacy of Thieves Collection"" refines these elements. Climbing and traversal feel fluid and thrilling, combat is tight and engaging, and the puzzles are cleverly designed to challenge the player without frustrating them.

The set pieces in both games are another high point. From a high-speed car chase in a crowded market to a stealth mission in a lush jungle, every scenario is crafted to be both a gameplay challenge and a narrative spectacle. These moments are enhanced by the remastered collection's improved performance, ensuring they look and play better than ever.

Character development throughout both games is stellar. Nathan Drake's journey in ""Uncharted 4"" explores his past and tests his relationships, while Chloe Frazer's character arc in ""The Lost Legacy"" adds depth to her backstory and personality. The supporting cast is equally strong, with each character adding to the richness of the narrative.

The sound design and musical scores in both games are outstanding, with immersive audio that brings the world to life and a soundtrack that enhances the emotional and action-packed moments. Voice acting is top-notch, delivering performances that are some of the best in the medium.

Multiplayer is another aspect where ""Uncharted 4"" shines, offering a fun and competitive experience where players can engage in various game modes. Although ""The Lost Legacy"" does not include its own multiplayer mode, it does come with access to ""Uncharted 4’s"" multiplayer suite, extending the collection's replayability.

In conclusion, the ""Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection"" is a definitive way to experience two of the best action-adventure games of the modern era. The enhancements to graphics and performance, combined with unforgettable storytelling, engaging gameplay, and cinematic moments, make this collection an essential addition to any gamer's library. Whether you're swinging into the world of Uncharted for the first time or returning for another playthrough, this collection represents the series at its peak, and it's an adventure that is not to be missed.

On the downside some of the mission dialogue is ""quippy"" and can get annoying, but the characters all have good chemistry and know when to take things seriously so its relatively easy to ignore for the most part. Climbing can also be a little boring especially when it takes up the majority of the gameplay in a chapter but the regular vistas and slight changes to climbing mechanics the game adds also make it relatively passable.

Uncharted 4 - 9.5/10
I love this game. It's probably within my top 10 video games I've played. But its definitely not perfect. 

What I love about the game are the characters, Nathan Drake, Sam Drake, Sully, Elena, and Rafe, are all absolutely fantastic characters. Nathan Drake is one of my favourite characters in media. Sam is a fantastic side character that plays such an important part in the narrative. Sully, though limited with his screen time, is an amazing character to have when he's here. And Elena is great too. All of the characters are very well acted and totally believable.
Nolan North (Nathan) and Warren Cole (Rafe) give some of the best performances in video game history, along side the best video game voice actor Troy Baker as Sam Drake. 

The overall narrative is very gripping and engaging. The movement is very addictive. The graphics are jaw dropping.
The combat is decent. The dialogue is perfect and hilarious throughout the entire game.

Missions Ranked:

9.9/10 - Chapter 11: Hidden in Plain Sight - One of the best missions in gaming history Mission Impossible head ahh.
9.8/10 - Chapter 22: A Thiefs End - One of the best endings to a series ever. 
9.5/10 - Chapter 20: No Escape - Perfection for about 95% of the level.
9.4/10 - Chapter 15: The Thieves of Libertalia - A masterpiece that is a little slow in the beginning.
9.3/10 - Chapter 14: Join Me in Paradise - This is what i think of when i think of Uncharted 4.
9.2/10 - Chapter 18: New Devon - One of my favourite character moments in gaming history. The rest is aight.
9.1/10 - Chapter 9: Those Who Prove Worthy - Similar to Chapter 8, but the puzzle(s) in this chapter are really good.
9.1/10 - Chapter 10: The Twelve Towers - Beautiful level, though tedious to finish, and for achievements its a nightmare.
9.0/10 - Chapter 5: Hector Alcazar - Awesome action fun, where the real game begins.
9.0/10 - Chapter 8: The Grave of Henry Avery - Graphics are unbelievable in this chapter and the parkour is fun asf.
8.8/10 - Chapter 4: A Normal Life - Wholesome and funny.
8.6/10 - Chapter 6: Once A Thief - Amazing location, but this was the first time a video game has made me fall asleep.
8.5/10 - Chapter 7: Lights Out - Basically the exact same mission as Chapter 6.
8.3/10 - Chapter 21: Brother's Keeper - Short, yet interesting
8.1/10 - Chapter 17: For Better or Worse - Amazing dialogue, but not so amazing gameplay.
8.0/10 - Chapter 2: Infernal Place - A little bit boring, but also fun at different parts. Pacing is horrible.
7.5/10 - Chapter 16: The Brothers Drake - Kinda cool, kinda not cool.
6.0/10 - Chapter 1: The Lure of Adventure - Teaches the player about the movement, very boring on replay.
5.0/10 - Chapter 12: At Sea - womp womp
4.0/10 - Chapter 19: Avery's Descent - Horrible on 2nd playthrough, a nightmare on Crushing difficulty but has a great end
3.0/10 - Chapter 3: The Malaysia Job - Horrible and boring with a few funny jokes.
2.0/10 - Chapter 13: Marooned - *fart noises*

The pacing is a HUGE problem in this game for me. It can be one of the best games ever, then turned into a walking in slow-mo simulator.


Uncharted: The Lost Legacy 5/10

The biggest whatever of a video game. It's very short, if you rush through it, it can take you 5 hours to finish it. The characters are horrible, besides Chloe. Asav is a terrible and forgettable villain. And Nadine is probably the most annoying character in Uncharted. The legendary Laura Bailey is the voice actress for Nadine, i love Laura Bailey for her performance in The Last of Us Part II, but her performance in this game is just lackluster and bland compared to her normal talent. 

Missions Ranked:

9.0/10 - Chapter 9: End of the Line - I love the ending credits. A very fun level from the beginning until the end.
8.5/10 - Chapter 8: Partners - Finally a good character in this game.
8.1/10 - Chapter 5: The Great Battle - A breath of fresh air to get back to the real story of the game.
7.0/10 - Chapter 6: The Gatekeeper - Some cool moments, boring though.
6.5/10 - Chapter 7: The Lost Legacy - Visually amazing in terms of scale but BORING again.
5.0/10 - Chapter 3: Homecoming - Short but its still solid for what it is.
4.0/10 - Chapter 4: The Western Ghats - Destroys and replay value due to its length.
3.5/10 - Chapter 2: Infiltration - Boring and bland, gives me no reason to keep playing.
2.5/10 - Chapter 1: The Insurgency - A terrible mess of an introduction to this game, somehow better than Marooned.

To me, this game falls under one of those ""it should've been a DLC"" kind of game.
Games like Spiderman - Miles Morales, or Resident Evil 3 (the way it was released) should've been DLC's to their much more successful games of Resident Evil 2, and Marvels - Spiderman, just like how this is MUCH worse than Uncharted 4. 

The dialogue is not funny because Nadine is the side character, she just downplays everything Chloe says.. The level design is great sometimes, and the pacing is actually very good compared to Uncharted 4. But it just lacks anything interesting unfortunately and i can't recommend this game. I've finished it 6 times now, and i still don't like it. 


A huge flaw for this game on my PC experience is the amount of crashes it gave me. Iron Galaxy is a terrible PC porting company, please stop using them Naughty Dog. This game froze my computer several times, and i have a 6950xt graphics card with 16GB of VRAM. This shouldn't be an issue.

Obviously a huge improvement in graphics on the PC and everything worked perfectly. The only issue if you could call it an issue was the default controller profile (in Steam, not in the game) was emulating a mouse and was janky. Took me a while to figure this out and change the controller profile back to a gamepad. Then everything worked like it should and gameplay was a dream. This is a well polished console port.

Like the similar Naughty Dog game Last Of Us this is a story dressed up like a game. The gameplay is fun enough but it's not challenging. You're here for the story and the visuals and thankfully it delivers on both fronts. I like these kinds of game, they have an Ending and don't encourage you to grind your hours away. It is fun to collect all the treasures and achievements, but ultimately this is a story and when it's done it's done.

Keep in mind this bundle includes only the last 2 games in the series. The PS3 and PSP games aren't here. But these are the 2 best games in the series.

[h1]Climbing Simulator[/h1]

The game sure does look pretty, but the actual game is a bit boring compared to the previous installments. 

Uncharted 4 gives Nathan some new abilities, like rock sliding, and throwing ropes around conveniently placed beams. These additions are a bit of a waste, since they don't play all that interesting, so it feels more like something new for newness sake.

There also has fewer interesting puzzles, and is more filled with climbing, which was always the least interesting part to me.

From the first game the Uncharted series has revolved around telling a story. A story consisting of fun banter between Nate and Sully, flirty talk between Nathan and Elena (or any other woman around), and the coolness of finding something new. Uncharted 4 is about guilt for douche-bag brother and marital problems. This is not something I find enjoyable, and I can't think of anyone who would think this is a good idea.

The big bad in each game has always been really evil bastards (warlords, generals, etc.). You know, really evil guys. In part 4 it's a guy who's a bit sad that the Drake brothers didn't want to join his team. So that part of the story was also a letdown.

The final letdown was the ending; as this is the final installment of the series I hoped for a really cool ending, but it was just meh.

The game is still well made, but compared to the previous ones I liked this one the least.

★☆☆☆☆ Terrible! [b]Lost Legacy[/b]

[h1]Feminists girl-power simulator[/h1]

This game feels like a rehash of Uncharted 4 but without any charm at all.

Chloe and Nadine are two of the biggest backstabbers in the series. They start out hating each other from the beginning in this game and I keep wondering why they are going after this artifact at all especially when Nadine made off with millions in pirate gold at the end of Uncharted 4. Nathan Drake wanted to discover his roots with Sir Francis Drake and that gave him a motivation that is non-existent here.

There is no humor, a weak mission and for those who say Nate is not missed, I greatly disagree. I also do not understand why this new development team for the Uncharted series want to design the characters looking much older and unattractive. I think that Elena and Nate looked awful in Uncharted 4. Nadine was never attractive and was a royal pain in Uncharted 4 but Chloe was hot in Uncharted 2. In this game she is not hot at all and goes out of her way to reassure Nadine that Nate is ""out of the picture"".

Very disappointed with this game, worst in the franchise.",1676145357,1697137257,False,4,0,0.47715294361114502,0,True,False,False

The animations and graphics, while not cutting-edge by today's standards, still manage to impress. They haven't aged particularly well, but they get the job done.

The story in Uncharted 4 is a highlight, showcasing Naughty Dog's mastery of cinematics and dialogue. It's an engaging narrative with well-crafted characters that keep you invested throughout. However, there's a glaring dissonance between the compelling story and the gameplay (why is there SO MUCH shooting? how come all these wonders laid undiscovered for so long?). When you find yourself engaging in the exciting actions for the umpteenth time in a single hour, the thrill starts to wear thin.

One major downside is the mouse & keyboard controls. They can be clunky and frustrating at times, which can hamper your overall experience. Fortunately, there is a silver lining—you can disable QTEs in favor of holding buttons, making those moments a bit more manageable.

It doesn't differ to far away from the main formula but I really enjoyed the dynamic between Nadine and Chloe and the opening mission in a rain soaked Indian town was one of the better missions in the entire package.

That said, this port has multiple issues that make the overall package less polished than the same game I played a few years ago. I'm playing on a high-end 4K 120 FPS setup with HDR which may have contributed to some of these issues. Those problems include:

 [list]
    [*]Occasionally scene transitions between chapters will not fade in/out correctly between each other. In these cases the scene presents as a cut to black with the audio continuing as normal which takes you out of the story immediately.
    [*]During gameplay, I noticed flickering brightness which seemed to vary with camera angle. Also, sometimes the entire image will flash rainbow artifacts.
    [*]Some visual effects (like smoke effects and some explosions) and cutscenes appear to playback at 30 FPS / a lower FPS than used for gameplay (120 FPS in my case).
    [*]Occasional issues with audio cut-outs. I don't consider the ""Audio Latency"" option in settings to be a reasonable mitigation as it introduces more delay between video/audio than acceptable IMO.
    [*]Shadow quality, even on the ""Ultra"" setting, is still quite aliased. This shows up best in the 2nd half of the game in forested environments where trees above the player cast shadows on the ground in front of you.
[/list]

These issues are being tracked on PC Gaming Wiki and hopefully a fix is identified in the future: https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Uncharted:_Legacy_of_Thieves_Collection

Compared to my experience playing this game on a PS4, it was disappointing to have what was ultimately a buggier experience than the original game. However, this PC port (and throwing high-end specs at it) can offer much higher resolution + FPS + DLSS-enhanced picture quality as well, which looks fantastic.

Overall I recommend, but it sucks to have these caveats existing at all in what I think is a 10/10 game otherwise.

I enjoy the mix of action and platforming, and especially the ability to use stealth in many situations. A good purchase if you enjoy the Tomb Raider reboot games.

A Thief's End was a nice ending to Nathan's story. I enjoyed the time spent with the characters, and it left them in a good place. Nathan's previously unmentioned brother showing up was sudden, but after a little while he fit right in for me. I liked the callbacks to the previous games in the form of the cabinet of treasures, it brought back some memories.

The Lost Legacy actually edges A Thief's End out by just a hair as my favorite Uncharted game. I initially wasn't sure about having a protagonist other than Nate, but it worked great. It still felt like an Uncharted game, which is the important thing to me. The visuals were great as usual, and the semi open world areas were a good addition. I wouldn't want too much more area than what was there though. The story was fairly typical for the series, but enjoyable. I wouldn't mind them being a little longer, I clocked in around 6.5 hours for the story, including grabbing some treasures along the way. I also managed to use stealth through many of the levels that allow it.

A Thief's End ran great the whole way through. The graphics quality was a big jump from Uncharted 3, and the PC port also helped make things just a little nicer as well.

I had a bit of trouble with The Lost Legacy during my playthrough, mostly freezes and crashing to desktop. Every time it happened was around water, so could be something to do with that. I found that limiting the fps to 30 allowed me to get past the area, and I could remove the limit until the next crash. Other than that the experience was good.",1696213627,1696213627,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If, however, you played Uncharted 1, 2, and 3 and would like to see how the story ends, by all means play this.

Uncharted 4 is a lot less over-the-top than the previous titles. The most extreme scene here is falling while a building, a pirate ship, or the ground collapses around you. No falling off a mountain on a train, climbing to escape a sinking cruise ship, or ensuring you don't die while falling from a plane. Uncharted 4 is quite bland in that regard. Plus the enemies are nothing more than a well-funded wannabe archaeologist and his pet army--nothing impressive and far more boring than I would expect from an Uncharted title. The locations, however, are just as spectacular as any scene in the earlier games. I thought the main story was also enjoyable as each chapter slowly revealed a great pirate legacy gone bad, thought the individual character interactions were quite dry with Nate's brother Sam possibly being the least enjoyable companion Nate has ever had. Uncharted 4 adds three new climbing mechanics and seems to focus the entirety of climbing around using those mechanics. Combat adds stealth, which actually makes the combat worse. Now you have very circuitous battle arenas instead of a straight path through enemies. Stealth combat feels like a bad clone early Assassin's Creed titles. Puzzles are toned down considerably, with maybe only two puzzles really requiring any effort. I think I would summarize Uncharted 4 as a mostly-enjoyable, gorgeous adventure that has toned down all the extreme elements that made the Uncharted series stand out from other games in the genre leaving players with a Tomb Raider knock off that isn't nearly as good as any previous game in the series.

Lost Legacy is a mini adventure following but unrelated to the events of Uncharted 4.  I like that Naughty Dog tried something new here. The semi-open world in Chapter 4 was a fun diversion full of optional puzzles. I also appreciate the new lockpicking mechanic. The rest of the game is basically what I expect from Uncharted: enjoyable banter between characters, amazing locations, and fun puzzles.",1696212711,1696212711,True,1,0,0.505928874015808105,0,True,False,False

I love the water features in both games. You really get sympathy for the characters when playing through both games.

A thiefs end is the best in terms of story telling, visuals, and controls that you will find. It still looks just as good if not better than even games that are being released now. I played the most amount of it on my steam deck and it is amazing to me that i can play something that looks just as good as the PS4 on the go. But when you  play it on something with more power this game really can shine. If you have the ability make sure that you crank everything up to max.

Lost legacy uses the same engine and still is a great looking game. It has the same controls and you will feel very comfortable with it if you like A thiefs end.

While I have never played an Uncharted game before, I caught up on the story with some recaps online, and I really wish I had the hardware to play those, but it left me very excited and able to understand what was happening in the base game of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. I thought the story was fun, the gameplay was easy enough for me to understand and have a thrilling time jumping around and solving puzzles, the music was awesome, the acting was memorable, and the presentation of everything kept me very invested.

Graphically, this game looked amazing, though I did suffer some small technical issues. My NVIDIA Geforce told me my optimal settings for my PC was max settings, though to get the game to run smoothly on my 2060 GPU I had to turn everything down to minimum settings, which was a weird contrast. I'm not sure what went wrong there, but everything still looked great at those settings. I also did suffer from frequent loading times, giving me a clue as to when a larger action section would commence, though I understand I don't have the best hardware. Also regarding the included spin-off, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, the Xbox controller I was playing with wasn't very responsive and I needed to tweak some settings in Steam itself in order to get things to work, and that was a little annoying.

But with those client side complaints out of the way, I still echo what I said above that I really enjoyed both games included. Uncharted 4 was definitely the more grand and fulfilling experience with an exciting story and characters, and I really enjoyed living in a modern adventure setting that reminded me of great action movies, I really enjoyed the journey it let me take as the protagonist. I really liked exploring the land, finding weapons, clearing some henchmen, locating treasures, and solving puzzles. So many settings felt unique and fully realized, and it made me not want to take long breaks, I wanted to jump back in every chance I could up through the end. The Lost Legacy spin-off was also very fun, while not as deep or emotional to me personally, and I am aware there are probably some great character moments I missed due to not playing the previous games, I still had fun for the same reasons. I liked playing as both Nathan Drake and Chloe Frazer, I felt awesome accomplishing what I needed to as both characters, but obviously the base game takes precedent and is probably more keen on grabbing your attention, but I would definitely give both a chance, I was glad I did.

So despite some small technical issues, I highly recommend this Uncharted experience. I really enjoyed a fun and easy single player story, and I hope they continue bringing more console exclusives to the PC market, mainly Steam since it is the most consistent and accessible platform for me. I am eager to play more someday, whether it would be from Naughty Dog or not, I'm so glad I get to experience these console games and I hope the future is bright for more accessibility like this.",1695595311,1695595531,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The detail in this game is just crazy. Some of the views that you get are just incredible. Probably in the top 5 of detailed games that I've played. Worth stopping from time to time just have a look around at everything. I felt bad when I zoomed through a level that had clearly been worked on for so long.

---{ Gameplay }---
☐ Very good
☑ Good
☐ It's just gameplay
☐ Mehh
☐ Watch paint dry instead
☐ Just don't

I really enjoyed climbing everywhere, its a bit unrealistic, DUH. The AI for the enemies is absolutely terrible, its quite harsh and actually made me rage quit once or twice. Just shoot carefully. If you're on keyboard, definitely change the take cover button to ""c"" instead of shift, otherwise Nathan will just throw himself off cliffs/in front of enemies shooting....

---{ Audio }---

☑ Decent - As ALL PlayStation games go. It'll run like a dream unless you own a potato. (120+fps)
☐ Fast

☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Just press 'W'
☐ Easy
☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☑ Significant brain usage
☐ Difficult

There's a good number of puzzles throughout the game. They're all pretty straightforward, just need to think a little... Nothing where you need to get a pen and paper out...

---{ Grind }---
☐ Nothing to grind
☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☑ Isn't necessary to progress
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second life for grinding

Lots of trophies around, grab them if you want.

---{ Story }---
☐ No Story
☐ Some lore
☐ Average
☐ Good
☑ Lovely
☐ It'll replace your life

Story is lovely, it's a little clique in some places but otherwise its like reading a nice book. Voice actor who plays Nathan (Nolan North) does an good job especially. 

---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☐ Average
☑ Long
☐ To infinity and beyond

Took me 16 hours to complete one of the stories. The number of chapters is a little overwhelming but still good.

---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☑ Worth the price
☐ If it's on sale
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money

For the quality of the levels and the stories that come with it its great! 30+ hours of gameplay for sure.

---{ Bugs }---
☐ Never heard of
☐ Minor bugs
☑ Can get annoying

Back in the day, Uncharted 4 experience was a technological and cinematic advancement within PS4 era BUT as the time has passed by, this game has not aged the way I imagined.  

Unch 4, like any ND game is a straightforward linear adventure that focuses on a cinematic experience with high production values, while it succeeds in most ways it also falls short in many due to its limited space in each sequence. 

While uncharted 4 packs the most varied adventure Nathan Drake has ever experienced, it comes with many awkward plot holes that leaves the the entire franchise in a awkward position. Story pacing also does not help to enhance or cover up these grey areas, rather they feel like filler to extend the length of game. 

Gameplay is a your simple, linear action adventure that also drags too long for what it tries to tell. however, chapter to chapter the experience unfolds in different ways. That said Uncharted 4 suffers from excessive use of repetitive mechanics.

Game opens up with a look in late game, then jumps back to Nate's past (when he was kid in orphanage) to explain a little bit of his relationship with Sam and then once again, it jumps back to future that unfolds Nate's married life with Elena to picture his daily life. This is a couple hours in the game and pretty much you have done nothing but navigating corridor to corridor or moving from point A to point B.

The entire prison scene is a messy, boring section that sets up the gang on a journey to look for Avery. The long standing Drake's family dream to locate the long lost Paradise of Pirates. Initially being a mother's dream has now turned into Sam's life long obsession brings the entire game together (excluding Chloe) to conquer this long standing dream. HOWEVER, as good and as emotional and as dramatic this sounds like, Nate is not clearly keen on this and the only reason Nate sets foot on this path is to rescue Sam from his debt (which is a made up story just to get people petty on him). There is no sense of family with this brothers and its ODD that Nate broke his promise of having a adventure free life. this happens while game tries to show Nate is thirsty for one last crazy adventure which contradicts with the entire setup. 

Next on the line is Sally booking a trip to a private auction house that a key piece of puzzle to find Pirate's Paradise (now called Libertalia) is there. This is one of the best chapters in the game.

the next chapter the boys take it to a old graveyard where they assume they can possibly seek clues to where libertalia is. this is where, shoreline is introduced properly to the game and Drake's brothers enemy, Rafe and Nadine are also explained. Rafe is not really an interesting cuz he is often not close to even being a threat to game. He does not have any dominating presence, he appears as opposite side of Sam, another fellow being obsessed finding Henry treasure. Nadine tho, introduced as Shoreline leader, receives a bit more story and development through the game itself and poses herself more in spotlight than Rafe. 
This section of game also introduces the player to stealth and it takes you around a boring stroll of caves and clifs and the usual platforming that just drags too long before exploring a crypt with some interesting puzzles. 

The next chapter, takes the gang to a more open area where you use a car to traverse the linear but bigger areas with a few rooms for exploration and treasure hunting. luckily you are free of excessive platforming and the car physics are actually amazing. I truely enjoyed exploring this land as it is rich with details, dialogues and places to see. There are multiple arenas in this map where the game allows you to have your own way of approaching the enemy which is a fresh change from its usual linear pace.

The next chapter has Nate and Sam setting a trip to a collection of Island where Henry  had included in the previous chapter This chapter is another open worldish map with focus on Nate and Sam riding the boat around island to look for clues. Unlike previous chapter, This chapter is another boring, only exploring chapter. While it is visually pleasing and the vistas are beautiful but essentially combination of platforming, exploring.

I will avoid more spoilers between but the next chapter is where Nate's globe journey has come to an end and he has landed in the island where Libertalia is built. This is where the game truley embraces the old souls of an Uncharted game long forgotten in early hours due to heavy narrative and platforming. While we do not see a decrease in platforming, the island is rich in narrating and showing how pirates settled down, in beautiful and lush with flora and amazing lighting and its filled with few interesting battle sections which includes enemies on different levels of rocks and platforms which demands you to be quicker and take more risk in positioning yourself. Nate reunites and Sam and they discover Libertalia, the long lost pirate land. While it takes a while to pick up the pace once again the Libertalia is worth all the wait to this point. 

Nate and Sam are fascinated as the player is with the majestic architecture of the Libertalia and it is such a joyous ride to see the life of pirates, their houses, districts, letters and notes left and much more to see. 

The next chapter takes place (FINALLY) With Nate and Elena. Tho, the story never explains how Elena found Nate, it is finally awesome to see my fav duo are once again back together. This short adventure is the best part of Uncharted IMO. It explores the much needed development that we were seeking between Nate and Elena and it also advances the story with Sam and Nate as he finally draws a line between him and his relationship. You get to solve puzzles with Elena, take out enemies together, drive car, cross through crumbling ruins, explores last diner of Avery and take a stroll through their luxury life and streets before heading to where treasure is. Honestly, this part was the most memorable part of campaign. 

The game last chapter takes Nate to where Henry ship is and the game concludes with a gimicky and lame boss fight between Nate and Rafe. While its concept is exciting to witness as it portairs two pirates  in a ship ravaged by war of their own, the fight itself is underwhelming. 

This campaign is filled with ups and downs and the gameplay is really dependent on the chapter you are. I just feel like the story is too messy and there are a lot of bad boring fillers and the excessive use of platforming eventually makes brings many dull and boring moments. 

In contrast, Lost Legacy fixes some of this issues by telling a very seamless story which involves Chloe and Nadine on treasure hunt in India vs a much more well developed, tho cliche antagonist, Asav. Nadine character never really catches up tho. She is lame, bad and unexplained. While eventually we find her motives, it never really makes sense why Chloe went after the once leader of shoreline who is now a weak character in the series. 

Lost Legacy majority is spend in a massive open world areas with much more denser main and side content to explore and there are more challenging puzzles than main game. Lost legacy eventually takes you on a amazing tour within Indian temples and there are many memorable set pieces and locations. I cant beleive, but this DLC offers much more polished gameplay than original game. While the plot is not as complicated, it focus on Chloe as a treasure hunter and it takes on an amazing character with much less dull and filler moments.

8/10 for Lost Legacy

All the characters feel like genuine people; they are complex and multifaceted. The gameplay is smooth and, to a point, complex since you're able to use stealth, environmental climbing, and obviously gun play. Uncharted 4 went away from the supernatural themes of the previous games, and in my opinion, it makes for a much more entertaining game. The addition of the scenarios from the past was one of my favorite parts, especially since Uncharted 3 took a lot of the context out of those scenes.

Lost Legacy is a little bit of a letdown, to be frank; it lacks the charm of its counterparts, and it's definitely a shorter experience, which leads to the characters not being able to be fleshed out, which would have made the experience more enjoyable. It's not a bad game by any means, but since you kind of have to compare the rest of the series with it, it can't compare. It's still worth a playthrough because there are some genuine, beautiful scenes you get to see. Also, it's nice to see some returning characters make a return. I would have loved to see Sully one more time since I don't know if Naughty Dog is going to make another entry. I also named my dog after Sully.

Uncharted has always been a cornerstone of Sony's first party line up and it easy to see why. Nathan Drake's journey to find the lost treasure of the pirate Henry Avery's Gournsway Heist leads him across the globe, gets in the way of his happily married life with journalist and fellow adventurer Elena Fisher and his legitimate salvaging job that allows him to remain somewhat connected to his old lifestyle, and reunites him with a ghost; his brother whom he thought had past years earlier while finding an early clue to the treasures location.

As a story, it holds up rather well, being an Indiana Jones style rip-roaring adventure across the globe, with a colorful and fun cast of characters. Nathan Drake himself is most easily described as ""like a Nathan Fillion character""; case in point, Nathan Fillion himself stars as Drake in a fan film on youtube if you want/need a brief primer for the character... we don't need to talk about the movie. His brother Sam fills in an older brother archetype, while matching Nate's charm with his own sardonic wit. Sully doesn't wanna be here, but is because he loves Nate like a close nephew. Pacing is nice, allowing for some slow moments alone, huge fast gunfights, tense moments, and satisfying payoffs. its pretty long and It also doesn't pull a late-game supernatural twist like the previous games in the series do (the lost treasure of El Dorado made those who opened it zombies, The Chintamani Stone AKA the Philosopher's Stone turned those who used it into Yeti things, 3 featured like psychedelic water or something, i dont remember lol.)

Gameplay checks the boxes of ""good singleplayer game"" these days--encounters start with a period of stealth which allow you to scout enemies, takedown enemies quietly, and plan the engagement. those encounters are spaced out by sections of climbing and exploration, puzzle solving, story dialogue, and the odd vehicle section with a more open map.

soundtrack is generally great, but as a fan of the series, i can't help but feel its a slight downgrade from Greg Edmondson's soundtracks for 1-3. Nathan's Theme in particular to me is just much worse and lost all sense of the ""epic adventure"" feel it used to have. other than that, it fits the vibes, takes a backseat when needed, and works well.

Perfomances are excellent across the board, with Warren Kole (Rafe) and Laura Bailey (Nadine) delivering the IMO best performances, but Nolan North (Nathan), Richard McGonagle (Sully), and Emily Rose (Elena) are excellent reprising their characters, and Troy Baker is, as usual, also fantastic as Sam.

Cons are minimal, it lacks some replayability because its a very linear game, its missing some of my favorite characters from the series (Charlie Cutter is mentioned but like Chloe, is missing from this one). TBF, this also contains the Lost Legacy which stars Chloe as the protagonist working alongside Nadine, but i haven't played much of it. its also missing its very strong multiplayer component for like no reason. for that reason alone i'd recommend waiting for a sale, but its not a full price game on its own and again, includes Lost Legacy, which was big enough to be its own game instead of a DLC, i can't say the regular price isn't fair.",1673917552,1694328294,True,2,0,0.5028190016746521,0,True,False,False

Movement always has this ""nerfed"" feel about it where it feels like you are always being held back from moving freely or actually playing the game for that matter.

The entire game is extremely linear and scripted creating a constant feel that you are being herded down a very specific path with little tolerance for deviation.  Like the game wants to impose its will on you instead play you letting you play it.  It wold have been a better experience if the controls consisted of holding down a single button or key because traversal is often just a matter of guessing which direction the devs intended you to move next.

Anyway the lame mechanics and limited game play became intolerable for me about half way though.

I had the original trilogy and this game on the PS4 for YEARS before I started them. And when I did, just like with The Last of Us, the extraordinary presentation for me was degraded by utterly abysmal gameplay, especially combat. I like a fun action movie once in a while, even the wise-cracking sort that was the inspiration for the non-stop-talking Drake brothers, but in those case I actually WATCH a movie.

Funnily enough I am a huge fan of narrative games as my review history will prove, but those are usually unique, rewarding experiences that leave lasting impressions. Uncharted 4, both on Playstation and on PC, is a solid but unrewarding movie experience with frustrating combat and too much snark to be entertaining in 2023. Instead, all characters are mostly annoying, especially Nathan lying to his wife to go adventuring with his brother. Lack of communication and honesty is my biggest pet pieve in entertainment (movies, books, series, etc.) and it is just lazy, lazy, lazy story-telling.

The beautiful scenery of the game could still make this a fun ride. Not every movie/game needs to be unique and groundbreaking, play-it-safe action adventures do have their merit as well -- BUT, remember this is a game, so it has so-called ""gameplay"" sections. In the case of Uncharted 4, these are in pretty much repeating order:
1. parcour that has the animations morph the characters into the right place without realism through a railroaded world, 
2. a mediocre ""puzzle"" that is too obvious to even engage more than 2 brain cells, 
3. a cover shooter section with conveniently placed half-height walls, explosive barrels and dozens of braindead enemies that spawn seemingly out of nowhere in endless supply until a specific number of them have died, 
4. repeat at 1.

During all of this, Nathan (and Sam) never shut up with the wise-cracking banter. Just like the three aforementioned sections, the game desperately tries to uphold a breakneck speed and constantly assaults the player's senses to stop them from actually thinking about anything that's happening. Because if they did, the nonsensical timelines, dialogue and character motivations would rear their ugly head. Naughty Dog has a reputation for excellent stories, but in all the games I played, I only see Hollywood-blockbuster-level adventures with mass market appeal -- well, I guess that explains the reputation... Maybe it's my fault, spending too many hours of my youth, watching almost every iMDB Top 250 movie, but it's just disappointingly shallow to me. Without all the hype I might have a different opinion...

Something which I would not have a different opinion about is the combat, though. I already mentioned the lazy setup, but what really frustrates me is the revolting ""accuracy"". They ported the game to the PC, looked at the mouse and said ""Nah, too accurate"" and slapped a randomizer on the algorithm to ensure that almost every enemy requires a full magazine or more to die because even though the reticule is pointing squarely at the head the game feels it is ""more realistic"" to miss half the time. I hated the combat on the Playstation, but it is no better with mouse and keyboard. Others may like the ""incentive to move around"", but I truly hate the combat in Uncharted (any game!). It is the single biggest reason why I usually stop playing after about an hour.

Many words, again, for a non-recommendation. I want to continue playing, as I finally want to finish this game after having bought it almost ten years ago, but it tries really, really hard to make me regret it.

Edit: Tried again two months later after a few indie titles and BG3. What a bad idea. I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I rage-quit. What a disappointment.",1690742204,1694257270,False,7,2,0.512140393257141113,0,True,False,False

Uncharted is my favourite game franchise, I bought the PS3 only 'coz uncharted. And don't get me wrong: this game is a masterpiece, and it trully deserves a 10/10 review. [b] But there are soo many issues with this port... [/b]

[h2] The good... [/h2]
1. [b] I enjoyed the story: [/b] its not a 10/10 motive, but the character development is as good as other uncharted games, the drama, the dialogs, I was hooked from beginning to end.

2. [b] It looks beautiful: [/b] maps, effects, textures, its just stunning, and its an old game already. 

3. [b] The grappling hook mechanic is the best of its kind [/b], the way it interacts with objects and the map, its just incredible, you wouldn't understand it until you play it, more games should take inspiration of the physics and mechanics of it.

4. [b] The music is just on the spot [/b] The action / combat music is soo good, how it changes depending of the aggression of the enemies, it adapts to the combat situation and is so good. The general OST is also really good.

5. [b] It completes part of the mysteries of the older Uncharted games [/b] Who is Drake? Their parents? Did he had family? Evth has an explanation now. Its an incredible follow up + prequel. 

[h2] The bad... [/h2]
[h3] Bugs...[/h3]
1. [b] Characters randomly T posing in cinematics.[/b] And if it happen too often, it will interrupt the dialog, and no more sounds/text, you'd need to restart from checkpoint.

2. [b] UI crashes [/b] 
Drake can squish trough a really narrow spaces/holes to uncover new areas... It can happen than when approaching the place, and pressing the ""E"" button, the game UI hides, and nothing happens (no animation), you cant open the menu coz the UI is hidden and you can walk everywhere slowly but cant do anything. Only way to continue is open task manager and kill the game and restart from save. Once loaded, you will be in the other side of the hole.

It happened twice during my playthroug (spoiler alert):
First [spoiler] underneath the cathedral chapter 8 [/spoiler]. second time [spoiler] In the same chapter, later on when getting closer to the final puzzle[/spoiler].

3. [b]The 87% loading screens of death. [/b]
This game loads randomly before (or during) actions scenes, it can happen that the game just pauses and keeps loading forever, with taking minutes for each 1%, and then stopping at 87%. The UI doesnt work, only wayt to play is closing the game and restart from save.
 
[h3] Optimization issues...[/h3]
[b] LOADING... [/b]
The game loads every now and then: it takes from 10 secs up to 1 minute to load. Sometimes it can crash how I said in the bugs section.

Well lets talk about [b] the well known Uncharted 4 car/truck chase.[/b] That scene is 10 minutes of pure adrenaline. Its probably the best chase of all time in video-games I'd even say that i has better action than most action movies, its legendary (just search it in youtube, its incredible).

Well that part [b] is unplayable in PC:[/b] every 20 secs the game stops mid chase to load for some seconds up to minutes. Its just unplayable, it gave me like 30 loading screens in that chase. A chase that on ps4 was 10 mins, it took me 30 minutes to complete on PC 'coz loading screens.

[h3] Is there anyway to fix this?[/h3]
Well I tried to play this game on 2 different computers:

The first one, a really old PC with a 1050ti, i7 10k series processor, and a SSD. And had all the issues listed above, ran on low graphics at 40-50 fps, with some major fps drops close to loading screens.

The second time, I played it on a PC with an RTX 2080, an i9 9k series, and a M.2. And it looked better, FPS over 60, but the issues didn't disappear at all, the loading screens were still there and were as annoying as before, no changes.

[h2] Summarizing [/h2]
I just cant give a perfect score, and to be honest, it kinda breaks my heart to give this review.

I will continue playing this game, 'coz I already paid for it, and no way i'd get a refund at this point. I havent finished yet.

[b]On Playstation consoles[/b]: this game is truly a [b]10/10[/b] masterpiece.
[b]On PC: 3/10[/b], its not worth to play with all these issues.",1694223562,1694224236,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

let me be clear, legacy of thieves is not a video game, its a VIDEO game, its all about the spectacle and the action set pieces, there is enjoyment to be had in other areas of the game, but what will decide if you like it or not are those two in particular, the climbing is mostly straigthfoward and only really gets spicy when is part of a puzzle or of a action scene, the ""stealth"" is very bare bones, you only get a silenced weapon in lost legacy, and even then is just a pistol so not really so ranged, you have pretty much no way of distracting your enemys, excepet of course, with granades, but, fair enogh, aparently I am one of the few people how enjoys stealth games, the combat however, is pretty fun, when it works and you are taking enemeis out and using the enviroment to your advantage, its very fun, problem is, and I dont know if its because I was playing on hard, but you rarely have any leverage to activly do anything, going in the open, to either shot, change corver, go in for melee, climb/grappling hook, either kills you, or leaves you so low on health you cant really do anything, that said, anytime the game threw gorgeous visuals in my face all these problems stoped mattering, until they came up again, and the cycle repeats, so if you can ignore the flaws as well as I ignore my intrusive thoughts, the visuals in the games are to die for, preferably not you, so you can enjoy the scenes",1667015577,1694141094,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Climbing was serviceable, but better than most other climbing games to be honest. Puzzles were very simple, combat was a side note, and there were a handful of bugs (most likely due to high frame rate). Performance was pretty great overall.

The attention to detail and overall cinematic game design was very immersive at times. Pistol fully out of ammo after a gunfight? You can see it in the next cut-scene with the release all the way back. Small actions like collectibles and branching paths gives you a little freedom, and with unique voice lines to match. You can tell the level design was hand crafted to give you gorgeous views as well, even picture taking locations as well for further emphasis. Hats off to the devs.

Overall, would highly recommend as a pure action game with really engaging characters. I beat it in around 11 hours, so its not too long either.

Lost Legacy: A very solid addition to the franchise. Largely the same feel as Uncharted 4, with same guns, mechanics, and enemies mainly. Pretty short, around 6 hours to beat. Characters had plenty of engaging dialogue, if not a little bit over the top on sarcastic comments (they were non stop the entire time).",1693839790,1693876365,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've played early Uncharted from the very first to 3 in my childhood PS3 days.
It always follows the same formula. Climb your way, find stuff, solve puzzles and survive ambushes in hit 'n run style. However, there wasn't a single moment where I would say this to be repetitive.

Naughty Dog is one of my favorite developers out there and one of the reasons why it prevents repetitiveness would be its stunning visuals and graphics. There were times where I simply stood still and admired the view, it was breath taking.

Next reason to break the repetitive climb simulator would be the story campaign combined with its pacing. It provides a rich dialogue and backstories of our fellow Drake and its members to make us understand their actions and reasons. The quick time events are so amazing that I don’t recognize any sloppy teleported movements, at most I only see some minor motion tween corrections before certain actions/cutscenes when it comes to interacting with objects (most games have that anyway).

The new character introduction, that being Drake’s brother Sam felt a bit forced, although they included a large amount of backstory to make up for it.

I have to add that the other game “The Lost Legacy” felt really rushed. The traditions like for example finding treasures in hidden areas was replaced by being inside lockboxes, behind breakable walls or simply being found out using the magic bracelet. The story removed Drake for the first time and replaced him with Chole who was only a temporary character in some of the Uncharted games and Ross from Thieves End which lacked proper explanation on how these two got together.

But that’s no way to leave a negative review. I paid 30€ for the price of two games of which I used to pay far more for only a single Uncharted title back in the day. I do however miss the multiplayer content, especially its co-op it used to have.",1693830394,1693830394,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Uncharted is my favourite adventure franchise in gaming
especially while uncharted 2 raised the bar so high back then and is the best in the series aside from this.
This game changes the uncharted formula of insanely epic yet dumb sequences, over the top action to a much more realistic and grounded approach and i loved it.
Naughty dog is second to none when it comes to creating lifelike virtual experiences and this game being 7 years old now is still one of the best looking games ever made.
The gameplay is as fluid and smooth as it can be and
The Animations make the characters feel truly alive.
The environments feel like big playgrounds to freely move and shoot around in however you want.
The story feels like a grand journey again with decent character development and alot of cool moments with flashbacks as well as twists and turns. The writing and voice acting again makes the characters and the story feel really alive as well as cinematic. 
The ending is pretty satisfying and gives Nathan's story a proper conclusion.
I wish there were more iconic and insane set pieces like the previous titles had but this version has its own charm and its one hell of an experience.
definitely one of my most favourite games ever.

[h2]Lost Legacy[/h2] 
I didn't know what to expect from this but after playing this i am surprised how little attention it got and how much more it deserved. The story revolves around Chloe and Nadine from the previous uncharted games and is set after the events of Uncharted 4. The story depicts india and hindu culture extremely well and like never before in a huge title like this. I was blown away by how much research and efforts they did to showcase and blend the mythology in this game with the stories and the stunning environments even cooler than a lot of Uncharted 4 environments. The game does a really good job at making us care about Chloe and gives her depth as a character. The story is not as well written and is mostly very predictable but keeps you hooked as it goes on and the villain is pretty good this time. As an Indian, i love hearing them talk about stories of Ganesh and Shiva and they handled it with utmost respect and dedication.
The gameplay and mechanics carry over from 4 and they are just as smooth and enjoyable here.
The Final hour of the game is my favourite with nonstop, insane and chaotic action. This also has a very satisfying ending for the most part concluding this short yet epic adventure.

It would make Laura Croft proud... plus you get the added bonus of playing crash bandicoot on a PS1 for all of 90 seconds.

But that's where the good times end...

The thing is this game crashes all the f**king time while playing on modern hardware. I've never played a game that has crashed as many times as this one. I don't know what they were thinking porting this to PC with all the bugs and sh*t and then not bothering to at least fix them in a update.

It seems to crash more often when playing it on crushing mode usually when you are in the heat of a battle so I wouldn't even try that.

I've tried a few ""fixes"" that I found online but honestly, I should not have to put in all that effort to try and fix something like this... and the ""fixes"" usually don't work.

Bottom line, even on sale I would not recommend this game to my worst enemy let alone a friend. You have been warned.",1692500256,1692500256,False,1,1,0.478560507297515869,0,True,False,False

But replaying it now, the game holds up. Uncharted 4 is still my second favourite game. The game is beautiful, the story is amazing, the gunplay is fun as fuck and holy shit, the action is second to none. But that's just the game. The port of the game is pretty disappointing. Specifically for one reason. There where animation errors which weren't much of a issue, just kinda funny. But whenever there was more than one vehicle on screen the game would jitter like crazy, which heavily effected my favourite part of the game (you could probably guess what part that as), although I won't say the scene to avoid spoilers. If you have a PS4 or a PS5 that you actively play on then I recommend you just play the game there. But if you don't than this is fine, I can only guess these issues will be fixed in the future. I highly recommend this game. 
The port is a 6/10
Uncharted 4 is an easy 9.5/10

Oh and Lost Legacy is pretty good too. I still don't like Nadine much, she's a bit of a prick but everything else was pretty good. I'm just hoping that Sam Drake will be the protagonist for Uncharted 5 and not Chloe.

There is no doubt, It is a Masterpiece 💗. I didn't play any other games in this series, but i can say there may not be a better game in this series. Because this gives the peak experience of Action 🥷🏻/Adventure🏃🏻/Story ✍️/Graphics ⛰️/Gameplay 🎮 and everything.

Exploring 🧨 and also Climbing 🪜 and Solving Puzzles 🧩 gives the Epic Experience. Also sometimes I felt like I was playing a movie 🍿

After playing Lost Legacy I really felt like its a latest Tomb Rider game. All the Tomb Rider element includes with it and its really rich in Indian Culture. That made me a really fan of the game.


- - - Uncharted Lost Legacy - - -
Repeating Type Gameplay ആണ്. Not Worth Playing.
അങ്ങനെ പല പല Negatives കളിക്കും മുന്നേ ഈ ഒരു Game നെ പറ്റി കേട്ടിരുന്നു. Legacy Of Thieves Collection ൽ പെട്ടത് ആയത് കൊണ്ട് ആദ്യം ഏതാ കളിക്കേണ്ടത് എന്ന് ചോദിച്ചപ്പോ Uncharted 4 മാത്രം കളിച്ച് നിർത്തിക്കോളാൻ പലരും പറഞ്ഞിരുന്നു. Uncharted 4 കളിച്ച ശേഷം Lost Legacy കളിക്കുമ്പോൾ ശെരിക്കും Negative അടിക്കാൻ Chance ഉണ്ടെന്നും അഭിപ്രായങ്ങൾ ഉണ്ടായിരുന്നു.
പക്ഷെ കളിച്ച് തുടങ്ങി ആദ്യത്തെ Chapter മുതൽ തന്നെ ഈ Game എനിക്ക് Interesting ആയി തോന്നി.
അതിനുള്ള Main Reason കഥ നടക്കുന്നത് Indian പശ്ചാതലത്തിൽ ആയത് കൊണ്ടാണ്.First Chapter ൽ തന്നെ ഉള്ള തമിഴ് Convorsations ആരൊക്കെ ശ്രദ്ധിച്ചു എന്നറിയില്ല. പോരാത്തതിന് Shiva, Ganesh and Parashurama ഇവരുടെ Presence കൂടി ആയപ്പോ ഒന്നൂടെ Curious ആയി .
കളിക്കുന്തോറും കൂടുതൽ ഇഷ്ടമായതല്ലാതെ അത്ര Negative ഒന്നും Feel ചെയ്തില്ല. Uncharted 4 പോലെ തന്നെ ഒരു Masterpiece Item.
Graphics ആയാലും ഓരോ Scenarios ആണേലും വളരെ മനോഹരമായി ചെയ്ത് വെച്ചിട്ടുണ്ട്.
ആകെ ഒരു പോരായ്മ ആയി തോന്നിയത് Story Length ആയിരുന്നു. ആകെ 9 Chapter മാത്രമേ ഉള്ളൂ...പക്ഷേ ഉള്ളത് ഒരു ഒന്നൊന്നര മൊതലാണ്.",1680897345,1691754351,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There's pitifully few visual options, and no exclusive fullscreen. The game doesn't even remember gameplay and control settings after shutting it off. The HDR is completely broken when used on a PC monitor, with no way to adjust luminance levels and it doesn't respect system level HDR calibration. The shader compilation takes 20+ minutes even on an i7 13700k. I had constant crashes in The Lost Legacy every half hour or so.

Maybe the most generic scenario, which will impress you only if you've seen less then 3 movies in your entire life?
Or a parkour which starts to copy itself and just annoys you after 1/3rd of the game?
Maybe scripted boss fights, when you suddenly cannot use rolls ""just because""?
Oh, I know. I should definitely LOVE the most retarded shooter mechanics ever. Man, that shooting will chase me in my dreams.

I honestly always kinda.. just dismissed this game as a console exclusive tomb raider knockoff. Guy with a douchy haircut does stuff Lara does better. It being a console exclusive made it easy to dismiss.
But.. while it still is very much a tomb raider knockoff, it was actually pretty good.

Story is serviceable - it is intruiging but way too hard to believe. In Tomb Raider, you could kinda hand wave ""how did they build all this"" by it being built by an ancient civilisation over who knows how many years. But being built by pirates over what looks like one or two decades? Without anyone noticing? Not being found despite being very visible from the sky? With some clues built right in the middle of a city? I can only stretch my suspension of disbelief so far.
The antagonist being a literal private army, too. I dunno why but I have a less hard time to believe a bunch of religious zealots going after a fabled artifact than a private army searching a lost treasure. It being a treasure as welll always sat in the back of my mind. ""So at this point I'm maybe a hour ahead of the private army. So if I find that treasure now, something which would need a whole team and plenty of time to pack up and secure, what then? just taking a coin and leaving the rest for them?""

But I may be a bit unfair. It's par for the course that such stories/games are unbelievable.

The combat is horsecrap tho. I can't be 100% sure but I'm pretty certain enemies sometimes spawn behind you. Several time I advanced on the enemy, scouted them out while hidden etc., searched out a good position, initiated combat.. just to suddenly being shot at from the side or behind. Not that great for a cover based fighting system if the cover is not working because they do a nothin personnel. Their grenade throwing game is on point too. you can sit on a small platform and the enemy can be like 20 meters way, if they throw a grenade, it will land on your platform, right at your feet, every time.",1690923434,1690923434,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's a few relatively simple puzzles, and some pretty basic and simplistic gun-play.  There's a bunch of cinematics, but the game doesn't lean into quick-time events like other cinematic-heavy games. There's only one puzzle that /really/ sucks, and only one 'race'. If anything, the common complaint that the game is just a climbing simulator are kind of fair. There's a lot of the game that you can progress through just by holding the stick in a generally-up direction while pressing jump repeatedly.

The stories are pretty good, if you're willing to do the usual suspension of disbelief required to believe that a mechanism made of wood would still be functional after hundreds of years in a dense jungle. If you're willing to forgive that someone can jump fifty feet down, and catch themselves on a narrow ledge with their fingertips repeatedly, you'll be okay.

The game is weirdly linear, but is artfully designed to hide that. It skates an interesting knife edge. Most often, there's brightly-colored ledges that describe a painfully obvious path up a cliff. But there are other times when if feels like you're allowed to go wandering off in the woods, and yet I've found that even then you're being subtly manipulated to a destination, so that it is actually quite difficult to get lost.  Death, too, is generally rare, and is more likely from you misjudging the direction of something more than ... I don't know, skill? The game is pretty good at offering hints about what's grabbable and what isn't.  But when it all goes wrong, the auto-save is usually VERY close, and more than fast enough.  Death is not expensive, and therefore not to be feared.

Both stories have driving sections, and they're some of the best ever seen in a game that wasn't trying to be an off-road driving simulator. 

The voice acting is top-notch, with some of the best voices in the business taking time behind the mic. Fortunately, the writers have given them good things to say, too.  You can easily fall in love with all the characters, and there were a few places where I laughed out loud at their wry responses to things.  The models are also very good. These came from the PS4 era where they were showing off their ability to do hair, so many characters benefit from a well-grizzled look. Clothing gets wet after a character jumps into water. And, of course, they will often exclaim ""Ah! Brisk!"" about it.

Oh, and speaking of the PS4, one of the platform features of it was a flaky flashlight. You'd have to shake the DualShock controller to get the light to work again. This is implemented on the XBox360 controller with just wiggling the stick. Otherwise, the port is pretty clean and successful, and other than the flashlight silliness I didn't notice any controller mapping problems at all. 

The biggest complaint I have is that the game fails to stream correctly during some of the longer driving scenes. The game will come to a sudden pause, a loading screen will pop up, run for an unpredictable stretch of time. Don't think you can use this time to take a break, though, because it will suddenly unpause and throw you back into the action without any warning.  Then, a few seconds later, it happens again!  I think this is a defect, and I hope they fix it before you buy it.

It's a fun story with fun characters. It's an easy playthrough and kills time. If you find it on a sale, yeah, sure, pick it up.  If you originally played on the PS4, there's not all that much more for you, here, but I still re-bought it during a summer sale and enjoyed both the replay and the DLC",1690772348,1690772348,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If so, this is definitely for you. The gameplay is very similar, but as expected for a Naughty Dog game, it’s also a true cinematic experience. Expect fast-paced action sequences, with beautifully produced cinematic cutscenes.

Sorry “PCMR”, but don’t play this with a keyboard and mouse. Trust me, you will not have a good time, a controller is a must have for this game.

Gun combat isn’t great, but it wasn’t good in The Last of Us either, so maybe it’s a Naughty Dog thing. I recommend turning OFF aim-assist, even when playing with a controller, because it interferes too much for my liking.

I also recommend using a dedicated sound system or headphones. You’ll miss out on the audio experience if you use crappy TV/monitor built-in speakers.

Iron Galaxy seem to have a poor reputation, but I have not encountered any problems with this. And the graphics are GORGEOUS! I don’t get a locked 60fps all the time, but that is to be expected with older hardware. The bottom line is that it still runs better than The Last of Us. Maybe Iron Galaxy should completely take over Naughty Dog’s PC development, but whatever, that’s a different story.

I highly recommend this, it’s great. Remember you’re basically getting two games with completely different storylines in one package. Great value for money!",1690673770,1690675027,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A good story where you really see the tensions of the characters and their opposing motivations (despite that everyone needs to learn how to communicate).

The push in gameplay is great. Lots of open levels where you can rush to the goal or explore and collect goodies. It feels organic while still being linear. The shooting is fine but the stealth actually works (even though it’s limited). The movement is great and talented players can do a lot of cool stuff.

Overall great series and Uncharted 4 is nice ending for Nathan Drake and his companions. 10/10",1690222575,1690222575,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is in my top 5 best games of all time, the graphics and physics are top notch and the cut scenes, story telling and facial animations are some of the best to date. This is a 10/10 game as long as you think of The Lost Legends as more of an expansion. This game has something most games lack and that is the PlayStation Exclusive magic, such as playing Crash Bandicoot inside the game and having it tie into the scene. This is truly a unique experience that completely blew me away. I highly recommend modding the EXE file to turn off TAA Depth of Field, Chromatic aberration, barrel effect ect, as it does have too much blur that cant be disabled thru menus. If you do that and turn on FSR or DLSS, it will have no aliasing and surprisingly good performance. This is one of the best ports out there, except for the built in post processing, that is hard to disable.

I prefer to call it an ""interactive movie"". Game producers pursue the details of the graphic and technology to the extreme. The finished product can be called a visual work of art, but it is not fun. There is basically no gameplay in this game, only the most basic interactions of pressing the prompt button, and you will die if you press the wrong button. In addition, the handle and resolution of character's moves are not good, especially the shooting feel, which is far worse than Rockstar GTA series. Is this all Sony's flagship first-party studio got?

Pro: excellent visual and graphic. Sam is well depicted as a good brother 
Con: poor game-play. Old-school narrative, I can even foresee plots and what's gonna break and collapse when Neit grab something.

Cons: Cut scene glitches break immersion but are kinda funny (though I've heard this mostly happens when you run the game on an external SSD so it's kinda my fault), where you need to go is sometimes unclear so I was just falling into a random cliff half the time (though there are hints if you wait long enough), combat and stealth are not as fleshed out as other AAA games I've played (eg Spider-Man or God of War) so it feels more like an interactive movie than a fully-fledged game, but don't get me wrong, it's an amazing movie/game.

Overall, basically a cooler Indiana Jones if it was a video game. Makes me want to play the other 3 games.

I can probably only complain that the autosave slot always overwrites in one slot [i](which hinders collecting collectables)[/i] and there are some minor bugs if your game runs at more than 60 frames per second.

The game is so enjoyable and engaging in all aspects that you just go with the flow. Indeed, you start by swimming, then you run, then dive, then ride. It's astonishing how many mechanics the developers managed to incorporate into what is essentially a linear game. Most importantly, it don't feel forced. The game is far from realistic [i](with plenty of conventions and exaggerations)[/i], bu you easily buy into everything happening and never want to put it down.

The impressive interaction between characters and the environment, along with breathtaking set pieces / scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat and add to the spectacle. Simple yet interesting puzzles. A good and somewhat mature storyline with a couple of intriguing twists. I was somewhat familiar with the series, but the characters and plot compelled me to search on YouTube for some backstory. Will that information ever be useful to me? I don't think so, but it's definitely time well spent.

The game looks fantastic. Most likely, it blew minds at the launch. Definitely a worthwhile linear action game to acquire.

Nevertheless, I'm glad I had to aim using a mouse, not a controller :)

The game starts off great. The characters look great, they are well written (personalities) and very likeable. The dialogue is also good. Those are however the only good things in this game. After the first chapters the gameplay becomes tedious fast. I had to force my self to finish the game to be honest. You climb, jump, climb some more and pull levers. And that is basically all this game has to offer. Ocassionally you have fistfights and firefights with badguys. And the fighting doesnt work well. At all.

The movement is clunky and the fighting is worse. And the worst thing of all is that you cant win many of the fistfights. You lose many of the important fights what ever you do because you are supposed to - so that you can rumble down in front of the next wall you have to climb.

I was seriously bored and frustrated towards the end - and often saying loud to my self ""not another chapter please"".

It features improved graphics, higher frame rates, and support for mouse and keyboard controls. The game is still as engaging and satisfying as ever, and it looks and plays better than ever on PC.

Here are some of the pros and cons of the PC port:

Pros:

Improved graphics
Higher frame rates
Mouse and keyboard controls
Support for ultrawide monitors
New difficulty modes
Photo mode

Cons:

Some technical issues
No DualSense support
Pricey

Overall, Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection PC is a great port of a great game. If you're a fan of the series, or if you're new to Uncharted, I highly recommend checking it out.

Here are some of the technical issues that have been reported:

Stuttering
Frame rate drops
Crashes
Audio issues

Naughty Dog has released several patches to address these issues, but some of them persist. It is unclear when the game will be fully patched, but Naughty Dog has said that they are committed to fixing the issues.

If you are considering buying Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection PC, I recommend waiting until the game has been patched further. This will ensure that you have the best possible experience.

Here are some of the things that I liked about the PC port:

The graphics are stunning. The game looks better than ever on PC, with improved textures, lighting, and shadows.

The frame rate is smooth. The game runs at a locked 60fps on most systems, which makes the gameplay feel fluid and responsive.

The mouse and keyboard controls are well-implemented. The controls are responsive and easy to use, and they offer a lot of flexibility.

The support for ultrawide monitors is great. The game looks amazing on ultrawide monitors, and the extra screen space is helpful in combat.

The new difficulty modes are challenging but fair. The new difficulty modes offer a great challenge for experienced players, while still being accessible to newcomers.

The photo mode is a lot of fun. The photo mode is a great way to capture your favourite moments in the game, and it's easy to use.

Here are some of the things that I didn't like about the PC port:

Some technical issues. There are a few technical issues that have been reported, such as stuttering, frame rate drops, and crashes. These issues can be frustrating, but they are not game-breaking.

No DualSense support. The DualSense controller is not supported, which is a shame. The 

DualSense controller's haptic feedback and adaptive triggers would have been a great addition to the game.

Pricey. The game is a bit pricey, but it is worth the price if you're a fan of the series.

Overall, Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection PC is a great port of a great game. If you're a fan of the series, or if you're new to Uncharted, I highly recommend checking it out.",1689747178,1689747861,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game gets a strong recommendation from me. It's a good game that I got a lot of fun out of for about 30 hours, 20 of those in ""A Thief's End"" and the rest in ""Lost Legacy"". If you've played one of the Tomb Raider reboot games and are looking for more along those lines, then I would naturally not recommend this one but the other Tomb Raider games. But this is certainly a good game to play after those. Or, if you had your gripes with the Tomb Raider games, you might prefer some of the areas where Uncharted takes a different approach. Those instances are not without merit.

I've played both parts on moderate difficulty. Gameplay and mechanics aren't overly ambitious or fancy by current standards but have a good enough amount of variety. Especially in ""Lost Legacy"" where they build on and extend what the other game had by introducing picking locks, C4 as a new kind of explosive that behaves a little bit differently, it is totally sufficient. Driving your Jeep is quite fun. And what's more: It all just seems to work without any hitches. I didn't have any technical difficulties whatsoever except for 2 crashes during a sequence late in ""Lost Legacy"". But it may well have been my PC running hot, because a few hours later everything worked just fine. I had none of the Tomb Raider glitches like where some ledges are just not reachable on a 4K resolution and you have to lower the resolution to get past certain areas. Everything just worked and the controls are consistent enough to become second nature in a short time.
Puzzle difficulty is rather mild, a tad bit higher in ""Lost Legacy"" than ""A Thief's End"" but not by much. It never took me very long to figure out what to do. No consultation of a walkthrough required. Sometimes game hints or cues from your companions make things almost a bit too easy. Similarly, visual cues for where to go aren't as on the nose as in Horizon Zero Dawn, for example. They don't ruin the immersion, but finding your way around also never gets too hard. In ""A Thief's End"" everything is a linear sequence of chapters with a linear sequence of places to explore. In ""Lost Legacy"" there is a chapter where you can branch out and explore various small ruins in a larger area in arbitrary order. There even is a little side-quest which earns you a an actual mechanical reward (the Queen's Ruby) that helps with the finding of Treasure. That part is a little reminiscent of how the Tomb Raider games handle areas, so yes, I liked that. Also that Queen's Ruby made me a lot more interested in actually hunting for collectibles than I had been in ""A Thief's End"". So, it was a well-balanced, meaningful addition.
Combat is interesting, if not the part of the game I care about most. And because I don't, I don't miss the crafting, improving gear, or buying gear, which is totally absent from the game.
Graphics hold up decently, quick-time-events are rare enough for me to consider them fine the way they are (not generally a fan). Oh, and you can save wherever and whenever you like. No need to first find a campsite if somebody calls you away from the computer. (Dare I mention Cenote on Deadly Obession difficulty in SotTR?)

When it comes to story-telling, my take is more nuanced. I'm OK with linear stories. I'm actually quite happy Uncharted stays away from the supernatural. The blend of actual historical background and legends is quite nicely done and can inspire some fun reading after playing the game. And I also appreciate that the protagonists don't even _claim_ to be archeologists while trampling through archeological sites. I also don't mind that there are moments where you shouldn't really think too hard about what's going on. (Like when your companion above you needs to go look for a crate to toss down to you so you can climb up, rather than just pull you up by the rope you're using all the time.) If you can't abide some logic flaws, you're not even getting through a single Tomb Raider game. 
The characters here feel perhaps a bit more real. In the Tomb Raider reboot series, Lara is full of inner turmoil and soul-searching to a point where in the third game you come close to wanting to shake her and tell her to finally get over her daddy issues. (Fortunately she kinda does.) The struggles of the protagonists here seem very toned down in comparison. The stakes also are not as cranked up to eleven. There is a motivation that's not saving the world from destruction. The downside of that is that I wasn't really invested in the story of ""A Thief's End"" for quite a while. I somehow couldn't get behind a brother who wanted to risk his life a gazillion times each day for weeks to save himself from a potential death in three months time. It was only after about two-thirds of the game, when Elena joins the fray, that things started to make sense again. Then, I could feel the urgency. And with that context the first part of the game had moments that verged on an annoying paperchase. You find a map to place. And in that place you find a map to another place. Then you follow that map to a tower and find directions to two other towers. In one of those you find a map of an island. You go to that island and find clues to another island. Then you go to that place and find out you need to go to another place on that island, and then the treasure isn't there anymore, either. By that time I was completely with Nathan and didn't even care about the treasure anymore. I just wanted to get off the stupid island. But of course that's not how the game played out. Still fun, but a little dragged-out. I liked the writing of ""Lost Legacy"" much better. I was on board from the first scene. However, it is a game that takes ten hours less to complete. So, it can be expected to be more concise and to the point.

So, if you can get through the scavenger hunt bits of the middle of ""A Thief's End"", it's a great bundle. At any kind of sale totally worthwhile spending 30 hours with Nathan, Sam, Elena, Chloe, and Nadine.",1689283748,1689284087,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

7/10 *experience*. I wish there was a better review option than yes/no here.

The story is fantastic and a testament to ND's story telling while being a fun adventure plotline. 

However, the ""game"" is...lacking imho.

I love games like the newish Tomb Raiders and Uncharted generally, but something is just 'off' with Uncharted 4. Sluggish combat that feels great in a semi-realistic setting like TLOU does not work very well in a clearly gameified setting a la Uncharted's world. 

Nathan can swing like Tarzan on drugs, but you can die to a respawned enemy that suddenly is on the same ledge you had just been on. On that point, the AI is showing its age in a terrible way. Awkward cover mechanics, constant grenade spamming, and generally frustrating shooting sections become horrifically tedious by the *20th* chapter of the story. 

I wish ND could have stripped some of the clearly dated aspects out of this game before re-releasing it, but I got it on a heavy sale so I'm not too upset about the entire experience.

I was shocked to discover this game came out in 2016, and I would've been harsher if I'd played it then, but now all of Druckmann's male feminist virtue signalling and discount Joss Whedon humour just feel like a product of a distant past. What bugged me more than that was just how half the climbing and ""puzzles"" are still basically unskippable cutscenes, but whatever. This has combat that almost rivals Vanquish and Max Payne 3 (but it barely uses it) and easily the best scripted set pieces of all time (but not enough of them).

If you're one of the morons who had their minds blown by this, you should be strapped into the Clockwork Orange chair and made to play Max Payne 3 on loop until you're ready to sit at the grown ups table, but this is alright. Easily the best Uncharted game at least. Druckmann is the only AAA American game designer who's actually trying to actually be an ""auteur"" and he's also the only guy trying to make video games more violent while everyone tries to make them tamer, so I feel the need to defend him even though he has a very strange idea of how women look and act.

An actually decent port so far.

There really is full controller support.
Keyboard and mouse controls work great on this game even though it was first built with controller in mind.
Graphics are good overall with an enphasis on insane model details.
Story got me hooked more than the first three games... i played 6 hours straight feeling like mere minutes.

It's not flawless though : I got a minor bugs (yet breaking immersion) which i posted pictures of.
DLSS is causing problems for me (available on my profile).
Saving after a certain chapter's start made me enter noclip with inverste controls for some reason.
Most of the time ""restart encounter"" is throwing you way back, sometimes multiple checkpoints away.
The final fight is essentially a glorified QTE with inconsistent timings and really bad camera angles (which caused me to die because i didn't guess the boss' combo and timing and i couldn't see it). Oh, you also die in one hit and have to do it hitless and if hit, manually restart chapter.
Mandatory speedrun as one requirement to beat the game : A pain in the a** !
You can't straight up start at crushing difficulty but can change to it as soon as you gain control of Nate.
The ending/epilogue were a big let down. It half solves the adventure of this game with an ending that felt like a sequel bait in the way that would help expand the universe and who could be a protagonist if the series keeps going. There's no sense of resolution.

I'd recommend it IF and only if :
You played through the trilogy.
You're really good at this type of game.
Good at speedrunning.

If that's not the case, i recommend checking it out on PS4.
The trilogy didn't age well but still incredible games regardless.

I'll update this to a proper review once i've beaten Lost Legacy.

So far i'd say 6/10.

Lost Legacy :

After a 3.5 hours session i reached the halfway point.
I heard it was shorter than the other games but damn (at least it's really good so far) !
Total lengh it roughly 8-10 hours.
Graphics, story and gameplay are really good despite occasional glitches (less than the previous game).
The shift of perspective feels odd at first but characters are really well written ends in a bang and open ending... and unskipable credits with what i found to be sh*tty music for almost 15 minutes !

I'll rate it 7.5/10

Honestly, i'd love this series to keep going...
I don't see the point of what is at this point the conclusion of a series to be there but not the previous game.
On the other hand it plays far better with mouse and keyboard even though it first came out on PS4",1687933943,1689153469,True,1,0,0.51406252384185791,0,True,False,False

The title, the first game in the saga for PS4 (now on PC) marks the return of [i]Nathan Drake[/i] in an adventure full of twists, charming graphics and a multiplayer mode that excites and surprises.

The plot of [b]Uncharted 4[/b] is very similar to other chapters in the series. This time, [i]Drake[/i] sets out on a new adventure to help his brother, [i]Sam[/i], recover a treasure so he can pay off a debt. However, even with the help of his old friend, [i]Sulivan[/i], it will be necessary to act stealthily so that his wife Elena does not find out, since Nathan himself had promised to retire from his career as an explorer.

[b]In the midst of all this, there is an intense search for treasure, twists, surprises (predictable for some), moments of emotion and a good dose of humor. A perfect script for adventure films...[/b]

That sounds good to fans and anyone who has played the other chapters in the series, as there are also references to previous adventures, as well as the return of iconic characters such as [i]Sulivan[/i] and [i]Elena[/i]. However, for those less patient and who don't care to follow much of the story, the long dialogues of Uncharted 4 can be uncomfortable.

[b][i]Sam Drake[/i]'s debut in the franchise also deserves praise. The inclusion of the protagonist's brother fits like a glove to give reason for a new plot, in addition to presenting a character so similar to Nathan and at the same time loaded with personalities. As well as villains and other characters, whose roles are important to the plot.[/b]

[h1]Small changes allied to a consecrated gameplay[/h1]
Uncharted's gameplay has always been one of the franchise's strengths. The way Drake climbs, jumps, grabs and moves is efficient even for those who are not so skilled with the controls, making the games in the series a good choice for those who have just bought their first console.

The successful formula remains in Uncharted 4, with some timid evolutions. The main one is Drake's hook, which makes the character reach higher platforms and advance great distances. All of this in the best Indiana Jones style.
There is also a greater focus on stealth. In many cases, it's more efficient to sneak up and take out your enemies one by one rather than simply opening fire on them all. For this, there are elements that help this approach, such as the high lawn, small alleys and higher platforms.

[h1]Paradisiacal look that convinces and delights[/h1]
The look of Uncharted 4 is by far one of the most beautiful of the current generation. The way in which the characters were reproduced is incredible, whether by physiognomy, facial expressions and even by synchronizing with the audio of the dialogues.
The whimsy extends to the scenarios. It's hard not to play without ""printing"" the screen repeatedly throughout the entire adventure. 

The places where [i]Drake[/i] travels are paradisiacal, either because of the context or the quality that [b]Naughty Dog[/b] exposed in the game.

[h1]Perfect lighting effects[/h1]
Finally, the lighting effects also contribute to the game's striking visuals. Be it the refraction of sunlight in the sea as Drake dives, the moon's glow in the night scenes or the limited illumination of a torch in caves and darker rooms. They all complement Naughty Dog's fantastic visual work.

[b][i]Drake[/i], [i]Sam[/i], [i]Nadine[/i] and [i]Sulivan[/i] enchant and make some of the most important dialogues have the atmosphere that the scene asks for. Whether with sarcastic jokes, orders or with a melancholy tone at certain plot points.[/b]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]Uncharted 4 was worth the long wait and easily emerges as the best game ever released for PS and PC. The game brings the good old mechanics that consecrated the series, with timid evolutions that just add up. The graphics enchant for their quality and even the multiplayer mode, which has already been harshly criticized in other versions, becomes an excellent game option. [b]Uncharted 4[/b] is a must have!

You'd think that everything that is going on sharpens the brains and makes you more and more experienced.
Well, here's the fact: working too much for your brain is like overusing the knife. It will get blunt and incompetent for work unless you sharpen it from time to time.
Playing a game like this = perfect rest and perfect refresh for the brains. 

Only cons I'd say as a lover of realism is that the game is quite unrealistic, but after my recent experience from Ukraine, I'm not so sure about that even.
There's a scene where you winch the car, you pull the winch but you slide off the cliff (not a spoiler since this was in trailer) and then a rock falls on the hood but the car is somehow still working. You'd imagine there's no way a car would be working after a hit like that. 
Here's a real life fact:

I was delivering an SUV to Georgian Legion operating in Ukraine all the way from Georgia. This was a supply mission running through 5 countries: Georgia, Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine.
The SUV its self was a piece of shit with no heating or isolation, It was January so my partner and I had our asses frozen all the time. We rushed the way, driving over 2500KM with no stop except for gas and border checkpoints. The vehicle had multiple issues including the leak from the transmission so we were in hurry to reach safe heavens so we could fix it and be done with the supply mission.
Our progress was halted in Romania where there was a huge snow storm. There were 3 routes leading up to the border point but all 3 were sealed off due to heavy snowfall. We idled for a few hours and then we finally made it to one of the routes. snowfall was still huge and the entire road had turned into a big ice skating route, but at least it was passable, the Romanians had pushed most of the snow towards the center of the road so there was a huge snow berm dividing us from the opposite traffic lane. Due to extreme freezing conditions, the snow berm had turned into an ice berm.
At one point, we saw the vehicle incoming from the opposite side. It was the only vehicle driving at that time (who else would be out in a crazy storm like that)... It was a huge bus which either slid or the driver had fallen asleep but it crashed into that berm with high speed, shooting a huge chunk of ice right at our car on our front left side!
It was a massive freakin hit. We had one heavy ass SUV but the hit pushed us towards the right edge of the road from the center. It was so noisy and so jolting that I was sure that was our end. I stopped and got out, expecting to see the entire front side and the entire left side gone with at least a major leak from the radiator. Turns out I had a wrong idea about realism - the car didn't have a scratch! The only thing that happened is that all the chunks of snow and ice got into our air intake so I had stand out and clean all of it with bare hands in the middle of a freezing snow storm. 

The SUV drove just fine after that though! So I guess a hood of the car being hit with a huge rock and then the vehicle still being perfectly operational isn't so unrealistic after all.",1688941859,1688941859,True,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

The best way to evaluate this game is to compare it to Tomb Raider.
The graphics are great. Tomb Raider 2013's shanty town blows it out of the water, but you can't fault Uncharted 4 for being a PS4 game, except that I can given that Tomb Raider was on xbox 360.
The gameplay is great. There are relaxing intriguing puzzles, and tense, difficult combat sections. There's pumice rock you can cut into and climb later, like Tomb Raider. I think Shadow of the Tomb Raider later steals the rope swinging mechanic though.

Where this game takes off is the story, the pacing of the game. Not only is there a beginning middle and end, but there's a backstory, beginning, real beginning (Madagascar), great city level, great boat level, great elongated ending, [spoiler]an epilogue[/spoiler]. This game is just super consistent. Pretty natural pacing. Even though everyone's racing towards the treasure, you still get time to look around and dick around. Shining your flashlight in people's faces makes them squint. Rolling into water makes your clothes wet (though that has been a thing since uncharted 1 I think). Characters will respond if you go off script [spoilers](Your... other left?)[/spoilers]. The driving mechanics, while not realistic, is pretty fun. You can get a good drift going by tapping the handbrake. The gunplay is good, making you run out of ammo pretty quickly and having to pick up other guns. You can fight while doing basically anything: swinging, climbing, sliding, falling.

After playing through Far Cry 5, I don't even know why I bothered with that game. This game sets the bar for what a AAA game should be. It isn't perfect, but it sure beats Tomb Raider. Tomb Raider has the graphics, controls, and movement down, but it's just so uninteresting and they always throw in magic at the end to make the entire story worthless.

Game play similar to Tomb Raider, but nowhere as dark or gruesome.
Enjoyable dialog like Guardians of the Galaxy or No One Lives Forever (if anyone remembers that oldie but goodie, which I wish someone would remake), but even better.
Skill of storywriting was reminiscent of Red Dead Redemption 2, but not nearly as epic (if you haven't played RDR2, do).

Amazing script and acting in both games. Well-acted, bantering dialog, similar to Guardians of the Galaxy, but with more depth. The story progression perfectly supported the game and the dialog tied into the gameplay so well that it significantly enhanced the experience. When my wife looked up the game and told me it was released before the movies, I was incredulous.  The movie's casting and acting were surprisingly faithful to A Thief's End.

Graphics were lovely.  I don't have a top of the line rig but even so the sets were beautiful, full of rich texture and detail.  I found myself stopping just to look around and appreciate the view more than once.  It was enough to make me take notice of Naughty Dog and to look for their association on other games in the future.  I can't speak to the environmental sound, unfortunately, since I typically play at night and keep the volume low so the rest of the family can read or sleep (I hate headphones).

I found A Thief's End to be a bit better in gameplay though Lost Legacy held its own. The latter was a bit easier I think, with handholds easier to find and usually more obvious paths.  The first large treasure hunting area of Lost Legacy at first was disappointing because there was enough content there (and repetition) that I thought it was the only game location. But after leaving that area, my hopes lifted and the growing friendship (and maybe more?) between the two leads made me want to keep playing for hours on end.

The gameplay itself was quite fun, but was admittedly the weakest component of the game. It had enough treasures scattered about to encourage one more playthrough, though probably not more than that.  PC controls were not awesome and I died many times from accidental key presses or getting caught behind cover or trying unsuccessfully to get out from cover.  The controls and the stickiness of cover mode together made stealth mode much harder than it needed to be; I rarely finished an area without having to fight my way out.  And fighting was also hampered by the same.  Puzzles were challenging but not so constant as to annoy.  One puzzle was frustrating enough that I finally went to game forums for the solution. But most could be figured out with enough persistence.

In all, solid game and I recommend it unreservedly.  I wish they'd make more like it, as long as they release it on Windows!",1688786470,1688786470,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The most astonishing part of the game is the artistic direction. The variety of environments, the lightning of the scenes and so on are second to none.
The combat is your standard uncharted game, nothing gained, nothing lost.
Sadly, where all fails for me is the story. Uncharted is about searching tresure and finding lost cities, yes, but what really makes uncharted stand out is the sense of an adventure like none other. You´re not going to any ruins, you are going to the lost city of el dorado, where you must overcome curses and devils. Instead, uncharted 4 is only about finding a lost city. whats so special about it? it's got pirates.... I guess. It's always building up for something bigger and at the end of the day it just leaves you underwhelmed.

Overall, 8/10

I said I was gonna change the review to positive if they fixed this, but in the meantime I got to see Nadine in the Neil Cuckman's finest writing/directing moment. That alone makes this deserve a negative. Buddy, you'll never be Amy Hennig!

--------------------------------------------------------------

Edit. First patch, they broke the mouse sensitivity ever more and the game is jittery. Second patch they fixed the mouse acceleration adding propper raw input, but it was a simple implementation and the game remais jittery.

The Aim Sensitivity (not the Camera Sensitivity) is so high that even when set to 1 (out of 100) it is still fast. My mouse is set for 900 DPI and I had to drop it to 600 DPI to make it work. Third patch fixed that. I don't need to change my DPI anymore.

Also, the Sniper ADS is still too fast. And there's something else that remains overlooked: there's still camera focus overriding sensitivity when you're in cover during a gun fight. Also, people have complained that X and Y axis have different sensitivities. I noticed this before, but I haven't payed attention to it now.

- Tweak the sensitivity slider to ajust it to lower than it can.
- Add a Scope Sniper Sensitivity slider.
- Remove camera focus during fights. As matter of fact, remove it for the entirety of the game.

Its a game with no fun on PC. 

It still feels like you are playing on a console where the controls work with 90% of the accuracy. 

The game has a very strong combat play with stupid mechanics. The protagonist can not fire from the cover. She has to stand out in the open to shoot which just means she will take the bullets too. The combat is very tuf and the lack of cover system just makes your player die more often.

Stealth fighting is crap too as the sensitivity is very high for you to be detected and there is nothing much you can do to hide except go in the bushes. She can't climb, nor hang nor cover herself with mud and neither can lie flat on the ground. The cover system as I already said is not there. All you can do is look for the bushes and go in them. I mean why create stealth when you have nothing to make it worth.

My biggest turn down -  I have high affinity with female protagonists, with males also I can play though. What I have never done is played with a transgender. The female character does not feel like a female. She has the face of a strong man with long hair and a man's voice. Except for the body she was a total male and throughout the game I kept feeling I am managing a transgender here. I have nothing against Trans people its just that I am not there yet when I will chose them as my  game character.

The exploring part is not so bad if you ignore the character controls. The graphics are good and the views are nice. It is still far from Tomb Raider though.

I usually play every game twice but never this again.

The mouse input when playing with KB+M was terrible. Even with 120 FPS it was as if the mouse only moved or updated at perhaps 10 or 15 hz / times per second making gameplay with KB+M absolutely brutal. It worked perfectly with any controller, and I would say in a lot of ways Uncharted plays best with a controller, but I really wanted to try it out KB+M, that + high FPS was the main reason I bought it here on PC after playing it already on PS4.

Well, as of July 2023, finally, this game has been updated and fixed the mouse input and I can FULLY recommend it to PC users. Especially right now on sale for $39 CAD, that is a great price for this game.

The graphics are beautiful, especially on PC. It is very well optimised and always has been. The gameplay is fantastic, consisting of climbing, puzzles, shooting, driving, and epic set pieces that take you for a real ride at times. Animation quality is beyond anything else that any other game offers. And the story is great too with characters that feel like real people.

This game is Naughty Dog at their finest, and I am so happy that it is finally fixed on PC regarding the mouse input.

A 100% buy for anyone who has never played it. You DO NOT need to play through the first 3 games to enjoy #4, though I would really like to see them come out on PC it is not necessary, you are not going to be missing out on much and will be able to follow along the story just fine, most of what you ""need to know"" will be explained through exposition and cutscenes over the first few chapters, but each game is more-or-less its own defined storyline, with just some minor character development and references that carry over from the prior ones. Besides, if you do feel like you MUST play them in order, honestly, the first Uncharted game is not even that great, has not aged well at all. #2 and #3 are masterpieces like this one, but #1 can overall be skipped. I say don't worry about it, and jump right in.

If you have already played this on PlayStation then I don't really see this as a must-buy. It does benefit from higher FPS, slightly improved graphics, and higher resolution if your monitor supports it, but it isn't a transformative experience. KB+M is a lot better for the shooting sections, but for the exploration (majority of the game) it doesn't make much of a difference.",1688689931,1688689931,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In some ways, it is.
The good parts are the climbing (which has a lot of depth) and the gunplay, where you can easily die if you're stupid but can feel like a badass if you're willing to put in the effort to learn how to use the environment to your advantage. Climbing, swinging and sliding your way around enemies to shove bullets in the back of their heads is therapeutic as heck.

Major downsides are that the game only has so many tricks to pull off and they quickly become stale. The ""Oh look you gotta jump over the conveniently placed slide section to get to the crumbly wall! Oh no! You the wall crumbled and you gotta go down the slide"" gag gets stale quickly. The other major downside is the game is incredibly linear outside of shooting sections. You can easily tell when you are about to enter a shooting gallery because the game throws choices at you regarding your movement. The rest of the game is a single, ""correct"" path that if you deviate even slightly you'll at best make no progress, at worst die for no reason. The best example is right early on in the game when you come back from the old Panama prison to the new one. You gotta go through a roof hatch on top of a single storey shack to end the segment.

My only complaints, which is nit picking... fsckng logo's, I know it is a Sony game, I know Naughty Dog are the developers.... I don't need a reminder every time I play!  And price. As with all games, well almost all games -> Never pay full price it only encourages greed.

Edit: I forgot to add, the attention to detail, the addition of elements that have no bearing on progression yet add to the immersion. NPC's interact with each other and the player in a way that seems real and this makes the world live. There was no need to make a string of sausages move as the player brushes by them in a market place, yet they do. Just one example of many little details that add up to a whole.

Graphics.
Everything that's close to the player (characters, weapons, vehicles) looks fantastic, especially faces and facial animations in cutscenes, but I cannot say the same about most of the surroundings, some pieces look like they are straight from 2003. I am not a graphics expert but my guess is that there's something wrong with the lighting. I do realise that the game was originally designed for PS4 but then why does the frame rate drop to 70 in some areas? The devs could have done a better job when porting the game to PC.

Music. Story. Acting.
Not much to say here, all three are amazing. I really enjoyed watching Nate's and Sam's story.

Controls.
It's a typical console game, so if you play on KBM, you'll realise how clumsy the character movement is.

Gameplay (non-combat).
A lot of monotonous climbing (by the way, when you drive a car, you also do the climbing, just in the car), too few interesting puzzles, especially puzzles with large mechanisms, like in Tomb Raider. I remember just one, with a huge bell in the church.

Gameplay (combat, Crushing mode).
This is one of the most annoying shooters I have ever played. You are always low on ammo (in most cases you can get ammo/weapons only by looting enemies, but enemies carry all kinds of rifles and pistols, so there's never enough ammo to fill up your pouch) whereas your enemies not only have unlimited ammo but also they don't even try to pretend it's not like that, they just give you a bullet hell (infinite heavy suppressing fire, instant reloads and high accuracy) they push aggressively, throw grenades which almost don't miss and stick to the surface right where you are hiding, even if it's a cliff. and the further you progress, the worse it gets; so in the final chapters, prepare to suffer and cry ""Oh, God, why"" a lot. The problem is that you don't really have anything to fight back because aiming feels like Nate is 90 years old, so headshots, which are the key to survival, are unpredictable; besides, enemies dodge bullets like the Agents from the Matrix, literally :) Also, the console like mechanics make thing even worse, because when you roll over, you often stick to the wrong side of a cover exposing yourself to the enemy and can get killed quickly. That said, surviving a gunfight is all about luck (and a bit of skills).

Female characters.
I am not familiar with the Uncharted series but here's my first impression. Elena - has the voice of a cowboy from Texas, also the way she talks. When Nate and Elena were sitting on a couch, it looked like Elena was a Chad and Nate was a shy girl. Absolutely not feminine and unattractive character. I would say, get a divorce, Nate. Nadine - beats up Nate, then later beats up Nate and Sam, two strong men - well, that's how it works in real life, right? And you know what's even more fun? Both times you confront her, those are not cutscenes, you actually play Nate but he somehow just forgets how to fight, so the game makes you feel helpless and watch how a strong woman kicks your butt. Chloe - has a voice of a 60-year old smoker and kills men with her bear hands and even fights against three. As far as I remember, in Tomb Raider (the new trilogy), you could feel how difficult this was for Lara, so only stealth and only with some kind of weapon.

I was fully immersed in the jungle, city, temples and all the history of pirates. I bought this because of summer sale 2023 and I do not regret it. Here's my opinion about the game for the first time.

Pros 
- Amazing story and cinematic
- Amazing graphics
- Game is not too hard, but not too easy (including puzzles)
- Finished the game in around 12 hours playing it at average speed inspecting everything that I could find
- Voice acting is great
- Playing multiple character is great
- Car mechanic is great
- Whenever you find a sneaky place or unusual route, there will always be a gift (treasure)

Cons
- 1 game crash & 2 blue screens during my time playing.
- The sliding on gravel is not the best mechanic & a little bit glitchy
- Puzzle & jumping around buildings is a little bit redundant at the end of the game
- Sometimes it's confusing what rocks you can and cannot climb on
- When you pause for long time or open the game again, I couldn't find a reminder of the quest I was suppose to do (if you don't remember) or you missed the dialogue

I have played these games multiple times on Playstation, but still wanted to get it for PC to play again. This collection offers you two games that may be in the same genre gameplay-wise, but are quite different in story and tone. 

Uncharted 4 is a sendoff to Nate. His last ride. The story is thoughtful, emotional and leaves you with a warm feeling in your heart. The graphics and visuals and fantastic too, and the game mechanics are genre-defining (So much so that the entire 2013 Tomb Raider reboot basically just copied Uncharted, haha!).

Lost Legacy is a standalone game featuring Chloe instead of Nate, but it is an underrated gem. Lost Legacy is fun, visually gorgeous an explores ancient history in a setting that is rich with it, but somehow never used - India. It has all the good stuff from Uncharted 4, but even nicer visuals and vistas. While Uncharted 4 may need you to have a little context from the past 3 games before it to really immerse yourself in the story, Lost Legacy has no such requirement and can be hopped into straight away. The only con to Lost Legacy really is that it is a bit short. Regardless, Chloe keeps the game entertaining for the entirety of it and I do hope that Chloe features in full-length games as a protagonist in the future, she's such a good character.

Long and complicated part:

Graphics: Probably just the same as Rise of The Tomb Raider, but Shadow of The Tomb Raider easily beats Uncharted graphically. There are definitely some ""eye candy"" scenes that are absolutely tear-wrenching. Very beautiful game. Tomb Raider is equal to Uncharted with scenery.

Gameplay: Very good. Smooth, fluid, and quick parkour. Some of the controls on keyboard are a bit janky and will make you mess up, but other than that, everything feels very satisfying.

Story: Not super flashy, but definitely has some warm, wholesome, and sweet moments. Basically just go through all of these locations while killing the bad guys, and then defeat the big bad antagonist, claim your victory, and it's happily ever after.

I have hit the main points that people pay attention to the most and I can say that the Tomb Raider series is about the same as this series.

The download is very challenging because the game is very heavy, with large environments and excellent graphics.
In the PC version I noticed some glitches on the characters (deformed climbing limbs) due to errors in the porting, but nothing serious. A fix is needed.
Lots of cutscenes for narrating the story (perhaps too many but still enjoyable).

Uncharted 4 starts with a vomit inducing scene on a ship, the ""lightning"" doesn't work and only makes the screen white. After that you are transported back in to the past and play as Nathan Jr. - which is soooooo boring. I don't care, I want Action.

Uncharted The Lost Legacy is a good game. It's just _way_ too short. 7 hours for 30 bucks? That's a joke. Chole Frazer is an amazing Protagonist though - if only that Nadine girl wasn't so whiny all the time. All the time bitching, crying, complaining. It gets so tedious. The best part of the game was when I was on my own. That Sam Character was supposed to be comedic relief I guess, but he was just annoying af.

Overall the game has a nice mix of shooting and exploring. Although it's very linear. In the beginning when you explore the valley you may think that this is an open world game - but that part is just way too short. Also the climbing is sometimes not very intuitive.

You get the feeling that the developers ran out of content. There was one particular scene near the end which made it abundandly clear, that they had to fill the game somehow. So they give you some tracks, a stonewall and a cart. At first you need to drag around the cart, which takes about 1 minute. Then you climb over the stone wall, only to find a room, where you can not progress. Instead your ""buddy"" climbs up the ladder, which then breaks. So you need to go back over the wall, bring the cart back to it's original position, so your buddy can throw down a crate on which you can climb up. That scene was so annoying and unnecessary.

The final fight was also kinda boring. Didn't feel like a real ""boss"" fight, it was just button smashing galore. Overall I'd rate my experience with Uncharted 4 1/10 and Uncharted TLL 6.5/10. Not sure why this game gets so much praise, it's not a masterpiece. It's a good game, just way too short.

I have played all the Uncharted games, and U4 as well, many times on the PS before. All great games, but Uncharted 4 is simply the best. Yet only if you played the previous ones and you are connected with the characters and engaged in their struggle. I strongly recommend to at least watch the story for the previous ones, to understand the character's background and chemistry. The game looks stunning and is full of action with an occasional puzzle to solve - 'tis the closest thing you get to being Indiana Jones in a videogame. But it also tells a brilliant, emotional story, with characters that talk and act like real people and you get to care for them very fast. And while the story is not very original, it is presented in a very down to earth and human way - which is rarity in videogames.

Lost Legacy
on the other hand, is soulless, dull fanservice. The action is here, yes, but the levels look all the same, all the puzzles are actually only two puzzles repeated over and over and the dialogue takes a huge fall in witt and logic. Towards the end the plot even diceides that the main heroes need to save the world with their bare hands - Avenger style... and they go and do so, with little to none motivation. Characters already established in the franchize act out of character and are presented only as 21st century holywood stereotypes. There is even a line, very unnecessary line, of dialogue at one point, about one of the heroines breaking a man's legs for looking down on her... Don't get me wrong. I like Chloe from U2 and 3, where she already is a strong woman type of character. Here it is just unnecessarilly overdone all the time. And I came to like Sam in U4.

The problem is  when it's not action packed it's a bit boring, and that's 75% of the game. The start of the main game has you play through two prison sequences that are almost identical, and then a flashback that is nothing but climbing and then a tutorial swimming section that adds nothing to the story before the adventure really gets going. Towards the end right as story starts to pick up, they throw you into another flashback that is nothing but climbing.

The tone of this game is all over the place as well. These games always had an issue with the main characters going from mass murdering thieves in one scene to charming protagonists the next. The first three worked because they were all fantasy stories that had supernatural monsters. They were essentially Indiana Jones games. These two games don't have a supernatural element and they attempt to feel too realistic, but it just doesn't work.

It's a decent enough adventure and I would normally recommend picking it up on sale, but on top of everything that I mentioned, the game seems to have a memory leak as it crashed every half hour on a machine with a 5900x and a 6950xt running fairly cool, I played this game for 30 hours so it crashed 60 times.",1686019131,1686019131,False,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

okay here comes the honest review about this game. so i think we all know this game comes from ps4 back in 2017? i cant exactly remember but i have played it on ps4 once and i played it again years later on PC and sheesh this game does not disappoint at all. this may be one of the best adventure game you could play considering this is an older title. not gonna post any spoilers but the mechanics, gameplay and graphics is amazingly stunning in this game. side note: i did encounter a sudden crash 2 times throughout the game and i dont think this has anything to do with the specific areas in game it's like the game just crashes on its own then it's fine the moment i loaded it up again. im running 3060ti with i5 12th gen and 16gb ram with all settings maxed out and id recommend yall to do the same, trust me you wont regret with the graphics in this game.  id give this game 9/10. kudos to the company that made this game yall did an amazing job.",1683529671,1683529671,True,1,0,0.507521510124206543,0,True,False,False

Not here, though. Seriously, this series is supposed to be a system seller for the Playstation? Why??

I have only played ""A Thief's End"" so far, and only for a couple of hours. But I'm so bored already that I can't bring myself to playing any further. Here are a few reasons why:

The characters. I can't get myself to like them. Not even Nathan Drake.

The gameplay. I mean, is there even gameplay? Most of the time, I'm running around, either looking for an icon to pop up, so that I can press the button I am supposed to press (usually the game will tell me which one). That's not gameplay.

There are the climbing passages, and yes, they are mildly entertaining. Yet still, at the end of the day, they are about me finding out which way the game wants me to go without telling me.

And then there are the fights. The gunplay is terrible. The camera leaves a lot to be desired. And the opponents are usually dozens over dozens of more or less identical characters attacking you. That the game loves to spawn them right behind you just adds to the annoyance.

In between are cutscenes. Lots and lots of cutscenes. Looong cutscenes. That you cannot skip. They are probably supposed to draw you into the story. But as that one is as shallow as the characters, this doesn't really work. Some of them were so boring that I dozed off in front of the PC. I can't think of a single game that ever did that to me.

On the plus side, the graphics are amazing. This game really looks stunning at times. But that can't make me ignore the fact that I find the game boring.

It's not that I dislike console ports in general. I did enjoy God of War. I absolutely loved GTA V and RDR 2. And I really had high expectations for Uncharted. But the latter turned into one of the biggest disappointments of my long gaming career.

And this time, I don't think it's me.

I think ""A Thief's End"" is just not a good game. There, I said it.",1682951218,1682951352,False,4,1,0.480556875467300415,2,True,False,False

They are crafted with incredible detail and the scenery is breathtaking... mountains, valleys, ancient ruins, etc. The story spans across both games with some characters appearing in both. I found the story engaging, the characters likable, and the voice-acting excellent. 

Although the stories are different, the two games are very similar in terms of game play. Both have a great deal of peaceful exploration with an occasional burst of skirmish. Most combat in initiated by you needing to enter a guarded area. Thus, you have options in terms of stealth, weapons, and strategy. There are some pretty intense combat sequences towards the end of both games but these were survivable for me.

I played on 'Explorer' mode which makes the game much easier for those not adept at action gaming. There are sections that involve a lot of climbing and swinging from ropes and these were quite forgiving. I struggled with using a controller to drive a 4x4 Jeep which is your mode of travel for several chapters. Especially when under fire, I tended to drive pretty badly. But, the game has very regular save points and you just try again when you fail.

Collectibles are scattered throughout the games (journals, treasures, photo ops, notes, optional conversations.). Many of these are not visible from the main path and you may need a guide to find them. However, none are required for game completion.  There are a number of interesting mechanical puzzles which involve activating old machinery. All required puzzles were reasonable and enjoyable to solve. There was one timed optional puzzle that made me crazy but, in the end, I prevailed.

I found Uncharted to be easier than Tomb Raider. The leaping and swinging in Explorer mode was simplified and I fell to my death much less often. Weapons and ammunition are abundant and I never ended up stuck without a way to defend myself. 

There are a wide range of achievements which include speed runs, driving precision, and completing the games at verous levels of difficulty. From the begining, 100% was not in the cards for me but I did try to finish with a reasonable percentage. The game allows you to circle back to chapters and encounters to pick up missing items and achievements. You also have access to all weapons and unlimited ammunition as 'bonus' items once you complete the game.

Overall, I really enjoyed Uncharted and highly recommend it to those who crave an action/adventure with a focus on exploration. Although there are some tricky scenes, there is no horrific boss fight at the end of either game and I was able to complete them with minimal frustration. My only regret is that Uncharted 1,2, and 3 are not available for the PC!",1682472308,1682546438,True,36,1,0.781227529048919678,4,True,False,False

The game-play is mostly smooth, but not without some minor gripes. The action and combat is very good, you have a decent level of options when taking on the enemy such as the usual stealthy bush hiding, or all guns blazing Arnie style.

The locations are interesting and look beautiful when the settings are maxed out.  Drakes arm did turn into a noodle on a few occasions when I was hanging from ledges and shooting, it did the floppy-compound-fracture wiggle, but corrected as soon as I stood up.

The story-line is OK, it's an Uncharted game! Much like any swashbuckling (gunbuckling?) adventure you are chasing down the goodies while obstacles and baddies try to get the goodies for themselves.

My complaints are minor but here goes:

1. The roll and 'take cover' buttons are one and the same. This becomes annoying as you try and roll the f*** out of a sticky spot when getting flanked by enemies, only to have Drake take cover behind a box but on the wrong side.

2. Imagine performing a series of jumps, climbs, swings etc. As you are shimmying along a ledge the camera angle changes by just enough to cause the direction that you've been holding to be interpreted as the opposite direction. I see how this would work if you start from a stand-still then move the camera and push left or right, but when you're already in motion and the camera  changes why would the game do this?

One thing that really grinds my gears here is the hour-long wait to compile shaders when I first installed the game and whenever my GPU gets updated. Like goddamn, I know I don't necessarily have to wait for it to finish before I start, but do I want to deal with longer load times during the game itself? No, so I'm waiting now. And it's really fantastic that it doesn't compile both games' shaders at the same time, so a few minutes ago when I switched over to play Lost Legacy I realized I have to wait again. Good thing it's not as big of a game, or that'd be 2 whole hours of shader compiling! Realistically, it's more like an hour and thirty minutes. I'm using an SSD, and it's taking this fuckin' long!

On PS3 I was not happy with the amount of combat in those games, which was also quite frustrating to execute. So I did pick up ""Legacy of Thieves collection"" at a discount, intending to play on easy difficulty, to see if ND could win me back. I must say after now having finished ""A Thief's End"", I was pleasantly surprised! On easy difficulty, combat is serviceable and does not block progress noticeably, even though it is still my least favourite part of the game. Climbing is a bit much at times, but besides that, it's all quite nice. I did not bother too much with side content/hidden treasures, but kept a steady pace through all beautiful environments. Always nice with games that allows the colours to stand out. It is a nice story wrap-up for Drake and Elena, well-acted across the board. The puzzles that are by no means hard but impressing by AAA-standards. Overall more like the first Uncharted games.

So, ""A Thief's End"" is definitely a step-up for Naughty Dog in my book and my favourite game out of the Sony PC ports. Initially it may have felt like a 3/5, but it grew on me up until the end, so I will bump it up to a 4/5.

As for the games, what's to say? It's more Uncharted. Granted with a boatload of subtle, but effective, QoL additions, two extra contextual mechanics to spice up the series' trademark climbing sections, and heavily expanded stealth mechanics that elevate stealth into a proper alternative to combat.

The two games really are both sides of the same coin. While I appreciated 4's more grounded story and setting, I found myself yearning for the mystic and swashbuckle of the PS3 games. Cue Lost Legacy and its slew of ancient massive ruins jam-packed with inexplicably functional puzzles and death traps. Puzzles, incidentally, I consider to be the best in the entire series, both visually and mechanically. Unfortunately while generally good, LL's writing is much shallower thanks mostly to its short runtime and much smaller scope. 

In short, if you liked the PS3 trilogy, this collection is a no-brainer. If not then these games likely won't change your mind.

The care, detail and creativity that went into crafting the world, the narrative and the puzzles for both games is simply unrivaled, elevated by the fact that both games - contrary to its predecessors - don't feature any supernatural enemies. The gameplay, which is the same for both games, feels very responsive and intuitive and is easily mastered. I do not recall encountering any bugs, game-breaking or otherwise, during the 123 hours I spent playing the games, so you can rest assured that you buy a functional product when adding the Legacy of Thieves Collection to your library. All in all both games are, apart from a few minor complaints (see below), a brilliant addition to your collection if you like playing narrative-driven games.

The game is not perfect however, and there were a few minor things that somewhat annoyed me during my playtime. To start off, the crosshair that you have when using a gun that does not have a scope is way too big, which makes aiming accurately harder than it has to be. I suspect the game makes up for this by making any shot you take while a part of the enemy’s body is in the crosshair an automatic hit, but it feels a little weird and I sometimes got kills that theoretically should have been impossible, which slightly ruins the immersion of the game. Another point of annoyance was that a few achievements are oddly specific and therefore very hard to do, and since I am someone who likes to get all achievements in the game this annoyed me to no end, especially when I had to keep reloading checkpoints for half an hour just to get enemies in the right place for the achievement to be doable. 

The only major issue I had with the games is that the end credits, for both of them, are unskippable if you want the achievements for beating the game to pop. This is simply unacceptable, especially when you consider that the credits for both games take over 10 minutes to finish. The only somewhat redeeming feature about it is that the end credits of The Lost Legacy start with a banger of a song (M.I.A. - Borders), but other than that having unskippable end credits is a terrible executive decision and I hope that it does not return for future installments in the franchise.

For those that do play the game I recommend not using any achievement or collectible guides for your first play-through. I made the mistake of doing that and it severely lessened the immersion and my experience of the game, so learn from my error and don’t make the same mistake.",1680395979,1681142138,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

To say it's story-rich is really underrating. The way the story is played and told is captivating. This game is very deep in accurate history, and at the same time it's adorned with fantasies and legends. It was really fun to watch the cut-scenes because this game is inundated with plethora of witty conversations. 
For game-play: some people think that because this game looks like a movie, the game-play part could be lacking. But NO! I used to believe so, and after I tried the so many weapons in this game during many encounters, I started to doubt my belief, and just until the last chapter in this game 'the sword fight with Rafe' that just I came sure to realize that this is not just a good movie, this is really a good game with a perfect story.
Also this game struck a cord in me, with it's references to zodiac signs and it's predominant dependence on actual papers instead of smart phones. But that's just personal.
And I should not forget to say that this game is ported very well to PC.
What's with the games made in the year 2016 that make them nearly perfect? this game, God of War, BF1? I'm superstitious now that a game made in the year 2016 is good at face-value unless proven otherwise.

- Climbing is super simple and doesnt require much tought. Its like climbing in Assasins Creed which is sad because its 70% of the game.
- The gunplay could have been much better. Stealth is an option but most of the time a timewaste. There is no benefit of going stealth mode. At somepoint the gunplay is just annoying because the enemy tank so many hits so you just shoot, hide and heal, shoot and hide and heal again. If you get hit your targed flinches 10 meters up so precise hits aka headshots in combat are rare and more luck than skill. (It sucks for mouse gameplay)
- The vehicleparts are just plain annoying and dont add anything to the game.
- The puzzle are too simple and require 0 thought. Also there are only like 5 in the whole game.

The only thing that keept me playing was the story. I like the concept but sadly at some point it got so over the top its not really comprehensible anymore.

Definitely Recommend this game for those who like this type of game.

Before I commence this review so you have a baseline to asses how it will play on your system.
my Rig is a CPU Ryzen 5800 X3D. GPU AMD Radeon RX6700XT  Ram 32 GB 3600 MTS.
In game Game Graphics @1440p set to Ultra everything. Average FPS was between 130-90 depending upon the scene.

So for me the game looked stunning (used HDR) and played smoothly. I used a controller as that was how game was designed to work so avoided the mouse polling issue reported for this port (stuttery  & 10 FPS when moving camera etc ).

With that out of the way. I have played the previous games ( just a few times  :-)   ). 
So this is the final chapter for Nathan Drake as an Adventurer Rogue thief . You find out more of his back story discover he has a Brother. So you get to know him more as a character overall.
Story is the usual wild yarn of ""Lost"" Hidden unknown treasure"" leading to a touch of globe trotting, crossing paths with this time not 1 but 2 protagonists after the same thing . The stage is set.

The characterisation is excellent the dialogue is believably human. The deliberate bad jokes are still here and wise cracks some making me laugh out loud ( done in a in joke knowing way by Naughty dog regarding the Uncharted series).

Visually I found it stunning and many time stopped to take screen shots and photos . The details of some items are insane considering they are just irrelevant other than set dressing for places.

The pacing of the game I thought was a decent balance between story / action / and plot moving forward.
Though if you do not like platforming you may find traversing areas a pain as there is a lot to do BUT that is what Uncharted is about, traversing suicidal terrain like some human fly. There are new mechanics adding a couple of different mechanisms getting from point A to Point B  (sliding , and grappling rope) which open up extra game play options especially in combat situations.

For me what elevated this above many similar games was the  Random NPC dialogues you could eve drop on, here I am talking about the shoreline mercs. some discussing previous jobs, some talking about is this job worth  sticking with, even saw one taking photos of another Merc who was doing different poses with his Rifle, I was playing stealth sections so all this was going on with me unseen . This added to the immersion into this world. Is it essential No but it counts and is applied to most aspects of this game. I am not adding specifics to avoid spoilers.

PLOT ARMOUR...we have a KAI Leng in UC4 a protagonist we chat touch this is the sucky part that left me with a distaste as much as Kai Leng does in Mass Effect 3. a shame they did this in this game.
Another gripe is an Action QTE event that happens in Kings Bay  because of the Camera angle and unknown layout of the streets you can only figure out what you need to do after dying multiple times, this ruined the flow I had up to that point.

The Puzzles are fun and of the usual Uncharted type.

Overall it is as good IMHO as my fave Uncharted 2 game. Its cinematic, engaging FUN and a worthy closure of the series. Highly recommend if you enjoy Light RPG Action adventure games where gunplay is kind of minor to the overal game itself but can be fun. I personally enjoyed the difficult conundrum of how to stealth kill multiple enemies that all had over lapping view of each other that required considerable patience and studying their  patrolling patterns ( not the same as they kept varying their route with unseen enemies) You could of course go all guns blazing against 10 Plus enemies see how that turns out for you ( I managed a couple of times ) passing unseen taking down every one without being detected.

I just wish more games where made with such love and care. even if the port wasn't perfect on release. As long as you set in game settings to match your system build it should run well enough.",1680692764,1680692764,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also most dialogues are great in the first game (of the two in this collection), specially Sullivan's, followed close by Elena's. Both clever people with cool minds, never overreacting and putting priorities first while pushing the right buttons both on Drake and Sam. The 2nd game though, get some awkward (not to say cringe) dialogues, like not really funny jokes, boring preoccupations; idk, they might've over explained somethings along the game... Somehow the 1st beat the 2nd when it comes to dialogues withstanding the test of time;

Drake is drake and no need to talk about him here, you know him; now Chloe is a very cool character and I had a lot of fun playing her. I think there should be more games exploring her past but maybe that would just be a copy of Tomb Raider unfortunately. I had a great time while she was talking her way out of difficult situations. She's clever and fun.

Then it comes, the two main issues:

It is pretty bad how you get to see Sam Drake going from problematic and liar (almost stealing Nathan's spot sometimes) to a complete stupid and dumb comic relief on the next game right after. Maybe someone in NaughtyDog thought they had to push the only man in the group into being a total brain-dead in order for the two girls to appear properly.
And........ There's Nadine. By far the worst character in Uncharted. One that gets to be unbearable and break immersion every single time she appears: First game, she's the boss of a mercenary group and is completely thrown off when other mercenaries betray her for money (being the boss, she should know better), then there's her super strength to a point where you have two guys holding her down but they might have noodles for arms bc in one move she breaks free sending both of them almost flying. On the 2nd game she loses the super power and can't fight any significant fights if you're not helping. Also, she's mean, even with her friends, everything you say can and will be used against you in a conversation. Unfortunately she gets to be with you until the very last cutscene.

Gameplay:

The basic stuff is harder than it looks. Most of the time you have a companion and they do make the game a LOT more difficult by stealing your spot, crossing in front of you and blocking your path while you're shooting, or try to run from a bomb, also they walk in front of the enemies while you're being stealthy and all that, not to mention that taking cover and running near walls is a complete nightmare, the mc will just not obey commands. The characters wont move if the're near a wall, as if they needed 3 times their actual size to pass through a door or something. It is bad enough to make you nervous a lot, but the game itself is still worth it.

The whole Indiana Jones stuff is there, it's fun, maybe they kill some characters that would be cool on their own by shoving some agendas on your face, the moving part is very awkward and could/should be reworked if they plan on some remastered version or something similar, but in the end it's definitely a couple of games I'll finish at least once more each, for sure.",1680140738,1680140738,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wont go in more details about what works and instead will focus on what doesnt work. So my overall opinion for the games is a worthy experience to play.

Now for me the worst thing about both the base game and the dlc is the gunfights. The are just extra padding to increase the total playtime while aslo adding variety to an otherwise ,limited gameplay, experience. They dont feel good they are not fun and i am glade they are reduced ecnounters compared to the previous games. There is also stealth which doesnt feel that good either but its still better. I also played on the hard difficulty and i have to say that its just dumb. You have enemies getting shot or jumping gaps while also aiming with 1 hand straight at you and somehow every shot connects. In my opinion just ditch the whole gunplay on future games.

This negative is only for completionist, the game has terrible achievements and collectible system. You have no indication(until the dlc) to show if you are near a collectible so either you spend all your time searching everthing or you just say fuck it and only collect what you come across. On the dlc there is also some annoying collectable dialogues and photos. The photos on the linear part are fine but on the open world are just terrible there is no way to tell what the devs consider a good photo spot or not so you just cant find them other than following a guide or being lucky. The dialogues are fine too but becareful because if you happen to do an action while the prompt appears you might lose it completly.

And finaly the worse for both the dlc and the base game ,slight spoilers, is Nadine. She is just terrible, and an annoying character during the base game that they then try to redeem during the dlc only to fail. For starters she is shallow during the base game basicly only appearing to make bad decisions and beat your ass because she is badass(something that the rest of the cast have to mention during the game). Somehow she is impossible to defeat on hand to hand combat but everyone working under her is just some random dure with no combat experience at all, no wonder she drove the mercenery company she had to the ground. So since she offered nothin to the base game and she could be easily removed and nothing would change they decided to add her to the dlc for allowing them to use her for future games. Well is just as annoying and stupid during the dlc too, thank god for Chloe and her charisma. She is a moving contradiction to herself, one moment she would say 1 thing only for the next to say the opposite. She is rush with her decisions and just overall a bad person. We are supposed to forget that she worked for the worst people during her mercenary years. But once again the cast around her is saying how badass she is and we should like her for some reason. Also she is nerfed, she could handle nathan and sam during the base game at the same time but now along with chloe she couldnt handle asav until the end of the game were they somehow overpower him. Honestly she is just a mess of writing inconsistances and shouldnt be in the base game. She is needed at the dlc to engage in dialogue with chloe but i would take sam over her anytime. I get what they wanted to create but they failed.",1680121002,1680121002,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately there are no Uncharted 1-2-3 on PC, not even this collection has them. So I played through the earlier games using the RPCS3 Emulator to catch up with the storyline and characters.

Playing through the earlier titles was a whole lot of fun. Getting to know the characters and their background stories, even on a deeper level, while also embarking on their adventures to here and there for lost treasures and cities was just overall a really great experience.

The best thing about this series is that it has humour, action and even drama packed into them. The way the characters talk with each other and react to various things is just pure fun to listen to.

Pros:
- The games are jaw droppingly beautiful
- The amount of tiny little details are mind blowingly insane
- Both game ran like a dream performance wise, top tier optimization
- Animations are as smooth as butter
- The characters are sooo well-written
- The storyline of both entries were intriguing, I just loved everything about them.
- The gameplay itself is really responsive and is just overall satisfying, both the gunplay and the exploration.
- You can either go stealth or guns blazing.
- Some sections of the games are semi-open world, great stuff
- Really great OST
- Photomode, which is an instant W in my book.
- Steam achievements

Neutral:
- I would have loved to play the Uncharted 4 multiplayer, but unfortunately, this collection does not have multiplayer in it.


 This game is easily a masterpiece and is now among the best video games I've ever played. It's really a must play.

I highly recommend checking out the earlier games too as they are also really-really great games and are mentioned in this final closure of the series, but do be aware that if you want to play them on an emulator like I did, it will have its fair share of issues, but I could finish them from start to finish, so maybe you can too.",1679429109,1679916641,True,54,2,0.806667566299438477,2,True,False,False

I played this game on a Ryzen 3700X with a Radeon 5700, connected to an 38"" ultra-wide display. Rendered resolution was set to 1920x800, upscaled to the native 3840x1600. This can be configured directly in the game's options, no messing about with AMD's Adrenaline software required. After initial crashing issues that where resolved by setting the texture quality to 'high' (I probably ran out of VRAM on 'ultra'), the game ran fine with no performance issues. Note that the game does not have a field of view setting, though it does expand the FOV if you play it on an ultra-wide monitor.Where the game fails for me is the gameplay, which alternates between climbing puzzles and combat. The climbing puzzles aren't terrible, but not as interesting as those in last three Tomb Raider games. The combat is pretty terrible though. The guns are all rather inaccurate, and the enemies are somewhat bullet spongy unless you land a headshot. The game also loves throwing multiple waves of enemies at you that appear out of nowhere. Again, the last three Tomb Raider games do this much better.TL;DR - if you haven't played the last three Tomb Raider games yet, get those instead.",1679746201,1679746201,False,3,1,0.510964632034301758,0,True,False,False

Every component of this game cannot compete with other games of similar genres. Driving the boat scene at the beginning - boat handles OK but the ramming is awful. Your heavy boat is about to smash the rubber one but when they collide they both slow down for a second and then the same animation is being played - enemy vehicle spins upside down. It makes you lose the feeling of handling a couple tons boat completely.Then comes the shooting - scoping's OK, but there's almost no impact when you hit the enemies.During the rest of the prologue I've really missed the flow feel I am expecting from a game like this. For example, I was being taught to do a roll between two covers. I was expecting Nathan to lean against the second cover automatically but the animation left me standing few steps from the destination.Climbing feels janky since you are being stuck all the time. The character refuses to move to the next ledge unless you are on the very edge of the current one. However, you stick should be turned at precise direction to move on which causes unnecessary pauses and kills the feel of the flow. In addition, I've had a couple of situations when the character was leaning to some random walls during the pursuit scene. The plot is good, but some tragic events which happened to our character during the prologue have little impact on myself since I am not familiar with the original trilogy.To sum up, the game doesn't feel like masterpiece I was lead to believe from all the positive reviews. You would like it if you are into popcorn movies I presume (no offence) since main components are there. However, if you are seeking some interesting gameplay mechanics - they are either not here or hidden somewhere outside of the prologue.",1679649369,1679661581,False,6,0,0.456516146659851074,1,True,False,False

My single regret is I'm gonna have to wait a few years before playing it again 'cos they were so packed with memorable sequences and set pieces that I reckon I could play through both stories in my head right now and probably not miss a scene.

Both the included games are similarly high in production quality; the scripts manage to feel fresh and funny throughout, and the sheer engineering to tie so many different game mechanics and animations into a single seamless experience is mind blowing. Basically gave me 25+ hrs of much needed fun.

OK I'm running out of superlatives. For context: I loved the recent Tomb Raider games; tend to play each CoD campaign as it comes out - I like cinematic games: first person mostly, bit of shooting, bit of story, lots of animation and eye candy. Main thing I need is escapism. And these deliver that in spades.

Played these Uncharted games on the Steam Deck, sometimes just dipping in for 10 minutes, sometimes having to run and find the charger after a couple of hours had zipped by...

I preferred the levels that offered me more than one or two ways to solve a problem or plan a path and perhaps there were a few too many levels - especially in the early going - that were very linear.  

I was sad when this game ended, and I was further saddened when I found that the previous Uncharted titles had not made their way to the PC and likely wouldn't due to the effort required.  I mean usually when I finish a game, I feel a sense of accomplishment, or even look forward to the next game I have waiting in the library to play - but this time I really wished I could have just kept playing for the next cool plot or area or storyline.

Uncharted 4 has far too much narrative content that takes away from the game. It's practically at the point where it's like Quantum Break for the first half of the game. The puzzles are also too simplistic. In general, the gameplay is very smoothbrained and autopilot. The game also plays terribly with M+KB because of weird input delays due to trying to create realistic movement, and it's even worse than RDR2 with this. The Tomb Raider games have extremely similar gameplay and control perfect with M+KB. That said, having PS5 controller support does work great with haptics and adaptive triggers. I would have rather played with M+KB still, but the game is just not playable like that. The combat is pretty fun and allows for experimentation, but experimentation is really not very rewarding and combat encounters tend to play out very similarly since most the guns don't do anything game changing, and they're over almost as soon as they begin for the most part.

The Lost Legacy is, however, far better in its balance of gameplay to narrative and has actually rewarding puzzles, with combat encounters happening often enough that you do get more of a playful feeling from them.

In my personal experience the game is more stable on a notebook with an AMD Ryzen 5 4600H APU with 16GB RAM - but the graphics performance of that AMD APU just isn't good enough for this game; it's playable in low settings, but if you want to really enjoy Uncharted, you need to run it in ultra settings and at least in Full HD resolution. Sorry - but in this game, the graphics are extremely important; they create the dense atmosphere that is vital to the story that is being told. It just doesn't work without the graphical details.

But on PC that is all an academic discussion anyway: The game is broken on a technical level. When you're lucky, it only crashes back to the Windows desktop. But very often, it either freezes the whole system or produces actual blue screens (making it the only software that I've seen in the last decade that still has such an effect on Windows).

By default, the game looks like horsesh*t garbage because it uses post-processing filter that looks like Vaseline speared over your eye balls. In order to mitigate this, you need to download ""Photo Realistic Re-Shade"" from the Nexus, install it, start the game, press Home, and check ""adaptive sharpening."" Otherwise, the game has some performance issues where, for me, the frame rate varied between 165+ and 65 fps (on an RTX 4080 at 1440p, if you're wondering). That's a pretty unreasonable variation in frame rate that can be pretty jarring. I don't know if this reflects an undisciplined attention to resource use at the development level, or if it's a problem with the port. The original theme song, which I consider to be among the best in the industry, is absent from the main menu and elsewhere in the game until the credits, which is disappointing, even if I understand the artistic reason for its omission.  Finally, the plot lacks any supernatural element other than Nathan Drakes unreasonable upper body strength. This was disappointing, as the supernatural elements of the other games were among my favorite parts of the stories. 

Other than these gripes, the game is great. The visuals are often beautiful, even if the set pieces are all things we've seen before. The climbing animations have been further refined. The dialogue serves its purpose adequately and the characters are well realized. The prologue and epilogue are entirely wholesome.  The in-game flavor-music is similar to, and just as excellent, as prior installments. This installment is basically more of the same, which I consider to be a good thing.

Port is very good, BUT there appears to be some shader compilation issues, even after you let it compile on the main menu. When transitioning to a new area, or when there are new assets rendering for the very first time, there is often a very noticeable stutter for a few seconds. Then it goes away.

So might as well give a proper review for the game and share my overall experience with it.

As a quick mention, Uncharted 4 isn't a new game at all. it was released for the first time in 2016 as a PS4 exclusive and of course. Sony did see it as a good opportunity to release the game for the PC in late 2022 with improved graphics and frame rate to give PC gamers a taste of the Sony universe and try to get them into the PlayStation ecosystems. its the same case with God of War 2018.

I always did plan to play the game and even went as far as considering to get a PS4 just to play the game as looking at the game back in the day was a unique experience for sure. But thankfully this isn't the case anymore and instead we can play the game as it was intended to be.

Graphics/Visuals is already one of those things that will stand out in this game.
Despite coming back in 2016. its definitely one of the best looking games I have played in recent memory and I would certainly say that it has aged like fine wine. if I gotta be honest, even on the baseline PS4. the game looked good but playing it on a high end PC just adds up to the whole experience
Lighting, dynamic environments and usage of effects is done amazingly while also being unique.

Story? I don't think there was a moment that I wanted to skip the cutscenes.
Dialogs are done really well, The environment speaks for itself and the story building has clearly a good direction and it does manage to get the right moments correctly with the balancing of the in game characters.

Controls? Uncharted by its core. is a third person action game just as most other Sony titles through history. While I respect such idea, it also brings an annoying set of controls for both controller and keyboard+mice players and that alone can be irritating.
On top of it, the game dynamically changes the camera based on the what is going on in the game at the time. its done for the purpose of increasing the immersion to the levels you see in movies. but I don't believe it serves a purpose in video games

Gameplay? the game is a throw back to simpler days. no complex skill set system or upgrades but rather everything is simple as it should be. You also pick weapons that were dropped by enemies and Uncharted also being unique by not telling you directly what you should do but it does let you figure it out alone until you get stuck for lomh and then it tells you word by word.

So my overall final verdict is 8/10. 
Uncharted 4 and its DLC was genuinely a refreshing experience compared to the games that came out as of recently and I'm glad that I got to experience the game
and just like with God of War 2018. I'm looking forward for Sony to release more former exclusives to the PC.",1677177505,1677177505,True,7,1,0.581695437431335449,0,True,False,False

We all love our little indie games, but this one really gives you that blockbuster AAA magic that only big budget titles like this can bring. The graphics are jaw dropping still in 2023 and the scenes you play in, the places you visit, and the vistas you feast your eyes on are just something to behold. The characters are brilliantly written, charming and memorable. You know nowadays it seems like every character in every video game is a sarcastic smart-arse. This one isn't like this. Nathan, Elena, Sam, Sully, they are all great characters that you care about and relate with. Btw I'm playing the Harry Prick game at the moment, and the characters there, the little brats, are absolutely garbage in comparison.

If there is some weakness to this game, I'd say the gameplay can be repetitive at times. Climbing a cliff can be fun, but at some point you just keep smashing the A button with your eyes shut and hope for the next cutscene or shootout. The shooting, however, is fun. I must report that I probably had more fun shooting at people in Uncharted 4 than I did with the last few CODs.

One more petty gripe: this game suffers from the same ridiculousness that you see in the Tomb Raider series, Like, in these abandoned caves in the middle of the Indian ocean where nobody has visited for centuries, there just so happens to be some carefully placed crates out of nowhere just for you to use to climb onto a cliff or something. Like wtf...  You just can't take the game too seriously. It's action-comedy. The story is decent but nothing to write home about. Typical Hollywood sort of story, a mixture of bull$hit and humour. Cliche as it may be, I feel it works well for this kind of game.

But overall, this one is absolutely worth the price and the time. I only played one of the two titles and I think I've more than got my money back.",1677129453,1677130040,True,2,0,0.43806728720664978,0,True,False,False

 I have not encountered any bugs or glitches that cause real issues. Both games are as close to flawless as they can get.

I give this game an overall review keeping in mind the price a 15/10 and worth every dime. Keep in mind there are a lot of puzzles some really easy and others rather hard but still a challenge.

This collection is mostly just more of what made UC 1-3 great--loose, acrobatic combat; an Indiana Jones-style awe of the aesthetics of ancient history; a cast of lovable scoundrels; and bombastic action setpieces. Nate's zingers are still 50/50 chuckle/groan, and fan-favorite Sully shows up exactly when he needs to. Nate's brother Sam fits in well and has good chemistry with the rest of the cast. Asav and especially Rafe are insufferable jerks, maintaining the Uncharted postulate that the character least able to take a joke is the most likely villain.

Incremental improvements include some mild stealth mechanics, which encourage (but don't require!) the player to approach most encounters a little more tactically than in previous games. This was fun! Also, it might just be my imagination, but Naughty Dog seems to have taken taken criticisms of the series' ludo-narrative dissonance to heart. It feels like there's a lot less combat--I think I went home with the blood of only several hundred men on my hands, rather than the thousand-ish from previous games. And they were all some manner of commonwealth-accented paramilitary thug type. We're still a long way from the Uncharted game that is just a pacifist walking sim, but at least Naughty Dog is keeping up with society's idea of who is expendable. And, the colonialist theft of ancient history from indigenous people, while still present--and, frankly, hard to avoid when you're channeling Indiana Jones this hard--also takes a back seat to more personal objectives through most of these two games. 

The Lost Legacy deserves special mention for ejecting Nate and still being a good time. The Chloe-&-Nadine-Do-Hoysala is a fun, refreshing odd-couple (and low-key feminist!) story, and shows how all of Uncharted's cast are strong enough to carry their own games.

There are some weird narrative choices in both games that feel kind of synthetic. Nate's initial lie to Elena, and Sam's initial lie to Nate, seem very out-of-character and largely shoehorned into the plot to manufacture drama later. In TLL, Chloe keeps vaguebooking about unresolved daddy issues in a subplot that never pays off. But, look at me, complaining about character drama in a videogame! In almost any other game, nitpicks like this would be silly; they only feel relevant in Uncharted because the general characterization is otherwise so dang luscious. Naughty Dog's commitment to blocking & mo-capping all of its character moments really pays off--even though Uncharted's drama is rarely serious and the mood is almost always breezy & fun, these characters live, breathe, and emote in a way rarely found in videogames. 

Naughty Dog has said that they're now finished with the series, and that makes sense. After you've suffered through a brutal fistfight hanging on a net trailing behind a cargo jet, as in Uncharted 3, what set pieces are left? I'd be fine if we never play as Nate again. But, TLL offers a glimpse into what kind of stories the universe has to offer sans its hero, and I think there's a lot of potential there. If ND decides down the road that there's still more to chart in this series, I'd gladly come back.",1676764858,1676766085,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

And its Uncharted, what isnt there to love? Games that are basically a long interactive movie, but that doesnt make them bad in fact Id argue its what makes them so fantastic. Uncharted games have always been more about visuals and spectacle than anything else and it excels at it. The character interactions have and always will be a large part of what makes the games so enjoyable too.

In terms of completion time Uncharted 4 took me around 15 hours to play from start to end, and Lost legacy took me around 7 or 8 hours (including some of the open area side stuff)

Uncharted 4 in particular is probably the best in the series, it has the best narrative and character writing. Gameplay is the most well refined and all around its just good. The Lost Legacy whilst weaker than 4 IMO, is still really good in its own right (better than 1 and 3 for sure still) and it keeps all of the gameplay improvements from 4. It feels like an in between of a DLC story add on and a game of its own, its hard for me to place which side it leans more on.

It is worth saying though that whilst the content of these games is incredible I cant ignore the elephant in the room which is my experience with game crashes whilst playing. They happened pretty often for me. Not often enough that they actively ruined the game experience but enough for it to be noticeable and mildly annoying when they did happen (luckily this game has frequent enough checkpoints you don't usually have to replay much when you do crash.) I've seen others with this issue mention they are using an AMD GPU, so I figured Id mention that I'm the same (Raedon RX 5600 XT) Just a bit of a warning if you also have an AMD GPU before buying.

TLDR: A double pack of incredible games that are definitely worth experiencing, other than potential technical issues with crashes on AMD hardware. Now if only Sony would port over the first 3 Uncharted games too. That would be amazing.",1676479234,1676481058,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics and environments are gorgeous, the cinematics and story are great (if a bit generic at times), but the gameplay itself feels rather bare-bones. Climbing is boring, stealth is okay, and gunplay is kind of a Gears of War ripoff. It's REALLY annoying that taking cover and dodging are the same button because there are times I want to dodge and instead my character takes cover in the worst possible spot. It can be frustrating at times not knowing whether you're supposed to be watching a cutscene or performing a quick time event. If you've played Uncharted before, you know what to expect, but for me, this was my first time with the series and I was simultaneously impressed and disappointed.

Also, the Lost Legacy DLC is pretty trash from a story perspective. The villain is generic af, and the two female leads are unlikable and annoying. They essentially just act like (childish) men trying to constantly one-up each other and brag about how strong and independent they are. But I couldn't give a shit about them as people.

Having reached Chapter 12, At Sea, the game crashes to desktop at random points, at the very beginning of the level, between finding the arrows to entering the cave. It had worked flawlessly up to that chapter. All of the usual steps have been performed such as updating Windows, GPU drivers, verifying game files and reinstalling the game as well as clearing out any app data folders relating to the game. At this point I'm unable to progress with the story or the game.

In terms of graphics and game-play, the game looks stunning. Underwater scenes are very enjoyable, the volumetric lighting when underwater is fantastic. Great environment and very well built maps. The gun play and driving are awful, though I think this much is known from the Uncharted series. Guns have a weapon sway added that's very exaggerated. The free climbing is among the smoothest of games that have this mechanic, such as Dying Light.

Story wise, it does get extremely repetitive. While it has been enjoyable, I doubt I'd return to play it again (not that I can with the CTDs). The story can be summarised down to a basic formula of
- Let's find treasure and fight bad guys
- Arrive at destination of supposed treasure
- No treasure to be found
- Overcome with sadness, let's all decide to give up
- Suddenly, Nathan or somebody else realises it's a map or puzzle

Uncharted games were Sony’s exclusive games for PlayStation and were a business card for a long time. This series of games ruled sales for years. Uncharted Legacy of Thieves was released in October 2022-nd for PC is technically Uncharted 4: A thieves and, which has been released in 2016-th for PS4 and Uncharted: lost legacy (DLC) which has been released in 2017.

I haven’t played in any Uncharted, and as most PC gamers - was disappointed about part 4, without knowing what happened in previous parts. Uncharted Legacy of Thieves looks very similar to Shadow of the Tomb Raider - two games from the same genre with similar game mechanics. But while I was playing Uncharted I had a mind - so that’s how [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/harkozavr/recommended/750920/] Shadow of Tomb Raider used to look like (may see review by the link). [/url]

Most reviews don’t pay much attention to Lost Legacy, but I think it’s a big mistake. Because when you buy the game - you pay for both Uncharted 4 and DLC, and don’t have a chance to buy them separately. That’s why I will review both of them.

[h1] Main Plot [/h1]

[b] Uncharted 4 [/b]
The plot is fascinating, from first minutes I was interested in understanding what’s going on. The beginning is trinket, because first few hours of gameplay are made in three different time periods. Climax is very explicit, and plot denouement leaves positive feelings. The characters look alive and there is real chemistry between them all. After finishing the game, the main plot leaves some questions, which points scenario gaps, but overall you may just not pay attention.

Despite it’s the 4-th part, the plot is independent, I have seen only a few references to previous parts. In general, the game doesn’t tell you - ‘Go and play previous parts to understand what’s going on’, and it’s good.

[b] Uncharted Lost Legacy [/b]
The plot looks crumpled. The main aim showed in first 30 minutes, and if at this time you are not completely attentive, then the whole game would create a bunch of questions. But in general the game’s plot seems to be quite coherent.

This DLC has much more references to previous parts, because the main character is a big reference. And for players who haven’t played previous parts it may look taken out of context.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

In both parts gameplay is combination of cinematic cutscenes (which are done perfectly), solving puzzles, climbing ledges and hills, shooters and some QTE. Uncharted 4 is more shooter, while the DLC has much more puzzles in it. Both games are based on climbing mechanics, and personally I was not annoyed from them, the game switches to other game mechanics in a very timely manner and I was not tired from climbing even they are very similar to each other. Both games have really easy puzzles, while Uncharted 4 have only few, the DLC has much more of them.

Both games are linear, but they have locations which may look as open world. Uncharted 4 has few big locations, and I got lost on them, I can’t find the right path and constantly walked in circles. The Lost Legacy has only only one big location, but I had no such problems with lost, because game gave a map.

[h1] Bugs and problems [/h1]

To play uncharted and don’t have problems - you need to have a good PC. Uncharted has some problems with optimization, but they are not huge. You may see some bugs, while you play - the game may freeze and write ‘Downloading %’. When moving to new locations, the game does not constantly display the loading screen, but loading after a break takes a very long time.
For all the time I spent in the game (25 hours) - the game crashed only 5 times, and usually it was after I systematically died at the same level for several times.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Uncharted Legacy of thieves is a good game. Yes it’s not new, but is still very good. Both games have good main plot, good story telling and cinematic cutscenes. I spent 19 hours in Uncharted 4 and 8 hours in DLC, and I enjoyed both of them. While Uncharted 4 is really good, per contra DLC is not bad. If you are thinking what to play between Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Uncharted, then definitely go for Uncharted.",1676039635,1676039705,True,4,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

It's one of those wheeled carts that sits on railroad tracks, and you crank the lever and propel it forward. You get some nice scenery, but soon you're exhausted from cranking and are looking forward to getting to the end of the line. This is the handcar of games. You basically tap the same button and move along the rails and the characters make noises at you and you basically do the tedious work of performing out the role you've been assigned in this D movie. They know how bland this whole experience is, so they switch the button to do the one basic action occasionally just to annoy you.

I hated everything about this game. There was nothing redeeming about it. This like Tombraider is the work of people who want to make a movie, and the player is just there to suffer through it. Nathan Drake continually says things that are meaningless talking to himself. The cutscenes are painfully tedious and awkwardly slow. Then there's the in-game cutscenes you cannot skip, where you can't move for half a minute after it ends or you are forced to walk akingly slow and it lasts for a  minute or two sometimes until the game works out that the quasi-unskippable cutscene is over. I regret completing the first game in this collection just to get my moneys worth, if I had been able to get a refund I would have.

Devs please allow turning off Drake's boring rambling. Remove the slow walking. Make it so that you can skip the cutscenes and get a highlight of what you missed, so you don't have to sit through 20 minutes of low grade soap opera every 5 minutes. Cut the flashbacks, they are pointless make-work filler. For that matter cut this game back to 120 minutes and get rid of the filler. And then quit and move to hollywood to make the movies you really want to make because you secretly hate computer games.

in contrast to the story that only gets better, the game fell flat in endgame due to its very linear nature. climbing felt like a semi-QTE near the end since there is mostly only 1 way to progress rather than multiple ways like in earlier levels. additionally, controls are a bit janky imo cs every time you grab on a ledge they play a ""ledge-climbing"" animation which sometimes doesn't match the character's context.

If you want to take a break from 100+ endless grind games, then this game is for you.
I enjoyed this game visually. He is amazing. Optimization is also on the level. RX6800XT + Ryzen 5 3600x produces +60fps in 4K.
I also liked the plot, if we consider it from the point of view of adventure, which it is. The characters are memorable, the scenes are excellent. What else is needed?
The game gave me a great opportunity to relax.
But I can't say the same for the supplement. From a visual standpoint, it's also great. But here's the story... I didn't really like it. The motivation of the characters is not particularly disclosed and it was not very interesting to follow them. Maybe because I didn't know about them at all. Since I didn't go through the previous parts, I have no idea about Chloe at all. I have at least heard a little about Nathan, since he is the face of the series.
This leads to the following problem. They did not port the old parts, justifying themselves with the quality of the graphics. Very believable.
But if to summarize and not to go into the wilds of the gameplay, then I'm satisfied with the game.

(I only played to the end of chapter 5 so review based on this)

Graphics are fantastic (this shouldn't be a massive plus point, this is a AAA game in 2022 that costs £45, it's the expected) and the story is decent if not slightly predictable. The cinematic events look great, although given the game is about 80% cinematic cutscenes they should look great.

Controls are absolute trash. Given the amount of time you spend jumping to ledges it blows my mind you have to press the button once to jump and then again to climb up - either 'hold' the button when jumping to climb up automatically or push the joystick forward is a feature games discovered 10+ years ago, so why it was omitted in a game featuring so much climbing is mind blowing. Of course get to with in 3ft of the edge of a ledge and the game is more than happy to auto jump down. Default controls are just odd - 'X' is reload for every other game in the world, why not this one?

For the hand to hand combat there is no 'counter' or 'reverse' for strikes. You just have to roll, like some kind of idiot, around and around - it looks stupid and breaks immersion. How a AAA game in this day and age doesn't have such basic functionality is beyond me and there's no game play reason not to have it. The scenes where a ledge slightly crumbles or a beam creaks doesn't add any suspense to the game because you know that you have zero control over it - if you're hanging out a window and the ledge crumbles slightly you know it won't break because if it did you'd fall to your death as you don't have control outside the QTE prompts.

As I said at the start, this is an interactive movie loaded with QTE's, scripted events and scenarios designed to make you feel like you're doing something but really you have very little impact on what's going on. This feels more like another AAA game that's more interested in going 'we can make this in to a film and/or TV series!' instead of being a fun game with interesting gameplay and mechanics.",1675903009,1675903009,False,2,2,0.490783393383026123,0,True,False,False

I mean, what a game. I had the chance to play the first 3 parts of Uncharted on my PS3 back in the day and when a 4th one came out on PS4 I was kind of sad because I really loved the serial, but realistically I was never gonna buy a PS4. Few years later and I cannot believe that it came out on PC and let me tell you I was not disappointed at all. Everything about this game is amazing, the story, the characters, the adrenaline rush that you get by advancing through the chapters and the best thing about it all is the mystery, what are you gonna find and what is gonna happen next. The lost legacy part although being ""much shorter"" then ""A thief's end"" it is also quite amazing. This game is simply amazing and there is nobody in the world who can tell me to not recommend this game to everyone else. I recently played God of War and wrote on the review of it that it is also an amazing game, but honestly if you told me to pick between this and God of War, I would pick Uncharted any way of the week. No disrespect to God of War as it is also an amazing game, but for me this one just is a tiny little bit better, or in other words more fun.

* Uncharted 4: A Thiefs End
	- With a great yet mostly predictable story it's saved by the cast being backed by some of the best MoCap and voice talents I have seen in a long time. With typical Sony picturesque environments with no expense spared. Many of the issues stealing away a perfect rating from this game boil down to the shifty port for the PC; Many key binds are either not bindable or are locked together to one key, and platforming (which you do a lot of) is made annoying as there is no auto climb feature or W key auto climb so every move you are required to hit the jump key making the overall experience tiresome, coupled with a few missing standards on pc such as exclusive fullscreen meaning if you have a screen saver or auto sleep enabled you better keep your mouse moving during cutscenes, No ability to disable motion blur or adjust FOV without editing a CFG file and a few crashes and the occasional bird flying backward. Other than that the game is an all-around fantastic entry for the franchise that I highly recommend you experience especially if the idea of a Tomb raider meets Pirates of the Caribbean story sounds enticing to you. I hope Sony keeps bringing console exclusives over to PC but with maybe a little extra polish next time. Horizon: Forbidden West would be a dream come true!
	
Uncharted: Lost Legacy
	- While a subtle departure from Nathan Drake's story you assume the role of a familiar Chloe Frazer and follow her along on her journey to recover an ancient horn within a temple located somewhere in the Western Ghats mountain range. While this title does not stray too far from Uncharted 4's mechanics it does introduce a few new weapons along with a small yet satisfying lock-picking mini-game used throughout your time as Chloe Frazer. This title does slightly stray away from the overuse of climbing for more mesmerizing set pieces, combined with its shorter story and grand finale ending it's a perfect example of a proper expansion to an already amazing franchise. Who knows what else is on the horizon for the Uncharted IP?

Graphics 
I’ll split this into two parts ;

A Thief’s End is an older title and subsequently undergoes the most in terms of technology enhancements. For the most part, this is done extremely well, 4K, HDR, DLSS, RTX and extremely high res textures make this game look absolutely fantastic. The most stunning thing is the epic landscapes that Nathan find himself scaling - the mountains particularly where awesome. However this title had quite a lot of bugs and artefacts. The thunder in the opening sequence was awful, and many times I had shadow texture issues. Restarts helped but this really broke the immersion 

The Lost Legacy was made more recently and it’s immediately noticeable , there is far more detail within the world and characters. Though both leverage the same technologies, the Lost Legacy performed without a hitch and I only had 1 crash through my whole play through 

The games both do a wonderful job telling of the adventures of Chloe Frazer and Nathan Drake- from jungles, to ruins, mountains to cities - each is insanely detailed and immersive. Ultra wide support and high frame rate make these titles gorgeous to play. Each character is equally detailed and well animated 

Story 

Both stories are incredibly rich with detail, I preferred the tale of Nathan, I found the adventure more organic and unpredictable. Intertwined is the backstory of Sam, Nathan’s brother and their childhood. 

The Lost Legacy is much shorter and perhaps there wasn’t the time to fill in all the backstory- but I hope more of Chloe’s history is told on a future port. 

A thief’s End follows Nathan as he tries to find the treasure of Captain Henry Avery, a legendary pirate from long ago. The story closely follows Nathan’s adventure but also his personal relationship with his girlfriend and brother - the development of the characters is organic and rich in detail. 

Gameplay 

Both adventures bring together the climbing from Assassins creed and the combat from Tomb Raider. The Lost Legacy also steals some of Laura Croft’s attitude and hunger for the unknown. It’s impossible to play and not think of the epic Tomb Raider franchise 

The combat is basic, but no less fun. Many times I restarted a section just to see if I could do it silently - but I’ll save you hassle , there are only a handful of achievements that reward you for this (so check in advance!) 

There are no upgrades or character perks, instead the game throws the occasional QuickTime event and you have to mash “y” or “a”

The game really focussed on story and doesn’t overcomplicate what it wants to be. Both games want to tell an amazing story - and use the combat and QuickTime events to break up the movie experience 

Music

The music is good but not the best I’ve experienced in a AAA title. Generally the design is there to follow suit, but the games wants you to focus on the character, the dialogue and the adventure. So music swells with combat, it’s soft during emotional moment s - but it’s not extraordinary 

SFX js superb, the guns felt loud- the grenades really did go BOOM! But one thing I did notice is the effort to add detail (in the sound) in the different landscapes. Different types of birds and animals tweeted and squawked in the temples while the clatter of the machinery was audible as Nathan flew from corner of the world to another in the clattered out plane. 

The team did a great job pushing the immersion through this- and makes Uncharted 4 truly one of the best titles PlayStation titles to hit PC in the last few years",1675544567,1675544567,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its great game and in this collection you will get two of them.

UNCHARTED 4: A Thief’s End
Its great story driven game. To be fair, story is not what will gets you.
Im mean story is just clasic chase for treasure against the bad guy. Nothing new.
But the combination of story, gameplay and locations is what the game makes great and definitely worth of playing.
Game looks great, my only con is controls. Sometimes feel pretty clunky. During shootouts, whitch are totaly arcade, when youre trying get to cover, character leap to covers you dont want to and expose you.

UNCHARTED: The Lost Legacy
Graphics, controls totaly same nothing new. 
You will play different characters.
At start I felt like this is short and sloppy copy of some assasin creed and tomb rider and uncharted itself.
But further in the game, the game itself gets much better and there is much more action and tension.
Probably at the end I have much more fun then in previus game.
Only what I dont understand is why the characters have the same equipment as Drake.
Maybe devs could tell us some little story how they get it or at least change it little bit. 
I understand that if they change the hook for ice axe it will looks too much like tomb rider.

Overall totaly worth it

You have some absolutely fantastic platforming bits between the story and combat. The combat is a weak afterthought, but works fine; nothing special. The story... I found terribly boring. Very cliche villains trying to foil our hero's quest to find ancient pirate gold. Whoopdy-doo. GOLD.

Look at RDR2 for instance: a large driving force of that story is also gold. However.... RDR2's story is actually compelling.

You feel like you're stuck in molasses mid-fight, and you'll simply be ignored if you press a button at the wrong time mid-animation, such as a roll, and there's no acknowledgement of the input. He stops running at random times so you feel like you're also being ignored in that regard too.

Aiming on M+K does not feel good. The aim keeps shifting to the left, because it does a subtle transition to where you were aiming prior to ADSing, so at the start of the ADS you subconsciously notice that the crosshair is to the right and begin adjusting, and then it's suddenly to the left after the ADS animation completes because of that. Really confusing.

Early on you're presented with forced stealth sections that last almost two hours. Then it throws you into a giant gunfight where the only way out is through the door the enemies come through (in multiple waves). So you just have to try getting through hoards of enemies without any challenging gunfights prior to that. Way to work up to it. 

The AI is unremarkable, and I've been shot through solid walls a couple times. Often companions will spout of stuff like ""I don't think it's this way"" or something, but at the wrong times, and it often just confuses you further when you were actually on the right track.

I played the first two games, and they felt FAR better than this does. 

Please stop sacrificing gameplay for the sake of realistic but unresponsive animations. It's almost as bad as RDR2.

I wish I could get a refund for this. That's just how much I hate it.",1675232920,1675232920,False,2,0,0.486785471439361572,0,True,False,False

If you like the Indiana Jones films and the Tomb Raider games you’ll love these. This is yet another great console port from Sony, I highly recommend you give them a go. 
After completing both games in the collection several times on my PC I booted the game up on my Steam Deck. Unfortunately the game cannot maintain a stable 30fps on medium settings with FSR set to balanced. Sadly, despite the verified setting on Steam I can’t recommend anyone play the game on Valve’s handheld. 
I’d also like to point out that this is indeed the 4th and 5th mainline game in a narrative driven franchise. You’ll be shortchanging yourself if you start here without playing Uncharted 1-3 first. Shame on you Sony for holding back the original trilogy. Uncharted 1-3 were remastered and released on PS4 and are fully playable on PS5. I played them recently and they still hold up, particularly at 4K. Yes, they’re not quite as pretty as 4 and Lost Legacy but they’re far from unplayable. Give Steam players the chance to experience these games on the platform of their choice!

Controls are not smooth at all, where movement sometimes does not register at all or do what you want.
Some interactions (for example with treasures) are not simplified for PC.

Pathfinding through levels is horrible since there is no minimap or clear route you need to traverse through.
With that said it is tedious to find treasures without the use of a guide, and even with the guide you are wasting quite  some time looking up the places.

Game did not really offer anything new or innovating compared to the previes games.

Actually I did say it loud a bunch of time while playing. 
Let's start with the graphics, it's ok, quite pretty looking but there some glitches here and there (like Nathan headless for instance). 
The controls are awful, it's clearly meant to be played with a controller, like a 10yo kid, but real gamer (hi yakuza ^^), those playing with keyboard and mouse, will feel heavy pain with this. 
The story is quite deep and pleasant, BUT, the PACE is horrific. You alternate between moment of pure FPS (badly done, very badly done, please do not try to make a fps), stealth mode (badly done too, please, forget about it, it's stupid to see your buddy running* in front of enemy and not being spotted, and anyway when after 30 minutes of stealth when you see you must clear the area whatever, you understand the stealth part is just to make you lose time) and exploration. 
I want to be clear, I bought this game because I thought it was mostly exploration. It's not. You are even incitate NOT to explore area, if you start looking everywhere your partner will start to press you and the game will ask you if you want some hint, in case you didn't understand the only linear pathway you must follow ... When I see how few people got the achievement for 50 treasures (and there's more than 100 in the game) I understand nobody play the exploration part. Too bad. 
Puzzles are childish, you don't have to think about anything more than 2 seconds. And there's only 2 puzzles in the game, so yeah, the fun exploration part is to forget. 
So to be back to the pace thing, it's simple: you explore (and it's slow, Nathan cannot run and speak at the same time or when he found an item, he cannot find an item when one is peaking to him too, so you have to wait ages for the blabla to end before moving on, it's boring) and you hide and you fight and you speak, so you have moment of intense action and moment of very very very endless scripted dialog. 
Pace is awful and the game is boring. The bro' robbering part is the worst by the way.
Speaking of brother, I never wanted so badly a npc to die. I think that game is ruined by the fact that you are (almost) always with this moron. 
Before my conclusion, I want to add that the saving is useless. When you load your save, it will bring you at the latest saving checkpoint (it shows that the console to PC port is very poorly done)
Well, huge disappointment, I've been waiting to play this game since it was on PSX, and now that Sony agreed to release on real platform, it's a failure :/

Interior locations run fine, as does looking straight up at the sky, but the game doesn't take place up there.  Framerate suffers massively when looking towards larger areas full of objects, and [in my opinion] necessitates playing with a controller in order to feel less jarring.  Note that I do have DLSS enabled and have done my due diligence tinkering with graphical settings.  Oh, and you're limited to windowed and borderless windowed; no fullscreen.

In-game cutscenes are rife with animation bugs that are reminiscent of cyberpunk at launch.  Characters will rapidly switch from their intended choreography to frozen-in-place, psuedo T-pose positions, before snapping back to normal.

The climbing gets pretty boring, it feels like being is a long cutscene at times.

Let's clear out one thing this review is not negative because of the bad quality of the port because it is mentioned by 90% of the users how frequent crashes are and the T posing in the cutscenes time to time and so on. It is only and only for the gameplay and the story.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
I played this game on hardest difficulty and I tell you what, don't do it. The combat and stealth mechanism in this game is absolutely garbage and very mediocore. The enemies are bullet sponge and your insane recoil with very limited ammo available makes it impossible to win the forced firefights out of cover which 90% of the covers in this game are breakable and in most missions it is a scripted fight where you can only shoot without being able to move to cover.

Another issue with the level/game design is you are forced to repeat the same thing over and over and over again in every chapter. 90% of the game is climbing simulator and trust me people, every time you assist your AI teammate to jump from somewhere or climb from somewhere expect that there is a cutscene where the platform falls and your character falls down and has to find a different route. I Am not joking this happens all the time to the point it gets extremely frustrating and predictable, I had a friend sitting by me and I told her let's make a bet this is where you help Sam or Elena to jump then the roof/platform/bridge breaks and Nathan has to find a different route. It is not a joke if I tell you this happens like 8 times in a row in just one chapter.

The chapters are way too long and way too boring, if you want my advice only play the game in explorer mode. The combat is nothing special to miss it.

Also I know that Tomb Raider reboot is copy paste of Uncharted but that game is actually much more interesting than this one because you are not forced to climb the same mountain in different skins for like 2 hours straight just to trigger a cutscene. The enemies are all same in this game, Sniper + RPG + Heavy trooper + Normal enemies with grenades and cars. Nothing changes in their tactics, it is just the same formula over and over again and a very mediocore boss fight at the end which tried to be a downgraded MGS 2 Raiden vs Solidus copy paste.

[h1] Story and Characters [/h1]
When I heard the hype about Naughty Dog story telling I couldn't wait to play this game and check it out for the story. But GOD, how annoying how cheap and how cheesy it is... The characters are bunch of lame jokers with zero passion or empathy or character development. Anything happens and all of them make a joke about it... Please, look at Mortal Kombat, a fighting game where story is not even the focus, only one character is the joker (Johnny Cage) and rest of the mare serious people. There is personality and variation there but in Uncharted you could easily swap Nathan with any other guy in the game even the villains and nothing would change.

Another thing that really annoyed me is the ""Plot Armour"", it is there for all characters who are good. You just know nothing will happen to them ""just because"". They get caught in explosion? It is fine they gonna walk out with a ""joke"". They are under heavy fire? No worries they have a joke in their sleeve to say. They thought they lost one guy? Nah no no no he is just playing dead to joke. This should be called Fast and Furious clone... cause guess what there is ""family"" in this one too, oh and every second a surprise brother or wife suddenly spawns somewhere.

Another seriously annoying thing is that you end up solving 1000 death traps + puzzles + clues just to open one door but then the bad guys are already there without a breach, so why on earth Sam and Nathan are even needed to be alive when they just get where these two stupid ones have to solve 100000 puzzles to get inside while for enemy it is ""just because we are here before you""?

And one thing I don't understand this Shoreline with all these modern technology and everything, couldn't they just get a helicopter and land on the treasure spot which was not even in a closed space????

One serious plot hole is Sam lies to Nathan about his escape and gets him into all the trouble and when Nathan finds out about it absolutely nothing happens when they encounter each other. It is like ""whatever"" even after all the things he was about to lose. Have you guys who rate this game super high played any Splinter Cell game? In Conviction when Sam Fisher finds out about the lie which actually SAVED him and not put him in danger unlike Uncharted, he goes emotional like a legend he reacts like a real human being (watch it on YouTube). And when I see those games with such magnificent story telling are not even mentioned and some PS Exclusive garbage is all over the place being praised for a super mediocore writing it just goes on my nervous.

Just to make you understand what you are going to watch in the story, imagine Toy Story 4 where Sam is Forky and everyone else is Woody. You know how bad that film was? That is literally Uncharted 4 story, one guy loves to go into trouble and others insist on saving him for his stupidity.

I don't know maybe I have lost my taste but I grew up with games like Brothers in Arms + Metal Gear Solid 1-2-3 + All old Tom Clancy titles + Max Payne + Old Tomb Raider games and many other legendary titles which were Story Rich. How is this garbage even considered as a masterpiece when gameplay has no quality and story is one absolute piece of misery?

Come on people where is your standards? Don't praise everything they throw at you just because it is over hyped in the magazine and media. The result is other companies literally copy pasting it because of the ""hype sale"" and Tomb raider reboot is the fruit of what we get, a lost identity game one after another.

The thing why i don't recommend getting the PC version is because of the following issues:

- You cannot set the resolution of the game under the current resolution your display in set at, however you can change the render resolution but DLSS block that and as well DLSS is broken in a way to where instead of increasing the performance of the game all it does is help the fps drop not happen as much but still happen even when its rendering the game at a lower resolution automatically,

- Even if i lower the graphics settings to medium or even low the game still is poorly optimized to even handle it in lower graphic settings.

- You cannot change the resolution to a lower resolution (not render resolution) below your displays output ratio unless your in windowed mode and once you do and change it back to full screen the game will revert your changes and go back to what your display outputs.",1674343920,1674343920,False,3,2,0.512448132038116455,0,True,False,False

The game is basically split in three: climbing, stealth and combat. Climbing is forgettable, hold W and mash space, if you've played assassin's creed for a minute you've seen everything this game has to offer here.

Stealth is ruined by the laziness of the devs to decide to code reactive AI instead of laid-out movement patterns, which means AI is unpredictable (and stupid) and will get into situations such as walking into each other and effectively having a 360° fov to spot you. You also get no silenced weapons, meaning you have to take down every target in stealth. This is obviously not feasible because the AI will spot you because of the aforementioned lack of movement pattern, and this leads into combat.

Combat basically ticks every bad PC FPS box that was ironed out in the last decade : abusive AI movement (get flanked while being suppressed, can't shoot while ducked behind cover), tanky AI (headshots barely matter an hour into the game bc I guess helmets make you impervious to rifle rounds?), inaccuracy and aim punch. It is a more optimal solution to go for bodyshots as the AI will punish you with aim punch the second you go for headshots, meaning the only viable strategy is to spam grenades and hose down enemies with body shots.

It doesn't help that the level design for those areas was meant for stealth (but the AI wasn't... go figure) so there is no progression to make through cover. If you move you die, all weapons are hitscan, and enemies spam grenades with perfect accuracy.

If you weren't yet deterred by the gameplay being abysmal whatever way you look at it, this would be a good moment to point out that half the game is cutscenes, a small portion of which you're forced to play through while having no bearings on what's happening. When you force me into fight scenes where each punch is scripted to miss, I stop playing. I guess you should've skipped the game trilogy and made a movie from the get go if you're so hell bent on making a game without gameplay.

As for the story it's exceptionally mundane, a series of bait and switch go-there-wait-no, with one-dimensional characters with zero progression and introspection. Think Indiana Jones but without spielberg and harrison ford. I guess the actors make do with the shitty dialogue they're handed.

I have always been a PC game player, but the quality of Sony Play Station original games like this is outstanding.

What an amazing Experience, I think PC gaming is a waste of money, NVIDIA is destroying PC gaming with their prices.
One thing I have noticed is Play Station exclusive games have always been top quality.

[h1] 1) Pro's: [/h1]
- Beautiful landscapes and areas (I really mean it, it's crazy!)
- Hooking story with interesting character building
- Cool puzzles
- Mostly fun platforming
- Mostly bug free
- Game is just the right length
- Going stealth on enemy encounters is really fun and satisfying

[h1] 2) Con's: [/h1]
- Missions are a bit repetitive
- Platforming is sometimes really janky (I've fallen off cliffs and died more than once which is hella annoying. It also messed up some of my enemy encounters -> when I tried to go stealth e.g.)
- I would've preferred if in the Lost Legacy the enemies would've spoken in their language as well instead of accented English -> it was like that in A Thiefs Legacy with the guards and locals

[h1] 3) Controversial Point: [/h1]
Although the puzzles were a bit difficult sometimes, I really liked the challenge. There was one puzzle though I just couldn't solve without a guide and when I found out how you could've solved it I still considered it way too hard (without spoilering it was the Ganesh Puzzle)

[h1] 4) Conclusion: [/h1]
All in all it's a really fun game and if you like Tomb Raider you'll definitely enjoy this one. Graphics are pretty up to date and considering it's a PC Port it's pretty stable. I had a bit of a hard time getting hooked in the beginning but after around 4-5 hours I really got into it. ""The Lost Legacy"" picks up a bit faster but I recommend you play ""A Thiefs End"" first. It takes around 14h + 6h = 20 hours to go through both parts whilst focusing mainly on the story. For the content the 50 bucks is worth it.

The game is beautiful yes a technical marvel, there is a reason why game devs seek out the gdc articles on rendering techniques in this game because every frame looks amazing. The game runs smooth and has no lag or slow down on my machine.

The problem is the story presents nothing new and since these days thats all this game can really lean on it shouldn't be released as an uncomplete story. We got the ending, and not even the best escapades of Nathan Drake. Ive never owned a playstation or played any of the other uncharted games, but hearing about his exploits in 4 just made me sad that i couldn't play them, they definitely seem like better stories and better achievements than in this. 

Which is why im at a loss, i didn't hate this game but.. i wasn't blown away either. I could see the story beats coming from a mile off so nothing was that surprising. After hearing playstation fan boys boasting about this title for so long i was looking forward to playing through these now infamous titles. But felt mostly let down.

It's a bit linear, puzzles are easy and there are no inventories/skills, but the jaw-dropping locations, the movie-like chats and the super-entertaining gun fights balance the flaws in a very well-paced manner.

I remember being in an awful and toxic relationship, living in some horrendous apartment and having no job. I would live off cereal and weighed about 9 stone. I had to borrow money for electric and gas and couldn't even afford a haircut with a dog ripping my clothes up because it was untrained which I wore whenever I went outside. You know what was there for me? Uncharted 4. I would turn the TV on mute, put my headphones on so it wouldn't wake up my partner as she would scream at me for being awake past midnight and I would go through each and every mission on this game fully immersed and living an amazing life within the story of Nathan Drake, this good looking dude on an adventure with his brother and his friend/father figure Sully. It was truly amazing and it will always hold a good place in my library and its just as good playing it now as it was back then.

As for Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, it felt strange. No Nathan Drake, just the serious Nadine Ross and the cocky Chloe Frazer. It was an interesting story and I suppose in a way, Uncharted doesn't have to have Nate to make it what it is but I still felt like it was missing something all the way through. If anything, it feels like an expansive DLC to Uncharted 4 with only one crash and a few minor glitches so the port wasn't too bad to play. I'd give this collection a try when it's on sale as it really is worth playing. Thank you for reading and enjoy your day!",1672986477,1673533721,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

A Thief’s End is the main game with about 10 to 15 hours of playtime and The Lost Legacy with about 5 to 8 hours. Even though the games originally came out a few years ago they still hold up again any new game and are definably worth the purchase.

Both games have a great story with related characters and a good dose of humor. The gameplay is both enjoyable and challenging without being too hard to the point of being too stressful. On Explorer difficulty, you can cruise through the game enjoying the game's story without too much worry about dying. While on crushing difficulty you will be challenged and die lots, but with a few tries and some learning the enemy’s ways you can work your way through without feeling like it’s completely impossible. The graphics in both games are amazing, although I think The Lost Legacy is slightly better. I found myself getting distracted by the beauty and then realizing I didn’t hear anything the characters were just saying. Even better, they both support Ultrawide, Super Ultrawide, and HDR.

I went into them expecting something like Tomb Raider and while they are similar, they are better. It’s hard to say why but I enjoyed them more than the Tomb Raider games and want to play them again even though I have already played them a few times. One of only a few games I’ve liked enough to get 100% of the achievements. Absolutely worth the buy, Get it! If you are worried, stick it on your wish list and get it on sale, but Get it!

TL;DR Fantastic games with great a story, graphics, and gameplay. Get it. If you’re unsure then get it on sale, but get it. You won’t regret it.",1673514267,1673517339,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Having played previous Uncharted games, I know I’ll be in for a joyride with this. Pokémon sort of side tracked me at the moment, so I’ll savor this experience a bit while I wait two years for FF7 Rebirth (RIP). If you’re a fan of Tomb Raider, then Uncharted will enthrall you, especially on higher resolutions with either good headphones or surround sound. I can’t say how long the gameplay is yet, but for the asking price or on a sale, I’d say it’s worth a buy.

I would like to add one thing though. Having the opportunity to reflect on this thus far, I wish Naughty Dog would focus more on bringing back and/or expanding on their older IPs. In my personal opinion, Last of Us 2 was nowhere near as good as the first, but even then, regardless, Last of Us in general as a series paled in comparison to Uncharted and Jak and Daxter. I’ll gladly hope and wait for the Uncharted Collection to come to PC. Maybe one day we can even get to experience the fabled Jak 4.

Anyway, if you like adventure platformers, I’d say this game is definitely worth checking out. You don’t necessarily need to have played the originals to be able to enjoy it either.",1673501466,1673501638,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Uncharted 4
The good: Very good graphics.
The bad: I don't like Nathan Drake. in 2016 we should have the possibility to choose at least between Nathan and Elena, since there is no customization of the character. Another thing that bothers me is that it seems like I'm just following the game instead of playing it. It is too noticeable that there is only one route to follow. The story of the pirates a little too worn, Goonies. The final sword fight is pathetic. It's long, tedious and I'm not in control of anything. The combat is really embarrassing and the end of the game disappointing.

Legacy of Thieves

The good: Stunning graphics, incredible landscapes and scenery. Chloe  and Nadine are great. The dialogues, the chemistry between this two girls, everything between them makes the game fun and enjoyable. In general Legacy of Thieves is an incredible evolution of Uncharted 4

The Bad: It is noticeable that Sony's puritanism has stopped the lesbian relationship, Not final kiss. No epilogue the two women living together as the happy family like Nathan and Elena and the daughter. Sad that we can naturally see series like Willow on the Disney Channel that breaks with archaic clichés and that Sony is so far back in time. 

Same as in Uncharted 4 it seems like I'm just following the game instead of playing it. Worst of all... The fight at the end. Street Fighter 1987 has more mobility and player control than this game.

Conclusion: Either this saga is modernized in gameplay and freedom for the player, or I don't think I'll buy the next title in the saga.",1673424326,1673424743,False,1,1,0.448735624551773071,0,True,False,False

The whole thing fell pretty flat, I didn't find any of the characters likeable, the plot was pretty predictable and repetitive  and there were a lot of logic problems/questionable decisions made by characters that seemed to contradict themselves. There was nothing special about the locations and the whole pirate treasure hunt just wasn't interesting to me, not to mention you could see the ending coming from a mile off. Possibly a lot of it missed the mark for me because I don't have the investment of the previous games, but it didn't feel like I was missing anything. 

I will gives this a thumbs up though for Lost Legacy, which was brilliant. Chloe and Nadine make a fun team and while I don't think either of them would have been great solo (Chloe annoyed me to begin with and Nadine was super annoying in Thieve's End) their banter and camaraderie together is way more fun than anything in Thieve's End. The story is better, the locations and mythology much more interesting, it's better paced and has a much more satisfying conclusion.

For those new to the series, I recommend for playthrough #1, don't worry about being pro, just get the full uninterrupted experience. Play this game on easy and enjoy the story and beat most everything in the first go. It's like playing through a 6 hour interactive movie. The puzzles are the same on all difficulties. Gunfights are dramatically improved on PC with M+K controls, but still have some serious difficulty spikes on higher difficulties that will break your momentum and the flow of the narrative as you figure out how you're being killed.

This is one of the first games I've played on my new-ish OLED TV, and I have to say for a game that first wowed me on the base ps4, the visuals are still just simply stunning. Certainly not the most technically advanced in terms of ray-tracing and next gen features. But, the game closes this gap with such varied, vibrant and well-realized game worlds you can't help but gawk and look around everytime you reach an elevated surface.

Worth mentioning - Audiophiles out there will love the high dynamic range options...talk about realistic. I had to condense the range because the maximum was just too jarring. Folks looking for more immersion will love that, though.

As for the two included games: Uncharted 4 can stand on its own for folks unfamiliar with the series, but could have benefitted from a little more background/recap. Legacy really surprised me the first time I played it - I enjoyed it as thoroughly as the other Uncharted adventures. Getting both of these on deep discount feels like robbery, even if the combined runtime is only 25 hours. This is a game that, if you enjoy, you'll revisit every now and then...there's just nothing quite like it in my experience.

In the end, this is just a fun, non-threatening adventure game that I find I keep coming back to for a particular brand of harmless and comforting escapism. Recommended thoroughly if you just want to kick back and enjoy a cool story and locations.

The story is interesting and the characters are very well written and voice acted. The graphics are great, obviously, and the settings are truly stunning, no matter where in the game you are. The gameplay is very nice and smooth, no matter if you're just walking around exploring or if you're in a firefight, and I love the fact that you can approach situations from different perspectives.

Minor glitches here and there but nothing at all that's game breaking or that really affects the gameplay in any way. The only critique I have is the jumping; it feels very poorly thought out for a game that relies so heavily on jumping and climbing. There's no problem when it comes to calculating your jump and the trajectory, I almost always landed where I predicted, but it felt and looked very unreal when jumping to grab a cliff or a mountain. It's like the physics engine was a bit off during those sections, which again is very odd considering the amount of jumping and climbing. Again, nothing game breaking but just a minor detail I felt odd.

All in all, I highly recommend the game if you like story driven adventure games. It's very good!

This is the absolute best video game I have ever played, toppling even [b]The Last of Us[/b] and [b]Horizon Zero Dawn[/b]. Wikipedia was right. The writing, cinematics, and directing are unbelievable. Even the chapter names are clever and have carefully thought out meanings. I can’t begin to imagine how much time and resources they spent on the script to have made it this rich and seamless. It was able to hit all emotions: excitement, humour, sadness, shock, guilt, horror, disgust, elation, anger, curiosity, the whole spectrum. I can go on and on about it, but just as with the many people who have experienced this game, I am lost for words how incredible it is in every facet. Even listening to the soundtrack brings me back to experience it again in memory.

[h1]The Lost Legacy[/h1]

This one could not match the main game. It is in a ballpark…in another state. The impressive storytelling, dialog, and character relationships are absent from this DLC. We are back to a regular old game that doesn’t take anything too seriously. The storyline is something that has been done a million times before with cartoonish elements. I wish they never made this DLC because I feel that it sours the lasting memory of [b]A Thief’s End[/b]. [b]The Lost Legacy[/b] isn’t a bad game per se, but [b]A Thief’s End[/b] set the bar really high, and by being associated to it as its successor without meeting or exceeding this bar, it just makes me sad that it had to end on a low note.",1672524519,1673182060,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On the opposite side, gameplay, at least for me, isn’t that great, game requires climbing here and there, some stealth, some action moments, in both games there are mini open-world maps with additional things to do, but nothing excited. I can’t say that gameplay is bad, but it feels a bit, generic, if I can say so. Tomb Rider (2013) was better for me for sure in terms of gameplay. 

First game is about hunting the pirate treasure, I like pirates, their ships and overall era of sailing ships. But game was a bit overlong for me, so I’ve liked a Lost Legacy more. It’s a more linear type of game, with less climbing, more interesting puzzles and Indian culture and mythology seems fresh and interesting, girls did a great job while voice casting characters too.

And a word about achievements. While playing both games without guides, just casually you will hardly get more than 30 out of 101 achievements, a lot of them are required some weird stuff to do. Not a big deal anyway, just for you to be aware of. 

To sum up, strong 7.5/10 from me

P.S. Sony, bring Ghost of Tsushima to PC! I’ve already bought too much of your games on Steam anyway xd

Haven't completed the story yet but will update my review when I'm done.

EDIT: Finished Uncharted 4 : F****ng hell what an amazing game! Story was incredible and is told so well. Was like playing a movie. Easily one of my fave story's Iv played through recently. Hooked from start to finish. 10/10 A MUST PLAY 

Finished Lost Legacy. Was a nice spin off from the series which had some very cool moments and great story. Was Quite a bit shorter than the main game but was well worth the play through. 7/10.

Sony please release the trilogy for PC next. I don't care about visual upgrades i just need to play it! :D",1672453405,1673049521,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Uncharted legacy of the thieves collection is a well made game in the sense of how it functions as an linear , chapter based, treasure hunt game. the graphics are good (as you would expect). the music is decent. the story ... well it could have been better, there was certainly some questionable moments and times where the game just wanted to be longer for the sake of being longer. but over it was good enough to keep you engaged.
The design and immersiveness are the stars of the game, the game seem to incentivise a lot of stealth but the mechanics don't really work for a stealth game (no distraction, no silenced weapons etc.....). The best moments of the game are the car chasings. you just feel like you are watching an action movie in theater and its done very well (overall action scenes in this game are impressive). 
If you just want to have some action fun game with a lot of puzzles (sometimes enviromental puzzles) as side things. you will enjoy it. its a 7 year old game however, i dont know if you pay full price for it.",1673043847,1673043847,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Plays like Tomb Raider, but doesn't take itself seriously (which is a big plus, I always found it super-annoying about the TR series) and has a lot of dumb dialogue (in an endearing kind of way) and the offroad open-world sections are really fun to drive across. Stealth is really bad though, so don't even try that. Has various vehicles throughout the game and lots and lots of climbing (too much IMO).

Kinda wish there was more stuff in the city setting though, I gotta say - I got a bit fed up with the jungle towards the end.

One thing people sometimes mention is the characters. I have to say I really don't understand that. I didn't find any of the characters interesting, even though I enjoyed their brainless banter and dumb jokes. Overall as long as you don't take the game more seriously than it takes itself, I think it's a really good product. But it does make me wonder how good is the ROI on projects like this, when you can seemingly milk the tasteless teenagers for hundreds of millions with some shitty MMO Battle Royale.

Long story short: aside from improved graphics, we've got pretty much the same we had before in parts 2 and 3.  And that inclues both the good and the bad from the series.

What is good:
- nicely directed scenes throughout the game such as that one when you got dragged behind the truck on you rope while shooting back;
- graphics, especially facial annimations
- optimization (but you should adjust the game right in the first place - therefore this thing will be mentioned in the bad things too)
- fun arenas where you need to eliminate a number of enemies using stealth or shoot-them-all aproach
- still charismatic and fun main protagonist

What is bad:
- The gameplay is quite repetitieve overall: walking - solving a puzzle - cleaning up small arena with bunch of thugs - repeat;
- At some point the scripted episodes when something breaks or fall apart while you're climbing, jumping onto, or just passing by really starts to become rather annoying
- The story is just ok. Enough to keep you going but it was always (meaning throughout the series) falling short of being really captivating and touching adventure. 
- The amount of climbing. I know that's one of the key things of the series but it was way too much. 
- Optimization. Here I had my struggle in a way that often in the middle of the game I was having my fps drop and never go back. That, after lots of googling, was eventually fixed when I started to run the game from under Steam's big picture (which had lower bearable resolution for my system).

To sum up, despite all the downsides and the fact that I couldn't finish the Lost Legacy add-on due to those same repetitive things, I'd still recommend this as you won't get any better adventure game at the moment (new Lara was similar and took inspiration form the Uncharted, but still not quite there) and if you haven't played previous episides - this might be quite enterntaining.

The game is great: a wonderful cinematic action game, no need to spend more words. Fun, dynamic, accessible but not exceedingly easy or ""guided"", and eye popping.

But... the Windows conversion is crap. I have an i7 with 32 GB of RAM, an M2 SSD, an RTX 3070 card. And while the framerate is good, and graphics are great, there are several instances where this game (even on the latest patch) has audio stuttering, especially severe in action sequences, that completely ruins the experience. The programmers clearly don't know how to make a PC conversion: I have played several MUCH heavier games that run flawlessly. Uncharted on the other hand is not particularly heavy: CPU and GPU stay at reasonable occupation levels, while maintaining steady 60 fps effortlessly. The absurd thing is that, in spite of this, the audio stutters, crackles, stumbles, has microfreezes whenever there's a lot of action going around. As if the developers had no idea on how to manage latency and audiovisual streams (I  am a programmer, so I know what I am talking about), and I see that many others with powerful machines have the same issues. Both CPU and GPU still have power to spare, and yet the game in certain situation is very stuttery.

And, add injury to the offense, the game is GREEDY. With 32 GBs of RAM, I had my system set to use only 4 GBs of virtual memory. You would expect a PS4 game to be perfectly satisfied with 32+4 GBs of memory, right? WRONG. At a certain point (market scene) it miserably crashes ""because of not enough virtual memory"". The crash is solved by letting Windows 10 freely manage virtual memory, resulting in a 20 GB pagefile. This is the first time such a thing has happened to me, and a further sign of AWFUL, lazy, ridiculous coding skills.

So, I repeat: great game, awful porting. Stay away until fixed.

As the title describes, the game is a collection, there’re two different ‘projects’ under the same title in the game with different directors directing the stories. One’s called ‘ A Thief’s End’ which is an adventure of seeking legendary pirate’s treasure with Nathan Drake being the protagonist in the story. The other one is called’ The Lost Legacy’ which is based on Indian mythology, the protagonist in this journey is Chole Frazer. Despite ‘the Two’ have some certain casts appearing in both campaigns, the two protagonists: Nathan and Chole will never bump into each other because it’s not the same story with a different time. Moreover, the gameplay also differs, A Thief’s End is a linear campaign with 60% focusing on gunplay, hand-to hand combat, 40% with exploration the environment such as climbing, puzzle solving, item collecting, etc. The Lost Legacy is a mixture of open world and linear(point to point) adventure that giving you a chance to spend more time on exploring the world they’ve crafted with side missions, complex puzzles, collectibles etc. The gunplay and battles in the other hand, are less heavier, less often.

OK, now we’re clear about the different concepts of the campaigns, let’s talk about them with my own insights. I am being completely honest to say, when I did A Thief’s End, I wasn’t planning writing a review for it at all simply I wasn’t impressed. Why? Despite the game delivers stunning visuals, cinematic cut-scenes, they’re triple A standard, no question here. However, A Thief’s End, had a very disappointing story right from the start, ‘Seeking a pirate treasure’(I don’t go to the point beyond this, spoilers free review). Believe me, as a 30+ years old full-grown man, I’ve at least heard & watched & played more than couples of similar stuffs from radio programs to films and video games, though the details could be different, the idea itself isn’t original. It will be quite hard to impress me by this idea I’ve known pretty too well. I had my gut feeling at the start and it failed as I guessed. What’s worse? Compare to Chole Frazer, Nathan was pretty boring to me ( sorry boys) for the most of time. If this wasn’t enough, in his story, certain characters’ certain decisions and actions they’ve done, I found it’s difficult to acknowledge. Can’t go with the detail, in short, the story was a big letdown. The gameplay is linear, it wasn’t the problem bothering me, the real problem is: the game’s very repetitive aside from sightseeing, all you do is reaching to a place, found a clue, fighting some enemies in a frequent bases. Once short objective was reached, repeating the process in a different place. I’d only recommend this game (if it were A Thief’s End alone), to players who enjoying sightseeing(a beast rig is a must to achieve this goal), gun-fighting, cinematic visuals. Unfortunately, this is not my definition of a magnificent game should be. In quite the opposite, they can simply design a pixel graphic game with some original creative ideas with a well-written story that could easily win my recommendation, none triple A standard were required. On the contrary, all these eyes candies were bring together with a dull story is like talking to a beautiful woman with a boring soul, I don’t think she will keep my attention on her for long, so it was the same with Nathan’s adventure.

The ultimate fact that alternatively changed my mind to write a recommendation for Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is Chole Frazier’s story alone: The Lost Legacy. I must say, girls have done an excellent job this time than boys had. 1st, as I mentioned a little above, her campaign is based on Indian mythology with directors’ own visions of creativity. The idea itself is very original, I’ve never heard nor seen a sophisticate story of this in the first place. I’ve searched my memories, in Tomb Raider III, Lara Croft went to Indian jungle, but aside from some fights and minimum sightseeing, nothing deep down to the mythology or Indian culture itself, nothing in comparison. In TR Underworld, Lara went to Thailand, despite sharing some similar landscapes like South-East Asia mountains, jungles, Buddha(Shiva)statues, again, barely scratched anything under the surface of Buddhism or Indian mythology. The Lost Legacy however, have done it terrifically, not only with the excellent storytelling, but also the amazing landscape to travel around. 2nd, compare to Nathan Drake, Chole Frazer is a much more interesting protagonist to play with, I enjoyed her British accent which woke some good memories of my old days, with a sense of her dark humor, characteristic personality, she was nothing short of fun to tag along. Just as she said,’ no one is perfect’, the good and bad thing she had done, made her ‘a real person’ who walked into my heart in her own way. She reminds me of Catherine Zeta Jones’ performance in the film: Entrapment, though the subjects were not the same. When a game somehow managed to establish a link connecting my real life events, I would no longer treat it as if it were someone else’s story, it undoubtedly got my full attention now. 3rd, gameplay-wise speaking, unlike A Thief’s End, The Lost Legacy approached players by a different path: by encouraging players to explore the world with some clever design’s help, the game came together as a whole new world to adventure. For example, by completing some certain side missions which will reward you ‘an easy way’ to find all the missable treasures scattering across the land. While in ATE, all 100+ treasures have no hints,  it’s impossible to find them all on your first run unless you have a guide at hand. E.g. Reducing repetitive combat which weren’t much creative room there to work with. Instead, focusing on well-crafted puzzles that take some serious time to study with then solve. These examples showed the development team does seem to take some time experimenting if they were players, what would be fun to do in the game? (When you design some hidden treasures in the game, you don’t want players eventually couldn’t find them, do you?) Little by little, this was what makes the difference in the end. 4th, I could even say, A Lost Legacy has done better than any piece of new Tomb Raider Trilogy had done. It’s a quite difficult compliment to earn. Especially comes from someone who have played TR first, not the other way around due to Sony’s delusion of what exclusives could have brought to them. 

But one thing A Thief’s End did better than The Lost Legacy is: it has few crashing issues for the entire long game and none of them are game-breaking. TLL in the other hand, have some serious issues I have to mention here as a fare warning. It crashes to desktop so often, literally in the 2nd half of the game, every water scenarios, it would crash for unknown reason. Some of them are close to game- breaking because they did happen in the same spots multiple times in a row which almost stuck me from progressing the story. This is a red flag no kidding. I have a high-end PC, 4K unlimited FPS with Render Scale set to 180%, I have no idea what kind of advanced setting inside could have caused this, likely, the problem is not on my end. Look, I am not saying crash issues definitely will happen to you too, but just in case, there’s a potential risk here if you ended up purchasing this game right now. Just keep this in mind. Well, it doesn’t affect my purchase decision by now since I have already completed the game, but it will do for my future orders from Sony: e.g I won’t buy The Last of Us Part.1 in advance knowing full well from the same studio, I could experience the same issue which ultimately could break my game if I were not so lucky next time. I surely have no desire to take the risk.",1672834597,1672834597,True,87,6,0.715893924236297607,18,True,False,False

Writting feels is a bit better than TR. dialogue and jokes etc . Tomb Raider does get locations a little better as far as feeling grandiouse .

I have not played the 5th part ""thief's end"" but so far the 4th one is good and offers a great variarity of vehicles to drive.

One area this game could be improved on is fighting enemies. it seems like every single encounter is the same. with just some degree of variation of elevations and stuff but if you are playing this on anything but hard you can problaly just rambo everything without much tought hence i recommend playing it on ""Hard"" to at least force you to try to think some stealth to weaken the enemy forces before engaging.

Driving the jeep is fun . the boat does not guide realistically as the boat should only turn when accelerating . it is a shame when they miss details like this because it would be a good chance to teach kids and people in general that boats do not turn like cars do.

Locations are nice and graphics are incredible of course. you can tell the developer put a lot of effort on detail like when the character walks around and feels around walls and the way he interacts with his environment. 

One are where this game is better than Tomb Raider is having an AI companion most of the time, the conversations are fun and witty and the characters do a great deal of helping each other.

But on the other side I get it how the protagonist is able to perform all this parkour moves and hang from cliffs and jump huge distances and so is the brother since they are both dare devils but where it is a little ridiculous is how the enemies can do the same jumps as the protagonist with some even carrying heavy armor and weapons it takes away from the protagonist prowess as an acrobat when the enemies and even his wife can do the same jumps .

I still feel Tomb Raider is better but a small margin. This game won't send Lara Croft packing by any means but if you are a fan of these types of games you will enjoy this one.

Also I appreciate that Play station is releasing exclusives to PC gamers to enjoy.

This game gets two reviews
One being all the lame runs you MUST do to get cheevs
and 
One being not worrying about them

First off, Id like to NOT thank the community for their guides.
They are terrible, out of order and in no way helped.
In fact the  guides led astray.

So this game has so many achievements and collectibles in the lamest of Bioware locations
this FORCES users even good players to use GUIDES
this makes you BREAK the immersion.

Oh ok so lets alt tab to this guide every 2-5 min 
BARF
then the game has an achievement to play the WHOLE game again and beat it in 6hrs or less
why? to pad play time, there is no other reason.
Then hardest difficulty  for no real reason

I cant recommend this game for that reason 
if you are a cheev hunter you WILL NOT enjoy the game, at all
you will be stuck in an loop of OH what did I miss, where is it.
And GL finding a guide, the two up are terrible, and not in order of obtaining them hugs thumbs down to this community for copy and pasting PS walkthroughs into steam

SO 
If you want these 2 games in 1 
DONT THINK cheevs at all
just play, enjoy the game and you will notice its only about 7 hrs long
thats it
its a great story with terrible acting, in a good way.
I actually cried during a crash on the couch with the wife. RIP mine.

So as a person who loves games, not gfx I want to point out
this game is UGLY
not pretty
its ps4 to ps5 to pc
the port is so so, but the gfx are abhorrent. 
Everything looks 720p even on the highest settings
same thing happened to God of War, I was able to mend that, but no.. not these two games nope
Also they are using false dx12 and false 4k
its not real people. its just form fitting the screen

I am TIRED of ports that claim 2-4k and people think yep ITS 4k! no no its not
if it was the game would be about 9 times bigger just for all the textures and a dlc would be there for 4k textures

A few ports have this  saying HD textures YOU MUST HAVE 11GB VRAM to use!
wow..
11gb vram, we all have that right?
3070ti here, and no I dont have that.

So if you want to enjoy the games, just play
have fun  dont worry about bs just enjoy the game. 
Dont alt tab ONCE to find x y z
it kills the vibe

you will find in less than 10 hrs both games are beat and then you sit with head in hands going, do I really need to play BOTH of these 3 MORE times just for cheevs

thats up to you 
me hell nah I not even finishing the games, they hurt my head  and no not the good kind

hugs 
here is hoping for less mind aches from pointless cheevs
here is also hoping for real gfx not false lies of them

A Thiefs End = Holy fudging fudge this game is incredibly good with a truly amazing story. It´s emotional, funny dialogs, epic fights, and just amazing voice acting. Puzzles were fine, not so many and not so complex that i want to remember the first game had amazing puzzles but it was many years ago i played the game. This Libertalia island... is the only wrong thing in this game... that place being that size and having bizzarly large mansions was just the wrong route to go in my opinion but i get it... if people are going to be bored with wooden shacks and huts...but still the director didnt have to go overboard which they did.

A Thiefs End is a masterpiece without a doubt. I didnt know how long it would take to play the game, so there was a bunch of times where i thought i was now at the end of the game and finding out that i was wrong.. i lost count how many times i thought that this would be the last chapter and boy i was glad everytime i was wrong cuz every new journey was a blast to play. Last game i played before A Thiefs End was God of War and which one has the better story? A Thiefs End story is much better than god of war, its miles away better.
........................
The Lost Legacy on the the other hand delivers a decent story, and by that i mean that the story does not give you a spark, a reason, a purpose to why you should go and want to go on this treasure hunt. Its feels like the beginning of the story has been cut from the game and it drops you in the near end of the game. But the story itself is enjoyable, good and satisfying from the beginning to the end. The later half of the game is alot more fun to play than the first half of the game.
Puzzles were just a few but a lot more complex and fun than previous game. Train fight was a blast, voice acting was decent and it sure had funny dialogs like A Thiefs End.",1672518693,1672518693,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

* Boring writing. This might (unfortunately) be as good as AAA game writing gets, but you're still left with a derivative plot, generic characters, and a narrative that makes little sense. The story beats are tropey and completely predictable, and most of the ""witty banter"" is just lame jokes. If we were judging this by movie standards, the writing would not even be on the level of a Michael Bay script.
* Extreme ludonarrative dissonance. All the protagonists are mass murderers. In dialogue, they seem dismayed at killing, and yet when they mow down waves of enemies, they just laugh it off and continue as if the entire area were not littered with corpses. You just can't go for movie-style writing while also having arcade shooter gameplay. It's completely looney and immersion-breaking.
* Poor legibility. The game leans too hard into realism, and as a result, critical game cues such as where a handhold is, or whether you're in cover, are difficult to read. It's also not always clear where you're supposed to be going, save for some vague instructions given in dialogue. (But don't mistake this for non-linearity: the game will often block backtracking with little warning.)
* Arbitrary fencing. See that pool of water a few feet down? Jump in it and you'll instantly die, even though you've been to that area before, because you passed through an invisible gate.
* Too much emphasis on being cinematic. There are several sections in the game where you're being chased by something that can kill you in a few seconds. It's supposed to be intense, but it ends up just being frustrating: partly because it's not always clear where you're supposed to go, partly because you sometimes HAVE to die to know that you can't go somewhere, and partly because the camera often ENDS UP FACING YOU in these sections. Who thought this was fun?
* Psychic enemies. As soon as you're discovered, everyone immediately knows where you are, making stealth gameplay frustrating. Enemies also have unrealistically excellent aim, especially with grenades. (Some enemy chucked a grenade 5 stories up and landed it at my feet.)
* Frustrating combat (on Hard). Magic grenades, spongey enemies, Nate constantly picking the wrong cover or grabbing the wrong handhold, bullets magically going through cover, perfect enemy aim even when you're swinging through the air. (What's even the point of those hookholds? All they do is get you killed.) I'd attribute a good quarter of my deaths to poor controls or Nate randomly doing something stupid.
* Offensively simple puzzles. This is ""square block in square hole"" level stuff. I never had a eureka moment for any of them, just annoyance at the grunt work I'd have to do to get to the next section.
* Ridiculous companion behavior. Your buddies will routinely run into enemy line of sight without them noticing. Nobody ever bothers to shoot or even follow them. They are seemingly incapable of hitting anything. Why are they even there? (There's a chase scene where one of my companions is under direct fire for about 5 minutes without a scratch. I almost had to laugh.)
* Pointless exploration. Sometimes, you'll find a shiny trinket hidden in a cave. That's about it.

This game reminds me why I invest so much time in indie games. Uncharted is shiny on the surface, but ultimately soulless, and the fact that critics gush over it points to the immaturity of gaming as an artistic medium.

EDIT: The epilogue was really well done. I just wish the rest of the game was up to that standard.",1672401564,1672487428,False,3,0,0.508077859878540039,0,True,False,False

There definitely is the linearity and the mechanisms to keep the game moving, but it's not like characters are spamming hints at you incessantly. The dialog is well done, it does not insult the player's intelligence making them feel like the lowest common denominator too much (I mean it's still like that don't get me wrong, just not nearly as bad as other games). The puzzles are also medium/low on difficulty. Still triple A fodder puzzles, but not awful or anger inducing, and good looking enough to make you not get bored too badly before they're over.

The set pieces are what make the game worth it, however. The insane, over the top action moments after long periods of calm are a real spectacle and an impressive feat in game development. You can feel the millions of dollars that were put into producing this stuff. That makes it worth it to play, just to see what's possible in this medium. The limits are constantly pushed, insane situations you thought were already teetering on the brink get cranked up to levels you did not expect to be reachable; it just keeps pushing.

My review was originally just a generated review but instead I decided to write a actually legit review off my experience with this magnificent collection

My Settings & What I played on 

I played on my default PC with a GTX 1660 Ti and a i7-9770k with 16gigs of DDR4 2666mhz ram

my settings in-game were all ULTRA with Enhanced Models turned on. I did have my Texture Quality to MEDIUM, the game was totally playable on all ULTRA except there was significant frame drops in huge open areas going to 40 to 50s FPS with my textures on MEDIUM I had 60+ FPS almost threw out the entire game.


GAME-PLAY 

The game play was very enjoyable I loved the parkour and the grappling hook the best parts were scaling the huge cliffs or the huge building such as the clock tower or the tower in Libertalia that collapses, it also has some great screenshot worth views (check my screenshot s to see!)

The game is also enhanced coming from PS4 so it ultimately looks WAAAYY better than what is looked like on there I wouldn't recommenced playing it on a low end pc cause part of the game is how good it looks

There is also quite a but of gunfights with shoreline, the game also features a variety of weapons and enemy types such as Juggernauts which you see later in the game

the Fist fighting is also pretty fun, gunplay is nothing special is kinda like your typical third person shooter with cover mechanics, BUT some areas have grapple spots where you can swing around and shoot enemies or jump onto them for a take down. the stealth mechanics are also great, i never really had a encounter where a enemy seen me out of nowhere

LENGTH

the game is quite long, it can take up to 15 hours to beat Uncharted 4, especially if you take your time and not rush through it. it also does have some pretty difficult puzzles with captain avery, and clues which you can find from notes that you put in your journal. 

BUGS

I never had any significant game breaking bugs except a lot of texture issues, a few of my sesions the textures bugged out on the character models and would have icons all over them or even change them a different color completely. the wind physics hitting clothes would also bug out causing them to freak out 

PRICE

the game is quite expensive especially considering it is just 2 campaign games, no multiplayer or nothing. I'd say wait for a good sale to pick this up instead of spending a full $60 


Overall I enjoyed the game A LOT and recommend it :)",1672207781,1672464136,True,1,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,False

I'm also happy to say it runs perfectly on Valve's Proton Compatibility layer in linux on my System76 Oryx Pro. The story in Uncharted 4 is very emotional. I was so excited to play this after my fond memories of the first game on my launch ""phat"" PS3 back in the day, that I borrowed my brother's PS4 and played through all of the original trilogy in anticipation for this game. While its not a requirement (each uncharted story can stand on its own) it did give extra emotional depth to the characters and the story. I'm honestly unsure why Sony brought the 4th and 5th games to steam without the original trilogy - but I'm still glad they did regardless. A fantastic masterpiece.

I played with mouse and keyboard and that worked better than I expected. The game looks great, most of the locations are awesome. The story is solid and so are the characters. Gameplay is fun; climbing and slinging I enjoyed the most, puzzles were not not too hard to figure out and fit in very well. 

Stealth and combat both are nothing special, but at least they add some variety. 

I'm mostly not a fan of quicktime events, but they were not super frustrating. Unfortunatly the game is very liniar, so there is not much replay value for me. Maybe in a few years I'll revisit this game again.

So Uncharted was a good game for me, I'm glad I bought it (on discount) and I enjoyed my time playing it very much.

While the overall game, story, sounds, music, etc. is good - the game is also from 2016 and that is obvious in many aspects of the graphics, for example.

But my main grievance with this port is the controls (I only used keyboard&mouse, never tried controller).
Moving within versus out of cover is seriously annoying and error-prone and will leave you frustrated in many of the more challenging combat scenarios. Especially from Sony, there have been many ports with much better controls - this here is very much sub-standard.

If you care about such things, there is another negative point: the collectibles - this whole aspect of the game has not seen much care at all. Going after collectibles leaves you feeling very unrewarded.

Runs and looks good enough on Steamdeck. Two things to keep in mind, when you start the game:
- There are two games that you can choose to start in the main menu: ""Uncharted 4: Thieves End"" or ""Uncharted: Legacy"". I looked up which to play first and generally saw people recommend starting with Uncharted 4 because it has the backstory for Legacy and makes more sense that way.
- After you choose ""Thieves End"", the first time you run the game, you need to let the game compile shaders. There is a little loading percent indicator which says ""Building Shaders"". Just wait about 15 minutes for this to complete. Make a coffee or something, while this one-time setup is happening and be patient. Do not click around the menu, looking for a way to skip this. 

The game is totally worth the huge 120 GB install size and 15 minute wait on first-time setup. The graphics, gameplay, voice acting and massive amount of content are simply top-tier. If you have a decent PC to play this, get it. If it's on sale, it's a steal and you will fit right in with the thieves ;-)",1671974294,1671974294,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sadly the game feels like watching a movie but worse. The game-play and pacing is painfully slow, interrupted with very long and oftentimes boring cut-scenes and it's also extremely linear.

Also…all of these Uncharted characters have some serious upper body strength.  

Uncharted 4: What a fantastic game. The story was deep and actually really engaging. The one downfall to the game is the repetitiveness to some of the gameplay. It was fun to climb around but at the end of the day you’re doing that for the majority of the time. There was a few times that the game stuttered but it wasn’t a big deal. Definitely an 8/10 game for me. 

Uncharted Legacy of Thieves: Well this was a game. Everything about this game felt really dull. The story was shallow, game play overly repetitive and the characters were just kind of meh. It’s still an uncharted game at the end of the day but not so much centered around the story as it is the gameplay.

Basically Tomb Raider but with worse stealth and gunplay. You destroy magical ancient ruins with the believability level of dwemer ruins. Naughty Dog decided that a good setting would be having a fictional version of the indian army who are depicted with outdated gear (india is the top 3rd country by total military spending) who are fighting some cartoonishly evil ""rebels"". Idk why they thought making some fictional Kashmir conflict was a good idea but here we go. The gameplay loop consists mostly of destroying ancient indian ruins, solving insanly ridiculous puzzles, fighting rebels with awkward gunplay and then driving to the next location. To it's credit, it doesnt pretend like this is archeology like Tomb Raider does.

-Quick Time Events need too go to hell already
-End boss fight and escape was annoying. Ending cutscene was worth it though.
-Lost Legacy has interesting and pretty annoying puzzles some of the time.
-Full or limited data collection aka spyware
-Water Quality could be way better. I have issues with it.Just looks out of place mostly.
-Can't skip ending credits. You can block credits with the steam browser until it's over.
-End boss fight might be cool with some people. I didn't like it and felt the end boss cheats a lot
-Can only choose skins after you have done one playthrough
-Building shaders each time you start the game again. Same annoying process that Horizon Zero Dawn had.
-Video signal corruption in some areas (since I've had a bad hdmi port before. I will need to look into this while using displayport now. Perhaps more than one connection port is bad.)
-Have to complete the game to unlock items: Model gallery, Journal, Highest difficulty etc
-Button presses seem to have issues. Need a new keyboard to test if it's just the one I am using. Corsair keyboards suck.

The ambitious end to a long running franchise, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a very fascinating game.
The gunplay is enjoyable, the puzzles are decent and the humor is pretty good, there are some hilarious character interactions.

The story though, isn't very deep but I liked the darker approach and the flashbacks, it's interesting enough to keep you playing, and it really makes you care for the characters.

Exploration works decently, but it could've been better, there are documents you can read or find collectibles. The open area in Madagascar was one of the best parts of the game in my opinion, the car handles very well and the driving feels phenomenal.

Lastly, climbing is a very big part of the game, and even though the climbing mechanics are very smooth, I really had to force myself to enjoy it some times, and I wish there was less of it.

The action sequences are easily the best thing about this game, some jaw-dropping set-pieces keep you on the edge of your seat.

Uncharted 4 is the definition of a ""Movie Videogame"".
It's absolutely gorgeous, the cinematography is outstanding, the performances are fantastic and the soundtrack fits well, but gameplay-wise it's just... exhausting, not because of the controls or the gunplay, but because of the hand-holding and the linearity.

Uncharted the Lost Legacy:

Uncharted the Lost Legacy is proof that Uncharted can great even without Nathan Drake. The Lost Legacy is essentially just more Uncharted 4, it's something like a stand-alone expansion, and a good one at that.

Honestly, I am surprised, I enjoyed this more than I expected. Even though the gameplay is more of the same, there's less climbing, and the fact that the game is relatively short is mostly a positive.

The game rarely feels repetitive, every puzzle is different from each other, and there is also an open area in the middle of the game where you can explore, which was implemented very well.

As for Chloe and Nadine, they make a pretty nice duo, where's Chloe is likeable and a goofball, Nadine is the opposite, she's aggressive and focuses on her mission. I liked their chemistry and I think both characters work very well together.

And now for the negatives, the story isn't necessarily bad, it's just very generic and there are no stakes. Also, in my personal opinion, the biggest flaw the game has is that there are barely any highlights in it, almost no action except from the last chapter, which is a complete letdown considering how the action is literally the best part about this series.

Overall it's very solid, and for its size it's definitely worth checking out, a great stand-alone expansion.

Conclusion:

Thank you Sony! Both games runs surprisingly well and overall very fun games. Uncharted 2 is still my favorite tho, but i'm happy to see Uncharted 4 and the Lost Legacy finally on PC, Uncharted 1,2,3 when?",1671226777,1671226958,True,133,2,0.861096858978271484,0,True,False,False

Really high attention to detail, but without vision. The gameplay is lacking severely. I came into this expecting a Tombraider III like experience. However I found a lackluster set of gravel slide sections that railroad you into a beautiful key scene of a level just to be tumbled along with endless `press forward to advance` climbing parts. I really liked `thier house` from the beginning of the game, yet you spend so little time there that I wonder how the developers could have justified detailing it to this high degree - it must've been advertising. Now that I am typing it, that little Crash Bandicoot intro couldn't describe this game in any better way.
You're running along the path, doing your little spin attack, not knowing exactly why you're there. Then you jump a little.

Honestly these games are perfect or p damn close imo, at least within their own scopes that is, but I think it would make more sense to review the port itself than anything else as I don't know if it's worth to talk about the (however year old) game itself necessarily. I think overall the port is pretty good, the download itself is just huge which is irritating but the performance and such or mostly alright, my PC is now a few years or so old and performance isn't necessarily the best but it's understandable, and considering it performed well enough, definitely better than it did on the PS4, I can't really complain. Something interesting that happened while I was playing through is that this is one of the few games where playing through with a controller would have been easier, which is really quite surprising to me as it's really not often at all where that happens, hell I'd say the other PS ports I've played on PC felt fairly natural in terms of controls on keyboard/mouse, it's still playable with keyboard/mouse, but no haptic feedback and the more binary nature of mouse/keyboard can feel like they make things harder, but I don't think that's a fault of the port, it's just how it is.

In my opinion this is undoubtedly the best Uncharted game in the series not just because of the superior graphics but also the story and gameplay. I may be biased because this was the first game I played in the series but I have now also completed the second and third games and while impressive for being on the PS3, they do not come close to rivaling Uncharted 4. 

With the power of the PS4, this game has larger areas. There is a lot to explore and with the stunning locations and attention to detail, this is a joy. There are notes to be found throughout the game which expand the world and present stories outside of the main story. The gameplay also benefits from the larger areas and allows for multiple paths to reach the same end goal. The areas are also more three dimensional and the grapple hook is a welcome addition. 

Most importantly I had the most fun playing this game hands down. The addition of the alert indicator on enemies and being able to mark enemies makes stealth a very viable and fun option in a lot of areas and is very satisfying to pull off. The guns feel much better in this game compared to the previous games and the controls feel very natural and easy. 

The story is both thrilling and heartfelt, the characters feel very real and everyone's motivations are clear. These are all lovable characters. The main villain isn't overly macho and ""villainy"" and even his motivations also provoke some sympathy. There is good female representation here as well. The dialogue throughout the game is witty and fun.

The pacing of the game is great. A good balance between exploring, climbing and encounters with enemies. The puzzles are quite simple and straight forward but feel fun. There are some epic set pieces but that are still grounded in reality. Some sequences really makes this feel like playing a very good action/adventure film. The ""supernatural"" element was left out of this game, which I thought was a welcome choice. There is more focus on character development instead. The story felt more realistic but at the same time extraordinary. 

The music is great. A mixture of epic orchestral music but also some tender emotional moments as well. 

Acting, voice acting all superb and natural. 

From beginning to end this is an absolute joy to play. A truly epic adventure with a very satisfying ending. Would highly recommend this to anyone!",1670836600,1670836600,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The main game actually runs quite well.  So I do recommend this game for Steam Deck as long as you’re aware Lost Legacy runs pretty bad compared to Uncharted 4 on the Steam Deck for some reason.  You can actually run the game at full 720P in the main game on Steam Deck, Lost Legacy is more like 540P, it’s a big difference in frame rate and visuals.  Something to keep in mind.

Edit:  Actually you can run DSR, if you set the desktop resolution to your target resolution using a PC DSR resolution setting and not an HDTV setting.  There is also a resolution scaling option allowing you to render up to 8K apparently, basically rendering the DSR option somewhat redundant.  This is all stuff that was added after launch, kinda wish I had waited to play the game at this point.
On a side note, this game as listed as Steam Deck ready.  I installed it on my Steam Deck and checked it out and the performance is horrendous.  I mean, I don't know who optimized the settings for this game because they need to be fired.  Whoever set up the games settings has the game running sub 30 FPS using an FSR setting.  You can actually go in and using the resolution scaling setting set a lower than 720P resolution that will maintain at least 30 FPS, but the experience is horrible.  You can barely tell what you're looking at everything is so blurry from running such a low resolution.  I don't recommend this game for Steam Deck at all.  Personally I only really play mostly older games that run very well on the Steam Deck.
Performance wise with a 4090 and up to 8K resolution, the 4090 can play the game at 8K max settings around 40 FPS, at 7K roughly, you can get closer to 60 FPS.  I'm running G Sync so even in the mid 50's it's very smooth.

So much better than especially the PS4 and PS5 version.  I was trying to play the PS5 version on the fidelity graphics option, but the horrendous frame rate just made it unenjoyable.  I'm currently running an RTX 4090 on stock settings and it's running the game at 4K 120 FPS with plenty of room to spare, about 80% GPU utilization on average.  However there are areas of the game where it does dip into the low 100's.
But, you pretty much need a 4090 to play this game at a solid 4K120.  I upgraded from a 3090 and I'm guessing you'll probably get around 90-100 FPS with a 3090 at 4K most of the time.  It is so nice to get the maximum quality from this game with the smoothness of 120 FPS, it's still is a great looking game, runs really well.  I'm currently playing it with an Xbox 1 controller, but you can't change the control scheme for some reason.  I would like to get reload mapped to X instead of Y.  One of the major issues I have with this game is there is no full screen mode, same as Final Fantasy 7 Remake for PC if you've played that.  There is a borderless fullscreen mode and a windowed mode.  So you're stuck at whatever your monitors native resolution is, no DSR if that's a feature you were hoping to use, I was.  I was hoping to play the game at a higher resolution at 60 FPS.  I was hoping there would be support for Dolby Atmos, I thought the PS5 version had that, but I guess I was mistaken, there is no option for it in the menu.  Or at least it's not labeled Atmos, it just says sound field.
As a game, yeah, this game is great, you should definitely check it out if you're into Tomb Raider style games.  For the PC version 9 out of 10, lacks a few features.  Why there is no fullscreen option is just strange to me.  I have run into a few bugs with characters getting stuck in walls or not progressing a quest.  Fortunately the game has tons of checkpoints and returning to one usually only costs you a few minutes.",1666222160,1670472322,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1670369093,1670369093,True,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Good 
- amazing graphics
- amazing story
- amazing game play

bad
- fps drops ALOT especially in the forest area.

Uncharted: lost legacy:

Good
- refined mechanics - if you like U4, you'll like this as well. They also added lock picking and different weapons.
- beautiful sceneries

Bad:
- story sucks ALOT - continuous talks about how there are barely any women in this industry (treasure hunting and mercs)
         - only good thing is when they input about females in history, which actually makes sense.
         - Who thought it was a good idea to have Nadine, who was a villain in U4 to be a protag in this?? 
         - Nadine complains so much. Like How they are trying to do something she didnt like. Lady, you're a 
            merc. We dont need to explain everything to you, to do your job.
         - Chloe, says she's in the wrong for not ""telling"" her. Which is also WTH? She's still getting a cut of the 
           prize, why are you feeling sorry and why do you need her? She isnt even pulling her part anymore. You 
           (me) is doing all the work anyway! She doesnt even know history nor can she provide any more mercs.

As you can tell i hate Legacy's story. 
@edit: i have finished legacy and good god its horrible story. Good thing they only made this for 9 chapters because i cannot play this any longer.

- gameplay is easy to learn (at least the parqour is easier than in Tomb Raider). I play with M&K, never been fan of any controllers
- voice acting and music - top notch

This isn't a bad game, but it IS the most overrated game I've ever played. The graphics are great and the story is solid enough to keep you interested. There are some pretty impressive set pieces, but the gameplay and level design feel like they got ripped straight out of a PS2 game. Walk here. Shoot some guys. Repeat. They could have at least added some variety to the combat in some way but it's literally just shooting and tossing grenades with nothing at all to spice things up. It feels so basic and dated. The traversal is boring as sin. Climbing is slow and boils down to just holding up while mashing the jump button. It's awful. There is no way to even fall. It is literally impossible, you cant even jump off mid way through a climbing section. In the 5 hours i played, the only puzzle i did was pushing a crate like 10 feet to jump to a ledge.

Uncover the thrilling cinematic storytelling and the largest blockbuster action set pieces in the UNCHARTED franchise, packed with all the wit, cunning, and over-the-top moments of the beloved thieves – Nathan Drake and Chloe Frazer.

Visual:

One thing I will say about this game is visually, this is so insane that you will fall in love with the game environment. Every location in this game was extremely eye soothing and beautiful.  The level design was too good. Huge shout out to NAUGHTY DOG for delivering us the insane visual in this game. 

Gameplay:

Now Let's talk about the gameplay. In both games, gameplay was fun. You can stealth your way or go guns blazing. Puzzle's were too good. Every puzzle was unique and fun. Had so much fun solving those puzzles. Loved the cinematic action-packed gameplay also.

Story: (Uncharted 4) On the hunt for Captain Henry Avery’s long-lost treasure, Sam and Drake set off to find Libertalia, the pirate utopia deep in the forests of Madagascar – leading to a journey around the globe through jungle isles, far-flung cities, and snow capped peaks on the search for Avery’s fortune.

Lost Legacy - In order to recover an ancient artifact and keep it out of the hands of a ruthless warmonger, Chloe Frazer must enlist the aid of renowned mercenary Nadine Ross and venture to India’s Western Ghats to locate the Golden Tusk of Ganesh. On Chloe’s greatest journey yet, she must confront her past and decide what she’s willing to sacrifice to forge her own legacy.

Conclusion:

Overall enjoyed the story on both games. But highly recommended to play the Uncharted Trilogy before playing this one. I played the first two on emulator and the third one was unplayable, so I watched it on Youtube for the story. Hopefully ND will bring the trilogy to PC in the near future.

The PC port is smooth. Played smoothly on my rig.

Final Verdict: 

Lastly, The achievements are fun. You can perfect this game if you have patience. I am a fan of the action-adventure genre, so as a Tomb Raider Fan this game is a must-play.

+ Good Story
+ Insane Visual
+ Insane Level Design
+ Fun Combat
+ Interesting Puzzles
+ Good Port
+ Fun Achievements

There are some problems with very obvious shadow and environment LOD changes. I've seen shadows go from smooth to blocky messes at very close distances.

Camera movement has a lot of stutter due to in game vsync not working. Forcing Vsync on in Nvidia Control Panel mostly fixes the camera issues, but if you just spin the camera round with a controller or make big mouse movements it still occasionally stutters.

The game is just amazing!!!
Please, [u][b]PlayStation/Naughty Dog LLC/Iron Galaxy Studios[/b][/u] take my money and give me [b]UNCHARTED™ 1,2,3,4[/b] :D
But back to the [b]Uncharted: LEGACY OF THIEVES COLLECTION[/b], title that came out is amazing, please just get more games like this and if there is ever a Continuation/sequel to the series coming out [b]UNCHARTED™[/b] then I'm already looking forward to it. If anyone ever wonders if it's worth spending money on the Games series [b]UNCHARTED™[/b] then you don't even have to think about it, this series is worth any money. And if anyone thinks otherwise they're stupid :D
[b]UNCHARTED™ 4: A THIEF’S END[/b]; I played this title for the first time. The story of [u]Nathan Drake[/u] and [u]Sam[/u] It drew me in incredibly I will not write much so as not to give away their story, because if someone were to read this review and I could write a great deal about this game with in turn I would be betraying some part of its History and believe me it will be better to play it for yourself and feel that atmosphere, see those wonderful graphics, those realistic lighting and that one of the best done Stories and I might even be tempted to write not one of the best, and frankly in my opinion the best game I've ever managed to play in my life, and I'm already preparing for the next pass. One more thing I have to admit that [i]Naughty Dog[/i] knows how to play on our emotions perfectly. And I regret that I did not have the opportunity to play its previous parts ☹
[b]UNCHARTED™ THE LOST LEGACY[/b]: The story of [u]Chloe Frazer[/u] and [u]Nadine Ross[/u] also in part, [u]Sam's[/u] story is also wonderfully crafted. The game is simply beautiful, The landscapes of the Western Ghats are somewhat associated with the picturesque views of Madagascar from ""four"". Of course, there was also no shortage of truly cinematic scene direction, which gives the gameplay the right amount of momentum. Especially during chilling chases and action scenes. By the game's closing scenes one feels like clapping standing up from admiration. So is the story of [b]Chloe[/b] and [b]Nadine[/b] worth exploring? Fans of the series certainly know the answer, which in their case is ""YES"". The rest of the players need to keep in mind that while we are still dealing with a technical masterpiece, in terms of narrative and gameplay the game does not match the quality of the excellent [b]UNCHARTED™ 4[/b], but it is also a great game. Still, especially considering the price, this is a title worth reaching for if you are looking for a simple and entertaining adventure. All the more so because the package is exceedingly complete, because investing in the [b]Lost Legacy[/b] you will also receive in the set the entire content of the network mode from ""[u]four[/u]"" along with the latest patches.",1669143111,1669759688,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game works well on the steamdeck. 

Having played the early uncharted games on a PS3 many years ago it was quite nice revisiting the franchise. The ports are good. Note that you have to let the shaders load when you first launch the game. On the title screen it will indicate they are loading in the bottom right hand corner. You can launch the game prior to the shaders loading but you will have problems with the game crashing. Also I had to use an older Nvidia driver as again kept having game crashes.

However once my technical glitches were out of the way the game ran really smooth.

Graphically its a really nice game. Story rich. You can bypass the story but if you did I dont know if the game play would cut it alone.

The game play is good. Lots of combat with perhaps dated mechanics but still enjoyable. Plenty of weapon choices but you cant mod them. Lots of climbing, jumping and rope swinging in fantastic surroundings. Its quite a forgiving game in that its hard to die but it makes the game quite fluid.

Most of the chapters are linear with an exception in each game where you are introduced into a fairly large open world area. You can do tasks in a random order but note it is easy to miss stuff if you are going for a quick game completion.

I would say allow 20hrs max for each game and you will be done. You can obviously do it much quicker. I think people do it in 6hrs but if you want to savour it allow about 20hrs.

The second game off the two is shorter and hollowed out a bit compared to the first and I suspect cost saving was a factor in development  but still well worth playing,

Another Playstation exclusive comes to PC with one of the most charming adventure series out there. Nathan Drake, life long thief, finally decides to settle down after a life full of adventures, lost treasure and countless close calls. Along with his wife Elena, he lives a pretty quiet life, has a pretty quiet job and overall seem to finally have put his travels behind ... or has he? It is clear that adventure is still in his mind and he fears that he might go back to the life of crime he once knew if he's not careful. But one day, when a ghost from his past shows up to his door with a request for help he can't help but put everything he has achieved on the line for one last job.

[PERFORMANCE]
First off, I have to open up saying this: This game runs like a dream. The graphics are as impressive if not more than what I remember. It runs smooth (I had maybe 1 hiccup at most). And I don't know what magic they worked but even at 1080 this game looks impeccable, not a pixel out of place. It has made a very polished integration to PC, adding a lot of options to graphics, controls and even integration with Logitech devices and NVIDIA features. It's always impressive when a console game gets ported to PC and doesn't break after running past 60 frames. I feel like I found only 1 bug in the entire experience (I drove a jeep against a wall and accidentally vaulted over the jeep, clipping the wall and falling out of the map), besides that this game is built very solid. This feels like a standard in how ports should be handled almost.

[GAMEPLAY]
The gameplay in Uncharted games has always been in the lighter side. What I mean is that what carries this game is its charming characters and crazy adventures. The puzzles are interesting but not too hard, and there are not too many of them. There aren't many combat scenarios but I'm kind of thankful for that because the combat in this game is probably my least favorite part. Don't get me wrong, is not bad, but it feels like it gets in the way of the story and the exploration. The exploration takes a massive improvement with the integration of vehicles and semi-open hubs to explore to your own pace. Even if the vehicles aren't used much they feel pretty good to drive, and are integrated in the gameplay as well in what must be one of the best chase sequences I have ever seen in a videogame to date. It literally has to be seen to be believed.
Overall the gameplay retains the formula used in past Uncharted titles. If you're looking for a very deep gameplay loop or mechanics you won't get them here, this is more of a casual ride with a very fun story.

[ACHIEVEMENTS]
This game doesn't come with the multiplayer, so all achievements are offline. They are not easy tho, I finished a full playthrough and only got 14 out of 101. Some include very specific things, getting off the beaten path to find extra dialogue, take a picture of Sully when you're supposed to be taking a picture of an old pirate artifact, stand still for 30 seconds to replicate the blooper at the E3 presentation of this game. Get your plan journals for this one, it's gonna be a long one.

Overall this is everything I've ever wanted from a port of Uncharted 4 to PC. If anything it makes me wish they ported the old ones as well. Very solid performance, very solid story, very solid game. The story of Nathan Drake ending is a very bittersweet experience for many people, but luckily it was a very fun ride from beginning to end. Take comfort in the fact that this port does the story justice.",1669499347,1669499347,True,23,1,0.633111536502838135,0,True,False,False

Ported by Iron Galaxy Studio for Playstation games on PC

-configurations not feature various setting unlike Spiderman Remastered, God of War, mostly basic setting but not in-depth
-lighting in HDR not apparent (but image texture is sharp on HDR), not surprisingly because Uncharted 4 game released on 2016 back then, play in SDR mode instead for Vibrant color but losing HDR lighting feature
-Shaders installation whille started game....took around 10-15 mins

+Supporting Haptic Feedback on Dual Sense controller (by USB), could experience guns/weapon trigger feedback on L2/R2 button while aiming/shooting
+Good pc port easily achieved 130-150fps by rtx 3070Ti & i7-10700KF on 1080p

I watched a play through of the game when it first released, and was in awe with the game. Now that the game is on PC, naturally i had to buy it and play it since i never owned a PS4. Lemme say this game looks amazing on PC, the characters are amazingly written and lovable even without playing Uncharted 1-3 i feel connected to the characters. The Story is top notch and so well written, and who doesn't love a grand pirate adventure! Game play is what you would expect from a naughty dog game, not amazing but still really fun. I absolutely love the parkour and puzzle aspects of the game, it never gets old. The soundtrack is outstanding, naughty dog always does a really good job with the music in their games, its so fitting for the kind of adventure you go through in this game. With that said if you haven't given Uncharted 4 a try yet i highly recommend it, i'm 10 hrs into the game at the time of this review and i'm not done with the story yet. I expect to get at least another 4 hours out of the story before i finish the game. My score for Uncharted 4 is a solid 9/10, one of the best single player story games there is and that's still true to this day!

Starting with Uncharted 4, Nathan Drake and Sam Drake, one of the best thrill driven adventure experience for me.

Satisfying end to the story of Uncharted 4, awaiting you with even greater adventure in The Lost Legacy, the DLC Expansion is just on another level.

Gotta say that the game optimization sucks because of stupid fking sony porting the game and not giving a fk about PC playe like always, the game is very unstable and not at all smooth, but

The Expansion is magnificent with some of the craziest Visuals I've ever seen and breath-taking scenes that just force you to take screenshots.

Both games feel like you're playing a movie. The level design makes it feel like you're in a living and breathing world, and it's hard to tell otherwise. Most of the time you can't even tell if there's a cinematic playing or not.

Despite a lot of people having issues and crashes before and after updates, I can't say I ever really had one.
The game for me only crashed once, and that was after I played for 12 hours straight. So I can't really blame the developers for that.

That's not the ideal experience because I lacked the background to appreciate all the references to earlier games. Despite that, I still thought it was an outstanding adventure game; awesome gunfight encounters with a dynamic combat system that lets players enter and exit stealth, epic set pieces, fantastic VA and the pirate-themed storyline made it such an incredible achievement. This PC port captures all of that. Negative reviews mention forced mouse acceleration-but I'm one of those people who don't notice that (or motion blur). I only notice forced inverted controls. Towards the end, I did notice the graphics lagging during busy animated sequences, but Uncharted 4 feels pretty much exactly the same as on PS4. The only difference is I was able to aim a lot better (PS4 was my first console after Gamecube and I had no experience with modern shooters) but Avery's Mansion, the shipwreck beach and exploding mummy section were still insanely hard on crushing, so a big tick for preserving difficulty. When Sony made Uncharted 1-3 freely available during covid lockdowns, I took the opportunity to fill in the gaps in my knowledge. Uncharted 1 was a rough third-person shooter I didn't really enjoy, but Uncharted 2 fixed a lot of combat issues and had an excellent story that's on par with Uncharted 4. Uncharted 3's confusing plot (Talbot has powers how??) and messier combat (except being able to throw grenades back) failed to impress. After platinuming all these games (and Uncharted 4) I naturally became curious about Lost Legacy. Although I was initially skeptical (an Uncharted game without Nathan??) I took the plunge. Gradually, the absorbing writing, awe-inspiring exploration and magnificent chemistry between Chloe and Nadine really won me over. Lost Legacy is (sadly) a more compact game, but on the plus side, every puzzle and skirmish is carefully tailored so nothing feels overly drawn out. The APC fight on crushing is still extremely difficult yet satisfying; the darkness, rain and stealth elements make it one of the best encounters in the game. I wish there were more like it. After completing the game I noticed some bizarre glitches(??) where some environments turned into rainbow blocks with no bonus menu filters activated, although I now suspect this is a graphics/rendering issue specific to PC. Lost Legacy crashed once while Uncharted 4 had no crashes. Overall, I think both games perform more consistently on PS4 but the PC ports are great. Logic would dictate that the next reasonable step is to port Uncharted 1-3 onto PC.",1668921567,1669171453,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

No stuttering or other signs leading up to it happening either. Running smooth on second, complete game crash the next.

Running maxed out at 1080p at 1.4x resolution in the in game settings on a 5800x, 32GB RAM, and RTX 3080 there was fairly consistent frames of around 90 up to 144 giving that smooth feeling that pc players love when playing shooters. 

As for the games themselves, they are the perfect blend of story, third person shooting and platforming that are as good in those three distinctive elements as they are all combined together. If you haven't played the original trilogy, I would still recommend picking this up even at the original price. 

I will mention that at launch there were issues for keyboard and mouse users, and after the first patch those were totally unusable without tweaking your peripheral sofware (G-Hub, iCUE etc). The second patch brought crashes and instability, and the third and fourth patches seem to have fixed everything though your mileage may vary. One gripe that I guess can't be fixed is the 126GB Storage requirement.

From this point of view, if ""Uncharted: The Drake Collection"" is ported to the PC platform first, the players' interest may not be so strong. For today's PC players, even though ""Uncharted 4: A Thief's End"" and ""Uncharted: The Lost Legacy"" are games from six or seven years ago, the experience is no better than the current popular 3A games. The game is inferior.

From the perspective of the actual screen, ""Uncharted: The Legend of Thieves Collection"" transplanted to the PC, compared with the PS4 version and the upgraded PS5 version, does not have much visual quality improvement that is visible to the naked eye. On the one hand, because of the quality performance of the original ""Uncharted: A Thief's Legend Collection"", even today it is still at the top level of the game industry; on the other hand, this transplant version has spent more energy on picture optimization And performance scheduling, to ensure that players can play this game with a lower configuration standard.

Compared with the alternation of generations on the screen, the gameplay of the ""Uncharted"" series has always been conservative - either climbing walls and fighting, or solving puzzles and watching performances. But ""Uncharted 4: A Thief's End"" and ""Uncharted: The Lost Legacy"" still bring some different elements to players. Such as the stealth battle in the grass, the semi-open box garden map level, and the application of new props such as claws and wall nails in different environments. Although it has not changed the original level design and gameplay of the ""Uncharted"" series in essence, it has indeed enriched the game experience in the game except for fighting and solving puzzles.

The story of ""Uncharted 4: A Thief's End"" takes place after ""Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception"", Nathan washes his hands and lives a happy life with Elena. But the long-lost brother Sam suddenly appeared, begging him to come out again to help him continue to search for the treasure of the famous pirate Avery. Drake, who is mixed between the two identities of brother and husband, once again embarked on a journey across mountains and mountains. At the same time, he has to face various problems brought about by his family and career, and find himself again.",1669142951,1669142951,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

Good graphics, fun puzzles, amazing set pieces and some of the best facial animations.  The story is okay, but the adventure is akin to an action packed Indiana Jones movie.

I think it has something to do with the port's absurd hunger for CPU bandwidth, but now that I've capped the frame rate to 60, my usage is hovering around 80% and it's still hitching, with none of my other system resources pushing the redline, so I just don't know at this point.  
I've genuinely tried everything I can think of and every solution I can find, but considering I can run virtually anything else on the market maxed without issue, including fellow PS port Spiderman Remastered, I think it's reasonable to blame the port at this stage, particularly given its other issues (the broken mouse aiming thing is the big one).
I don't know if it's just not playing nice with a 7700k or what - should be plenty of brawn despite its age but I've heard people with newer processors are having a better time.  Maybe it'll get patched.

This game loves it's chromatic aberration for some reason, resulting in weird artifacting images. I'm sure with some configuration, you can get it looking good.

Glad to see more exclusive games come to PC, but I really wish they started with the other three games. Uncharted 4 is clearly the end of a storyline that's been built up for three games, and giving it to what could be a fresh new audience doesn't make a whole lot of sense. They only brought 4 + Lost Legacy over due to the graphical fidelity of those games, and while, yes, 1-3 are PS3 era games, they still hold up visually. Only putting 4 up because ""gwafix"" is valid, but also dumb, people with powerhouse PCs are still playing older games.

It's a shame, because Uncharted on a keyboard feels perfect. The other three games would be amazing on PC, and with the nature of the story, it'd benefit the new PC crowd who's jumping on.

If you're going to buy it, those two elements alone are worth the price of admission.

I however have bought this game twice. Once on console and once again on PC knowing full well I was going to have an elevated experience playing it on the current PC system that I own. I however was unaware until after purchasing it that Multiplayer and Survival mode had been gutted from the collection.

I think the story and characters are incredible on their own, however the Survival mode and Multiplayer are what made the game replayable in my eyes, in my own personal opinion. ESPECIALLY having a mouse and keyboard in Survival, that'd be an insane experience to have.

It never feels rewarding and more of a tedious hassle tbh. I tried sneaking around enemies a couple of times, but couldnt figure out when I was actually in their view. So it always ends up in a firefight... which again, at least on PC, feels quite dull. Aiming for a hs often misses, while blindly firing from cover almost always does. I don't know.

Apart from that I cannot bring myself to care about any of the characters (the brother just runs in my way all of the time. Once tried to jump over a cliff to escape some bullets, he came from the other side, blocked me midair and I fell to death...), or the story - if at least you would learn something about Henry Avery... but no, it's all just made up mumbo-jumbo.

It is difficult to make good sequels, especially with story-driven games, but Naughty Dog was able to strike gold yet again. The story is very well put together, with an interesting narrative and filled with thrilling set-pieces. The characters are witty, the writing is solid, and the voice actors are outstanding.

While the core gameplay remains largely similar compared to the previous games, with a third-person perspective and a big focus on platforming and combat, some chapters are now open-ended, requiring you to drive a vehicle in order to explore them.

If you have not yet played uncharted 4 trust me play it... its a fantastic game overall. You DO NOT need to have played U 1-3 to enjoy this title (coming from someone who has played them all on PS4). This collection also comes with the lost legacy which im still in the process of completing for the first time, highly enjoying it. 

[b] The Port is Fine... ugh ish... [/b]

I played this game at 4K on a Rtx 3080 / i9 10900K

- Performance is acceptable for the most part lock right on 60 unless hitting vram cap. 
- VRAM (Memory Leak?), Performance degrades overtime due to hitting the Vram cap. Need to reboot game after every chapter.
*I partially blame nvidia for this, giving the 3080 a 4K card only 10 Gb of vram??? LOL???
- Horrible implementation of DLSS picture is very blurry even on Quality mode, turn it off and use the in game TAA instead please. FSR 2.0 Honestly looks better but I will stick to a native 4K with TAA.
- Shadow draw distance even on ultra is HORRIBLE, blocky ugly shadows medium distance away from character.
- Graphics menu feels a little lacking / However settings menu is pretty extensive
- Huge RNG Bullet Spread makes shooting feel very clunky on M/K
- Loading is done via 1 core on processor so installing this game on a NVME does not help much still takes ~15-30 seconds to load your save.

[b] The Actual Game [/b]

This was my 3rd time replaying Uncharted 4, I absolutely love this game, its my favourite in the entire series.
- Story is very fun and enjoyable.
- Visuals hold up well.
- Game is super fun to play.
- Mix of puzzle solving, climbing and combat all done pretty well.

First time playing Lost Legacy
- Highly enjoying it lots of fun.
- A lot more puzzles (difficult ones as well) compared to uncharted 4
- A lot more freedom in exploration
- Story is fine.
Will update review when I complete it. 

On a side note if your a completionist and enjoy 100%ing all achievements. This collection is crazy annoying to fully complete.
At least half the achievements are very specific (read them ahead of time) and super annoying to perform + requiring you to replay the entire game MULTIPLE TIMES.

UNCHARTED™: Legacy of Thieves Collection is yet another Playstation exclusive package making its way on PC. Developed by Naughty Dog originally and brought to PC by well known player in the porting scene, Iron Galaxy Studios. The company is no stranger to both great ports and some poor ones, this collection sadly steers a bit to the latter. Some tweaking of drivers and in-game settings should provide sufficient results on most systems, though players should not have to resort to that in order to have an enjoyable experience.

[h2]Uncharted 4: A Thief's End[/h2]

The ending of Nathan Drake's story is a thrilling narrative and cinematic experience, sprinkled with the classic Uncharted action. The game features fan-favorite returning characters, as well as some newly introduced ones, which are a great addition to the overall narrative. It is one of the best games in the series, in my opinion, taking full advantage of the Playstation 4 hardware. The port might leave a sour taste in your mouth but the game itself definitely won't.

[b]Positives:[/b]
+ The search for Henry Avery's treasure and long lost utopia is one of the best stories in the franchise. It is not only a treasure hunt story but also one of complicated personal relationships between brothers. The newly introduced characters provide a fresh layer of depth to the narrative, while still keeping in line with the past events of the previous four games. Returning ones are as great as they were in all previous titles. It is a satisfying end to Nathan's journey.
+ A true cinematic experience on all fronts. Like most games of this genre, it is a rather linear and scripted experience full of amazing moments. Some might view this as a negative but I feel like it is an important part of the franchise and key to the whole cinematic style, after all this is not an open-world game.
+ Truly beautiful game and a strong showcase of the Playstation 4's capabilities back in 2016. These PC ports are based on the Playstation 5 remasters but the original version of Uncharted 4 still looks good even today. It was especially noticeable when compared to the previous 3 games released on the Playstation 3 and the prequel Golden Abyss, released on the Playstation Vita.
+ Stellar soundtrack composed by newcomer to the series, Henry Jackman.
+ Solid performance capture by Nolan North, Troy Baker and the rest of the wonderful cast.

[b]Negatives:[/b]
- One obvious negative is the fact that this is the 5th game in the franchise and the only Nathan Drake adventure available on PC. This puts new players who want to get into the world of Uncharted in an awkward spot as they cannot start from the beginning if PC is their only platform. In order to experience the first 3 games you need to own either a Playstation 3 or a Playstation 4, as far as the prequel goes you need to own a Playstation Vita. Naughty Dog's explanation is that players can easily get into Uncharted 4's story without prior knowledge of the previous games. It is true that this game has a decent beginning and end, making it possible to stand on its own but I still feel like playing the previous games is very much required as there are just some characters who will have much more depth if you have prior knowledge. Starting with the final game of a series is simply not a good idea and this is likely the biggest negative regarding the collection.
- Generally a rough port compared to all other Playstation exclusives we have received on PC so far. Stuttering problems, frame drops and mouse issues all paint a negative picture. I am not running the latest in PC hardware but Marvel's Spider-Man which is slightly newer than both these games ran much better. Support has also been lacking with only 3 patches to date. The first patch completely broke mouse sensitivity and it took the developers over 5 days to release a second patch addressing the problem. During those 5 days there was also no communication or acknowledgement of the issue whatsoever, players were waiting in the dark for an update.
- Gun combat is really frustrating and hard to do on a mouse. Enemies constantly twitch around causing you to miss a shot. This might just be me being bad but it felt really annoying at times.

[b]Overall:[/b]
Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is huge hit in terms of narrative, graphics and cinematic moments. Playing the original game or even the same remaster on Playstation consoles is absolutely recommended. PC on the other hand is a different story. The fact that you are forced to start with the final game in the series, have to suffer through multiple technical issues and deal with the developers' lack of communication and support make this not worth the buy. If I have to be consistent and give a rating it would basically be a [b]7.5/10[/b]. A [b]9[/b] for the game itself and a [b]6[/b] for the port to keep it simple.

[h2]Uncharted: The Lost Legacy[/h2]

[b]Many negative and some positive points in regards to the technical aspects of Uncharted 4 also apply to the Lost Legacy expansion since they are both part of the same package and are basically the same ports under the hood.[/b]

[b]Positives:[/b]
+ Compact and thrilling story that takes just about 7 hours to complete. While there are characters from Uncharted 4 appearing here this is definitely a standalone story and it has its own set of new figures. It does a fantastic job at being its own thing despite some familiar faces.
+ Chloe Frazer finally gets her own game. Despite being a long-running character in the series this is her debut as a main protagonist. Even for its relatively short time, the expansion manages to provide decent development of her character arc and keep her interesting even with Nathan's absence from her life.
+ The final chapter of The Lost Legacy is my favorite part of the collection. Full of action and great cinematic moments. Overall much better than the final chapter of Uncharted 4. It is one of my favorite final missions in the whole franchise.
+ Another stellar soundtrack composed by Henry Jackman.

[b]Negatives:[/b]
- More frame drops in this game compared to Uncharted 4. I have no idea if this is only the case with me or if it's a universal thing.

[b]Overall:[/b]
Uncharted: The Lost Legacy is a solid expansion and another decent entry in the series. Absolutely recommended if you play on a console and not PC. The PC version is not worth buying due to the exact same reasons as the other game and the score of [b]7.5/10[/b] also applies here.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
UNCHARTED™: Legacy of Thieves Collection is the first Playstation port I cannot recommend. Multiple technical issues and poor business decisions led to the downfall of this collection and I hope Naughty Dog and Sony realize this and do better in the future. It is the worst-selling port to date and seeing the state of it, it is no surprise at all. Such a shame as these games are absolutely worth playing and this was a golden opportunity to introduce PC players to the franchise properly. I really hope The Last of Us Part I and II will be handled with much more care and passion.",1668463727,1668463727,False,16,0,0.590518712997436523,3,True,False,False

Most chapters are fun for the first time, but you'll find them long and uninteresting the second time as it's really filled with cut scenes and just normal conversations.

The camera sensitivity is very bad for some reason and aiming is truly very hard. At every stage there's a lot of enemies (in moderate) and it's very difficult to kill them all unless you have aim lock (basically aim bot) turned on.

Story wise, Uncharted 4 is good, ending was really good, both the final sword fight and the epilogue. However as for Uncharted Lost Legacy, a good portion of it was honestly boring, and at one stage just wanted to get over with the game.

Graphics and sound and stuff are cool, and I would highly suggest everyone interested in story games to play the game, but just not buy it at full price.
I saw the prices on steamdb in different regions and knowing that the game is a collection of games which is why it's priced at such a high point, I'd strongly suggest waiting for some steam sale and grab it then.

Just for a heads up the game is basically 50% story, 35% platforming and 15% fighting encounters (the game has more or less around 10 fighting parts that are not particularly long). Give this aspect once you finish the game is understandable you wont want to play the game again, unless you really want the achievements. One of the the only problem i see with the game, besides some crashing issues, is that it was clearly develop for a inferior console. You can notice this, by the amount of scenes where the game will stop you stone cold for the loading of the next area. Now days this does not happen anymore but clearly the way the game is design to compensate for the lack of loading screens. 

Overall the game is good as story oriented game and mostly focuses on that. Gunfights are spread thin through out the game  so if the fighting bothers you, luckily there is not many. 

On the other hand, the DLC is actually better than the main game when it comes to game play, the parts where the game stops you for not reason, are basically gone. It focuses on controlling the character more. find treasure, exploring, and fighting enemies. While the game still story oriented for the most part you can clearly see that there is better pacing in the Lost Legacy DLC.",1668304226,1668304226,True,5,0,0.575835466384887695,0,True,False,False

Cons: Exploring is terrible, as they try to rush you in a linear fashion. Combat is atrocious. Companions are terrible in combat. Only having access to one pistol and one other type of rifle at a time, is unacceptable. Due to not knowing exactly where to go next, leads to many unnecessary deaths. Unnecessary key taps and presses. Key taps and presses that cannot be bound nor changed.  Game is way to short and way to linear. And the worst of all, is unresponsive key commands, no matter how you bind them to your keyboard. 

I have yet to play Legacy of Thieves, but I sure hope that the key commands will be better, but I doubt it. But the game has much better graphics at least.

Both my siblings were interested in playing Uncharted 4 but were worried because they hadn't played the first three games. Still, I encouraged them to try it- it genuinely doesn't require knowing every bit of lore from the first three games, it explains when and where context is necessary. After beating Uncharted 4, both siblings ended up seeking out the first three games, as well, because they ended up enjoying the characters so much.

In terms of Cinematography, the game is unparalleled. It really does feel like you're watching a movie a lot of the time, and the accessibility settings the game includes are intuitive enough to help a wide audience of people with different ranges of motion and abilities to still experience this incredible story.

The Lost Legacy is a perfect compliment for fans of the first three games, and fans of A Thief's End, incorporating characters from both to create a wonderful new blend of character interaction that adds a lot of depth to characters that longtime fans already adored.

So far, with ~7 hours of real gameplay, all I keep doing is running, jumping, climbing, jumping, shooting, sneaking, jumping, etc. All of this takes place in a very linear setting. The story and the motivations for the protagonist to do what they do are fairly interesting, but it's easily forgettable as I go back into very basic, repetitive, and unsatisfying gameplay.

Am I missing something, or playing the game wrong??

A fantastic port. Disappointed it came out so late when PS5 release was in Jan 2022.. Controls are great while feeling the haptic feedback on the Dualsense. There’s great tense while pulling the trigger. Everything runs great and looks great even at low resolutions. I haven’t seen any issues but it truly feels like playing Uncharted for the first time on console. 

The only thing I will say. It does feels odd from a story perspective to release 4 without 1 - 3. Namely Drake acknowledges the past adventures in game, but it would be great to see and actually play them. If you know what I am talking about. Hopefully, whenever Uncharted movies sequel comes out, it seems like the direction of the movies will follow the the first game just from the ending cutscene of the movie. Perhaps we could see the release of Nathan Drake Collection then.

(Edited:

Finally finished: 
Still some bugs, but mostly the entire game is clear and clean. Bugs mostly included model pop ins after camera cuts for two to the three seconds. A few black boxes patches in one quick cutscene. 95% of the game is clean.)

While I think anyone could just jump in and be fine playing, I am concerned that they would miss out on key character moments that really make the game shine.

As for the Lost Legacy, I had never played it before. However, it was a fun action romp and a medley of some new, and mostly recycled mechanics from Uncharted 4. I definitely got side character vibes the whole time though, as it felt like the main character was missing. Chloe is a great protagonist... but it just feels like their 'group' is missing something.

So, let me put up a review for Uncharted.

My initial experience was nice and interesting so I had ""upvoted"" the game. But going further into it, gameplay is basically bland. Nothing new comes up, just same ol' parkour, rapple hook and shooting. There's not a 4th thing you do in this game except in chapter 11 where you get to drive a car for 5 minutes or so. 

Moreover that, there are numerous bugs in the game. 80% cutscenes are bugged and I have to replay the cutscenes multiple times over and over to get it correct. Sometimes, characters go mute, sometimes they dissappear from cutscene, sometimes they keep re-spawning and refreshing in a weird location.

I am playing this game on RTX-3060 laptop with i7-10th gen and 16GB ram (installed on HDD). And since chapter-6 or 7, I have been seeing corrupted textures here and there on large surfaces (corrupted textures are basically rainbow colored bands that cover any surface completely when the game fails to produce actual surface). Numerous stutters whenever I enter new location even when shader cache is 100% completed.

Very pathetic and mediocre experience. (possibly the worst port from SONY and I own and completed all the games from SONY that came to PC).

(6/10) -> Only good things are cinematic and photogenic locations paired with blockbuster level directed action scenes. Definitely wait for sale and also a few patches to settle in.

If you want treasure hunt chase and explosive experience, you are better off with TOMB RAIDER series, far better experience than this. I have played Uncharted 2 back in PS3 and it was miles better than this Uncharted 4/5.

This has got to be my ""most expensive"" downvote on STEAM. Feels like a clown for spending such amount of money for half baked experience.

So you've enabled raw input in settings and expect it to fix those issues right? Wrong.

While moving your mouse, X axis is way faster than Y axis. If you are indoors in-game, then X is slower, Y is faster... And there seems to be some sort of mouse acceleration too.

I really wanted to spend more time with them in what's meant to be the last ""main"" game. I was also not keen on having ANOTHER pirate-themed adventure after how awesome Ubar and especially Shambala was. But I gotta admit that even in 2022, Uncharted 4 is a top-tier cinematic experience with incredible acting and enjoyable, if somewhat unremarkable, gameplay. The villain, as usual with the Uncharted games, is pretty forgettable but the spectacles and set-pieces were incredible while being, dare I say, bordering on the absurd. All in all, it works.

I think I might have enjoyed the laser focused story, the in-deep exploration of South India and the new dynamic between Chloe and Nadine in The Lost Legacy more actually. As I said, I was never really infatuated with the direction of the story in Uncharted 4 so playing as a different character and buddying up with a former antagonist was more rewarding than I expected.

However, I'm baffled that Sony didn't choose to port over the first 3 Uncharted games. Those games, and especially Among Thieves, is what's most fondly remembered by the fans IMO and it seems pretty strange that they chose to have the finale and a side plot be the main entry point for the PC community. Also, I genuinely dislike the collectibles in this game. They're numerous, tedious to gather and offer very little in the way of knowledge, satisfaction or amusement. The achievements are a pain too. The port isn't super great either with lots of ""building shaders"" and microstutters. Frankly, I'm shocked that companies still hire Iron Galaxy after their disastrous Arkham Knight port. In any case, I'm still pretty happy that Sony is continuing this trend of PC ports and I'll keep supporting it for as long as it continues.",1667794186,1667826606,True,9,0,0.591289877891540527,0,True,False,False

The game itself: Absolutely stunning.

The graphics are truly incredible, it ran at a rock solid 60 fps, and I personally never had any crashing issues (not to discredit those who have though). I truly think this game has some of the best looking water I've seen. 

So while across the board this is far from a perfect port, when you get the controls to your liking it is one of the best single player action games I have ever played. I haven't even played the other game in the pack yet! Excited to get started on that but I'm writing this the moment after beating Among Thieves.

So honestly, give us the Remastered Trilogy! And Last of Us 1 and 2 of course.

Edit: I have now played and completed Lost Legacy
Holy Crap.

I thought Uncharted 4 looked good, this topped it and then some. It's definitely shorter but in this case I felt it worked well to its advantage. As much as I liked U4 it had some moments that dragged on just a bit too long. Lost Legacy moves at a very nice pace!

Doesn't register PS4 controller so the prompts are Xbox (Normal Uncharted 4 did recognise), but that's a small flavour thing.

I let the crash reporter send its data every time this happens, maybe they'll sort it out. Only 4 chapters in at the free-roamish part too, I don't think I'm even halfway through and I'm having more issues in Lost Legacy than in the base game.

But it's definitely worth it still. Base game only crashed 2 times during the entire playthrough. Other reviewers have already said why the game is great, don't think I must repeat myself.

Well the game is nice, thanks Sony now give us Bloodborne.

As it is a story driven game it would have been nice if they had ported 1-3 as well. I played 1-2 but missed 3 please port them as well.

Gameplaywise the game is okayisch. The keyboard and mouse support could have been better. The controls still feel limited. The quick time event cutscenes or holding w key simulators that you get sometimes are annoying as hell as well. Guess thats a console thing but they could have set the buttons to m1 instead of f. The gunplay is also okay. Headshoots should be instakills imo everything else is mostly fine except the climbing which just feels bad on PC. Rappeling up and down a rope is also extremly akward.

I hope the next ports will have some better controls and maybe some gameplay updates. The intro is basicly holding w till a cutscene appears. Like why ? Just make a cutscene for the whole thing

Update:

Finished the main game. Story wise there are quiet some parts that make the story hard to believe (even if you view everything with video game logic some parts feel like they just wanted to lengthen the playtime). The camera sensitivity bug stayed for most of the game. Also in the second half more and more lags and sometimes visual bugs appeared (rtx 2080,i7 9th generation and 16gb ram. medium to high graphics) and sometime the game lagged out or had to reload. I dont have the best specs but I can play Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Elden Ring and many more without that problems.
Graphic wise the game looks beautiful but e.g if a cave is colliding, the rocks that drop appear out of nowhere. You could have done better on that Naughty House. Also cutscenes in which you have to occasionally hold w or press f as well as quick time or button smash events are just annoying gameplay mechanics. Its always sad when they appear in AAA games but Uncharted always had them. Sadly. The game is also extremly guided. Other characters tell you what to do, there is only 1 path you can take...... (even tough there would be a 2nd but you cant use it duo to invisible walls of death zones). Guess that also was always part of Uncharted but things changed and its not Uncharted 1 its Uncharted 4 gameplay updates could have been made. SPOILER !!What was really disappointing was the ""final fight"" which was basicly  a quick time event cutscene!!

The Spin-Off

The sensitivity bug didnt made its way into the dlc. Points for that BUT the controls with mouse and keyboard feel way more clunky, Enemies are sometimes invisible, the game lags out quiet often for no reason and sometimes you die for no reason (like the game bugs out and you either can restart or kill yourself and sometimes you just die for no reason and have to restart. Enemies detection radius is also super bugged out. They spot you through walls way to often

In most cases I would refund a game with major bugs like that and buy it 1 year later during a sale but this is a PC Port that I've been waiting for a long time. I hope Uncharted 1-3 as well as Bloodborn and many more make its way to the PC as well and that Sony learns from the mistakes they made.

- You have to play the previous games to grasp who are most of the characters and a few parts of the story.
- While the visuals hold the gameplay really didn't age well, especially for computer players who thought they had to content themselves with tomb raider, tomb raider has a far superior and engaging gameplay (better puzzle, temples, actual exploration, better weapon handling, reactive movements)
- The game is really too linear.
- Since the last update if you play k&m, enable raw data input for the mouse, it fixes the jitter on mouse axes, you're welcome.
- Sometimes you have to reload because the state machine didn't register an action and NPC get stuck.

Even 6 years after release the graphics remain impressive and the core gameplay is solid. You climb around cool places, solve the occasional puzzle and engage in some gunplay.

The story is standard genre stuff with lost cities and clues strewn around the world. To make things more interesting the devs give you three different sidekicks to do character development with. The sidekicks also serve to create conflict for the protagonist in that he has to choose between competing loyalties.

The game's production values are through the roof and every set-piece and location looks spectacular. The game is probably as fun to watch as it is to play.

The weaknesses are a kind of muddled combat and cutscenes overload to the point where the game sometimes feels like an interactive movie. Though I guess that's the point.

Uncharted Lost Legacy:
Now this is a short game with Uncharted 4 having 22 chapters this has 9 chapters, Now this story isn't about Nathan Drake, Is about Chloe Frazer Which we only saw in Uncharted 2 & 3 not 4, & Nadine Ross which got introduced in Uncharted 4, Now this feels, not as good as U4 which make sense, But it is enjoyable somewut but i don't really feel a connection to any of the characters or atleast the connection i had is from the previous games, But the weapons in this is probably the best, With the Introduction of the Silence pistol which is so useful for stealth, Now you don't need to play like this but i feel is much more enjoyable compaired to Uncharted 4 where the only stealth you could was with you hands because a gun would be to loud. Anyways I will give it a 6,7/10


The Port itself:
Now these are pretty old games that hold pretty well, But at launch i didn't experience anything bad in the bugs part of the game but as the recent patch has come it has done more harm than good, There is a problem where the mouse is very slow even on high sens you can fix by turning your Report rate on your mouse to 250 or 125, but it shouldn't be a problem at the first place & also had a little graphic issue at the prologue of Uncharted 4 but only happened once compaired to how many times i have played that part of the game, now this game perfomance wise is very good, I get around 80+ fps on ultra compaired to the PS4 being locked on 30fps on standard or PS5 on 60, But graphic wise the Ultra doesn't feel like ultra at all you could switch between Ultra & Standard & it would feel the same the only way to see the difference is to zoom in 100x & look at it side by side, which is unfortunate, I also dropped down to 40 to 30 fps in some parts of the game but it isn't much, but if you look at who did this port which was Iron Galaxy is pretty well, but Is not as good as the other ports Playstation has made, but if you're playing this the first time you should get it or atleast after the next patch with this Slow Mouse issue. 7/10",1666209988,1667503299,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

After the recent patch, the native controls for this port (keyboard and mouse aka kb&m) are totally wrecked.  i have seen several people complain about the kb&m only to get the flamed response: ""getta controller!""  that would an appropriate response if we were playing on a playstation console.  but we are not; i am not.  the native controls for a pc are mouse and keyboard.  the game must acknowledge them correctly for the game to succeed.  the controls were correct the previous patch; it is a shame they are taking so long to correct this gross error.    

while this game was fun before the latest patch, this was not the best port.    mouse tracking/ gyro scope issues since launch in specific instances.  I also noticed strange consistent non-significant graphical errors (like gumby limbs).

i would mention the selling points of the game, but the current state the game is unplayable.  i am disappointed, i had higher expectation than this.  

do not buy until issue is addressed.

For example all treasures don't show up at physical items but small blinking stars on the surface when you get near them.  So a small bright star in the grass when picked up become a found pot or other object.  It just seems silly animate the object into the game.  Also after picking up the treasure you can look at it but there's no description as to what it is or why you should even care about it.  In Tomb Raider there would be some historical text to go along with what you found.  Perhaps they could have added while you're examining the object some bonus thing you can find for example.  Cut scenes at time have NPC characters phasing in and out making it really immersion breaking.  Hand to hand fighting is very clunky and there's no block option.  Roll or evade is the shift key which is an unusual default choice compared to other games.  Usually shift is run.  Instead run is something like ctrl or alt.  I realize I can change it but it's just a weird choice of default keybindings.  Tutorials are not full converted for PC users and still show things like press the X button when the playing is using mouse and keyboard.  Last the game is on rails there's no real ability to explore sure there's some small areas but for the most part only one way to go and no alternative choices to approaching a objective.,1667228631,1667228631,False,2,1,0.529514610767364502,0,True,False,False

The plot is childish and goofy, main characters are the same way, everyone is an idiot (historic characters included).
You thought your brother was dead but did not actually bother to check or get his body to bury it?
The other guy who was with you did that instead and knew your brother was alive for years? Get out of here.

Everyone is an idiot, except for a couple of strong independent female characters of course, who are without a flaw, looking from above on the helpless, week men playing their stupid, reckless games not knowing when to stop - men huh?
It's so obvious and in your face like a slogan on a placard, at least do it with talent or creativity if you are doing it.
Or just not use art (games are art) to deliver some ""current thing"" 1 bit propaganda slogans.

All of that might not have been important (it's in every other game these days) if the gameplay was good.  

But the gameplay is from 2005.
Gun fights are horrible, stealth is very basic and rudimentary, no RPG elements are present, the best parts are the parts where you just climb and jump on stuff.

I know it's an a adventure game, but Lara Croft games are also that and the gameplay mechanics in there is rocket science level compared to Uncharted.

Visuals are good and attention to detail is impressive, but that's it.

Works out of box on the Steam Deck at about 45-50FPS with locking it to 28-30FPS with the hard/in-game ""30FPS cap"" is pretty impressive. What isn't impressive, is the heat output. It's really worrying how hot the Deck gets. It's a good sign that the game runs on Linux (given... the PS4 and PS5 are FreeBSD/Unix based like Linux is), but I wouldn't recommend playing it on the Deck unless you make some fan changes in the menus because the default/post-fan speed update that Valve made defaults aren't enough [for me personally] to be comfortable running the game on the Deck hardware for extended periods of times.

[h1]The Desktop Experience/actual gaming PC[/h1]

125Gigs with about 69Gigs of ""Junk"" (read: Other language audio/subtitle files you may never use) files. Then throw in Naughty Dog's PS3-4-5 era Blu-ray Disc streaming tech that they have to use on consoles for the ability to load things faster than the disc drive via the hard-drive.

...Which also asks for more drive-space than the minimum recommends... ...Which wants to stream from another drive than the drive that the game is installed on...

...Which also has a RAM problem (probably due to Iron Galaxy?) that will cause your OS to chug or the game to soft-lock/hard-lock and crash eventually...

Besides that, the port (when it runs well for me) is ""great."" I went through the campaigns and enjoyed them, despite the frame-dips and loading-tech getting in the way of cutscenes and gameplay at times.

Iron Galaxy is apparently infamous for poor PC ports. I only know them for [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/244730/Divekick/]Memekick[/url] and [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/577940/Killer_Instinct/]Killer Instinct X-box[/url] which are alright ports. This one is ""servicable"" but the issues right now (and no patches in the ~1-2 weeks from launch) really doesn't inspire confidence in me to recommend the game to anyone but the hardcore series fans (like me) who don't own a PS4 (like me) that want to play this entry/finale to the series.

[h1]The game itself[/h1]
[hr][/hr]
Gentle reminder that Uncharted 4 is [url=https://imgur.com/gallery/xcA0Y]Amy Hennig's baby[/url] and she was working on it and trying to do gameplay changes from the PS3 era Uncharted entries before Neil Druckmann pushed her out.

With that said, bar the obvious Druckmann-isms from the Last of Us being put into the Uncharted series (the stealth system in Uncharted 3 which was only for like 1-2 scenes is expanded here and made the main focus like it was for the Last of Us. Blech. The less said about U4 Nadine the better in terms of wasted character slots.), the game is a ""good"" (not GREAT, just good) entry and finale for the series from a studio that generally does not count past 3 (unlike Valve which does not count past 2) and generally makes a kart racing game for the I.P. they're retiring (UnKarted when, ND?).

I enjoyed the game... HOWEVER, veterans thinking of going into Crushing vanilla and first playthrough: DON'T. Worst mistake of my life (Chapter 18 finale, Chapter 20 opening, infamous examples here) and the Crushing difficulty is based around using Cheats [which you get for collectibles gained and beating the game] like infinite ammo (which gets around Crushings quarter-half ammo on pick up gains) and slow motion (for helping with armored enemies, and tight areas) to beat the game and get the achievement(s) tied to that.

Which is funny and a point that Neil Druckmann doesn't get the series: Because while U1-3 had certain tough areas, they weren't hard to beat on Crushing given you could have ""kill boxes"" and obvious ""this is going to be a fight area"" triggers on the journey to prepare yourself for.

U4? As soon as you hear ""SHORELINE!!!!"" on Crushing you're like ""Oh, god, why..."" because the game grinds to a halt (without the cheats) due to it forcing you to use Stealth or be beaten by reinforcement numbers eventually or getting frustrated by the AI  partner[s] getting in your way of cover and battling the enemies during these segments.

Is it beatable ""vanilla""/no cheats? Absolutely, I did it. BUT I DON'T RECOMMEND IT.
[hr][/hr]
Lost Legacy was better. Crushing could get a little trouble-y (the Chapter 8 boss, notable) at points, but not to the point where battles were like ""OH GOD, PLEASE NO MORE COMBAT. THIS IS TERRIBLE!"" and the story is generally better and more engaging and ""Uncharted""-Hennig feeling than Druckmann [taking cues from Hennig's planned 4 story beats but kind of ruining them] did. Whoever was the directors of Lost Legacy need to be promoted because they had a more enjoyable adventure and length and pacing feel than U4 did.

PLUS, they made Nadine slightly more likeable and at least not a total worthless addition to the story by having her tag along with Chloe though be prepared for a lot of ""JA!!""ing from Nadine.

It's final segment is one of Uncharted 2's on steroids. I loved it.

So: U4? Pass beyond seeing what Hennig was trying to do and wish she could've stuck the landing better. LL: Absolutely worth going through and hoping ND promoted these dude/ttes to leads to further the series.

Dearest Sony: The reason this game flopped is becasue the port is pretty barebones and doesn't include stuff that the console version has in addition to being the LAST FUCKING ENTRY of the series. You're pulling a Persona 5: Strikers on PC players, never go full Persona 5: Strikers.

[Atlus, thankfully, learned and listened to consumers to where they ported Persona 5: People, get on that: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1687950/Persona_5_Royal/ It's worth the $60 than Uncharted 4: Late Port is.]

Many people were not happy that the Legacy of Thieves Collection was released before we got the Chance to play through Uncharted 1-3 and I can totally understand that.
I myself usually don't want to play a Sequel when I didn't have the Chance to play the prequels that came before.
But after playing Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection I am just glad that I got to experience the 2 Games included (A Thiefs End - basically Uncharted 4 - and the Standalone DLC The Lost Legacy).

Also I saw many people complaining about the pricing because those Games are a few years old. Let me just say for the amount of Game Time and Quality of the Game, the pricing is more than fair and even worth buying without waiting for a sale.

I try to keep the Review Short.

The Game looks absolutely stunning, amazing and georgeous and also it runs really well on my PC.
i5-9600K / RTX 2060 Super / 16GB RAM and I could play on Ultra 1080p with only a few minor drops to 48fps in a few areas.
I got no problems with microstuttering or whatever other problems some people describe. That's not to say that those problems don't exist for some, we are talking about PC Gaming here anyway. Differs from setup to setup. 
Overall I'd say this is a great PC Port. Minor gripe from my side is that sometimes the ""Building Shaders"" in the menu took too long. Also be aware of a few bugs and glitches, but it was nothing Gamebreaking.
In Cutscenes more than once I had characters warping in and out or just weirdly T-posing and also I had to die a few times to reset the checkpoint, because I broke a sequence and the Game wouldn't let me progress.

The Sound is very good, the Voice Acting is awesome, the story is very entertaining (you actually root for most of the characters and feel for them, even though you may not have played the previous Games like myself), the setpieces are gorgeous and bombastic at times, same goes for the action (think Call of Duty Campaigns and equally or sometimes even more memorable), so yes, it is worth it.

Control wise as of the time writing this, they have made the Mouse issues worse, but I played with a XBox1 Controller anyways (even though I still have problems aiming with a controller, but it got better over time...).

I really do hope that Sony will not someday stop porting over great PS Games to the PC only because this Game was the least selling Game for them.

My Verdict: Great Game, give it a shot even though you didn't play 1-3. Maybe in the future we get a chance for that...There is a lot to play and like here.",1667134879,1667134879,True,2,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,False

All of a sudden, my mouse movement can no longer exceed a certain speed (need to move mouse 5 times across my mouse pad to do a 180!!!!) and increasing my mouse DPI results in my cursor flying to my second display (because the game doesn't have fullscreen funcionality)
I am now changing the review to a negative one.
Sorry, but if I can't move the camera how the F am I supposed to finish the game? 

Old review:
The game is great but the port is lazy.
Temporal Anti Aliasing - Ugly as heck with lots of ghosting if you play <1080p or with DLSS @ <1440p.
Film grain - can't be disabled
Aberration - can't be disabled
Mouse Acceleration - can't be disabled
FOV - can't be changed

How come the graphics settings are so lackluster?
It's weird especially if you compare the amount of customization in audio and accessibility settings and PHOTO MODE which has the above mentioned video settings adjustable...
The mouse acceleration is abhorrent. If you don't want to feel like a Stormtrooper in regards to aiming ability a controller is highly recommended.

If I had to score it - I would give it a 8-9 out of 10 for the story and characters, 8 for world building, 6 for gunplay, 7 for sound and 5 for the PC port. The story is great, characters are done pretty well. Action sequences are unmached (although silly). Gunplay is meh - enemies are aimbots on higher difficulties and it takes quite some time to get a headshot from a distance. Getting hit makes the camera go crazy and aiming is really difficult (wish it was the same for enemies, but nope - aimbot no matter what). There are quite a few achievements you can sink a lot of time in. Just finished the game on the hardest difficulty available (there's one more that unlocked) and that took 20 hours with almost all collectables.

There are some technical issues (honestly, wish the same people that ported God of War ported this game). Long load times, models not loading, T posing, broken mouse aim, audio glitching here and there, audio lower volume during cinematics and a bunch more. Due to the slow load times, the game sometimes shows a scene that you wouldn't normally see (like a bunch of enemies gathered in the air) while it loads, or the whole level goes dark with T posing people - it's funny.

Keep in mind, that this game just released, and is bound to get a few patches to iron out some bugs.

A small rant below...

At times, the way the world is built doesn't make sense (caves mostly). The way rocks are formed just makes it jarring when looking at them... It's almost as the devs built it not so you can look at it, but rather be passable to... pass through it and not be that boring. There were quite a few places where you could see through the map, purple missing textures, models floating - things you would expect to see only in an unpolished game. I don't remember having this many issues in my first playthrough back in 2016. Oh that Nate sure is made out of some sturdy stuff. I mean - he constantly falls from great heights, gets shot, [spoiler]survives weather that is sure to give you pneumonia at the least and a really bad blow to the head[/spoiler]. Talk about suspension of disbelief sheesh. But hey - it's a game and I love it.

When this popped up on my radar, I was obviously very surprised that Sony is beginning to bring its exclusives to PC.

However after running through the first 10 chapters of Uncharted 4, I can honestly say that I am quite disappointed, and am perplexed as to why it is such a well reviewed game.

Dont get me wrong, the game is very high quality. It is beautiful, the mechanisms are generally very smooth, there are incredible small details like the way a rope will wrap around trees that adds a lot of immersion to the game. The voice acting is great and the writing is pretty good as well, the story is decent as well.

But something about it just doesnt keep me interested, it all feels so ... cliche?

The gameplay is quite simple, the pacing feels a bit slow and inconsistent, the mechanics get old quite quickly, the story is just decent - it feels like I will forget this 1 week after I finish the game.

If I could summarise it I would basically call it the video game equivalent of one of the recent Star Wars movies. Good quality, technically, obviously big budget, good for a run-through, but ultimately forgettable.

I give it overall a 7/10

Story - 6/10 (decent story for a game, ultimately forgettable)

Gameplay - 7/10 (nothing too innovative)

Writing - 6/10 (one thing that really bothered me is the way Sam and Nathan casually joke repeatedly after killing literally hundreds of people)

Graphics - 8/10 (quite pretty, even for an older game)

World/atmosphere - 9/10 (I think this is done very well)

Optimization: good
Gameplay: good
Bugs: occasional crashing when tabbing out and character models MIGHT bug in pre rendered cut scenes

I used to have a Playstation and I was able to play the first 3 games on release and absolutely loved them. I haven't had a Playstation since the fourth one game out and I was so excited when I found out this game was coming to steam. When writing this I have only played A Thief's End and I don't know if the other has similar/more issues, so keep that in mind. 

FOR ME, the game ran great. I have a 1080, and the game was able to hold constant 60+ fps for the entire game. I could count on 1 hand the amount of time I had less than 60 and those times were very brief (less than 5 seconds). Crashing happened but wasn't an issue. The game auto saves very frequently and the only time crashing would occur was after tabbing out of the game. Still infrequent and only happened about 5 times. The final issue I experienced was during rendered cut scenes. During the rendered cut scenes, character models would occasionally morph into another position and almost instantly revert back to what it is suppose to be. To me this is very minor and sometimes funny, but to others it might be a little immersion breaking and annoying. The worst case of this happening was actually in the final chapter of the game, and this happened. Not only the character model bugging out, but the big baddie of the game had their entire dialogue cut out. The subtitles didn't appear either. This was fixed by opening the menu and replaying the cinematic. I found it odd that the pre rendered cut scenes were the ones to be buggy and not the in game engine cut scenes, but I also had a similar thing happen to me in Spider-man Remastered.

If you have played the first three games then I can easily recommend this game. It does a great job of wrapping up the story and it is very fun. 

MAYBE SPOILER (IDK): If you have played the other 3 games or even the Tomb Raider games you would know there always seems to be some super natural thing/people and the end of the games. I went on the last 4ish chapters waited for something super natural to happen (several times I felt it was teased something super natural was going on) and it never happened. I'm not saying this is bad, but the fact it wasn't simply threw me off a bit. Seeing that this is the conclusion and a purely character driven story (as far as motivations go), I feel adding something super natural would have been worst for the story and ending.",1667058868,1667058868,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think Uncharted 4 is a love letter to fans of the Uncharted series, the ending is just perfect compared to the past games which weren't bad but I think people that played the past games can agree that they were a bit off after the next game began.
The gameplay is good, though gun fights were a bit harder than past games in my experience. (I played it with a dualsense controller) I think it felt harder mainly because the enemies like to toss a lot of granades at you and they flank you way more but also... I'm really bad at stealth so maybe that's my fault.
So, about the PC port. As I'm writing this review I got to say it's a bit lacking in terms of graphical options, it's still a very pretty game but it's not perfect. When I played for long sessions the game would stutter and I waited for the shaders to compile but even then it would start stuttering after long gaming sessions. I assume it will get patched with time but that was my experience as I'm writing this review.
So to conclude, well I wish they could bring the first trilogy of the games to PC so people who hasn't played those games can experience them, they were really good at the time but I don't know if they'll bring them to PC...
I recommend this game, if they patch up the weird performance issues (could also be that maybe it's just my setup) and for the Uncharted series fans it's a must buy. This is my first review so forgive me if it's hard to read...",1667050289,1667050289,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was expecting to be left in the dark as far as the storyline, but these two games tell a very comprehensive tale that can be enjoyed on its own.

Strangely enough, The Lost Legacy expansion is a far better game than Uncharted 4 is. Pacing was spot on, and the almost claustrophobic linearity of the 4th game was fixed with a very well implemented hub world with unordered objectives and even an optional side-mission. Climbing and shooting sequences are delivered in just the right proportions, whereas the 4th game often uses these sequences as padding for what would otherwise be a fairly short game. The 4th game has an edge in terms of the writing and story, but they seem to have focused more on the dramatic cutscenes than the gameplay for some reason. Mind you, It's still well worth playing both.

In my opinion this is undoubtedly the best Uncharted game in the series not just because of the superior graphics but also the story and gameplay. I may be biased because this was the first game I played in the series but I have now also completed the second and third games and while impressive for being on the PS3, they do not come close to rivaling Uncharted 4.

This game has larger areas than previous uncharted games. There is a lot to explore and with the stunning locations and attention to detail, this is a joy. There are notes to be found throughout the game which expand the world and present stories outside of the main story. The gameplay also benefits from the larger areas and allows for multiple paths to reach the same end goal. The areas are also more three dimensional and the grapple hook is a welcome addition. 

Most importantly I had the most fun playing this game hands down. The addition of the alert indicator on enemies and being able to mark enemies makes stealth a very viable and fun option in a lot of areas and is very satisfying to pull off. The guns feel much better in this game compared to the previous games and the controls feel very natural and easy. 

The story is both thrilling and heartfelt, the characters feel very real and everyone's motivations are clear. These are all lovable characters. The main villain isn't overly macho and ""villainy"" and even his motivations also provoke some sympathy. There is good female representation here as well. The dialogue throughout the game is witty and fun.

The pacing of the game is great. A good balance between exploring, climbing and encounters with enemies. The puzzles are quite simple and straight forward but feel fun. There are some epic set pieces but that are still grounded in reality. Some sequences really makes this feel like playing a very good action/adventure film. The ""supernatural"" element was left out of this game, which I thought was a welcome choice. There is more focus on character development instead. The story felt more realistic but at the same time extraordinary. 

The music is great. A mixture of epic orchestral music but also some tender emotional moments as well. 

Acting, voice acting all superb and natural. 

From beginning to end this is an absolute joy to play. A truly epic adventure with a very satisfying ending. Would highly recommend this to anyone!

Lastly I would like to thank Naughty Dog studios & Playstation Studios for letting us enjoy this hell of a gem in pc & i have to say that waiting 6 years for this masterpiece was really worth it to every last bit of my money, I hope Naughty Dog brings Last of Us 1 & 2 to PC as soon as possible because after playing this my hype has been doubled for that games !!

The Port: It's good enough, there are performance issues in some parts, specially loading the cutscenes causing T-posing and dissapearing hair at times, luckily there's a ""restart cutscene"" option on the menu that you can use to restart it without issues. The performance issues I found mostly on the ""Lost Legacy"" game, more exactly during the late hours of the play through in a certain temple the frame rate started to become unstable, but outside of that it was always pretty stable and smooth. Overall, this is not the best possible port but is playable to an acceptable degree, meaning that there are no major issues with it, only small ones that don't ruin the experience.

The game: It's freaking good. It lasts enough to avoid getting old and avoid being too short. I'd say it's the perfect length and has a really good pacing, no chapter overstays its welcome and the ending is really good (for both games in the collection). My only issue is with the mission design in the last chapters of both games, were there are chapters that either change your perspective (camera) or simply require too much of a good timing and lead to repeated deaths because the game wants you to do things a way and ONLY that way; I'm my opinion that's a rookie mistake that almost ruins the experience... it doesn't matter how good an ending is, if you have to start repeating it over and over again because there's this part that might as well be a quick-time event due to it's timing but terribly implemented... well, you get the idea. Still, I said ""almost"" because it's doesn't get that bad, but it's enough to be annoying. Still, amazing ending on both games.

The story and writing are really good. There's a bit of forced ""wokeness"" inserted, but it's not too bad - and not on the same level as Naughty Dog's later work. Some of the transitions between modern day and the past are distracting, and obviously added to increase the game time.

The gameplay can be a bit bland at times. You will have to suffer through too many awkward parkour sections while fighting with the camera, some dodgy edge detection, and having hand holds give way or break.

The gameplay is honestly nothing special, your regular 3rd-person cover shooter, but it has been refined and is much better than in UC 1, UC2, or UC3.

Nathan Drake has his journal as always, and it's always cool to check it every once in a while for hints or cool commentary and scribbles.

Uncharted 4 actually has a cool villain; someone who has something to prove, is a psychopath, but also gives the protagonists plenty of leeway to back off, which is kinda cool.

The animation detail is top notch, one really cool thing I noticed is that if you point your flashlight, they either turn their head, squint a bit, or use their hand to screen themselves from the light. Lost Legacy has even more detailed animations.

Another cool thing I loved is that stealth worked against heavy/armored enemies, but had more steps, which is nice for a full stealth run!

Now for the bad:

The collectibles are downright garbage in comparison to the recent Tomb Raider trilogy. Uninspired vases or jewelry that barely connects to the story or setting at hand, with no description or commentary from the protagonist. Major missed opportunity. They do seem to unlock cheats, skins, and gameplay modes after finishing the game.

The linearity of the game can sometimes be jarring; you can clearly see the right way to go, but you need to go to somewhere else to trigger a dumb cutscene and then you'll be able to go the right way.

I wish there was at least a limited us of silencers in the game, however, you do find a silenced gun in Lost Legacy that you can use in a couple of encounters.

All in all, this collection is a fun romp and I would recommend the game to anyone interested in it or similar games, however, I wish more was done in terms of collectibles, especially since there's no Multiplayer in the PC version in which you would be able to show off your skins.",1666891811,1666891811,True,1,0,0.501259446144104004,0,True,False,False

First off PC performance. 

I run a Amd 5800X- 32GB 4200mhz ram- RTX 3080 10GB OG version- 2TB m2 ssd and a LG C2 42 inch OLED tv. 

Every setting @ultra + enhanced models + DLSS@balanced in 4K.  Through both games this has given me anything from 70 fps- 120 fps (max of the screen) Depending on outside/inside maps and how much is going on and i would say this game delivers like a baws concidering my hardware.  

No hickups, no bugs, no crashes and no nothing in a total playtime of 29 hours.  

Now over to both games themselves. 

I have earlier enjoyed uncharted on playstation but i never got 4 or 5.  Last one i had was a chipped 3 :P 

I have so long waited to yet again get to enjoy the uncharted series with sweet performance, HDR and 4k in 60 FPS +++++.  This has been a wild ride!  I had no pre knowledge about the story in either of these two games on purpose since i wanted to get a completely fresh playthrough without having any knowledge. 

Yet again Naughty dog delivers the high quality superb gaming they always have.  I loved the stories in both games although the 2nd one with Chloe and Nadine is quite a bit shorter (about 50% timewise).  

Great writing , fantastic action, gameplay itself is snappy and just works.  I like that you can adjust your own experience regarding difficulty and if you still want to play with a controller.  I have for the last 10 years been an avid PC gamer exclusively on mouse and keyboard but actually in these two games i had a blast using a controller through the whole thing. 

Took me 29 hours to complete both games (and yes i did ofc miss pickups here and there) But i like playing these for the story, banter and the fun between all the characters.  

I have loved all the tomb raider games all the way back to the OG playstation but uncharted...man there is just something special about Drake and Sully in particular.  

I higly recommend this game for anyone finally getting to play this on PC and crank the graphics up to the max and have a fantastic time exploring wonderful worlds.  

i do not rate anything in different categories but for me this game pack is an absolute solid 9/10. 
Much of that comes from nostalgia from the very first game and that i think drake is a cool puppy but also a flawless game totally bugfree with good graphics and gameplay.  

I hope some of you bother to read my review and take it to heart.

Nothing overly new for the series so far. I'm running.  I'm jumping. I'm climbing. I'm occasionally killing quietly. I'm frequently killing wantonly, with big explosions. The action is big, the voice acting is excellent, and the ledges are crumbly. Just what I wanted from my uncharted.

While I did not play these titles on console, I can say it seems as though this is an excellent port. Like God of War and Spiderman, Sony has put the effort in to making this an excellent PC remaster. We have plenty of options on the graphics. The game is exceedingly well optimized.

The game is a cinematic experience, especially if you were an Indiana Jones fan growing up. The emotions portrayed by the characters and the way it drives the story is amazing. The voice acting is great and the soundtrack used for the different regions of the game helps in creating a rich and robust environment.
The action sequences are directed in such a way that it feels like a  Mission Impossible x Fast and the furious love child. its quite engaging.

When the news finally came that they would be bringing Uncharted 4 and the Lost Legacy to PC I was so excited, and now finally getting to experience those stories on the right platform in the highest quality available it was everything I could have hoped for and more. I grew up playing the first three Uncharted games they were some of my favorite childhood memories, I won't include any spoilers but the ending to Uncharted 4 and possibly the ending of Nathan Drake's story, it was like saying goodbye to an old friend. Essentially, someone, I haven't seen or heard anything of in the 10 years since Uncharted 3 came out, it was just perfect. And then to be able to experience The Lost Legacy even though it is a much shorter game again it was like seeing an old friend again for the first time in years, I just can't find the words to describe how amazing this collection is and I hope everyone else buys it and enjoys it as much as I did and I hope they still bring my favorite game of all time The Last Of Us to PC, as well as all their future games, NaughtyDog has made some of the best games I have ever played and I just hope I get to experience more of them on PC",1666825189,1666825189,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One of my top games of all time, if not my favorite. The beautifully-crafted story is filled with plenty of action, tons of adventuring, and lots of laughs. Always manages to get some tears out of me as well. Following the story of Nathan Drake and co. going after pirate captain Henry Avery's treasure will keep you on the edge of your seat as the adventure plays out. This may be the grand finale for the great Nathan Drake, but his story will live on forever in our hearts. So happy this game finally made its way to PC. Fairly solid port. I encountered only a few minor bugs (except for an audio issue that eventually went away). By far one of the best looking games out there too. Just incredibly detailed characters and environments. 

Definitely recommend to anyone who is a fan of action/adventure/exploration games. I guarantee you will fall in love with Nate, Sully, Elena, Sam, and the rest of the cast. Sic Parvis Magna for life.",1666777651,1666777651,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

UNCHARTED™: Legacy of Thieves Collection:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Treasure hunters, are you ready? Because it’s time to step into the shoes of two accomplished fortune seekers. Some people call them thieves, but the terminology is totally up to you. Regardless, the two adventures you are about to experience will grab you from the start to finish. So, what are you waiting for? Pack your explorer gears, and don’t forget your gun and rope, as you will need them through both adventures of UNCHARTED™: Legacy of Thieves Collection.

UNCHARTED™: Legacy of Thieves Collection combines two single-player action-adventure games developed by Naughty Dog LLC and published by PlayStation PC LLC on the 20th of October 2022 on the Steam platform. 

I have always been tempted to play the UNCHARTED™ game series, but as a true PC gamer, I never got around to playing them as I don’t own a PlayStation (yes, I know it is odd, but there you go). I was delighted when the news of UNCHARTED™: Legacy of Thieves Collection was coming out on PC, and I couldn’t wait to play both games in the collection. After all, I had waited six years to play UNCHARTED 4: A Thief’s End (released on PlayStation in 2016) and the stand-alone expansion UNCHARTED: The Lost Legacy, which was released in 2017. So, will it be the end of the PlayStation exclusive, I wonder? In the last couple of years, several games were ported onto PC for our pleasure, and the ones I played were exquisite. So, what do I think about UNCHARTED™: Legacy of Thieves Collection?

In a nutshell, I was blown away and played both games from beginning to end within 25 hours. Naughty Dogs have managed to balance all aspects of these games. The stories are well-structured and compelling, with great dialogues, and the voice-overs are top-notch. You’ll laugh, be intrigued, and be on edge on several occasions provided by great cutscenes. Then you have amazing gameplay as you discover mind-blowing locations; the graphics are really good. There are plenty of collectables to find, which are pretty well hidden within the landscape, and they will only show as a small sparkling light as you walk or run by them. You’ll also climb a lot and use your rope a fair bit to access new spots within each chapter. Stealth is a big aspect of the games, as you’ll meet plenty of enemies in every chapter, and it will be totally up to you to sneak up behind and eliminate them without making too much noise. My favourite takedown is pulling them down while my character is hanging on the edge of a cliff, wall, or window. Or you can go in all guns blazing and have epic gun battles. There are plenty of guns and explosives to pick up along the way, which can be found on or in crates, and also when enemies have been killed as they will no longer need their weapons. You’ll experience wild escapes on foot and in vehicles too. The action in these games is brilliant, and when you will face the baddies at the end of the game it will be a spectacular fight. In addition, you have the puzzles aspect of the game.  There are several of them; they are not too difficult to complete, but just enough to make you think a bit. 

There are some issues, though, mainly graphical. However, I did experience a crash to my desktop while playing The Lost Legacy. The most frequent one was when my character jumped towards an edge at certain angles; one arm looked totally dislocated (it actually was funny when it happened). Amongst some minor glitches, the worst issue was the pixelation of one of the character’s faces, which was just odd. 

Despite these small issues, the graphics are fabulous. The story is well-structured, with great dialogues and voice-overs. I thoroughly enjoyed my time playing both games. You can play with your mouse and keyboard or with a gamepad. I waited six years to finish both of the games within 25 hours! Bugger, give me more treasure hunts!

Positives:
~~~~~~~ 
+	Great graphics with beautiful landscapes
+	Entertaining story with great dialogues and voice-overs
+	Good combat system
+	Good puzzles
+	Full controller support
+	 Achievements

Negatives:
~~~~~~~~ 

-	Several graphic issues
-	No trading cards as yet

UNCHARTED™: Legacy of Thieves Collection is truly a treasure to play on PC.

The graphics and environments are pretty much perfect, even on lowest settings it is absolutely beautiful. The story is a bit cliche but also very intriguing with great characters, i personally love the story despite its flaws. The gameplay, however, is absolutely terrible and its biggest weakness. The combat/stealth scenarios are just bad, stealth is very unrewarding in this game unless you do it flawlessly. in fact i'd say that unless you are flawless, stealth is almost never the best option outside of a few times. Some of the chapters are unrealistically difficult, especially chapter 11 which starts off as my favorite chapter and ends as one of my least favorite levels in all of gaming. 

The game also is very poorly ported as i had to revert to an old graphics driver to even run the game, and even then, i have crashed at least 7 different times about 11 hours in. This is just unacceptable in 2022; i expect some issues in most major releases, just not to this degree. 8.5/10 game, but i'll give it a 6.5/10 due to the issues.",1666593034,1666685393,False,1,1,0.464618563652038574,0,True,False,False

Beautiful world, with a good eye for details. 
But, unless your'e fan of a loooooot of jumping and climbing, this might not be the game.
Interesting story development, even though its very linear , and there's no choices that could change the story (or i could not really find one).

Game mechanics contra story/immersion had me scratching my head some times, for example where you have this grappling hook, your companion is above you , but you still need to find a crate to climb on to ...

And even though you have some stealth mechanics , i did miss a silenced sniper rifle :-)

Its console roots are obvious when it comes to the controls, and there are inconsistencies in the ui handling, but nothing mayor.

Graphics wise it looks very good, even though some parts are horrible not optimized , i played this on a 3060Ti at ultra, i7-5930K CPU @ 3.50GHz,  and 32Gb Mem, (so not a super high end but still....)
which mostly worked ok, but with some glaring unplayable sections here and there where fp crash landed at 6fps, where i had to turn graphics down to medium or high (seems to be related to waterfalls ?) .

But all in all, i have seen faaar worse console ports

Would i recomend it ? yea, had a fun couple of hours with it!

As an Xbox and PC gamer, I've never had the opportunity to play the Uncharted series until now. Boy, was I missing out! Uncharted 4 has incredible visuals, voice acting, writing, and overall game play. The game makes you think, challenging you to find new ways around enemies and traversal around the beautiful landscapes. Although this isn't ""open world"", there are many wide open spaces to explore on foot or by vehicle - all while sneakily pushing you to the main objective. 

There are deserts, mountains, forests, oceans and even a high class mansion or two to explore and fight in with an NPC ""buddy"" or even by yourself. The difficulty of the AI that you fight can be challenging if you don't play smart, even on the ""moderate"" setting. There is good variety in AI from pistol henchmen to rocket launcher wielding foes - yes, you can pick up that RPG-7 that dude dropped.

When finishing the main storyline (which took me about 15 hours), you unlock a ""bonus"" category to sort through weapons and give yourself at any moment. Also fun render options like turning the game into a rainbow patterned world, sepia toned or even giving yourself ""bullet time"" abilities and unlimited ammo. This was great to go back to your favorite chapters and activate silly bonus features to mess around with.

All in all, Uncharted 4 is a great PC version that runs fairly well on my system - 3060Ti, Ryzen 7 3700x, 32GB RAM Averaging about 90-110 frames on Ultra settings with DLSS turned on.

I am glad that Sony has given us (the PC owners) the ability to experience the fourth title and the expansion on our computers.  (This was my first time playing ""Uncharted:  A Thief's End"" and ""Uncharted:  The Lost Legacy."")  There were no issues with game performance (I waited for the shaders to download before playing on several occasions, but that only took a few minutes each time).  Both titles ran 80-100 FPS on Ultra Settings with Intel Core i5 9600K and nVidia RTX 2060 Super 8GB, and the visuals looked stunning on a 2K 240hz G-Sync monitor.  

These games are perfect examples of what single-player games should be and require no additional software or memberships.  I really wish that more contemporary games would follow this suit.  As other reviewers have commented, it would be nice to experience the previous Uncharted games on the PC as a full Uncharted collection, but I am happy to have this game in my Steam Library along with other critically acclaimed games, such as ""God of War"" and ""Horizon:  Zero Dawn.""

The script and acting is very good although a little predictable and occasionally the players make odd and somewhat illogical choices that you have no choice but to accept and move on.  

In terms of gameplay it is a combination of climbing parkour that has you jumping, climbing and swinging on ropes around old crumbling structures. It can strongly induce feelings of anxiety or vertigo as things are often sickeningly high and fall apart when you touch them. There is also a fair amount of first person shooter action which can be ramped up or toned down depending on how much you like that style of game.  Its pretty well done though and there is a large variety of weapon types that are fairly fun to use ranging from grenade launchers to silenced pistols. 

Nearly everything you do is mostly intuitive such as swimming under water, swinging on ropes, climbing etc.  The game does occasionally, however, insist on forcing a certain view angle as part of a sequence. For example, there is a sequence where you get chased by a vehicle and the game puts the camera in front of you watching them as they chase you.  It looks nice but requires you to reverse your controls with forward being backward and vice versa.  Its terribly disorienting and I died quite a few times trying to get it right although I did eventually figure it out. This only happened rarely and seemed to simply be a means of increasing your anxiety while giving a more cinematic view of the action.

Not everything is completely perfect, however, and there were a few things I did not care for although they weren't enough to ruin my enjoyment or recommendation as a good game.  

First, although the game appears to be an open world adventure this is not truly the case a lot of the time. There are many sequences where you chase someone (or are being chased) and it seems as if you are choosing where to drive, run etc.  You eventually realize though there is only one choice most of the time and if you choose wrong you will die. They simply conceal it and make the correct choice or path seem logical and appealing. Not a huge deal but if you are expecting a true open world to explore that isnt what this is.

Second, there are absolutely no dialogue choices.  When you interact with people you do so precisely as it is scripted. You cannot make any choices regarding who you talk to or what you say.  The game will even put a prompt up when it wants you to speak to someone.  As I previously said, some of the choices are a little questionable and make no sense but as long as you remember its more like a movie than an open world rpg its still entertaining and fun. Plus the acting is really good and the dialogue and story are as well so its fine most of the time.

Finally, I see very little replayability in this game. Maybe you could run through it a few more times and find some trinkets or enjoy some of the action sequences or something but once you solve all the riddles and mysteries that's pretty much it. You can't explore new areas, or make choices to get different outcomes or unlock secret dialogue. You are on a roller coaster and while its fun there is no mystery about where it starts, what it does or where it ends no matter how many times you ride it.

Bottom line is that this is a very good game and if you have never played it you really should.  A lot of fun with absolutely stunning visuals.  The acting is top notch and the dialogue and writing is excellent.  The parkour mechanics are occasionally frustrating but not terribly so and most everything is intuitive and works well. The combat is good and the AI of the npcs is pretty good as well although a little predictable sometimes.  The only suggestion I might make is to either play some of the prior games in series or at least watch a few videos summarizing the plots of those games because if you just start with this one as I did the characters have prior relationships and adventures that you don't easily understand. They talk about old missions and experiences and even peruse old memorabilia and pictures that probably mean something to people who played those games but to me they left me a little confused.",1666575972,1666575972,True,1,0,0.520815253257751465,0,True,False,False

I think it automatically sets it based on your computers specs and you should get better performance.  You may have to lower some more settings based on your hardware. Also turn on HDR if you have it, it looks great. Uncharted 4 is Naughty Dog at its peak.  In my opinion, it is their best game and that's from someone who loved both Uncharted 2 and the Last of Us part 1.  I cannot recommend this game enough.  If you love great graphics,  art direction, story, awesome characters, fun gameplay, some puzzles thrown in then you will love this game.  You do not have to play the other Uncharted games to get into this one. There are only a few references to the other games and they take place at the beginning. The only negative is a lack of multiplayer, but the campaign more than makes up for it.  Cannot recommend the game enough,  10/10",1666562969,1666562969,True,8,2,0.574303388595581055,1,True,False,False

After roughly 4.5 hours (i.e. the average length of a full CoD campaign) I have arrived at the point that is presumably the end of the prologue and it's the first time I was given a gun to finally shoot at some bad guys in an open firefight -- and that's when I couldn't help but notice that this is a console game that was ported to the PC...

You see, as a console player, you can rely on ""aim assist""/""auto aim"" to put the bullets where the target's weak spot is, but as a PC player, the gold standard is using a mouse without any sort of aiming assistance. In consequence, guns in shooters have to be more accurate on the PC than on the consoles, because otherwise the player's aiming skills are nullified by the weapon's bullet spread -- and this is exactly what happens in this game. I really love sneaking around and putting a single well-aimed bullet into an enemies head, but the absolute insane bullet spread in this game makes any effort at aiming completely pointless -- I have to empty an entire magazine from a .45 pistol at a distance of 10 meters to bring down a single enemy and trying to serve headshots is pretty much a lottery...

Seriously, Goldeneye 64's Klobb is a sniper rifle compared to any of the guns that I have found in this game so far, and being forced to ""spray-and-pray"" in a game like this is really a downer for me... I don't see myself playing this game any further until Sony patches provides a patch that improves the bullet spread to a level that is also enjoyable for skilled no-aim-assist keyboard + mouse players. (Other console ports, like e.g. Horizon Zero Dawn, have done a lot better in this regard.)

I feel like I missed out on some of the references that were clearly from previous games, it didn't stop from enjoying this one though which still serves itself well as a self-contained story without previous knowledge really needed.

As a big Tomb Raider fan, this was very much a clone of that (not that this game stole the recipe of it, I'm sure both games influenced each other over the years), but I did have a fair amount of deja vu from my excessive TR history - but again, it didn't detract from the enjoyment of this, if anything it just made it easier to play.
Though he does 'run' far slower than Lara does, which was tedious at the start but throughout playing at a slower pace, I found I was looking at the scenery more and WOW... was the scenery worth looking at. The amount of detail and care the developers took cultivating this world was just incredible. From the interactivity with objects which you wouldn't expect, to the large expansive scenes, to the small unscripted moments, to the detail of spittle on the sink taps from brushing teeth... just wow, incredible.

One of my personal memorable moments was just in a random part of a jungle, where I had stopped randomly while eating and I noticed a lemur in a tree, then my AI companion was just wandering around waiting for me to move and as it moved near the tree the lemur ran away when it got close - like the odds of anyone seeing that seems rare, let alone notice it, and yet the programmers/modelers/scripters/animators all took the extra effort to add that in.

Honestly can't say enough good about the game and worth every cent of the full price for it.

I was worried about the studio who were porting the 2 love filled games because of their past but I'd say its safe to say that they did good with this port.
There were minor bugs here and there but nothing game breaking.
Overall the game was very well optimized for PC and the stories of the 2 games are unforgettable.
Now, I wouldn't recommend this game for now but Im still giving it a thumbs up. 
The reason is because this game is only Uncharted 4: A Thiefs End, and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy.
It is not the full franchise of Uncharted sadly. If you don't care then I full of recommend these 2 fantastic games.

Uncharted 4 is the conclusion of a series of amazing story and gameplay, its a one of my favorite games of all time, it looks insanely good and now even more on PC. It is a dream that it is here, and I recommend it to anyone but I still heavily think you must not experience it first. 

The gun play and weapon kicks, the open world elements in certain parts, physics everything is just great. It is a perfect end for Uncharted.

The relationship between Nate & Elena is well plotted and the story in general feels well fleshed out.

I would say the campaign in End of a Thief feels a little stretched, but this was true of the previous Uncharted games as well. Lost Legacy on the other hand feels a little squeezed in towards the end. Both were still enjoyable with what I felt were very warming endings.

My biggest gripe with both games, which once again, comes from the previous chapters as well, is the repetitive grind that the combat becomes after a short while, this is especially noticeable in End of a Thief with the longer storyline. There is a silenced pistol available to Chloe in Lost Legacy, which does help in this regard as well.

Lastly, especially if you take into account the obvious thought that went into the storyline, it boggles the mind as to how on earth they came to the chase sequences. It's just jarringly out of whack. Rubberbanding AI drivers, continuous respawns, roads and tracks that would make the airstrip in Fast & Furious proud. Maybe it's there for some fast paced action, I felt it was just tacky, boring and a let down when compared to the quality of the rest of the game.

I have really been looking forward to play this game, but so far (4 hours in, just started chapter 8) I'm feeling a bit disappointed.

The Pros
- story is REALLY good
- graphics is amazing
- character acting is amazing

The Cons
- gun play (PC with xbox controller) is HORRIBLE.
- game play is worse than Tomb Raider (I really expected it to be better than Tomb Raider)
- of the 4 hours I have played, I feel I have been watching a movie for probably 1 hours. Very long cut scenes.
- linear gameplay with no additional (or very little) exploration.

I'm giving it a thumb down, not worth the $50

-Semi-Open World sections are so boring, just make me play a linear game!!!

Nice.

UPDATE 10/20/22

Now I have had time to play and do a little bit of everything. Absolutely obvious they  upgraded the visuals. Runs smooth for me too. Keep in mind this game is a very good cross between game and cinematic experience. The best game play ever!!!!?? No. But serviceable. I enjoy it. Again, they mixed in cinematic seamlessly. Going hand to hand VS gun blazing is a press of a button and the moves glide together very well. Don't get me wrong, will the game sometimes break the laws of physics to string these fighting moves together? Yup! But you have a smirk and keep on moving. 

The Drake brothers are awesome! The type of duo you root for no matter what. The acting? Industry top tier. This game really does blend it all together into a action packed adventure. As a kid who loved Indiana Jones growing up, and was adventurous themselves, this series really spoke to me, even before I actually played video games. Sound design is pretty much the top of the entire industry. Graphics? Just look at them. Characters are played perfectly. 

I will say this. Sony goes for the last two entries in the entire series first is kind of crazy. This series is heavily dependent on your knowledge of past games to get the whole picture. Heck within the first 30 minutes of the game you go down memory lane from those past entries. If you played the past games, you'll enjoy. If not, you'll have an ""OK...?"" moment. I kind of get it. Sony wasn't about to RE Remake the first three games and they're obviously dropping their semi most recent banger's first. But I truly hope they just make the Drake Collection work on PC, drop it for like $30, and I think most will be understanding and thankful. Here is to hoping! 

I do not recommend going in blind. I would at least watch a story recap of the first three games, then give this game a go! If you're an action-adventure junkie like I am, give it a go! I think you'll enjoy! Within the first two hours, I'll be honest, you will not be far at all. By that time though you do get a taste of exploration, fighting, acting, puzzles, so you'll have a good grasp. However, the game doesn't really start pumping till about Chap 6/7. Watch your time closely for that refund.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1666461815,1666461815,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

It’s far from the first big well known franchises to get from being a Sony console exclusive to PC, but something about Naughty Dog’s series that always made Sony hardware look like a magic box producing game flow and transitions no one else could achieve on any other hardware, makes this port feel extremely weird. But here we are, sadly, starting at the end of the franchise, or at least a big transition point, instead of the beginning. Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, originally for PS4 from 2016 and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, also for PS4 but from 2017, combined into one package and released first on PS5 at the start of 2022 and now on PC.

Uncharted didn’t become an instant success. The first game, Drake’s Fortune, from 2007 was impressive in many ways, but also deeply flawed and often frustrating. Sure, it was a generational leap of quality in comparison to Tomb Raider: Legend from a year before and even Anniversary from the same year, but the game was often more unfavorably compared to the adventures of Lara Croft, even if visuals, animation work and character banter were praised from the start. But then Uncharted 2: Among Thieves came out in 2009 and basically redefined what a cinematic action adventure can be. And the influence of what that title has achieved can still be felt in third person action adventures today.

Very importantly, people started to really like the characters of the series and them, and the situations they got in, were key to the popularity of the second and the third titles. The stories were always just there to created a sense of adventure and motivate characters to do stuff, they were never particularly great on their own. It was the characters, the situations and extremely fun mix of adventuring and action. Which is why it is so odd to think that Legacy of Thieves Collection might be the way some people will get to first experience the series. Because for all intents and purposes, Uncharted 4 is a goodbye to the characters of the original trilogy, with the emotional core of the title being the continuation and conclusion of all of the experiences they, and you the player, went through in the first three games. While The Lost Legacy is a transition into an idea of other characters being the main heroes now, the playable character also being a returning one.

If you didn’t experience the adventures from the previous games, it’s not like you won’t understand what’s going on. It’s that you won’t feel the same way. So… Unless Sony does make a new re-release of Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection for PC and you have no way to play the first three games, unless you’ve already played them, I would strongly suggest at least watching a longplay of them or a good let’s play, like ones from Chip and Ironicus.

With this out of the way, you really have to play Legacy of Thieves Collection if you like action adventure games. I mean, holy crap are these two titles amazing. They no longer “redefine” the genre quite as drastically and now, ironically, feature even more ideas from TR: Legend, Anniversary and Underworld, except polished to near perfection. But these titles are still many steps above the titles of the same type we get today.

The action, while in my opinion still the weakest part, is incredibly cool when everything clicks just right. You seamlessly switch between stealth, sitting in cover, jumping around, using a grappling hook to throw a grenade one one swing and then drop punching someone in the face on the opposite one, then blind shooting to the next enemy only to brawl with them a bit to grab their weapon and hide for a few moments to get into stealth again. Even when there are no set piece encounters happening and it’s just a more or less normal shootout, the action is exhilarating and fun. If you don’t die immediately when trying to do all that cool stuff. It still doesn’t have the precision and agility of greats by Japanese action game greats like, say, Capcom or Platinum Games, but at least it doesn’t feel “unfair” and checkpointing is very nicely thought out.

Platforming is fantastic and the way the levels are designed is incredible. The game manages to be linear, without feeling linear, completely avoiding the typical problem of the modern Tomb Raider and the like titles, where you have one clear path through the level, always providing many different ways to get to the same necessary spot, always leading you subtly to where you need to be, without you consciously feeling the hand holding. It’s amazing how they didn’t make the climbing fully freeform and systemic, like what, say, Assassin’s Creed or Breath of the Wild strives for, while still keeping the excitement and the feeling that you are making the path, not just following one. It helps that unlike recent Tomb Raider titles, it’s very rare where these fully contextual actions like jump distances and ledge grabs or distances at which you die or not feel “fake”, so the flow of player actions almost always goes naturally.

What’s really improved as well is the puzzle design. Unlike TR franchise, Uncharted was always slightly less focused on puzzle solving aspect and it’s changed for Uncharted 4 and especially The Lost Legacy, and the way they bring these more into the forefront is really cool. And where Uncharted 4 is still more interested in the flow and guiding the players during the puzzles, The Lost Legacy often goes fully TR and lets you figure things out without any hints or comments from the characters that spoil the puzzle solving. Speaking of, The Lost Legacy also includes a really cool wide open level with several sections that you explore in any order you want and that whole thing (and the game in general) honestly feels more like a Tomb Raider than the whole “Survivor trilogy” of the Tomb Raider.

The games still look and feel astonishing and almost no magic is lost in the transition to PC and high framerates and resolutions. It’s not quite flawless, for example the pre-rendered video segments that the game sporadically uses to introduce cool crossfades from one scene to the other or other little inserts are far more noticeable, because of their lower bitrate recording and set framerate. But it doesn’t detract from just how seamless the whole experience is as you go on a globe trotting adventure without a single visible loading screen in sight (apart from when you go from the main menu into the game). There are also occasional visual bugs that can pop up that are only fixed by going to the main menu and reloading again. Keyboard and mouse controls seem to be rather meh, though I’d highly recommend playing the game as intended on a controller. And the fact that you need to launch into the game and then switch the game instead of having an external game selector is really odd. But otherwise, it’s all fixable and Sony seem eager to support their PC titles for now.

Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is incredible. There’s still nothing quite like this as far as action adventure games are concerned. Some sequences feel impossible as you’re playing them, having (almost) full control of the craziness that’s happening on screen. It’s not perfect and it is probably not going to have quite the same impact if you have not played the first 3 games. But this is still an amazing experience that you should have.",1666445124,1666445124,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

it's uncharted 4

go buy and play the damn game already

usually i would regret buying something full price

so far
i have absolutely no regrets

*edited after finishing all of uncharted 4 and lost legacy on hard difficulty*

this collection was definitely worth it, but

do yourself a favor

if you wanna have fun like those Youtube videos where Drake/Chloe are swinging around and running around like maniacs gunning everyone down

Don't play this shit on hard

I personally liked it since I like gunfights where it feels like a life-and-death struggle

But I spent most of my time in cover, and when I was running around I was panicking since my cover got blown away

Also there were a fair amount of graphical glitches, especially in cutscenes, where models would t-pose for a split second before going back to normal

I had to reset several cinematics where the sound cut out without returning

And my game started freezing towards the end of lost legacy in the final two chapters

However, I had fun

Horizon Zero Dawn, Days Gone, God of War, Spider-Man and now Uncharted, isn’t that amazing? If you think about it, you would have probably not believed this in 2019, in just 3 years the industry changed so much that it’s almost unbelievable.

Some of you are already familiar with this saga but for those who are about to jump in for the first time let me tell you that this is a great moment to do so. You will miss some of the references but I think you will enjoy the adventures by themselves even if you don’t get the full punch of some scenes and moments by missing the previous games. Let’s see if Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End and Lost Legacy are worth your time.

Let’s start with Uncharted 4.

Nathan Drake has long left behind the adventures in order to settle with Elena and live an ordinary life together, however, the past catches us all sooner or later and a new adventure is about to start. Nathan and his, until this moment unknown, brother Sam will sail on a race against time in order to beat an old partner and, perhaps, something Sam is hiding, the goal of this race? The biggest and most legendary of all pirate treasures, Henry Every’s fortune and the lost pirate nation of Libertalia.

A Thief’s End sets a very different tone for the story, while bombastic and spectacular at moments, it’s far more personal and deeper than previous entries, there’s a huge emphasis on how characters are living this adventure, for example, Nathan’s struggle between his desire of keeping a more calmed lifestyle with Elena and the pure desire of returning to the adventure of the unknown, which ends up happening, but the way he’s facing it is completely different to previous expeditions. All characters have enough time to develop themselves within the game thanks to an incredible narrative and performances, the scenes do really help building the characters, here’s my favorite example by the end of the game, [spoiler]Nathan’s performance on Every’s mansion[/spoiler], that scene alone creates a moment in which we can see a level of affection they have to each other, simply wonderful.

When it comes to Libertalia things are a bit different than previous games, while Shangri-La or Ubar had a supernatural element behind them, Libertalia feels like something more coherent for the story Naughty Dog wanted to tell here. The more we explore and learn about the city, the more detailed everything becomes, the conflict that happened, how the most prolific pirates of the era ended up building this place, etc. There's a huge narrative element about this place and its previous owners that is absolutely fascinating, probably my favorite of this saga.

What about Lost Legacy?

We will be following the steps of Nadine from Uncharted 4 and Chloe from Uncharted 2, this adventure will place us on the edge of a civil conflict in India caused by Asav, a nostalgic and ruthless warlord that wants to obtain an ancient object from the Indian culture, the Tusk of Ganesh. We will have to find it before Asav does in order to save the ancient object and perhaps stop his madness.

I would say that Lost Legacy story is a bit simpler than A Thief’s End because it feels more like a classic Uncharted game but at the same time you can feel how the team behind learned a lot from the main game. Lost Legacy was supposed to be a DLC for the main game but got too big and became its own thing and the final result is a mix between the old concepts and the new concepts in terms of scale and pace. I’m glad to see Chloe back as she was a character that had a lot of potential and I think this game truly gives her the attention she deserves. Nadine is also a very interesting one as we saw her as one of the villains from the previous game but here we can actually learn a lot from her, giving enough time and depth to all characters in order to really shine. Asav however, I think it’s a good villain but felt somewhat disconnected from the story most of the time. While it had some potential, it ended up being a flatter character than expected.

The story is good, India was an unknown place for the saga up to this day and there was so much potential, not only it has a very rich and interesting culture, but also had a lot of background that truly highlights thanks to the amazing locations we can see in this game, the temples, the jungles, it feels similar to A Thief’s End but in a more ancient scenography.

There’s absolutely no doubt that A Thief’s End and Lost Legacy are stunning games so I think it’s about time we jump into the visuals because trust me, it’s worth it.

Both Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy are the type of games in which you will most likely take a few seconds taking a picture every few minutes because every environment is stunning. In the case of Uncharted 4, each area of the game is distinctive from each other, we go from urban areas to dense jungles and tropical islands with coral reefs. It’s no secret that Naughty Dog is top tier when it comes to visuals but the amount of detail and care they put into building something that feels natural but at the same time functional is stunning.There’s also an open area for the first time in the saga, Madagascar, and while it’s a good idea in concept, it doesn’t work especially well in this entry given that it has a different pace than the rest of the game but fortunately the concept evolved and Lost Legacy was built around this kind of world structure.

When it comes to Lost Legacy, visuals aren’t less impressive, on the contrary, while there’s less variety of biomes as the story takes place in a very specific part of India, which has a lot of vegetation and forests, we find here something that we don’t see in Uncharted 4, impossibly big structures, which, at a personal level, gives this games a lot of positive points.

What about gameplay?

U4/LL’s gameplay loop is the same as  in previous entries of the saga, however the number of possibilities and animations have been vastly improved over the previous generation of games, not only animations feel more natural but also the addition of the grappling hook has improved both exploration and combat by adding a certain amount of verticality to the areas without being exclusively climbing dependant.

Gunplay is still something that I do not really like, it’s not about how it works but how it feels and I have always had this problem with ND games, that’s why I’m not saying it’s a problem but a personal perception of it, however, while the gunplay isn’t something that I like, the combats became more exciting by letting you approach it from different angles and using different approaches; Stealth, direct combat, jumping, climbing, using covers, etc… There’s a certain combat in U4 (ship graveyard, you will know the one) that sure is intensive, damn!

KB+M control is ok, weird at first but you will get used to it.

Story, visuals and gameplay have been discussed, I think it’s time to talk about sound and music. Music ain’t nothing special, sadly it doesn’t really shine as we would all have hoped, there are great tracks but overall it’s not something that stands up. Voice acting and surrounding sound design is good, the cast did an amazing job with their performances.

As for PC performance, aside from the Shader compilation process (keep that one in mind in case your temps go crazy with such processes) the PC conversion seems to be great. Steady performance and great visuals. While the game is demanding, I didn’t have problems with my rig but please keep in mind that your experience can be different.

In conclusion for this review, I’m extremely happy to see that Uncharted came to Steam. After revisiting this title for its PC debut I realized that this is in fact my favorite entry of the saga and Lost Legacy is a very worthy product too. I think you will enjoy this one a lot as a newcomer to the franchise, here’s hope to see the previous ones coming at some point too but don’t miss this packaging.",1666425805,1666425805,True,55,2,0.772241532802581787,0,True,False,False

What I'm seeing so far is amazing, it's clear why so many people fell in love with these characters and this story.

I don't know the people, I don't know the stories, and I certainly don't get the jokes. I can always continue playing as I have been, enjoy what's there with the knowledge that there will be plenty of things I won't understand. But as I progress, this seems like a game that was made as tasteful fan service. Something in the same vein as Mass Effect's Citadel DLC. Uncharted 4 seems fantastically self aware and willing to poke fun at its story and its characters, while knowing when to have slow it down and have sincere moments. The more I play, the more I feel like I'm missing out. So, in the meantime, I'm going to hold out hope that Sony ports the other Uncharted games to PC (if not, I guess I'll watch some walkthrough videos on Youtube lol).

Uncharted 4 is a game that personally will always be in my heart. Feeling the riveting action as you venture your way to find a treasure, only to fool yourself thinking that it'll finally be yours. Uncharted 4 offers many settings that no other console provides. Plus, utterly beautiful graphics was something that really caught my attention throughout gameplay. Naughty Dog has always given, us as gamers, the experience to leave us saying, ""Wow, that was a great game.""

I have an RTX 3050 card and a Ryzen 3600x. 16GB of wam will do just fine. Even on the low settings, this game still maintains the beauty that Uncharted always gives us. I  found myself reciting all the lines, this truly was one of the games that got me really, really excited. 

Really, though, can't say more. I'll just be repeating myself, haha. Overall, keep giving us these games Playstation and Naughty Dog. I can't wait to actually finish the entire game then jack it up with mods.

I played Uncharted 4 to completion when it launched back in 2016 on PS4. Playing it in this state @ native 4k with a 3090 and solid 60 fps on my TV feels great

[h1] Major Pros [/h1]

 [b] Unlocked frame rate and hugely improved visuals coming from the PS4  [/b]
 [b] Xbox controller support is spectacular. I heard a PS5 controller can be used as well for an enhanced experience  [/b]
 [b] 2 Engaging stories. It will keep you hooked to completion.  [/b]
 [b] Amazing gameplay. This includes gunplay, climbing/traversal, combat etc.,  [/b]

[h1] Major Cons [/h1]

 [b] No exclusive fullscreen [/b]
 [b] Keyboard and mouse support is quite poor. Especially mouse movement (at this time) [/b]
 [b] Cutscenes abruptly transition from video file to gameplay and it is quite abrupt. Certain cutscenes also exhibit noticeable stuttering [/b]
 [b] No multiplayer component. This remains exclusive to the PS4 version [/b]

Also, the game makes references to previous entries in the franchise (Uncharted 1,2,3) which were an integral part of Drake's story (especially Uncharted 2). I hope the original trilogy is brought to PC, so players can experience that too.

 [h1] Final Rating: 8/10 [/h1]

 [h1] TLDR: A solid PC port. Great way to experience it for the first time. You can skip this PC version, if you have already played it elsewhere (PS5 or PS4). Buy this PC version, if you have never played an Uncharted game before, or Uncharted 4 in particular. It is a masterpiece, now available on PC.

BUT i feel not happy about... i feel the game lack of fights\gunfight and N. of enemies,
and the fights it's very short and low quantity
this is my feel After the first 2 hour of CGVideos,Walk,CLimb...(after that finally i found 5 minutes of fight in uncharted 4)

during this time Fights also finish so fast in short time,and enemy quantity is very low,i think the game could be 10.000 times better if have longer fights,more enemies and if the game use the levels\maps for create + fight situations instead of only do walk\climb.

i hope i feel this because this is just the ""intro"" of the game..maybe later\after the game will have more fights? we will see.. if YES i will change my review to positive.

also looks like to me  there is not so much interactions about having inventory with objects or craft,you only must to walk\climb and go next...from one cg video\level to another...


normally in games as tomb raider,sniper elite5,sekiro,hitman 3 there is a major quantity of fights in 2 first 2 hour...

i will update my review to positive if after the first 2 hour the game add + fights,we will see..

See why critics and audience agree ""Peter Jackson has crafted a cohesive trio of films that everyone must see back to back.""   ""All three films will stand the test of time for many decades to come!!"" --- Peter Jackson's 'LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TRILOGY' -June 9th.

But then they release only the 3rd movie first. That would be utterly insane, right? 

They must have titled the game this way on purpose. Legacy of Thieves COLLECTION. They got me. Probably gonna refund and wait for first 3. Probably be cheaper by then.",1666311373,1666322819,False,19,10,0.507629275321960449,0,True,False,False

So far, a great port of a great game. Can recommend.

[h1]Performance[/h1]
The performance is good. Running the game on Ultra graphics, with DLSS on Quality. The game runs at a smooth FPS of 60+ as a minimum. Most of the time the FPS is 100+. (see specs below)

There are a few microstutters when loading a new chapter/scene which lasts a couple seconds. After that, the rest of the scene is buttery smooth. Maybe they'll fix it in an upcoming patch. (note, I'm not talking stutters every cutscene here. I mean when loading into a new chapter of the game).

[b]Specs[/b]
CPU: i5-8400
GPU: RTX 3070 Ti
RAM: 24 GB

[h1]Controls[/h1]
The controls are fine. It's obviously build for controllers, but keyboard & Mouse work perfectly fine. Aiming with a mouse is a huge improvement. I did remap a couple keys and increase the mouse-sensitivity, but these are personal preferences.

[h1]Note[/h1]
When first starting the game, it will be installing shaders. This will cause severe stuttering and framedrops. I would recommend waiting in the Main Menu for it to fully install (there is a progress bar of sorts). It didn't take too long, but didn't go fast either. For me it took 15 minutes or so, maybe a bit quicker.

From what I've heard, DLSS only takes affect after relaunching the game. So do this before starting your playthrough (if you want to use DLSS that is).",1666264295,1666292901,True,3,1,0.503759384155273438,0,True,False,False

Hey Sony… keep it coming.   We will buy as long as you release.  As much as these PS4 titles are great… and they are…. You could release PS3, PS2, PS1, PSP and Vita and we will still buy.   PlayStation is my Jam! When that PSP was released, I lost my mind… the the Vita… fantastic (still play all the time)… and then you broke my heart when the Vita was no longer supported.

Uncharted 4 brings action, witty dialogues, amazing characters and top notch animation to the table.

-It feels like I'm legit watching a high production movie while simultaneously playing it.
-The characters so far who I have been introduced to are hilarious and have a lot of depth. They don't feel like ""video game"" characters who just serve their purpose for my story.
-I love how my companions keep talking to me while I'm climbing or in combat.  In other games, my companion would say one or two line and shut up. But these companions feel like real people. They would comment on a lot of things that I'm doing and a lot times make fun of it.
-The animation quality is also something else in Uncharted 4. There was a time where Nathan scratched his ear and then scratched his nose and his nostrils also swelled up for a moment. It seems silly but these are the things that happen all the time in real life but nobody puts them in games. The animators are really on another level on this game.
- The pacing is also very good. The transition between cutscene to gameplay to cutscene again feels very very smooth. This is why it's so hard to put down this game.

-Speaking of combat. I kind of am not a fan of it. It's mediocre. 
-Same goes for stealth sections. It's not well thought out. Stealth is my favourite genre so i was looking to clear out guard posts with only stealth but it's just hard to clear out with stealth since it's not well thought out.( B is watching A and C is watching B and D is watching C. So you think of killing D but then you notice A and B are watching D. )
-Lack of puzzles also irks me. I thought Uncharted would have lots of puzzles but that is not the case. So far I have been only introduced to only one proper puzzle.

That being said I am absolutely loving this game. It's just so fun.",1666274072,1666274072,True,2,0,0.517828702926635742,0,True,False,False

It took me 4 hours...four hours to unpack this game on my PC, which is a powerhouse rig before I could play it. It actually unpacked slightly faster on my Steam Deck, which was surprising. 

With that gripe out of the way...Uncharted 4 is one of my favorite games since it released on the PS4 half a decade ago. This port to PC is pretty good but not without some issues. As every PC is different, including those with the exact same hardware that I have in my PC, everyone will have different performance or bug issues so, I'm basing my review on my own personal issues with the game. One thing I've been hearing from a lot of PC players is the mouse acceleration problem that needs patched immediately. I play using a PS5 controller so this isn't an issue for me. However, it is for others who prefer KB and mouse. Whoever thought this was a good idea? Second, as for me I'm having some visual glitching going on where characters are either hitching up or moving oddly on the screen during cut scenes. This is the only buggy issue I've experienced this far being about 3.5 hrs into the game. As for performance...it's been a mixed bag ""for me."" My PC consists of an i7 12700K w/32 GB memory and an RTX 3070. Up till the part where you climb the mountains and go to the auction, the game ran fine, with high FPS.  Since I've been here, performance has tanked for no good reason and I went from 80+ FPS at high settings @3440x1440 to low 40's and sometimes into the high 30's. I'm also getting a good bit of stuttering here. Everything ran fine up to this point. 

As for the graphics and visuals...they look great but, I can't tell much difference between the PC version and my PS5 upgraded version. Here, I only speak for myself and this is more my opinion than anything else. However, its nice to see the game be brought to PC and not be a damned Epic exclusive or a complete trainwreck. It would be awesome if they would also bring Uncharted 1,2 and 3 to PC as well. Now, if only SONY would bring Bloodborne and Demon's Souls to PC as well, I think a lot of PC players would be extremely happy. Now, do I recommend Uncharted : Legacy Of Thieves Collection? Absolutely. Especially if you play using a controller. And despite the buggy cut scene issues I've been having a long with something going on performance wise in the Chapter I'm in, I've had a blast. As for performance over on my Steam Deck....its a mixed bag. I need to tweak the game a bit and mess around with it before I give my judgement on the Steam Deck playability of the game. One thing I forgot to mention is that I wish they would have given us more in depth graphics tweaking options.

I own the PlayStation 5 Edition of Spider-Man Remastered, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, Death Stranding, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Sackboy: A Big Adventure. So have these games with PC now 2 - 3 times.

The Last of Us Part 1 Remake, which I completed on PlayStation 5, is coming to STEAM. Ghost of Tsushima is due out in 2023 (maybe) as a PC version of which I have the PS4 and PS5 editions and I'm sure Horizon Forbidden West and God of War Ragnarök will come out for PC in 2024 or 2025. I have the Collectors from Forbidden West and I have pre-ordered the Collectors from God of War Ragnarök.

I bought the PlayStation 5 because I grew up with PlayStation and because of the exclusives and timed exclusives, because I don't want to support the Epic Games Store.

But at times when I replace my ASUS ROG STRIX RTX 3090 OC with an ASUS ROG STRIX RTX 4090 OC, the PlayStation 5 becomes more and more pointless.

Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, is a great game with a great story and graphics. With Ultra Settings in 4K I didn't see any big differences to the PlayStation 5 edition.

   The Uncharted franchise is one of my favorites, the story, the characters, the setting, and the gameplay are always good (Uncharted 3 was okay on the story part), but I will say that it is weird to port the 4th and 4.5 games of the series and not including Uncharted 1-3. Newcomers will be confused and not that invested in the story as much because its the 4th installment. So I hope down the road they will release Uncharted 1-3.

   Uncharted 4 is a great game and its very nostalgic for me because Uncharted 1: Drakes Fortune was my first game to ever play on a console back in 2010, I was 8 at the time. So this game brings a lot of emotions for me and I'm glad that Uncharted 4 doesn't disappoint on delivery. Graphics are stunning... the environment is very eye pleasing, gameplay is good, the story is lovely/compelling, its a long game so it can keep you busy for awhile, the characters are so good and written well, and its so worth its price.",1666247437,1666247437,True,2,0,0.539518892765045166,0,True,False,False

To those of you that played on PlayStation: it has met and exceeded ALL expectations! The game runs as smooth as ever and comes with almost everything you got on the PS4 version plus keyboard and mouse controls to help you finally beat the game on crushing difficulty. The only part that got left out is the multiplayer. :( Perhaps a future update if we ask really nicely?

There is comfort in this lifelong passion we grew up loving. It's been with us through the thick of life, often times offering a place of solitude in the hardest of times. Given the decades of gaming ""experiences"" we have all been exposed to, it's rare to find something that truly leaves a lasting impact on you. ""We've seen it all"" mindset tends to seep in as we desperately and mindlessly stumble through the steam store looking for that next big fix. Anything to satiate that desire to wet our gaming palettes grown numb over the years. I'm here to tell you that Uncharted is that game. You'll remember this exploit for the remainder of your days, smiling reminiscently as you tell your future families of the first time you stepped into the shoes of Nathan Drake and the adventures you had together. Cutting through the humid dense forest... Speeding your boat towards the sun-drenched shores as the waves splash playfully against the hull... The glint of excitement in your eyes as you realize you're about to set off on an adventure of a lifetime...  I worry sometimes that I have lost that passion for gaming, but every once in a while, you find a game that reaffirms your love and passion has not been ill placed. Maybe you too can open your stone-cold hearts; exposed and stained from the weather of disappointment, empty promises, and Developers who aren't Sean Murray and give this game a chance.

Nothing I have ever played really compares to the memories I've had in this game.  Once you play Uncharted, your real life will become a game and this will become your new reality. If you are not in a position to go on vacations to exotic faraway lands, this is the next best thing. If you ever wanted to go on an epic adventure including: hiking, parkour, rock climbing, exploring jungles, crawling through caverns, stumbling upon abandoned ruins, flying planes across oceans, climbing steep surfaces of buildings, treasure hunting, uncovering ancient mysteries, and unearthing rare artifacts, this is the game for you. It makes everyday life seem like a marvelous grand adventure where you get to play the rightful gaming heir to Indiana Jones, and Lara Croft. The adventures you get to go on in this game are something everyone with an adventurous spirit should be able to experience at least once in their lifetime. 

One of the best things about Uncharted is the cinematic gameplay. Every moment seems like a perfectly framed scene from a movie, only you get to be the main star. The supporting characters in the game are excellent and well developed. A companion system while you are playing makes it so you never feel alone and are immersed completely. The chit chat and banter makes it feel like you are actually playing a multiplayer game with friends rather than a single player game. The Npc's are not just typical cardboard cutouts of human beings.  

This is a a great game for people who like 2d platformers but want something more realistic. It is also the best parkour game along with Mirrors Edge, Dying Light, and perhaps some of the Assassins creed games. The 3D Platforming and climbing from ledge to ledge convey a sense of danger and you have to figure out how best to climb the rock face safely. The feeling that you might fall from great heights only adds to the exhilaration. There is also a duck and cover combat system and some really cool weapons. You can also play stealthy if that is your thing. There are puzzles to solve that are reasonable and they don't get in the way of the action or adventure. The soundtrack only adds to the immersion and gives inspiration to the meaning and wonder you experience along the way. The game is by far the best adventure I have ever experienced. The experiences I've had in this game are now part of my own life experiences.

If you like the Tomb Raider series, Mirrors Edge, Dying Light, Assassins Creed Black Flag, 2d Platformers like Spelunky, or Indian Jones style movies you will love this game. I have thousands of hours total in this series including Uncharted 1,2,3 and 4 on Ps3 and ps4. And I now get to enjoy the latest remasterd installment of Uncharted 4 on pc.

Uncharted captures the mystery and wonder at the very heart of being human. And it puts you in touch with that sense of discovery and the indescribable feeling that there are still amazing things left in the world for you to discover.",1666207974,1666207974,True,2,1,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I enjoy open world games but these days it's become so saturated with games that talk up about an open world experience but in actuality it's just a huge map with tedious and repetitive missions and mundane side-quests. I would much rather play a linear game, and Naughty Dog has perfected this genre with Uncharted and Last of Us, and no other series really comes to mind when it comes to linear games besides maybe Tomb Raider (which is basically a repackaged poor man's Uncharted anyways).

For the PC port specifically, I didn't think the difference would be that huge but since I have a PS4 slim and not pro, it was pretty noticeable for me. Graphics looks much better and detailed, and most importantly the framerate is great on Ultra settings and I'm still on a 1080gtx. This is my third PC port of a playstation title and thus far they have all ran incredibly smooth without really asking for a lot of hardware in return.

I'm sure there are people that have not played the first three Uncharted games and don't have a console. I would say you can still play 4 as your first Uncharted game, you will just miss certain references and easter eggs that refer to things from the first three games. For the story of Uncharted 4 itself tho it won't be a huge problem and I would still recommend you try it, and hopefully Sony will port the rest of the series later.",1666207448,1666207448,True,1,0,0.500289201736450195,0,True,False,False
