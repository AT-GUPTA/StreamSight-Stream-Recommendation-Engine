It seems as though the creators are more interested in adding content rather than having the game be playable for those who've purchased it. The fact that this game has been in early access for nearly three years is utterly shocking. The workrate of the creators is not near what it should be with so much crowdfunding from just the early access. However there is still much fun to be had, in it's current state DayZ is a stripped down version of the mod that so many people stumbled across and loved.

Yes, I understand its early access, however, the game should be progressing and not regressing particularly with the zombie AI. The game could improve by 50% if they just removed zombies altogether and had an ""end of time apocalypse .""

The game has its highlights, but at this point you can get the same gameplay and MUCH BETTER performance from other games such as Arma 3, and H1Z1. 

I would suggest the newcomer to skip this for now, and check it out again once it is out of early access. That way they can be sure to know if Bohemia came true to their word on improving this, or they could find out that Bohemia instead took the money they have made already and ran.

VERDICT: Fun game but pass for now until more improvements come to it.

Then go servers and select the modded server you wanna play on and download the addons.

Negatives: 
(1). The game feels like it is still in early Beta. 
(2). Feels like it is 20 years old (early 2000 or something).
(3). There is no working inventory, the creators have completely failed to make it functional and intuitive.
(4). I tried to game for 20 min and still dont know how to put on clothes or quickly and effective get my rifle up. Went online checked google... but those instructions didnt work. 
(5). No real quick-button to get weapons up. 
(6). Graphics not that impressive at all. Kinda boring to be honest. 
(7). Environment interaction feels outdated
(8). There is no horror atmosphere or ""cosy-apocalypse"" feeling. 
(9). Character-editor is ancient
(9). The zombies are extremely boring ... marathon runners, no horror feeling at all. 

Positives: 
(1). No idea ... a good idea of a game I guess 

I am sorry to say that this game feelt like a huge disappointement from the very first glance of it. The game feels like it is still in Beta and really really old. They still havent figured out how to make the inventory and weapon access intuitve, and even putting clothes on is for some reason complicated. Where is the character-body-map? The place where you have a head, a torso, legs, arms etc and where you put the things you wanna wear?

Better play Rust, PUBG or any Stalker. These 3 are better in any aspect.

I would add this game feels as a very early maybe even pre-Alfa game concept where they generated a huge map added zombies and they trying to figure out what they can make out of these two things.

This game is definitely not worth it's money even if i bought it on sale.
At the current state it should cost around 2$ - 4$ maximum.
Even in this price range (2-4$) you will find lots of much more engaging games to play.
Don't Starve Together for example if you want a survivor.

Lots of running through fields or forest hoping to find a town. No in game map so usually not totally sure where to go.

The game isn't really hard, you just need to be lucky and get spawned in were it hasn't already been looted. It almost always has so you need to run somewhere else hoping it isn't empty too or server hop.

I think if you are playing with a bunch of friends on a private server that has the loot boosted it might be fun.  Especially if you have all day to play.

But I seem to spend a lot of time on loading pages as a casual solo player. Not a lot of game time doing anything but running.

Not a lot changed after 7 more hours, but, the loot seemed less absent so I assume they have shortened respawn time. Stuff like water bottles & rocks are still just painfully slow to find. Melee combat rather jerky so it feels off.",1684288072,1708594120,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

DayZ is first and foremost a survival game...when you first start playing. For your first probably 8 hours you will be lucky if you find 6 or 7 people, and you will probably end up starving to death, getting ganked by a gang of zombies, torn to shreds by wolves, or get a seemingly incurable disease that causes you to throw up, but then eventually goes away but you are dying of thirst (because of the throwing up), so you go and drink a bunch of water from a water source that looks really crystal clear, but then you realize that your food bar is low, so you go and kill, skin, and cook a chicken that you find, then eat said chicken, only to realize that your hands were covered in blood so you get sick from that, but luckily you had the right items to cure it so you are a-ok! Then you realize the water you drank from was actually not clean and end up getting sick from that and then suddenly realize that the wolves that you had escaped from earlier ended up chasing you and are now camping outside the building you are in, so you run away to a town and end up getting shot by a random guy who now has to deal with a pack of wolves. In other words, DayZ is brutal. DayZ is unforgiving. DayZ doesn't tell you anything. DayZ forces you to sit down and use the god damn sun to figure out which way is which and-

Ok let me compose myself. That was a pretty good description of the first 10-20 hours of DayZ for the average player. You run around lost and confused, but still have fun because you know, deep down in your bones you are actually making progress. So lets talk about the next 80 hours of play. DayZ disguises itself as a zombie survival game, with building, farming, fishing, hunting, etc. but do you want to know what DayZ really is? DayZ is a psychological horror multiplayer shooter game. Let me set the scene.

It's nighttime, and you are in the east side of NWAF (That being the NorthWest AirField) and you suddenly hear a shot coming from VERY close by. By very I mean right outside the building you are looting. You quickly swap to your gun, but you realize its not fully loaded. You quickly swap to a full mag and wait and listen. You hear footsteps stomping around. You are on the second floor, hiding in a room with 2 windows. You don't know if this player is alone but you do know that they most likely can-and will-kill you. You hear the sound of the 1st floor door open and go to prone in front of the closed door of your room. You wait as the player runs around, opening doors and looking for loot. You hear him run up the stairs and ready yourself. He opens the door and you hold your breath and fire, landing a clean headshot, dropping him. You stand up, walking over to loot the body an-he was naked. No items on him, no nothing. You hear a quiet ""crack!"" and your screen goes dark. This was a real encounter I had within the game, and it had turned out that the player had a friend in the ATC tower not far from the building I was in who was ready to snipe me. When you reach a certain point of the game the main emotion you feel is anxiety. At any moment someone could end you. Someone from 1500 feet away could just so happen to see you and drop you at a moments notice. Someone could be hiding in a bush as you run up to go and loot that hunting stand that they placed a bear trap at the foot of. Someone could be gunning down the road at 40 mph in a Gunter and flatten you on the pavement. DayZ is a game of constant death and rebirth. It is the ultimate feeling of ""Am I being watched?"" and the answer, 9/10 out of 10 is no, you aren't...but it doesn't matter, because that 1/10 means you need to constantly be on alert. No lights, no gunfire unless absolutely necessary, and no, and I repeat NO glowsticks. The thing I see people do all the time is they throw their glowsticks on their backpacks at night because its ""too dark out wah wah wah"", DONT DO THAT. That is like a beacon to anyone with so much as a god damn revolver. DayZ players are like moths, they see a light in the dark they go to it. 

Thanks for reading my DayZ short story, please buy and play this game immediately so you too can feel like a PTSD stricken Iraq veteran!",1708549216,1708549216,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The item spawn system sucks, it just does, there is never anything good (or anything at all) spawning in the map.
I don't even know why there is PVP in the game when you're never in any shape or form to fight anyone.
No guns, no equipment, nothing, and even if you are it takes way too much time to get to that level, just to die in a shitty gun fight.

After recently watching some footage of the game, I really liked a lot of things that were in the game, and its mechanics (although DayZ was always a bit too realistic to me to be fun).

I just want to point out, I bought this hoping for less hackers (unlike arma 2 mods) and for more content updates.

We are ALMOST 10 years further friends! And this game has yet to have an actual working airplane, an actual working helicopter, a large variety of cars such as the Arma Mod has..

10... Years... Recent update? they added some camo helmets, a gun and a clip. Woopiedie doo.

Im sorry man, but when I quit playing this around the same time that review was posted, it was due to hackers being just as available here as on Arma, and although im unsure if its the case, imo you're better off taking the L on the graphics and the possible hackers and playing Arma for its cool variety of : Taviana and the many mods like origins that came with it.

once upon a time in the magical land of uwu, where rainbows danced and fluffy clouds giggled, a phenomenon known as ""uwu"" emerged, spreading joy and adorableness across the digital realm. Uwu, a term derived from cute anime expressions, has become a language of its own, transforming ordinary sentences into delightful expressions that warm the heart.

In the enchanting world of uwu, words are sprinkled with extra love and affection, creating an atmosphere of sweetness and innocence. The journey begins with a simple ""hewwo"" instead of the traditional ""hello,"" immediately setting the tone for a whimsical adventure. As we delve deeper into the uwu-speak, we encounter endearing phrases like ""nyaa~,"" ""pwease,"" and ""notices ur bulgy wulgy,"" each contributing to the charm of this delightful linguistic landscape.

Uwu is not just a language; it's a feeling, a sensation that wraps around you like a cozy blanket made of marshmallows and rainbows. When faced with a challenge, the uwu spirit encourages us to ""nyuzzle"" through difficulties, replacing stress with a positive, uplifting energy. Uwu, with its magical powers, turns frowns into smiles and transforms even the gloomiest days into a pastel-colored wonderland.

Communication in the uwu realm often involves the generous use of ""owo"" and ""UwU,"" symbols of wide-eyed adoration and admiration. Whether expressing excitement about a new adventure or sharing a heartfelt sentiment, the uwu language adds an extra layer of sweetness that resonates with the gentle rustling of cherry blossoms in spring.

One cannot escape the influence of uwu without encountering its adorable mascots - cute, fluffy creatures like kittens, bunnies, and pandas. These uwu ambassadors frolic in meadows of positivity, spreading happiness and warmth wherever they go. In the uwu world, even the most mundane activities, like sipping on a cup of tea or reading a book, become kawaii adventures filled with uwu magic.

As we navigate through the uwu-scape, it's essential to embrace the spirit of innocence and playfulness that defines this extraordinary language. Uwu teaches us to approach life with a childlike wonder, finding joy in the smallest of things and celebrating the beauty of simplicity.

In conclusion, the wondrous world of uwu invites us to express ourselves with a sprinkle of magic and a dash of cuteness. It's a realm where kindness reigns supreme, and every interaction becomes a delightful journey through fields of uwu blossoms. So, dear reader, may your days be filled with uwu joy, and may your heart forever resonate with the enchanting melodies of the uwu language.",1708533615,1708533736,True,0,0,0.479797959327697754,0,True,False,False

After playing games for 50 years, tens of thousands of hours from text adventures to Cyberpunk, From Atari, Amiga's, Nintendo's, Playstations, Amstrads, PC's, Spectrum, Saturn to PS5 and PCs. 

For most games i've always worked to play the game until it's relative conclusion. For linear games to the last chapter whilst for non-linear sandbox games until I've completed a satisfactory number of goals and achievements (personal or otherwise). Indeed the vast majority of games i've finished to that effect

Day Z is one of the few games that are an utter waste of time. Their a tar baby trap. A failure of design and purpose. Minecraft has more purpose then Day Z.  

The public servers are empty and boring, kilomtres of literally nothing, towns and villages filled with zombies but not much else. All of the good items cleared out already by sociopaths who wait for hours to kill unsuspecting new players. 

Unless you stealth 100% of the time you'll eventually be caught by zombies, or you'll die of thirst and starvation with the water pumps being surrounded by campers and zombies. Pretty much all you can find are branches. Guns are crap, broken or with little to no ammo. There is zero support or help even on private servers where there is absolutely nothing going on. And jeebus the amount of hiking you do in this game is ridiculous.  

And this is from someone who loved flashpoint, who played the hell out of it. My favourite was to go off mission, sneak into a russian army base, steal a Shrike or Hind and just go to town on the enmy.

If you don't know DayZ, watch a video, do not go without knowing the basics.

Remember to have mic, this is a very social game, talking can save your life. (it can also kill you)

What to do? : Try to see how much time you last alive.
Be noisy freshie and get killed by zombies.
Repeat.
Get killed by players
Get betrayed, uninstall.
Reinstall  --------> *misery starts here*
Git gut.
Git gud some more ------>  *Good Gear comes here* 
Kill players
Be an asshole.
Still an asshole but more relaxed.
ADDICTED STATUS:  you will rarely play other games

- Food And Drink system is wack, cant go 20 minutes without food or drinking it seems
- No information given, you will spend more time tabbed out, or looking at a second monitor as a new player great if your a Youtube fanboy
- Melee Combat is garbage... 
- Looting is stingy and there is way too much crap
- Storage System is insane/ for keeping loot ""storing"" smoke another one... 
- Can't set a spawn point?

It has so much potential and the overall idea is awesome - you spawn into a hostile world and try to survive with other players. The problem is that it seems incredibly unlikely to be able to find the initial tools so that you don't starve to death right from the start. To make a fire you need small stones. Even these are mostly not there. I once found a fishing rod, but died before I could find something to dig up worms for bait. And so it goes, endlessly re-spawning, looking for something to keep you alive, and dying. Every 15 minutes.

Not a noob friendly and bug glitch still present. Yes i know it's better than BETA but 7 years to polish with Bohemian help. That's not too good for me. And please when i want to throw something it doesnt mean i want to bury it under the ground fix it please. Also if you solo hope you enjoy with 4 hours of died of hunger and respawn. This game is real damn obsolete the engine is somewhat questionable. Maybe it's BIGNESS of ARMA engine i guess. UI and accessibility is meh but i see an improvement. 

But! Sound effect is pure magic thanks to ARMA legacy. The conflict of this game is really cool, human vs human vs zombie vs environment vs health condition, very interesting i have to hat off to that. Mod support is very cool for casual playtime. Co op experience with this game? Addictive and those ARMA OG will feel right at home. 

I'd refrain myself to comment about vehicle since i haven't make it out to any cars.

EDIT : update for car
It's she3t dont bother try to drive it unless you find an server that prevent a damage. Or else the car will brick itself.

It's ok. Too much zombies

Then they released the Standalone, of course I bought it 10 minutes after the release. I was totally hyped about this game after enjoying many many hours playing the mod.

What happened next? nothing. They screwed it up using the Arma engine, this engine is not ready to move DayZ as it should. The devs increased the team members but they are developing the game the same way than a monkey uses a pc. One steps up and three steps down. 

Alpha? yeah sure that's a great excuse. The team leader (Dean Hall) decided to leave the project at the end of the year, why? well I guess that he is not ready to asume that his game is not going to advance in a good way so better to step away.
Brian Hicks? doing non-sense streamings where you need to pay 5$ if you want to subscribe to his channel. Yeah you don't really need to do it to be aware of his streamings, but it's only about principles. Man, you are making pay 5$ to your, already, customers in order to show them how do you play that shitty game and you don't even answer basic questions that they do in your chat. But hey, I guess that this is because you don't even know how to develop a game so answering basic questions about it makes your life pretty hard.

Anyway, I wanted this game to be the best game ever, but I guess that it will be a decent game only when the modders will be able to mod it, the future of this game is in their hands.

I don't really need to talk about hackers, bugs, etc. because there are enough people talking about them, and what they say in general is the reality of this game.

Don't buy it, at least until 2016.

Edit on 2019: Don't buy, at least until 20XX

You either die of hunger, thirst or some type of infection before you can find anything that will let you actually progress in the game.

How are players supposed to survive if finding the absolute basics for survival are next to impossible to acquire. I am not asking for hand holding, I liked how independent the game is, but there just are not enough basic loot items. 

Like just add more of the absolute basics to spawn areas. Plastic water bottles that only have a small amount of water left, more canned food that only feeds you a small portion, more basic heals so when you get an infection you can actually heal yourself. 

The game is literally unplayable in the current state and the servers are proof of that, Majority of servers are sub 10 people.

BUT, because of players and passionnate developpers with less skills for the most part than the developpement team but with better brains and better ideas, have transformed this game in modded servers. There so much diverse proposition, SO FAR away from the base vanilla experience that sucks hard and hasn't move that much in 5 years.

So i dont recommand the game itself but the community that worked hard to upgrade their shi**y game. Ones of the best modding community out there with the Escape From Tarkov SPT modding community and the ones from Stalker GAMMA. So keep that in mind, you will have to take time to test servers, to find the best ones, download hundreds of the Gigas of mods for the most complete ones, before enjoying great games with great communities. See the 39.99€ as a access cost to those servers, cause Vanilla is really, REALLY, trash. That much trash that it hurts me to give a recommandation of DayZ and let this shitty management team take the pat on the shoulder when it should be modders that worked so hard for free. 

Review is over, but here is a little story for people interested in :

People see them as real Bohemian Interactive, but the real team for BI as always been focus on ARMA and are doing a fantastic job there for many reasons, DayZ Team is the shi**y part with managers that listen their EGO and who fired really competent developpers with awesome ideas that u see in other games cause their ideas were for the most part so much better than the managing team and their EGO saw them as danger cause so far away from their level of competence. To talk about one example in mind, see Road To Vostok ? This insane loot dispersion mechanic ? Where the solo developper made the loot kind of spawn in a grenades in middle of rooms and then blow up before player comes in and so loot is disperse randomly behind furnitures, in corner of the rooms, NOT LIKE DAYZ where loot is put in so unatural places. So this idea he took from a ex DayZ developper that wanted to put this genius idea in DayZ, but it was not the boss developper idea so even if it was a pretty genius idea, he forced him to work on the shit*y loot disposition we always knew in DayZ. This  is one example. End of the story, i felt like it was important to insist on the modders community of DayZ being the reason of the success and not the DayZ official team.

But I think it was fair for the game given the circumstances surrounding it.

Since then the game has improved dramatically.
Combat is back to being fun, brutal and rewarding. Movement is life in DayZ so you must manage your stamina.
(I would like hiding in trees to me a little more effective, though.)

The option of starving to death is much reduced, with game, fruits and mushrooms being available you're chances of survival are actually reasonable.

Overall the loot is much more balanced and the game is actually fun to play.

DayZ, the epitome of zombie survival games, has been a staple in the gaming community since its inception. With its immersive world, challenging gameplay mechanics, and intense gunplay, DayZ offers a truly unique experience in the survival genre. However, like any game, it has its flaws. In this review, I'll delve into the aspects of DayZ that make it both exhilarating and frustrating.

Aspects I Enjoyed:

Immersive Gameplay:
DayZ's greatest strength lies in its ability to immerse players in a post-apocalyptic world where survival is paramount. From scavenging for resources to avoiding hostile players and infected, every moment in DayZ feels tense and realistic. The open-world environment is beautifully crafted, offering a vast and diverse landscape to explore.

Punishing and Challenging:
Surviving in DayZ is no easy feat. The game is unforgiving, with harsh consequences for mistakes and poor decision-making. Food and water are scarce, diseases can quickly debilitate your character, and the threat of other players looms constantly. This level of challenge adds to the game's intensity and keeps players on their toes at all times.

Rewarding Progression:
Despite its difficulty, DayZ offers a sense of accomplishment unlike any other game. Every successful scavenging run, firefight, or interaction with other players feels like a small victory. Progressing from a helpless survivor to a well-equipped and skilled survivor is incredibly rewarding and keeps players coming back for more.

Amazing Gunplay:
Gunplay is one of DayZ's standout features. Firearms feel weighty and realistic, with each shot carrying significant consequences. The sound design further enhances the experience, immersing players in the chaos of combat. Whether engaging in a firefight with other players or fending off infected, the gunplay in DayZ is both thrilling and satisfying.

Aspects I Didn't Enjoy:

Janky Movement:
While the overall immersion of DayZ is impressive, the movement mechanics can feel clunky and unresponsive at times. Character animations can be awkward, leading to frustrating moments during intense encounters. Improving the fluidity of movement would greatly enhance the gameplay experience.

Lackluster AI Zombies:
One aspect of DayZ that falls short is the behavior of the infected. While they pose a significant threat in large numbers, their AI can feel simplistic and predictable. Adding more variety to their behavior and making them more intelligent would make encounters with infected more dynamic and engaging.

Limited Environmental Interaction:
In a game focused on survival, it's surprising that players cannot interact more with the environment. Specifically, the inability for zombies to break down doors feels like a missed opportunity. Allowing infected to pose a threat even within fortified structures would add an extra layer of tension to gameplay.

Conclusion:
DayZ remains a standout title in the zombie survival genre, offering unparalleled immersion, challenge, and reward. Its intense gun play and unforgiving game play mechanics keep players engaged for hours on end. While it has its flaws, such as janky movement and lackluster AI, the overall experience of DayZ is truly exceptional. For those willing to brave its harsh world, DayZ offers an unforgettable journey through the apocalypse.",1707774221,1707774221,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Although some things implemented are good, the majority of the things are bad. The game is in an OK state but lightyears away from being complete, mostly for all the missing content, bugs and recurring broken promises of their so called ""roadmaps"" throughout the years. 

They made players wait for 5 years for a release of a new engine with maybe not even 1/3 of the previous content, core mechanics that are questionable not to mention all the bugs that came with that. Now the latest; they made a DLC and ported the game to other consoles and lead developers that are leaving the company for new people to probably to the same thing over and over again. 

This game is an absolute disaster of management and when presenting the issues to others in the steamcommunity it's like talking to a wall. When posting criticism about the game, you've got these, lets call them ""defenders"" of the game. The moderators don't have a problem of these defenders giving pejorative response like ""go play something else instead"" or ""have you tried this in real life"" but if you call the them ""DayZfanboy"" well then you better watch out for the moderators for namecalling. 

I like the alpha version 62 much more than the current version. Many things were better than todays version: 

The map felt more original, the bulletcracks made your heart race from 0 to 100, melee attack animations was much better, the good old Arma 2 ambient sound was much natural and better, weather much better (no constant rendering distance fog), ragdoll

Good things in current dayZ:

Stamina, better weaponsway, vaulting, trails in the forest, camphouses. That's pretty much about it.",1544736724,1707770166,False,0,0,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,False

Sometimes it might be fun to stash food, weapons and ammo in a box somewhere but anything bigger than that will feel like a waste of time once your base gets raided.

Gunfights feel different from any other game I've played. No other game makes my heart race like DayZ does because it's so unforgiving and it can all be over in an instant.

What I would suggest is putting love into the official servers where many players end up and make them the best experience possible and even more desirable than some of the incredible modded servers where the true value of this game rests.

This game does a terrible job at making the game play fun. The game is not immersive the map is huge and they have taken no steps to make it easier to move around the map. This could be solved with something as simple as a bicycle and various bicycle spawns through out the map. Or even making cars or ATVS that are more commonly spawned like why are there no running cars? Chernaurus isn't in the stone age. There needs to be ways to maneuver the map because to a new player this game seems like a running simulator. Also don't even get me started with the desync it is terrible zombies go through walls cars drive piss poorly and half the time there's a chance you can just fall through the map. Also there is no endgame to this game its just spawn die spawn die if anybody is going to play it there has to be some sort of base or home building that isn't so poorly done that makes it so you can actually work towards doing something like basic quality of life things that groups or players can work towards like maybe a work bench/crafter that can make late game items. There must be ways players can for sure interact with other players whether it be for pvp or just an immersive experience with voip. Modded is the only bearable way to even play the game and its still shit experiences because the game is shit. The devs need to do SOMETHING because they never do anything to begin with, no good updates or anything its all gibberish. If something is not done the game will continue to die.

I've crushed people with helicopters, handcuffed and tea-bagged players after breaking their knees. Beaten men to death with a hammer for a can of bacon. Forged friendships with people, through gunning down poor freshies for the clothes off their back.

It was dusk, a little bit foggy, and I was walking by myself through the forest. I could hear somebody. stalking me. Got to a clearing I saw what it was. It was a. wolf I thought he'd would leave  me, but that's not the case. Followed me. Started biting me. and I found safety. on a half wall from one of those ruined houses. Since I was bit, I was bleeding and I. did not have any bandages left, so I took off my shirt, cut it up for rags. And as I did that, they fell to the ground right next to the wolf. Now the wolf was just sitting there waiting for me. He was not gonna leave and I was bleeding to death. So as a very desperate. last chance to save my life. I jumped on him. And started stabbing with my knife. and I killed him.  Well, all seems good. except for the fact that I had my headphones on and I. am living in a hotel  30 minutes later. It was a knock on my door. Damn, it sounded like a cop knocking on the door. I look to the people and sure enough, there's three officers. I opened the door. and acting really funny. Asking me Questions. and then the officers said,"" well, there's no way to put it other than someone called and complained that you had killed somebody"". It's a big mistake. And then about three or four minutes into that conversation, it dawned on me. that during that wolf incident, I was probably a little louder than I should have been screaming."" I killed it. I killed it.""  And then I invited him into the hotel. He took one look at my PC and said Yep, big mistake.",1707063028,1707063028,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Things have since, progressively gotten to a state of disgust.) This game is amazing. Tons of potential to be had here. Just try playing without a kill on sight policy. Way more rewarding fun and enjoyable. Plus handcuffing unsuspecting people is great. 10/10 For the most tense situations I have ever seen in a video game even if they are caused by other players.

*Edit 1* After well over a year of waiting for something to happen to the goddamn zombies, I have decided to thumbs down. They keep adding more muddled shit into the game to keep the retards in the player-base flooded with useless items. Fix the goddamn zombies. The developers ran off with the communities money and blew it on hookers cocaine and a trip to Nepal. This is just sad had so much potential but due to bad development choices and Dean Hall taking the money to the top of Mount Everest and throwing it over the side. Only to then slip and slide down the side of it Scrooge McDuck style over the loot.

*Edit 2* Please rename this game to DAY you assholes took out the Z.

*Edit 3* 12/30/15  - Decided since DayZ has been out for an eternity I would try it again. Fired up just fine only to find there are maybe 4 servers total that are visible ? It's 2:47 EST and there isn't an open slot anywhere. So what now you have to rent a server just to even be able to play this ? Heard there were Zombies back in and was going to check them out. Unable to do that. Used to bug report and such but pretty much most bug reports were ignored. All in all unsure how this game will turn out at this point. On one hand it could be relabled and sold as the most dangerous hiking simulator in existance! On the other it has soured its people by allowing things to get this dire. I still hope I will wake up and one day this game will be better than the mod and completely blow me away but I am starting to doubt it. So much potential and most of it will probably be wasted.

*Update 01/23/2024*
10 Fucking years and zombies still hit through walls and all that fun shit. You would think after all this time they would at least get the most important basic feature of the game to be half decent. Melee still sucks ass.

5. Меня выебали в жопу, но я доволен.

6. Я покупал DayZ чтобы получить удовольствие и расслабиться.
что я получил: 
- усиленное чувство тревоги
- постоянное ощущение слежки
- нервозность

7. Взяли в плен, изнасиловали, убили, но игра годная.

The world is POINTLESSLY big. I run miles going fuck-knows-where just to find a can of vegetables, as I'm looking for literally any indication of which way goes inland. You know, the part of the map where you can actually find supplies worth a shit. 

Nobody plays this game to get lost. Your ""realistic aspect"" of dropping me into a huge ass world with zero means of navigation sucks.

Are you fucking kidding me? What am I Bear Grylls? What's the premise of the game again? I thought I was here to fill backpacks with stuff and engage other survivors but I am literally just trying to figure out which direction takes me towards actual loot after being spawned in the middle of bum**** hills actual miles from anything interesting.

Not fun. If this is fun for you, you have way too much time on your hands. On what planet is it fun to be dropped in a 142-sq mile map and just ""expected"" to find your way around?

Wow. Very realistic, guys. You should add a feature to put the half-broken makarov I found after five hours of scavenging in my mouth and pull the trigger when I'm bored as hell and can't be convinced to trek another five miles to find anything that isn't useless. 

This ""game"" isn't a game. It's a part-time job that manages to somehow be less entertaining that my actual, day-to-day IRL job. It is literally more enjoyable to get in my car (Yeah, my real car) and drive to work for a shift than to play this game.

By lineage of this game, you can trace back the success of most modern first person shooters. DayZ lead to clones such as WarZ, Infestation, and most importantly H1Z1. Soon after, H1Z1 introduced a new game mode that began to rapidly outpace any competitors in the field, the Battle-Royale. And the rest is history. 

DayZ itself however has been anything but left behind. Instead of switching to the money-making formula that it helped grandfather after a failure of a launch, they stuck their nails in the dirt and got to work. DayZ today is THE zombie apocalypse simulator, and even as new DayZ-like gamemodes pop up around such as the extraction-shooter, DayZ continues to run with a strong community of players. 

The quality of the simulation is beyond anything I've seen to date in a video game. The complex crafting system relying on the word-of-mouth of players themselves straight out of a real apocalypse movie, (although you'll most likely learn most of your crafting skills through youtube videos) the way real life knowledge of astronomy can help you navigate the maps (since the stars that are out at night are all in their accurate real-life positions), and dynamic player interactions leading to Tarantino-quality stories being written in the moment. 

I've never known what it means to EXPERIENCE a media product like all the Christmas movies advertise. But DayZ is an experience. Thousands of experiences. You will meet cannibal death cults. You will meet dying people who will stick you up and steal your blood so that they can inject it into themselves. You will meet apocalyptic taxi services. You will be followed by hordes of zombies only to have shots ring out and the zombies fall one by one, and when they are all dead you will look around and never meet your savior. You will meet all these people, you will become these people. This is DayZ- this is your story.

To anyone considering purchasing, I would personally recommend finding a good community-lead server. I personally play on Survival of the Fittest, which takes place on a community-made map called Namalsk, but if freezing to death every ten minutes isn't your thing, Chernarus is the perfect beginner map.

The idea that they would never be able to fix interactions with zombies. 
Turns out to be true.
The zombies will phase through you all while still being stuck against you and will stick you in a corner with no means of escape as the zombie swings in a random direction and hits you over and over again all while being 10 feet away and pressed right against you at the same time.

I'm running around while listening on Discord to what my friends are doing 10 kilometres down-coast. Them coming to meet me isn’t really worth anyone’s time, because they’re going towards a direction of scarcity, while they themselves are struggling to find any food.

There is no groups in the game. So, from the 4:30 hours I spent playing the game, I really spent 4:10 hours holding Shift-W, only to be annoyingly interrupted by the hunger or thirst systems. Maybe 15 minutes was spent listening to my friend struggle to figure out how to cook a piece of chicken while I was eating a burger IRL, and the other 5 minutes was spent where we finally met up, one friend died of starvation (or food poisoning?), despite having eaten three chicken fillets mere 3 minutes ago.

Next I died a couple of minutes later, because we were again hastily B-lining to their new spawn location, except I was wet due to running in rain previously. Don't get wet in this game, because it'll undo you faster than any zombie can hope to. Maybe the rain is radioactive; I don't know, it's not explained.

The various systems surrounding hunger/thirst/stamina are superficially interesting and I’d even say a step in the right direction, but—just like me and my friends—are 10 kilometres away from emergent gameplay mechanics. You eat 3 chicken fillets (called steaks), only to be dying of hunger some 15 minutes later. The characters run out of breath after running for about 20-30 metres (might be a sprint, but still), and there’s no way to improve your character’s meagre stamina.

There’s a good layer of complexity with the cooking and crafting system, but it feels like that sucked all the creative juices out of the team.

Melee combat, which is the only thing available to you—unless RNGesus looks upon you and spawns you near a gun or some bullets—is incredibly janky. Zombies clip through you, and their AI is so dumb you can either not fight them or just glitch them and kill them.Engaging with the zombies is largely a waste of time too, since you’re not rewarded in any way for doing so.

The UI leaves a lot to be desired for. Sometimes you can’t arbitrarily equip or unequip things, it requires a weird “shuffling” dance before it lets you swap gear (and I don’t mean moving inventory items, that system in itself is fine). The game doesn’t tell you why you can’t equip things, other than a red border, but the border is sometimes green and you still can’t equip things.

World interactions are inconsistent. Some bushes you can break for branches, some you can’t. You kinda develop a half-intuition for which bushes you can interact with. There’s a rubble of rocks, and there’s a singular rock that can be picked up from it to be used as a weapon (similar to rocks on tracks). Some rocks have a 3D model that elevate them from the texture (there is no normal mapping in the game as far as I can tell, which is bizarre for a game released in the past decade), but you can’t tell if you can interact with the rock or not; mostly the answer is no, but there’s the occasional special rock that you can pick up. Seems arbitrary.

Ladders are extremely buggy. I died a few times because the character refused to interact with a ladder to go down. Sometimes it works, but most of the time it does not. Crouching doesn’t help, inching forward slowly doesn’t help either (that’s how I died). You can spam the interact button until your finger rots off.

Now, don’t get me started on doors. They just yeet you when you open them. Sometimes they half-clip you through a wall, and then your camera starts shaking so much that the game should have an epilepsy warning for this thing alone. This makes interacting with the door sometimes nigh impossible, because the interact prompt just keeps getting shaken off the screen. So you’re left shaking your mouse and spamming the interact button while praying it sticks.

Tl dr: everything about this game feels less than half-baked, and unseasoned.",1706652724,1706659203,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As time passes DAYZ keeps getting better and better. The community has been continuously growing. The Devs have fixed a lot of problems, made server stability much better, and are stil adding new things.
What with the steam workshop existing and modding existing, DAYZ is so much better. Modding and custom servers with new maps, new everything is great. 
Overall lots of fun and getting closer to the same vibe as Old DAYZ-mod",1507871085,1706589837,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,True

But, do NOT ever expect this game to be anything more than it already is. It's now a cash cow for Bohemia to make 6+ more modern games... and rebuild it's primary ARMA game (as of Jan 2024).

It's a very old game (SA released 2018) that gathered over 267+ million USD gross revenue to date, on Steam alone (vginsights dot com> game> 221100). But Bohemia has yet to rebuild its dual (graphix/physics) architecture onto a more modern and stable single engine platform. Modern games also use browser platforms to keep cheating down, but not dayz.

Bohemia would rather build 6 different newer games with all that money rather than deal with the primary issues of the Dayz. Cheating, bad internet timing, and AI/player glitching (which is part of internet timing).

And that's why I don't recommend this very old game... So many other games have advanced past this one in terms of skill and quality for pvp looter shooters, like Tarkov for one (even with all Tarkov's hackers). And Dayz mod'ers are producing more quality content than the company itself. Which Bohemia seems to be content to add only old weapons and backpacks previously taken out, or taken from ARMA/Vigor games.

It is challenging, but this brings the fun. You end up craving to learn and go again and again into the frey of what adventure you are looking for. There is PVP, PVE, and in each you can do your own roleplaying with different characters. You can live to help others, be a lone hunter, be a bandit, be a cannibal, tank up as a soldier, go light as a sniper, scavenger, form a team... ect. This is the best game for replay-ability and with the added maps and mods on DZSALauncher, there is just so much you can do. If you run out of things to do then you lived to 1 million. The game is harsh and unforgiving, but this makes it the most rewarding game out there for the things you accomplish, and the stories you get from your experiences are truely one of a kind. I would rate this 10/10 as a game and i would of paid more for it than i did, which i would never say about another game. If you read a bad review on this game it is when it was not from someone who played it recently. Check it out, it is worth it! Edit: Almost at 2k hours and its still the best game out there!

The game offers a plethora of options in its survival simulator, making each playthrough a unique and unpredictable experience.

The difficulty level of DayZ is not for the faint of heart. From scarce resources and relentless zombies to hostile players, every decision could be a matter of life or death. The game's steep learning curve adds to its appeal, rewarding players who invest time in mastering its intricacies.

One of DayZ's standout features is the thriving community. The game's open-world environment fosters player interactions, both cooperative and confrontational. Joining forces with others is essential for survival, but trust is a rare commodity in this unforgiving landscape. The social dynamics create a rich and dynamic experience that goes beyond the game's mechanics.

Realism is at the core of DayZ's design philosophy. Whether it's the need to manage your character's health, temperature, or nutrition, every aspect feels grounded in reality. This commitment to realism extends to the game's environmental details, providing stunning vistas and a meticulously crafted world that truly immerses players in the post-apocalyptic setting.

Graphically, DayZ delivers impressive visuals, especially when it comes to the expansive landscapes and atmospheric effects. The attention to detail in the environment, from abandoned towns to dense forests, enhances the overall immersion. While character models and animations may not be cutting-edge, the overall aesthetic contributes to the gritty and authentic feel of the game.

In conclusion, DayZ is a game that demands dedication but rewards players with a uniquely challenging and immersive survival experience. The diverse gameplay options, active community, and commitment to realism make it a standout choice for those seeking a true survival challenge in a post-apocalyptic world.",1706353383,1706353383,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is no loot anywhere on the map despite the fact you can go into a large structure and find absolutely nothing, most of the buildings have got multiple doors that you are unable to open, they couldn't  decide on whether the doors open outwards or inwards, finding a simple stone is impossible despite walking along railroad tracks.

On a balmy afternoon, Ringoding, a character as vibrant and lively as his name implied, and I embarked on an impromptu exploration through the bustling streets of the city. With his infectious laughter and penchant for adventure, Ringoding led the way to a quaint boutique that beckoned with its eclectic display of garments. The air inside was a melange of fabrics and the soft hum of conversation, providing a fitting backdrop for our spontaneous escapade.

As we navigated the racks of clothing, Ringoding's eyes gleamed with excitement when he spotted a kaleidoscopic array of T-shirts. Each one seemed to tell a unique tale through its design, and amidst this riot of colors, Ringoding's enthusiasm bubbled over. Suddenly, he halted in front of a particularly eye-catching T-shirt, adorned with a whimsical pattern that mirrored the spirit of our camaraderie. Without missing a beat, he insisted that I try it on, convinced that it was destined to become an emblem of our shared moments and inside jokes.

The shirt, with its vibrant hues and quirky design, seemed tailor-made for our friendship. Ringoding, ever the spontaneous soul, didn't hesitate to declare it a must-have addition to my wardrobe. His insistence on purchasing the T-shirt for me was not just an act of generosity but a testament to the unpredictability and warmth that defined our friendship. As I left the boutique adorned in this unexpected gift, I couldn't help but reflect on the serendipity of the moment – a tangible symbol of the day Ringoding, with his boundless energy and keen eye for the extraordinary, wove another colorful thread into the rich tapestry of our enduring friendship.

Even though I bought it back in 2014, I actually only really started to play DayZ in 2017. The game used to be a bit too barebones back in 2014. I completely forgot about this game and noticed it somewhere in my library. Figured I would try it again.... From that moment on I was hooked.

DayZ had a lot of changes, mainly with the partial engine change in 2018. But I am not going to write chronoligical story on this game. Let's jump into what makes this game so damn good.

 [b] World design / Graphics [/b]

From all the open world PVEPVP survival games DayZ hands-down has the best world design. This is something that Bohemia as a company is so good in. it is the same for their other game series called Arma. It really feels like an actual world and not like a game. The way the hills are situated, the tree lines, water streams and little village down in that valley. Similar games such as Deadside, Scum or Miscreated all cannot come close to how authentic the world of DayZ looks like. 

Of course it is not perfect. This becomes noticeable in cities and some buildings. Cities feel a bit empty. There is little on the streets in terms of objects like crashed cars, trash or other things you would expect in an apocalyptic world. Some building are also very empty which impacts the immersion

Graphically the game does lack behind in some regards. The character models all look pretty good and so do all the new assets that have been added in the game over the past 5 years. Sadly there is also quite some objects and buildings that are still from the Arma 2 era (2009) that look way too ugly and really need to be replaced.

Certain graphical effects such as lightning or weather effects also do not always look as good as the competition. This is since the map is still stuck on the old engine (and will remain that way) and has limitations on the more modern graphical features.

Overall the game has great world design and decent graphics. I personaly hope they will increase the graphical quality of various objects and upgrade some of the more lacking parts of the world design.

 [b]Gameplay [/b]

In DayZ you can hunt, fish, farm and loot to survive. You can also craft various items, build a base and repair broken cars so you can drive around. Of course the main gameplay loop is to loot to find better gear and food/drinks to survive. PVP is a big part of the game as well.

The game can be a bit unforgiving in the beginning as there is just a simple tutorial page and some tips on the loading screen. Best is to watch some Youtube video's if you do not want to be thrown in the deep.

The map of chernarus is big (225 square KM) and the map of the DLC Livonia is just a bit smaller. You can play for hours without seeing anyone and out of nowhere run into someone in a dense wood in the middle of nowhere. This randomness is what makes DayZ so fun, in my opinion. It is not for everyone though. As I said, you can play for hours and do not encounter any other player. And if you are really looking for that pvp it can feel a bit empty from time to time.

With that being said, there are tons of community servers that have mods or no mods. Besides the fact that the game offers room for various playstyles (servers with more loot, traders and various new items), you also often see community servers that have upped the player count so player interaction is increased.

 [b]PVE [/b]

Pve in DayZ consists of fighting against the infected and animals. There are wolfs and bears that will attack you. The wolfs track you when you get into a certain range and will attack in a group. Bears are strong but not aggresive. They usually attack when you get too close. Fun thing is when you do not shoot the bear and it knocks you out, it will leave you alone most of the time.

Infected can be found in any place with human structures. Villages, cities, military bases etc... Right now I would say infected are the biggest issue in the game. Their pathfinding is okay at best and they often glitch around you or get stuck in you. However, the devs have mentioned that in 2024 they are looking into improving the infected. What this actually means is unknown at the time. Even though the infected have their issues, they are pretty well done in other regards. They respond to sounds (like throwing stuff or opening doors), you can lose them by running around corners and when you hide in a house they become calm again after a while. Have to say that the infected AI of DayZ is one of the better that I have seen in its genre. If the developers fix the pathfinding, animations and other earlier mentioned issues, they will become actually great.",1403214637,1706090125,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

pas mal d'évolution puisque j'ai passé pas mal de temps sur Livonia : une ambiance très différente de Chernarus, plus rurale, et toujours autant de chemin à parcourir à pied, sauf si on se procure rapidement une voiture...
La base principale est à Sobotka, une autre base à Topolin, et des tentes et barrils disséminés dans différentes villes pour stasher le loot qui devient souvent volumineux. 
J'ai ajouté quelques mods, légers, qui par contre simplifient bien ma vie de joueur, l'un d'entre eux permet
de porter un dos ghillie tout en bénéficiant de 150 espaces...très très cool. 

Modifié 4 : 07/11/23 : 
après mon ""indigestion"" des premières 1000 heures j'avais laissé tomber DayZ pour me consacrer à autre chose...
J'y suis revenu il y a quelques jours, pensant trouver le même jeu répétitif que j'avais laissé et...il est toujours répétitif, mais mon état d'esprit dans le jeu a totalement changé, je joue de manière très différente, avec des vues sur le jeu beaucoup plus satisfaisantes pour mon coeur de joueur :)
Le but est toujours de survivre mais les tactiques apprises au fil de l'expérience accumulée ont considérablement changé mon évaluation des situations, beaucoup plus complète et ""construite"".
Beaucoup plus précise et rapide alors sont mes actions...
Donc toujours Chernarus, toujours en Lan, avec quelques mods qui vont bien, un peu plus de munitions, un peu plus de silencieux, une voiture mais toujours pas de moto...ça serait top !
Chernarus est devenu un pays légèrement plus vivable, même si, comme je l'ai constaté hier tout peut partir en vrille de manière très rapide si l'on devient un tantinet trop confiant ou trop ""insouciant""...
Il faut le constater, ce n'est pas la destination qui compte mais le chemin que l'on parcours, et surtout la manière dont on le parcours...
Ok, je vais surement aller sur YouTube faire des vidéos avec le titre ""un joueur avec 2000 heures..."", lol.   

Modifié 3 : 28/06/23 : 
au bout d'un peu plus de 1000 heures j'ai acquis l'expérience 'base', revenant après chaque update vers mon lieu habituel de résidence et reconstruisant (mais je fais en sorte maintenant de garder mes données 'joueur'...). J'ai commencé à adapter certains fichiers à mon style de jeu, ajoutant également un mod 'munitions', rendant le loot plus facile et faisant de Chernarus une carte plus homogène. Les 'Tiers' 1,2,3, 4 se comprennent mais vont à l'encontre d'une carte 'random' où l'on peut trouver un peu tout un peu partout. Ca n'encourage pas le joueur à rester et prospecter près de la côte et ses alentours , ce qui est dommage... Au fil du temps meilleure connaissances  des armes et de leur munition, et, après quelques accidents malheureux (lol) j'ai pu garder une voiture, ce qui évidemment change la donne, même si le but est d'aller à un endroit et d'explorer ensuite à pied le dit endroit, je connais encore si peu la carte ! DayZ ressemble donc de plus en plus au jeu dont j'ai envie...Certaines manipulations ou animations de jeu compliquant inutilement le gameplay pourraient être modifiées ou supprimées, la gourde qui ne se remet jamais à son emplacement sur la ceinture en est un exemple, où ce solide gaillard de joueur incapable de monter une simple marche en étant accroupi, petits détails qui cassent un peu l'ambiance...
Après ces mille heures DayZ devient un jeu où il peut faire bon vivre...

Modifié 2 : 28/04/23
200 heures, c'est le temps qu'il m'a fallu pour bien connaître les nécessités, contraintes et erreurs de la survie...Toujours en LAN, toujours  sans mods, et vraiment aucun envie de changer. Je viens de m'apercevoir que, pour l'instant, je ne mémorise pas les routes, mon esprit n'en a sans doute pas envie. Ceci dit la carte de Chernarus fait 300 Km2, il faudra un moment pour en venir  à bout, même avec une bonne carte.
J'ai déjà pu looter 2 hélicoptères mais c'est assez décevant, comme pour le reste du jeu le matériel est vraiment trop disparate, on a le fusil mais pas les munitions...ou l'inverse @@
Je construis une base, un endroit d'où rayonner ensuite mais il faut trouver des clous...pas gagné !

Modifié 1 : 22/03/23 : j'avance un peu dans le jeu, je construis petit à petit les connaissances nécessaires à la survie, il y a deux paramètres qui sont faibles et auront du mal à passer ce sont les pîèces vides et uniformes et la nécessité de les parcourir  encore et encore...on voit bien qu'on est dans de la programmation...boring !

Origine : 18/03/23
Voila, voila, après avoir regardé moultes vidéos j'ai décidé d'acheter le jeu pour avoir une idée claire de ce qu'il est... Paysages somptueux, carte (Chernarus) intéressante mais l'ambiance du jeu et les paramètres du gaming sont, pour moi, à la très proche limite de ce qui est acceptable...et que je n'ai pas accepté.
 
Le ressenti du débutant : la plupart des ""joueurs"" se comportent comme des c.h.i.e.n.s, ce qui fait froid dans le dos, et le gaming rend votre survie très improbable au-délà de 30 minutes et il faut  
 courir...courir...courir...courir......pour mourir !
Ce n 'est plus un survival c'est l'entraînement au marathon, le vrai, celui où le soldat grec meurt à la fin :D
J'ai été tellement choqué, ""Mais enfin c'est un survival, tu comprends pas"", que j'ai installé un serveur LAN pour régler déjà le problèmes des toutous, mais le jeu est toujours aussi épuisant, même des joueurs ultra-confirmés le disent...
J'ai l'intuition que les serveurs 'community', avec l'ajout massif de mods, sont un moyen de contourner le problème...qui vivra verra, j'en incorporerais sans doute certains quand je les connaîtrais...

In all that time, I have seen the bad and the very bad some updates have brought over the years. I must say, overall the developers have listened to the player base on the games direction. Some good requests, or suggestions have taken awhile to be implemented. But that is what mods are for. *wink, wink*

I greatly recommend picking up the game. You can play many styles, Be it PvP, PvE or both, You can also find a lot of mods that can satisfy your imagination...  Can even find a few role-play servers out there.

Vanilla is a good game, however it is lacking on several features and additions that would make it a lot nicer to play, such as additional vehicles, better base building, maps, NPC's etc which can all be found on modded servers. This is why I always play modded servers and run one myself as the community for this game is insane with what they have created over the years. 
Modded servers are all very different and provide very different experiences however you can always find something your looking for, whether it be hardcore PVP and survival or just some relaxing PVE and farming, you can do it.

Want to spend your days fishing, how about exploring, or maybe you want to jump on a server with a train and just ride the train all day, or perhaps you want to make a mobile base with said train and assert your dominance over the server, sure you can do that in DAYZ modded. The skys the limit!

I would also to like to mention that the devs are still actively updating this game, Yes updates aren't super frequent but they try their hardest to fix bugs and give us new content without charging us additional fee's for every bit of content they create like most modern games and its not full of dumb cosmetics that some survival games seem to think its ok to sell now.

Overall I would 100% say this game is worth picking up, I have managed to rack up nearly 1000 hours playing this game on and off over the years and for what the game sells for versus the hours its a great investment. 
Most AAA titles will only give you 100 hours of game play if your lucky and we spend a lot more money on them and still receive a buggy mess these days. Where is this game started as a mod and look how far its come!",1705967695,1705967695,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is one buggy fucking nightmare of a game. The mods are fun to play around with, but still limited for anything to happen in this massive world of absolutely nothing. The pvp is dull in the official servers so unless you join in on a server with others that have them dedicated you're shit out of luck. There is no pve that would be considered worth the purchase at full price so wait for a sale. Each town has the same loot, and the zombies are less than enjoyable after a while to go around and shoot. Play this game while drunk and you'll have more of an enjoyable time. 

The updates that have occurred have not made this game any better in anyway. They usually create more bugs in the game than previously. The devs for this game are the wish version of Bethesda only you discover this after a few updates that have been released. Save you time, energy, and money with this title. If you are looking for a game that is a glitchy nightmare version of the long dark then this game is perfect for the casual fuck that you are. 

Being said there are some positive aspects of the game for a very casual player. Trying to keep yourself alive, creating fires, and cooking are some interesting features this game does have to offer. Getting sick from contaminated water or being too cold at times makes for a challenge that will be short lived. This game has huge potential but holy fuck add some shit into this massive world of literally fuck all sweet nothing. Walking simulator at best. But hey, at least you can find some dumb as fuck shit to wear while you explore the wilderness prior to discovering how hard you've been fucked by buying this game.",1644948980,1705814896,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Despite this, I was never really able to get into it. The Arma 2 engine's clunkiness was a significant barrier for me. That changed when the standalone version of DayZ was released. In 2014, I bought and installed the game, spending several months immersing myself in its unique survival-based environment.

The game was unlike anything I'd experienced before. It featured a sprawling 200+ km² map depicting a desolate yet eerily familiar world. Engagements with other players were infrequent, yet the constant threat of violence was always looming. Resources were sparse, and the drive of each player to get their hands on what you had—even if it meant resorting to killing—added an intense level of excitement.

I played the game both solo and with friends, but after some time, I began to notice that the issues with the engine hadn't fully been resolved. Dying to a game bug posed a greater risk than an in-game gunfight. The excitement of discovering a new item was tempered by the shortage of interesting loot, and what items were available often didn't present a real challenge to obtain. This meant they felt somewhat unrewarding, as you could simply hop onto various deserted servers and gather everything you needed. The persistence of collected items was also non-existent.

Hearing that the developers were shifting their focus to creating versions for PlayStation and Xbox was disappointing. I felt this decision diverted precious resources away from developing new content, fixing bugs, and overall game improvement. Eventually, I had to come to terms with the fact that DayZ's lofty ambitions might have been too much to realize fully. Recognizing this, I decided it was time to move on from the game.

Years passed, and I kept a casual eye on DayZ's progress, always holding onto the slim hope that things might improve. However, when I learned that Brian Hicks—the original creator of the Arma mod—had fully left the studio and had stopped all involvement with DayZ, it felt like the final nail in the coffin. It was time to release any remaining hope I had clung onto. The game seemed to be nothing more than a beautiful but unattainable fantasy.

That was until a few weeks ago when an old friend of mine reached out and suggested we reinstall the game and see if it had improved. The current gaming landscape was, and still is, rather barren. I was completely disillusioned with gaming—every new shooter felt lackluster and tedious, just more of the same recycled concepts. In light of this, I figured, why not give DayZ another try? What was the worst that could happen? Maybe I'd lose an hour of my time and then carry on as usual.

We opted for an official server restricted to first-person perspective, logged into the game, and began to play. I fully expected to grumble and complain the whole time and then abandon the game an hour later. Surprisingly, the exact opposite happened. Instead, I found myself thoroughly engrossed, playing for an astonishing 65 hours over the course of just two weeks.

The initial impressions during the first hour of gameplay were a mixed bag. The game immediately felt more challenging, with survival being a tougher task. We had to learn a few tricks just to avoid starving, dying of thirst, or being overwhelmed by zombies. DayZ offers no hand-holding; it doesn't explain shit to you. You spawn into the game without a clue of your location, with jack shit to your name. There is no clear direction on what to do or how to proceed. To find your bearings, you must rely on your basic school geographical knowledge, and us a topographical map to navigate. Sometimes, you may even spawn at night, where darkness is so absolute that adjusting contrast, brightness, or any other fancy ass black equalizing settings on your expensive monitor won't make a difference.

As you venture forth, you decide your own path. You explore and loot various buildings, discovering items, clothing, and if you're lucky, some food. You learn how to engage and kill zombies without sustaining injuries, either by stealthily avoiding them or dispatching them strategically. It's through these experiences that the game starts to click, drawing you into its unparalleled immersion. Crafting in DayZ is intuitive and grounded, devoid of the over-the-top and unrealistic mechanics found in other survival games like Fortnite or Rust where you can slap wood together and build cringe castles. Instead, you can craft improvised backpacks using rope, sticks, and burlap sacks. You can fashion a fishing rod from a stick, rope, and a knife or any sharp object at hand. As you become more adept, the initial fears of hunger and thirst fade, replaced by an ability to adapt to the wilderness and its elements. Even the once-ominous howling of wolves in the night loses its frightful grip.

You begin to understand where the valuable loot can be found. Eventually, you accumulate an excess of supplies, prompting the need for storage. Suddenly, you have a goal: constructing a rudimentary shelter to safeguard your ill gotten gains, just in case you meet an untimely demise and have to start the arduous process all over again. Then you discover the immense depth of crafting options and small details. You realize that bullets can deflect and penetrate objects, that sunglasses shield your eyes from the sun's glare, and that you can bury a box as a hidden stash, like some kind of a pirate. The learning process becomes endless, yet every new piece of knowledge brings immense enjoyment.

By the end of a day, you come to the realization that DayZ is what you make of it. DayZ is patiently camping a military base for hours, dressed in a ghillie suit that you crafted yourself, on a hill, 400 meters away. DayZ is a simple pleasure of catching a fish in a forest lake and cooking it over a fire in the dead of night, all while shooting the shit with your mate on Discord. DayZ is having your heart pounding with excitement during intense firefights in the middle of nowhere. DayZ is the rush you get from discovering an exceptionally valuable piece of loot, like Night Vision goggles. It's a game where you craft your own unique story with each playthrough.

Over time, I came to realize that the tremendous effort put in by the developers is finally paying off. The numbers on Steam charts and the positive trend in player base affirm this. The ""idea"" of DayZ is alive and thriving, and the game is no longer a fantasy.",1638197929,1705768021,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

From the get-go, it throws you into a post-apocalyptic world that's hauntingly beautiful and eerily realistic. Chernarus, the game's setting, is a masterpiece of desolation, with abandoned cities and dense forests that make you feel like you're really in the thick of it.

What sets DayZ apart is the way it lets players shape their own story. Every interaction with other survivors is a wild card, and you never know if you'll end up making an ally or facing off against a foe. The game nails the whole survival thing, forcing you to scavenge for supplies, manage your hunger and thirst, and deal with both the undead and hostile players. The constant fear of losing everything keeps you on your toes, making every decision a do-or-die moment.

The crafting system is a game-changer. Building shelters, crafting weapons, and even farming to stay alive add a whole new layer to the gameplay. It feels damn good to see your progress and adapt to the challenges the game throws at you.

But where DayZ truly shines is in its multiplayer. Meeting other players, teaming up, or getting into intense shootouts—it's a rollercoaster of emotions. Trust is a rare commodity in this world, and the camaraderie and betrayal make every playthrough feel like a unique experience.

The devs have been on the ball with updates and fixes, showing they're committed to making the game better. Sure, it had its hiccups in the beginning, but the current version reflects the dedication to refining the player experience.

In a nutshell, DayZ is the real deal when it comes to survival games. It's tough, it's thrilling, and it's endlessly rewarding. If you want a game that puts you through the ringer and leaves you with stories to tell, DayZ is a must-play that sets the bar high for the genre.",1647255265,1705734892,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Well I would be a hypocrite if I did not update my review. I've more than doubled my hours on this game. I can't help myself. I still want to rage quit all the time due to perma-death, but I always come back. So many servers with many unique options there is something for everyone. Nothing like walking around, constantly being terrified that you're going to lose all your stuff. Even better when you have a large friend group that likes to spend time walking towards eachother as well. Bohemia has continued to spend time patching this game and it continues to improve. I'll say it again, Good Luck, Survivors!

OLD REVIEW:

Wow...I have had so much hope for DayZ for years. So much...I love the concept of the game, the ability to collaborate with other players, and just survive. This game (in theory) fits with my game style because I can be a lone wolf or social, depending on my mood. Today I saw headlines that there was a free weekend, so I thought that maybe some new content had been added, the game stabilized, and new fun stuff to explore. Unfortunately, I went to get on and was in a queue with 50+ players in front of me. Bounced out and found some low pop servers, which turned out to be based on the new DLC. So I paid $$ to play the game, but now to actually get on a server I've gotta pay up again? While waiting in the queue, I decided to review some of the latest discussions in the DayZ community. It was a rehash of messages from 5? 7? 10-years ago? Buggy, No Food, Insta-deaths, etc...I wish so bad for this game to be successful, but constant mis-steps have led me to write this review and I will uninstall the game. Tired of waiting for the game I want, so I will have to explore other options. Good Luck survivors, but if you can save your time and money, do not try this game.",1581800549,1705710020,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Good.
A truly difficult survival experience where you WILL die dozens of times to even learn the game.
Death is final - you don't keep anything from a previous life unless you happen to find your body. However, with no ability to pick where you spawn, good luck!

The Bad.
items are limited by count and that includes things in people inventories. There are only a few AR-15's on a server and chances are, someone else already has them.

The UGLY
This game supports mechanics that play into obscene behavior. You can be handcuffed, stripped of your clothes, items and shot to death. They get off on causing shame, and exercizing power over other people. This will most likely be by someone in full military gear with automatic weapons. Essentially the new players are at an extreme disadvantage and veteran players - especially if they have a crew - will always win. There is no chance at it being an even fight. Add into that the item count on things that could even the playing field - automatic weapons - and you're looking at 20 hours of play with no deaths to gear up to the level of someone fully geared up.  

Other players are the worst part of the game.

1-having beds to spawn into our bases instead of going on a 4hr walk evry time we die.

3-NumberLocks usable with numberpad would make it faster to open in time when being under attack.
with these upgrades this game could be one of the.. nahh the best survival game ever.

Every civilization is an armed hunter stalking through the trees like a ghost, gently pushing aside branches that block the path and trying to tread without sound. Even breathing is done with care. The hunter has to be careful, because everywhere in the forest are stealthy hunters like him. If he finds other life—another hunter, an angel or a demon, a delicate infant or a tottering old man, a fairy or a demigod—there’s only one thing he can do: open fire and eliminate them. In this forest, hell is other people. An eternal threat that any life that exposes its own existence will be swiftly wiped out. This is the picture of cosmic civilization. It’s the explanation for the Fermi Paradox.”[/h3]

So before you play grab a sandwich, because you will have better luck finding loot in that then in this game. day z found a way to keep making this game progressively worse. good job guys. keep up the good work.

heres a fun list of probably what will happen to you
1. im hungry
2. im thirsty
3. i feel blood dripping off of me.
4. im starving
5. i could really use something to drink
6. my feet hurt
7. im dying of starvation
8. you are unconscious.

then repeat several times. sounds fun huh?

1,024 sandwiches later...... a reconsideration...
I wrote the original review some years ago. however after learning to love this game i changed my review in it's entirety. They have added some updates that have made this game actually better.

This game was made before the whole battle Royal janra got perfected. basically PUBG is essentially the same kind of game. you Drop into Map , you start looting , you gear up, you Survive  and you fight other player. the real difference is that in pubg you get to the action very quickly because you can gear up in under 10 mins. in DAYZ it takes hours of searching and gearing up to get to the point where that intense Adrenalin is achieved. So its a matter of preference really. i feel that games like PUBG and Hunt Showdown took the basic premise of games like this and created them so that you can get into the action much faster. I for one do not have the patience to search around for hours for peaces of cloth and and guns with no ammo and broken fishing poles. about 20 mins of searching empty houses is about all i can take before i have to jump back into PUBG or Hunt. or if I really want this kind of long game , im going with something like like SCum or maybe Subsistence for a real Survival experience.Because the only real Diferance between DAYZ and PUBG is that there is some crafting in DAYZ, but games like Subsistance or Scum are many others are going to be much much more up to date when it comes to deep crafting . Also since this game is very old its not nearly as well optimized as something new and the mechanics seem to be dated as well. i feel that the price of this should have lowered. 
But try it out , you can try it for 2 hours and then return it if its not for you. 
some people love the search and the fact that it takes longer im sure adds to the intensity of PVP fights.
My feeling is that if you have hours to burn then go for it. however if you have a job and other things in life and you want something that allows you to get into something for a hour or so and then jump off. Go with PUBG. same exact concept, it just gets you to the action much faster, but its almost identical with in game goals , looting , surviving , searching , Running and fighting. just not crafting , 
but like i said if you want crafting , their are far better options than DAYZ.
Its not a bad game. it is much loved by many people , but i just feel like there might be better choices depending on 
your gaming style and goals.",1705250824,1705251035,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Picked this back up back in the day (around 2013 I think?) and i feels like it's been living in the Mods shadow since then; now though, I think it may have finally surpassed it.

Performance first, the game runs silky smooth at a high FPS even in large cities, something I considered impossible for this engine even just a few years ago. Frame rate drops happen very rarely  but it's less than once an hour so I can forgive this given the engine's age. 
There are also a couple of weird glitches involved too, such as Zombies phasing through doors or walls - while this does temporarily ruin immersion it's again infrequent enough to be overlooked, and part of me kind of enjoys the jitterish randomness of the old ArmA engine (though this is likely the nostalgia talking)

Loot balance on official servers is spot on. It always feels worthwhile searching every house on the off chance there may be some good loot in there; most of the time you find nothing, but loot drops are just frequent enough to keep your interest and make it worthwhile to check that one lonely, abandoned house on the way out of town.

There are a many different ways to keep your survival stats in the green, some of which are ethically questionable such as feasting on the freshly killed corpses of your fellow survivors - with interesting after effects such as an incurable mystery cough, or manic crazed laughing. 
Food and medicine drops are surprisingly rare, leaving you to rely upon more classic methods of acquiring sustenance like hunting or farming. All well and good-  if you know how - but make sure you cook that chicken right or you'll be out of action with salmonella poisoning before the Z's have chance to even look at you.

Finally the gun play is very satisfying and surprisingly in depth with its inventory management. This isn't the type of game where you hit 'R' to reload after spending one round; you need to ensure your equipment is prepared and ready after every engagement.
Some may not like this, but for me manually loading every bullet into a magazine and checking for breaks or jams in your weapon before a fight adds a whole new level of immersion to the game which really bring the world to life. Taking care of your equipment and gear serves to make it all the more heartbreaking when death inevitably find you. 

And make no mistake, death it coming. Be it from a gang of rogue walkers bludgeoning your battered body, slow painful wasting away due to hunger or thirst, or some camping bastard with a Mosin on Sniper hill, death or the threat of death is constant and oppressive in DayZ.
Having the grim reaper just a few steps behind you for the entirety of your play though makes the little moments of relief so much more satisfying in ways you wouldn't imagine. 
For example, finding a can of beans in any other video game is something overlooked and forgotten about seconds afterwards; but in DayZ beans bring life, and every one must be cherished and enjoyed. 

In conclusion, there is a ton of fun to be had in DayZ for anyone who enjoys survival games and I would recommend it to everyone with even a passing interest in zombie fiction.

Be you some wannabe hero type or a realist survivor only the naive would name a 'bandit', the ruins of Chernarus offer hours of fun and you should jump straight in and get to lootin' and shootin'

REMEMBER
this game is an alpha
for the people who didnt read it or dont know what alpha is, this game is in a very early stage. it was early released for people like me or you to play and give feedback on the game

MY THOUGH
ive loved dayz since it was just a mod, if you love the mod, you WILL love this game.
there are many more things to be added to this game over time such as new weapons, cars, being able to build your own buildings, ETC.
it is a hard game, gets your mind going, you need to be quick and know who to trust and who not to trust, if you arnt, you will either be killed or hand cuffed and looted. if you are not one of those people who cant do any of that you shouldnt play this game, or alone atleast. this is online, you can play with your friends, which does make it easier and more fun to play, in game chat, big maps, lots or room to play in.

i do recommend this game but warning there are bugs because it is an ALPHA. but still worth the money, me and my friends play and we always enjoy the game. It is a simulator of a lone survivor or group after an apocolypse. be careful not to make to much noise, you will attract zombies or enimies, it is pretty damn realistic (atleast i think so) i havent played long but i know for sure i will. hope to see you on the battlefield!",1397030521,1705203353,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

In the past year DayZ devs have done a great job of shoring up the current base game. The stability injected is excellent and well worth the time. As a modder, there is a ton you can do with the game but my original though stays. If you are solo PvP servers are a bit toxic. If you are a Roleplayer, you have a bit more leeway and there are quite a few places where you can spend a lot of time exploring content and story.

tl;dr; The players/community of the server you play with determines if this game is worth buying.

Longer version:
The game itself is practically an alpha build of a half finished game. Fairly buggy and no longer supported actively by the developers. There are widespread stability issues that keep servers from being able to run longer than 4 hours continuously so there are constant restarts; merely inconvenient of there is no queue. Mod support is there and the only thing keeping the game alive... Active independent modders are single handedly building additional functionality for this game while we all wait for something better to come along and replace this piece of garbage. I would personally recommend getting this game during a sale if you MUST have it and pass on it altogether unless you have specific people you want to play with. This is not a solo friendly game. 


The game is awful, the community is worth trying out. I cannot recommend the game itself but the people I play with make the game more fun than if I played alone.

""RN"" as he said his name was, did not know the controls at all. I had to help him learn how to pick up items, equip them, even to feed him when he couldn't feed himself. He was a sweet kid and full of life and joy at playing this exciting game.

We ran together for a few hours, till late at night we came across a small fenced encampment in the woods. RN was sick and we were hoping to find some Tetracycline to cure his illness. He'd also nearly bled out numerous times from encounters with zombie, so he was weak, but I was confident we could bring him back if we could just find some medicine.

I am searching and I hear RN calling for help. He's fighting a zombie. I equip my shovel and position myself to strike the zombie, but at the last moment, RN steps in the way. Both the zombie and RN fall to the ground. I drop to my knees, hoping to revive RN, but it's too late. He's gone. I've failed.

I was ready for backstabbing and betrayals, but hadn't even considered that I'd have to face the fact that I had failed as a father.

Well, I lied.

They haven't added anything significant aside from basebuilding - infact, they table things like bows years in the past with the intent to fix, yet they never are. They've patched the bare minimum of bugs, in some cases creating new ones,  and they've jacked the price to 60 CAD. 

The game is fun, sure - but it's carried by it's community and community servers, nothing provided to you on-install makes this game worth it's native price. Zombies are glitched to shit and have never been improved, combat is gross and unintuitive, lag is wild and animations + combat + ladders + audio + bases + you name it: are jank. Nothing is smooth, nothing is clean, everything is a fucking chore to play through. Nothing feels natural when playing DayZ. You are stiff as a fucking corpse the whole way through.

The only thing that's enjoyable about DayZ is player interaction: which you can easily find in other games. Is it an awful game? Nah. Is it a good game? Sure, and it's lead dev was a pioneer in the genre back when it was a free mod. Is it a great game? absolutely not. Has it been elevated beyond it's origins as a - I repeat - FREE mod, with innovations and fresh gameplay systems to justify it's release and sale as a standalone game with DLC?

Absolutely fucking not. And don't let them forget that this launched damn near a decade ago as ""DayZ Standalone,"" implying this shambling, putrid corpse of a once-Copernican Megalith of can-do, indie innovation actually has the strength to stand on it's own two feet anymore - which is laughable, considering they never correctly adapted the skeletons of the gameplay, engine and UI modules from it's parent engine of ARMA II. 

DayZ sits in the middling-limbo many former modding studios languish in; which is mediocrity and niche enjoyment. There's nothing inherently wrong with this: but charging 60 dollars Canadian for a badly-adapted MOD that hasn't shown any signs of significant progression, player-retention or game-health upkeep in the DECADE it's been on steam is unacceptable. That release date of 2018 is actually horse crap. That's untrue. This game has existed in a near-identical state on steam, since early-access, for all of my adolescence and early adulthood. The ONLY shit that's changed is gimmicky garbage you'd never even see use for in your entire playthrough. 

Will climbing a ladder kill you sometimes? Yeah for sure. Have we fixed that over the last ten years? Nah. 

But we added the ability for grenades to explode if put into a furnace!!!! 



Do not buy this game. Do not line Dean Hall's pockets. Go buy Arma II: The original title that DayZ plundered - badly - all it's systems from. DayZ existed as a mod before going independent in plenty adequate circumstances. There is absolutely no reason you should be paying this price for a product that's actually less competent than the free mod it was derived from. 

60 bucks Canadian - what a fucking joke.",1682859667,1705129706,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros - The game is off of its own engine and feels good, Its a little weird for me because I started on the Arma II Engine but I got used to it relatively quick
       -The servers and community seem to be very active and the people are pretty nice for the most part
       -The standalone DayZ Chernarus map is a big improvement from the Arma 2 and Arma 3 Chernarus 2020 mod map due to the amount of buildings you can go inside of and the entirely new locations to go visit

*Applicable to some as a pro or con -- Game plays way better with at least one other person as a friend, Playing solo is definitely doable but the game can get lonely without a friend to play with.

Cons -Cars definitely still drive clunky to this day but they seem to have made them less buggy
         -Game could use an engine overhaul at some point in the near future
         -Graphics could use an overhaul at some point in the near future (Ties in with the last con) because it doesnt hold up compared to Arma III Chernarus 2020 mod picture quality
         -Zombies equally as cancerous to fight as they were on the Arma 2 DayZ mod

Overall I would rate this a solid 4.5/5 of a game to play because it does have its faults here and there and you can tell its dated but I would only assume the devs will create a new title in the coming years and or upgrade this game on this title without making a new title, whatever they do, I just hope they do keep this game up with the times -- Considering Arma IV is in the works... Good job Devs and definitely recommend this game.

But overall you're gonna spend a lotta time walkin in the woods so I hope you like hiking.

Step into the gritty post-Soviet wasteland of Chernarus in DayZ, where life is a perpetual struggle for survival and every can of beans might be your last. This hardcore zombie survival game throws you into a vast, unpredictable world with no map markers, daily quests, or scoreboards. It's just you, Chernarus, and the infectious undead hordes craving a piece of you.

Quirky Chaos Awaits:
In DayZ, there are no hand-holding tutorials or easy mode. Just Chernarus – a playground for up to 60 players, each trying to survive in their quirky way. Will you make friends, engage in epic battles over tasty beans, build a base, or risk a dramatic betrayal? The beauty is in the chaos, and every encounter is a potential chapter in your bizarre tale of survival.

Beware the Unexpected:
Surviving isn't just about dodging zombies; you'll face threats from wildlife, elements, and even your own hunger and thirst. Evade packs of wolves, outsmart bears with questionable motives, and pray for shelter during a downpour. Master complex survival mechanics, or Chernarus will chew you up and spit you out faster than you can say ""tasty beans.""

Ready Your Gear, Fashionista:
Your style is your armor. Patch up those damaged clothes, craft improvised items, and strut into seemingly deserted cities for loot. Fix up a car, hide it in your secret base, and venture into contaminated zones (if you dare). Just remember, you're not getting far without a full hazard suit and a fashionable gas mask.

PvP Pandemonium:
In Chernarus, PvP isn't just a game, it's a lifestyle. Expect intense firefights in hotspots like military bases, where survivors are either after your loot, hunting for sport, or just terrified you'll shoot first. Learn to fight, know when to flee, and always watch your back – because one bullet can change everything, turning your quirky adventure into a respawn screen.

Customize the Chaos:
If vanilla isn't your flavor, head to the Steam Workshop. Join an active community of survivors and spice up your DayZ experience. Thousands of fan-made features, maps, and guns await, all easily managed from the game launcher. Install mods, shape the mayhem to your liking, and revel in the delightful unpredictability of DayZ.

In DayZ, survival isn't just about staying alive; it's about embracing the unpredictable, crafting your story, and savoring the quirky chaos of Chernarus. So, pack your beans, sharpen your wits, and dive into a world where each quirky encounter might be your last - or your weirdest.",1705022193,1705022193,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

AKA PORT OR REMAKE THIS SHIT IN ARMA REFORGER BEFORE MODDERS DO IT FOR YOU. Generally unfair to anyone for a game to release and still be so shit and expect modders just to fix everything for free. Its lazy and unprofessional. 

If you do not do something, in 2 years no one will want to continue to play this old, ancient out dated buggy mess, considering there is 0 progress on the old engine its running on being made, and 0 being made in a game changing way (as they have already done that with the Arma:Reforger Engine, which the DayZ devs have stated multiple times they DO NOT HAVE PLANS TO REMAKE DAYZ IN THE REFORGER ENGINE, AS IT WOULD TAKE ""TOO MUCH DEV TIME AND WORK, AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAUSE DAYZ UPDATES FOR IT"" yea bro you pause your updates, the ones that change nothing and do nothing positive for the game, and actually make a good decision and ASK YOUR HIGHER UPS TO GREEN FLAG FOR THE LOVE OF GOD THE REFORGER ENGINE DAYZ REMAKE. The DayZ OG mod legit would of had more progress then this if somehow the higher ups at Bohemia would actually see the potential in their game and products and invest the time and man power to actually do something good and im not talking just like ""oh we added new santa hats"" im talking ACTUALLY GOOD AND GAME UPGRADING AND GAME CHANGING.

 7DTD and DayZ, and Scum are the 3 games im curious are they just upgrading their engines under the table and not telling people or are they generally just not making good decisions??? Like for YEARS NOW MIND YOU. Years bro. Make changes or just drop support for the game and let modders fix shit, as they usually literally do. Project Zomboid understood this and hired modders and yea, they fix their shit and add ideas to the pool of dev ideas. Its not a bad idea to you know, ask the community for ideas and help on changing the game THEY PLAY. Im almost positive the actually community knows 1000x more things the players want because you should also know, THEY ARE THE PLAYERS PLAYING THE GAME. Its just all unacceptable for gaming in 2024, and i hope these games that have been in EA dev for years now understand and remember, ""oh shit we own a product we hve to care for it and release it eventually.....""

FOR THE LOVE OF YOUR COMMUNITY ITS BEEN AGES, STILL RUNNING ON A ENGINE FROM ARMA 2 BRO. ARMA 2. 

Sink that in. They have Arma 3, and Arma: REFORGER (reforger is huge engine progression and a brand new updated engine vs the old ancient dog water that is the Arma 2 engine)

Each and everytime i come back to play DayZ, i see nothing has generally progressed except like a few things, here and there, maybe a new animation or a new something semi useless or useless has been added, like im just lost as to why and what the thought and decision process is currently going on at their studios. Generally. I hear the DayZ devs got thrown this project a long time ago and were kinda rushed to make it into a standalone product. Is this what they had planned? Just keep it the same dogshite old engine and keep it outdated, and then continue to make other games and upgrade their own newer engines and just forget about DayZ eventually?

 Im just curios cause once newer and BETTER SURVIVAL/ZOMBIE SURVIVAL GAMES come out people will just not play this anymore and hope for it to become better so they can hope to come play it again. Because yea DayZ is just simply a vibe. If you played it for a few hundred hours, youll know where im coming from.

Updated: 12 Sep, 2019 - NEGATIVE

DayZ had great potential and was a favourite game for a long time. Even with all the bugs we still loved it because we thought it would get better soon. Instead of fixing the bugs we got updates that were redundant for the game and eventually all ratings became negative. A few years later the game is finally ""finished"" so maybe it deserves another chance.

Updated: 11 Jan, 2024 - POSITIVE

After so many years and having spend a lot of time on this game I came back to replay DayZ.  I believe it's fair to change my review to POSITIVE since I keep coming back and enjoy this game.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME

The DEVS should be EMBARRASSED to admit they have anything to do with it.  To call this load of crap a game is shameful.  In the year 2019, to release such a buggy, broken mess is unacceptable.  

Many reviewers talk about all the potential...  You pay for potential when you buy a game in early access.  If you buy this game in it's current state, as a released title, you are getting robbed.  Steam should pull it down and refuse to sell any more copies.

What's so bad about it?
NOTHING WORKS
Not the crafting system, the survival system, the medical system, melee combat, the cars, inventory, NOTHING WORKS.  

You will invest time into the game and make progress, only to have it all taken away by a bug or glitch or some other laggy nonsense.

The only thing this game can promise you is diasppointment and frustration.


UPDATED 12/18/2020

This is the first time I have played DayZ in years.  Within the first  15 minutes I've experienced two bugs.  One which allowed me to craft rags from the same pair of pants three times, and then wear the pants with no change to their condition.  The other which which now prevents me from accessing my inventory (with a different character on a different server) or pick up items.  These bugs were both in OFFICIAL SERVERS with no mods.

Nothing has changed.  This game is still the biggest steaming load of dung ever made.

The devs should be ashamed that they ever participated in such a rotten display if incompetence.

You are a fool if you spend a cent on this game.



Fast Forward to January 2024

I rented my own GTX server which I have been running for about a month.  There are a bunch of mods that help make this mess of a game playable.

I decided to give an official server a try tonight.
Error 0x001001 Can not connect.

Verified my game files, manually unloaded all mods, restarted my computer, restarted steam, re-verified game files.  I have tried to join 10 different Official servers.  Same error.

Crappiest game ever.  The Devs should not be allowed to work in the industry ever again.  What a sloppy, embarrassing mess.",1548039700,1704933932,False,8,1,0.49505886435508728,0,True,False,False

I'm not here for what most people are here for, I mostly enjoy single player, though I could enjoy a bit of grouping up and adventuring but I suck so bad at PVP I think even my parents would be ashamed of me, and they hardly even know what computers are. It's an age thing I guess, don't have the reflexes anymore.

So I decided do dig in when it was on sale and check what this old workhorse was up to. I had tried it before at the early stages of when the mod was created, and even though it seemed kind of interesting I didn't really get the concept back then, also, so much must have changed since its humble beginnings!

I set up a LAN server and went into it with a little worry as I know this is pretty hardcore, plus I had no real idea that there was any crafting implemented so WOW what a surprise!! I quickly realized that this is as close as you can come to 1st person Project Zomboid. Certainly not even half of PZ's mechanics are in DayZ, but those that are in there feel very much like it. So if you've been waiting for a PZ first person variant, seems it has been around for a very long time already, you just haven't really tried this, I guess...

I've played about 7000 h of 7 Days To Die so zombies don't really freak me out anymore, but they definitely can give you plenty of tense moments when you're all alone and without much gear - I guess that's what all of you regulars experience on a daily basis, however I really made that experience last, also I'm dependent on it as I can't loot other players for the gear I want, and I enjoy it a lot! If I had been on a PVP server I would have probably died a thousand deaths as the playstyle I adapted really only works if you are in control, without other players around. But even though me being alone, it works, and it works great!

I'm having a ton of fun, especially since I love the Cherna map since I've played Arma 2 and I've long wanted to see it again and explore, and I'm getting that and more compared to how it was in Arma 2. And even though I'm alone I'm having lots of tense moments in the game, I still need to be careful, and need to make every shot count.

The only thing I've done differenty from the original game is that I've installed an admin mod with which I can toggle god mode, which I will use to fend off wolf packs, which will eventually happen. Those are really meant to make groups of coop-players stick together in the more difficult areas. They are however a 100% death sentence for a lone player without much experience and I've seen that there are a lot of areas with wolves on the map and I find that a tad unreasonable for my personal game. I don't like it if can't by any chance really avoid dying under such circumstances, and I get more out of being able to move freely than having to avoid all the forests farther inland just to play the game as it's meant to be. I don't do that anyway, I play PVE, so I'm already off script. I play to have fun and mindlessly dying isn't part of it. I want a challenge, but a challenge with a chance, not just a random event I can't control and which means certain death. <- No fun! Anyway, fixed that problem and now I'm enjoying it!

Anyway, fantastic game, I can absolutely recommend this even to people who shy away from it for PVP reasons, it's still a fantastically fun experience even on your own, with tons to do, to craft, base build, loot, and despite its age, it still looks very nice and the map is a blast! The loot scarceness was bothering me a bit in the beginning, but the game pretty much only contains items you can actually use, so no fluff that will scrap up your inventory, and to be honest, I still can't keep up with my crate building and storage barrell collecting. The loot is still pretty nuts once you actually get into playing for real! 

I'd say go for it if you enjoy zombie survival, because it fits that bill 100% as well as being a very popular PVP game (for good reason!).

And on a personal note, I would actually love to enter PVP servers and just play a travelling medic, carrying food and water and med supplies to trade with all players that are in a pinch or just want to have a chin wag, but firstly everybody would have to konw there is a friendly medic on the lose on the server, and secondly I'd probably get abused and shot a lot ;D.

Unlike Rust, The Long Dark, or GreenHell.. There’s no way to explain this game to a new player. A new player might return the game and get their money back or keep the game and give it a try. Why? The game isn’t really basic, and there’s no tutorial or explanation on how it works. YouTube is a good source for a tutorial. Don’t buy this game for good zombie mechanics; the zombies will slow you down big time. I love DayZ, no question about that. I’ve played the game since the beginning of Alpha Standalone and also played DayZ Mod Arma2. To make the game work, you should play with friends or others on Discord. Servers make the game better with mods! Do you want to be a robber or a hero? Well, don’t wait any longer. DayZ modded servers are here for you! The game allows some practice, and it will take some time for you to figure it all out. But when you know how to survive well, you will feel like a god in this awesome survival game.

Pros: 
 ☑︎ Survival 
 ☑︎ Hard 
 ☑︎ Good Servers
 ☑︎Fun
---------------------------------
Cons:
☒︎Zombies *cough* they act more like paranoid humans with a sniffy nose like a dog
☒︎Sick why? 
☒︎Not many options to build a base
☒︎The game is sometimes quite boring, and you’re losing interest
☒︎Want to feel like a god early in the game? Solution: a knife!

Don't be deceived by those scripted YouTube videos where everyone is geared to the brim with guns, gun attachments, vehicles, armor, and such. Where factions lead wars between each other, that just isn't the case. In actual DayZ, you will rarely ever encounter a player, and in most cases, you will die out of either hunger or thirst. If you want what you see on YouTube, go play modded servers.

The fact that out of 5.8 million players, only 17.3% have actually eaten and drank anything, while only 14% have equipped a weapon says more than enough.

And don't even get me started on the bugs (such as where a zombie can apparently survive 15 shots straight to the chest and an additional 10-ish hits).

Even more amazing is the best version of Dayz I've ever played was a Roblox clone. No I'm not joking, Apocalypse Rising on Roblox is better than this game in every way except graphics. Just go play that. It's free.

The UI of this game is awful. Like, the amount of time you waste just fucking around with inventory management is like 1/3 of your play time.

Everything is needlessly clunky. Want to load bullets in a magazine? Do you drag and drop the bullets into it? NO. You equip your gun. Drag and drop the magazine out of the gun. Equip the magazine. Drag and drop the bullets into the magazine while you have it equipped. Then you hold the mouse button to load bullets one at a time. Needlessly complicated, clunky, and annoying.

The combat sucks. Floaty movement, stupid health system, and stupid stuff like how you have to manually press R every single time you shoot a pump or bolt action gun to pump it or rack the bolt. Your character doesn't do that automatically like every other shooter ever made. Why would I not want to pump my shotgun after I shoot it?

Loot is spread too thin. I looted the entirety of Cherno, the biggest city in the map, on an empty server. I found like three guns that all had no magazines or ammo, a bunch of damaged clothes, some duct tape, and two cans of peaches I couldn't eat because I never found a can opener. Compare this to the mod where I can loot one building and find two M16s with multiple magazines in the same city. The loot pool is too spread out and there's too much filler bullshit in the loot. Why are there so many clothes?

I couldn't find anything valuable nor anything to protect myself against others but a baseball bat.

Two ""friendly"" people stopped me and told me that I could trust them. I didn't trust them, but I also had nothing to fight back, and they were right next to me anyway. So, I played along, and that friendship ended just how you would assume.

After that, I respawned with a new character, ignored everything, and rushed to a city this time. I managed to get my hands on a Derringer and an MK II, and I had a knife to fight off the zombies. Now that I was loaded, I needed some food and better clothes. I found some chips and started eating them on the second floor of a house, watching the sunset... until I heard his footsteps. I slowly sneaked behind him, missed my first shot, and he started begging for his life in voice chat. His last words before I cold-heartedly murdered him were ""I am your friend."" His body was LOADED with ammo, meds, and food.

I literally didn't experience that dopamine rush I had when looting that poor guy's body in any game for a really, really long time.

This game's not hard because it's hard to play, but because it's obscure and has a shady design. You can't collect rocks unless you look for them near tracks despite being in a massive field. Most trees don't bear fruit. Everything breaks after using it a few times, unless you're lucky enough to find something in good condition. Items sometimes don't work. Controls sometimes don't work.

In order to get the best experience from DayZ you'll need to find the server that's right for you. Nobody should be playing on official servers because they aren't policed by admin so you have zero comeback against cheaters.

My friends and I have had fun building bases but after watching streamers like Smoke, I understand that isn't how DayZ plays best. If there were more no-base servers in Asia, I'd play them exclusively. Base builders spend too much of their time in their bases admiring their loot so even of a healthy population server you will have fewer encounters with other players. I prefer to roam the map now. Playing solo and meeting random people is where the most fun is to be had. However, not all servers will have players open to teaming up with randoms. You're best playing on DayOne style servers if you want that experience. These uneasy alliances between strangers can lead to experiences that you're unlikely to find outside of DayZ. Some of the community generated maps/mods, such as Namalsk enhance the PVE elements of the game and force survivors to work cooperatively to overcome the elements.

The base game is in great shape now. You should avoid heavily modded servers because the guns they inevitably add dilute the loot tables making it take longer to combine gun, magazine and ammo to become 'geared'. The one thing like like to see implemented is see more options for crafting with tanned leather such as canteens. The only thing tanned leather can currently be used for is backpacks and shelters.

The addition of permanent gas zones on Chernarus and the bunker on Livonia have provided some fantastic end game goals but there's plenty of fun to be had roaming aimlessly and just surviving.",1609579152,1704166407,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Buy this game if you hate yourself - like if you seriously fucking hate yourself. Sink 67 hours into it having to put up with continual bullshit of losing your semi-decent gear that you spent 4 hours a life seeking but being able to actually use in a pvp such as dying from the following:

Random illnesses for no good cause.
Becoming ill from drinking a bit too much clean water even drawn from moving water.
Overcoming the illness but still dying from the resultant stat debuff.
Being hit by a zombie carrying a disease picked up from another player.
Committing suicide for every time you get an illness because you don't have a degree in DayZ medicine nor an entire infirmary to hand because you're out in the sticks with nothing but a rag to wipe your arse with.
Get blown up by a grenade you pulled the pin on because there are next to no prompts or tutorials on how to actually throw a blasted grenade at a horde of zombies at the bottom of a watchtower you climbed up to escape them.
Or get battered by somebody at the spawn with a gardening hoe despite yourself having a hatchet to cut them up with.

Perhaps instead you put yourself through the total agony of attempting to build a base in order to lessen your losses per life. However due to not having pliers or wire, be unable to build a simple gate to lock your stash up - get raided and cleared out every time despite your efforts at concealment and use of lock pins to secure the premises in the short term by the time you return to it after getting some sleep IRL.

Call it ""skill issue"" all you want. If you fucking hate yourself, your life, and want to be utterly crushed in your soul by some poxy pixels on a screen (that is before coming across total dickwad players); this is the game for you! 

I have given too much time to this game already, learning a bunch of things on YouTube between sessions. Even as a presently unemployed fellow, this game is far too in-depth to be genuinely enjoyed. Learning to play and then getting buttfucked over repeatedly by this game is not a mere occupation in of itself by which some streamers make their money compiling the highlights of their runs - it is self-imposed auto-sodomy with a spiked mace laced with AIDs. You go from ""Gah, what bullshit?!"" between each death to ""Don't be a little bitch, just try again, it has to get better"" and within a space of four more hours to you are up to ""Man, now that was absolute fucking nonsense!"" repeatedly. 

Never mind my money, I want the time back from the learning and suffering this game has demanded. It demands too much and pisses into your face in return.",1704150256,1704150256,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You set it up, hidden deep within the woods NW of Myshkino. A road less traveled. You log out for the night taking only what your inventory slots allow. 

The next day rolls around and work was exhausting. You wanna hop on and play some DayZ. You finally get logged in and you're standing in the forest. Huh, that's weird, you thought you logged off in the tent. You look down and see the remains of a tent. Some one broke into it with a knife. All is lost a second time. You are now distraught over losing so much progress. Its a 15 minute run back to NWAF to loot. You've decided to give up, but then you hear it. A crack of a single shot to the East. You hurriedly make a stash in a pine tree nearby and rush off. Thinking what are the chances this man stole my loot. You make it near Vybor. You notice a large base built in the construction building. It is a clan base. You know this clan from dodging them in NWAF and Tisy. You decide its best to avoid the area, but instead there is another crack of a shot. Then black. You've been knocked out. You wait praying you get up hoping that you don't see that feared death screen. Finally the light of day peers through the darkness and you see... 4 players standing around you. You can't access your inventory. You are unable to equip any weapons. It was bait shots, your hands are bound and you are at the mercy of the clan. They start speaking, but they are Russian, you don't speak any language but English. One speaks broken English asks you questions about dogs. ""Huh?"" You're confused on why they are asking you about dogs. NO, they are calling you a dog. ""WHAT?"" They get more and more aggressive. Eventually the kitted out one points is VSD at you. Says ""Goodbye Dog."" 

You are at the ""You are Dead"" screen, thinking about what just happened. You're upset, you lost all those hours of work to an unfortunate series of events. You are sitting in silence when it hits you. You are not going to let it end that way. You click ""Respawn"". Determined to get revenge on the clan, you set out from your randomized spawn near the coast. You run across some railroad tracks and hear another CRACK. ""You are Dead"" is back. Freshie killers sent you back to that dismal screen. You give up for the night. you just can't handle anymore. You'll pick it back up tomorrow you say.",1704045165,1704045165,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The controls are a little wonky, and the gameplay becomes a slide show at the literal worst moments.

Also disappointed in the BattleEye anti hacking system. It DOESN'T WORK.
I have video evidence showing:
zombies being blown up via controlled frag
me getting KO'd the same manner and losing all my stuff upon consciousness. 
It's not a ""git gud"" situation because I was left w my rifle and armband. 
I went to go hunt the possible master war chief thinking he couldn't have gotten far with a fully stacked large backpack and all my gear. 
Saw an aggro'd z, went in the building, cleared the empty rooms, waited in a corner to listen for movement, got KO'd again. Lost my rifle. Doors are still closed. 
Went outside the building with my hands up and saw every zombie getting frag/sniped.

Why even play this game at all if you're going to grief? 
Why play this game with friends if you're gonna get wiped by a hacker then blame each other?


Freshie perspective:

This game is fastly becoming one of the greatest games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. 
The atmosphere is unforgiving, not in an immediate way but in a kind of looming doom.  
You lose all your hard earned loot when you die which kind of develops a Taoist mindset where your intention is to live well and not let materialism be a distraction from the true way.
The mundane is intense and puts me in a primal state of being of which my biology has been accustomed to for thousands of years. 
It is only in this particular iteration of my being am I completely unplugged from my natural state due to the advancement of tech and the rapid industrialization of man, yet Day Z really soothes my savage soul by allowing me to use the very survival core that's allowed my ancestors to survive. 

I never had use of knowing specifically where the sun rose or set irl, nor did I care for the position of the stars, nor did I bother learning how to move stealthily as none of these vastly useful things that have been key to survival were ever useful in my urbanized hi-tech life. Thanks to this game I feel more in tune with the world and how poetic everything truly is. 

The apocalypse is such a freeing concept which is probably why I've gravitated toward literature and media regarding the topic, yet to be actually in it through Day Z is another level for me. 

When I'm in the game, my senses are on high alert: my eyes scan the horizon for movement, my ears steady listening for any aberrations, my blood coursing through my being as if to ready my sinews for fast twitch movement. Not to mention the ""extrasensory perception"" that kick starts somehow and allows me to know where danger is coming from.
It's a real trip and pleasure to be in this momentous feeling of self reliance. 
My brain and body cannot tell if this is just a game. There's some weird kind elation when looting and in the same breath a kind of strange fondness for the things I loot. ""MINE"" says my brain, and my body facilitates the necessary senses for me to keep what is ""mine.""

I'm a fairly new player yet I feel I've experienced the most intense moments playing this game than I have in any other game I've sunk thousands of hours into. 
I've met some proper characters who's names and deeds my brain bothered remembering; which made me realize that I'm not bad with names, it's just that there's no need to really remember names in my modern life. 
I met Will who was a veteran of the game that just waited by the coast in his little house and farm, who's sole purpose was to teach Freshies the game, I met Corey who snuck up on me but did not kill me and instead let me come with him to his hidden base in the forest by a military encampment, I met Carl who was already doomed from a late stage sickness when I found him, who in his last moments of life had me witness him jump off from a high building where he unfortunately lived and broke both his legs and all I could do was put him down with a rusty shovel as he thanked me for releasing his spirit. 

This is not a game for the feint of heart to be sure, in fact this is a game for the stout of heart who wish to test their mettle against the forces of the self, nature, man, and the undead.",1667157971,1703881314,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Not for those who get attached to their gear or avatar due to the likelihood of frequent death.  You probably won't respawn anywhere near where you died, so getting your carried inventory back is difficult. Official servers tend to be overrun with hackers and griefers, so the community run servers are your best bet to start on.  Just be discriminating and maybe do some research before joining those, as owners/admins can be corrupt or self-serving. Many games have this issue, it's not unique to DayZ. I recommend this game to those who have longer blocks of time to play (couple of hours minimum), as just popping in and out is more liable to get your toon killed and keep your progress slow.  Expect weird bugs and game mechanics, some amusing and some frustrating. Use vehicles with caution. Keep it simple to start out. Bring friends and an abundance of rags.

The game can be played alone or with friends. One can get bored, but you can meet a lot of interesting people. This game will give you a lot of different emotions: both positive and negative.

Dayz has been on the market for years, but the devs act like its new and exciting every release, which is a good thing they care and keep adding very cool stuff to the game different quality of life items different weather how the zeds act the toxic zones you need full body gear to go into, the newest vehicle the humvee, the weather like storms and rain, i have 1 little tiny issue which doesnt effect how awesome this game is, the DMR ( Designated Marksmen Rifle) why would the devs only limit it to an acog scope why not a hunting scope it is a sniper rifle not a battle rifle im hoping they correct that.. I would highly recommend buying this game for sure really is the only game on steam i can honestly say is only getting better, but what would top it off is if they put helicopters in the vanilla version instead of leaving it to mods, which is not a big deal but for those of us that like to play vanilla version no mods a helicopter spawn would be sweet and lets us have fun while staying vanilla. Great thing about this game is the community servers where owners and admins ban cheaters which if you play official servers where cheaters and hackers are they consume official servers so dont waste your time in those i secretly believe the devs leave it like that so they can shut down the official servers other wise they would allow admins to start cleaning them up. Community servers are your top choices if your new to the Dayz community there you can get to know the game in servers that have only Player verse environment, or you like to kill join a server strictly pvp or join a server with PVP and PVE zones there are so many servers out there try them out add to favorites the ones you like if your a noob i suggest Fairplay by hydro to start out i have many hours on dayz now owned it from when it was a bug filled game, i can promise you they have and are still fixing any bugs reported to them and at the current state the game is now you wont have too many issues with bugs the most common is lag which is mostly the server you play on if its located too far from where you live, I paid for this game i rate this game a Solid 10/10 as it is now and as it improves aor adds more threw the years it is exactly how it appears great fun especially with a group of squad mates or solo its all up to you, be a friendly character or be a evil one its your choice and you can change threw the game by just not killing someone or just by killing a rando, THIS GAME IS BY FAR THE BEST GAME OUT THERE its got base building survival, crafting, looting driving shooting hiding everything the players wanted way above its time SO YES !!!!!!

It's basically just a game full of already looted houses with nothing but damaged pants and shirts. You will either die of starvation because there is zero food or water. Or you'll die from zombies because the best weapon you'll get is a wrench. You can join the lowest populated server and the game will spawn you in a town with three buildings that has already been looted. So you will spend the next 45 minutes finding another town that has already been looted as well. The only players leaving good reviews are the ones who spent countless hours in multiple servers  that have stacked inventories and just cant die. This game should cost $10 tops.

- fall again
- leave the game

Over time, the game has undergone substantial evolution, evident in its recent iterations showcasing remarkable enhancements.

DayZ maintains its essence in a world where survival is unforgiving, presenting relentless challenges that push players to their limits. Scavenging for resources remains an intense pursuit, with towns often yielding scarce supplies, underscoring the game's harsh reality.

The game's atmospheric setting, Chernarus, continues to emanate an eerie allure within its barren landscapes and rural enclaves. Its immersive world, replete with intricate details and historical context, forms a captivating milieu for player exploration.

While navigating this realm, moments range from exhilarating encounters to tranquil isolation, defining the gameplay experience. Interactions with fellow survivors are where the game truly shines, offering potential narratives of cooperation, caution, or betrayal—a hallmark of DayZ.

However, the undead inhabitants of this post-apocalyptic world, while pivotal, lack the depth to significantly elevate gameplay. Their behavior and combat mechanics still fall short, failing to pose a substantial challenge compared to the complexities of human interactions.

DayZ's gameplay alternates between gripping excitement and serene exploration. Yet, these fleeting instances of tension and drama, spurred by player interactions, constitute the game's most captivating facet. It demands perseverance and rewards players with unique tales, despite occasional bugs and inconsistencies within its improved framework.

Overall, DayZ remains an immersive survival journey that has come a long way. Its capacity to immerse players in a social survival experience within a vivid world is commendable. Nevertheless, those expecting flawless gameplay might encounter sporadic imperfections.

For those intrigued by a challenging survival narrative steeped in atmosphere and social dynamics, DayZ stands as a testament to the genre's potential, offering an engaging and ever-evolving journey.

In my opinion, its best played with Mods to really fine tune the experience.",1703566678,1703566678,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The few times I found melee weapons they weren't any more effective than the random stick I got from a bush. A bush mind you that caused my character to start bleeding. And since this is another game that treats every human player like they don't have an immune system is basically a death sentence. 
I give props to the players that put up with the broken game but claiming those broken mechanics make the game challenging does not make the game good. I've tried to play multiple times and I have never survived passed the first fruit and bandage the game starts you with.

You drop everything you have, EVERYTHING!!!!!! Its all at risk every time you play and if you stash your gear, Its at risk of someone maybe finding it and ripping you off, or even ripping you off and trapping around where your stash was. You can Die by Starvation, Thirsting, Freezing, Burning, Vast different Diseases, Bleeding out, Falling, Shot, Maimed, Murdered (many ways), and even Eaten, and not by just Zombies you have Cannibal Players as well.

1. Spawn in and die 40 minutes later because I couldn't find food/water quick enough\
2. Spawn in, get lucky with some weapons and food, die to someone camping behind a door
3. Spawn in, die instantly to zombies
4. Spawn in, die instantly to a player
5. Spawn in, get the jump on a player, get killed by another player while looting
6. Spawn in, travel to a nearby military camp, get gassed while looting the military camp
7. Spawn in, get lucky with loot, get shot at, run for dear life, black out due to blood loss shortly after, and than die

I don't know. Maybe the true beauty of the game isn't about getting looted up the wazzoo and surviving like a true champ, but rather the struggle, the journey, the tears that you shed along the way that write a story as you spend countless hours begging the gods up above for a single piece of chocolate to get you from one city to another in hopes of finding some food or water. You cross many dangers, and encounter many many many near death experiences. When you do finally get a house that blesses you with not only food, but a backpack, ohhhh buddd... You can suddenly do anything... The world is in YOUR hands... YOU are the main character now, all that beautiful time spent that you can never get back has finally payed off. Things are finally taking a turn for the better, this is the lord himself... blessing you with your daily bread. Nobody can stop you........   *BANG* *BANG* ""You are dead"" Maybe DayZ represents something more than just an open world zombie survival game... Maybe DayZ represents our lives on a much deeper, much more meaningful level. We constantly strive to beat life, we want to be rich, we want to be ""OP"". It is because of this blinding mindset, we loose sight of the beauty that is around us everyday. We have a massive world to explore, with countless stories to tell and countless stories to write, yet we choose to only focus on the loot, to only focus on getting the best cars, the best houses, the best guns...

It's way better now. It's a lot more fun, a lot of the issues I had have been fixed. The game runs fantastically for me, the animations and movement are nice and smooth, and the amount of mods and community servers available keep the game nice and healthy. Failing that, there're always ways to play it alone if you're the antisocial type but it does detract from the experience.

There're plenty of toxic people in it, but it's a multiplayer game with a large PVP element so that's to be expected. To balance it, there're just as many if not more people willing to talk, mess around, team up, or are just generally friendly and won't fight you if you don't fight them, so it keeps things nice and interesting.

**UPDATE 2016**

[b]tl;dr DO NOT BUY THIS GAME[/b]

Previously this game ran pretty well, for what it was. I could maintain a relatively stable framerate consistently which kept me pretty happy. Despite the previous lack of loot and features to actually use, the game was fun. However, since the more recent updates over the past few months, the game has gone to utter shit. My framerate has dipped so ridiculously low that it's literally impossible to play the game. I get barely 30fps in fields and roads, and it dips to 10 or less in towns. 

Honestly, that's unacceptable. Especially when I can launch Arma 2 and get 60+ fps almost all the time. I have a friend who has very high end gear and he gets terrible framerates too, so it isn't an isolated issue. The more recent update that claims to improve FPS (0.59) didn't improve my FPS at all. Update 0.60 claims to increase FPS even further but I have my doubts.

This has been in early access for too long, games which were put into early access around the same time and after have since been released, and I would honestly suggest you go and play one of those instead. If you want a survival game, go check out Escape From Tarkov - it's a good looking game and it probably won't suffer the same horrific performance issues as DayZ.

I'm sorry to say that this game has gone from something relatively decent to utter trash. Avoid it like the plague.


**ORIGINAL REVIEW**


A man took my trousers off and force fed me rotten bananas

But asides from that, I've had a good time. I was skeptical after having an awful time on the mod, what with the abundance of KoS and just a generally unfriendly atmosphere. I was also one of the veteran Arma players who gave it a go, so my knowledge of Arma's mechanics paid off when I decided I wanted to turn the tables. I got bored of doing that after a few hours or so anyway.

The standalone - I have to say - is a thousand times better than the mod, the community so far has been wonderful. Even the aforementioned bandit and other encounters were actually really polite (I'm not saying I'll take my pants off for you if you say please, I'm not a slut :c). I've been helped out by fellow survivors as a new spawn, and in return I helped out other new spawns, as well as the people who helped me if I came across them later on. 

The game is hard, even on the regular servers. If you come across even a single zombie when you're unarmed it's best to just run as far as you can and hope it loses interest. If you start bleeding, you're gunna have to sacrifice your shirt to bandage yourself. You'll need to make more decisions as to what you want to carry around with you, inventory management is much more important now. You also have to be ready to lose that gear if you come across a bandit or two who have the advantage. 

Naturally, there are lots of bugs, some of which are incredibly irritating, but when you pay for an early access game you have to expect that, so you can't complain about it. It's annoying when you lose your character, or when loot never spawns, or when zombies walk through walls, but they'll get fixed.

So overall, I can't complain. Whilst the game is in this state, I can't tell you what is bad and what isn't, only the very core mechanics have been implemented and even then they aren't fully completed yet, my advice would be to wait. £20 (or however much it is in your region) is a lot of money to spend on an early access game, especially if you're unsure about it. As the days go by, Bohemia will be adding in vehicles, more loot, zombies that abide by the laws of physics and so on. It's best to wait the game has more depth before you make a final decision.

I'm glad I bought it though, it's a damn good game and the developers deserve my money. I also met Dean Hall at Rezzed last year, he's a lovely guy and works really hard on his projects, if any indie developer deserves your money, it's him.",1391102949,1703367321,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

You know, after 5 years from my last update and over 8 years since my original review, I'm happy to say this is actually a pretty decent survival game. Some of the mechanics haven't aged well, loot can sometimes still be annoyingly sparse, and zombies are tough to deal with without firearms, but this is a solid, full-featured game now. I definitely place this more in the ""hardcore"" survival genre, but only in that it has brutal survival mechanics and unforgiving RNG when looting sometimes. 

This game is definitely not for me still, but if you like the hardcore survival & permadeath genre then this is one you could really lose some time to. I'd recommend or for anyone looking for that experience, even if it hasn't necessarily aged well after all these years.


*Update 5/20/2018*
Well, almost 3 years after my initial review this game is still in early access. They've done some major graphics and UI overhauls, but the game is still garbage. Maybe one day when our kids are old enough to PC game this will see a full release, but I wouldn't hold my breath.

Have you ever wondered how magicians do their tricks?
Do you want me to teach you a trick?
Step 1: Buy DayZ
*POOF*
Congratulations you just made $30 disappear with absolutely no fucking idea on where it'll ever go! 

Do you think you got a game in return? Psyche! 
What you have purchased is a shoddy, poorly-optimized, lame excuse for an open-world survival game. ""But they'll be updating it over time to make it run better, add new features, and fix any in-game bugs"". Nope, try again. In the last two years there have been - from what I can recall - about 4-5 major updates. Sure, there have been ""bug fixes and balancing"" implemented, but the same recurring problems never seem to get fixed. In fact, some of these issues have gotten worse. For example, at initial release a lot of the zombies were bugged; they could clip through walls and doors, hit you from excessive distances, and you would hear sounds of them near you without seeing any followed by taking heavy damage. 

Those bugs don't even include the fact that zombies would chase you for 10-15 minutes at a sprinting pace without stopping. In that time, since the game was so poorly balanced, you would often get messages that your character was dehydrated, hungry, cold, and probably bleeding; but since you're being tailed by zombies you have no chance to remedy the problem. These messages usually continued until your character passed out or you died trying to fight the zombies back. 

Now I'm sure you're thinking, ""fighting the zombies back can't be that hard"", but the hitboxes are so broken beyond repair that you could swing at a zombie 100 times and probably only hit them about 20 times. The problem with this is that the zombie AI is so overpowered that they'll hit you at least 4-5 times before you even hit them once, and since bleeding starts after one or two hits you have no choice other than to run away or die tryin'.

I could go over so many other issues with the game, but I'm honestly tired of even thinking about the frustrations this game gave me. 

Moral of the story: Don't buy it; it's not worth your time, money, or frustrations. This game will probably never come out of ""early Alpha"", and if it does the developers are only lying to you and themselves. With the amount of progress this game has seen in the last two years I would be surprised if it gets a full, well-optimized release by the time my grandchildren are born.",1445062311,1703356877,True,0,0,0.494296550750732422,0,True,False,True

The game itself is very clunky. Zombies move erratically as their model animations seem incomplete. Classic modeling that would have been seen in a game in the early 00's. Interacting with items, inventory, and worn gear is a total disaster with little to no explanation. The crafting system is entirely unexplained and very finicky. Not a single part of this game is optimized well.

This game has been out for years and they haven't gotten it even ready to begin polishing. I got it for half off, $20, and have spent 8/16 hours of logged time attempting to get the game to run. I wish I could get a refund.

To sum It up it's PTSD in a game. You'll become super paranoid and addicted to loot(ing). You'll get killed and then to top it off your body will then be eaten by the next hungry naked from the beach. Cannibals Among Us. You will be killed time and time again sent to the shore all to run back and do it again.

The change in leadership, attributed to a lack of motivation, has resulted in a failure to prioritize crucial in-game elements, such as basic movement mechanics, weapon handling, and the loot system. Compounding these issues are persistent glitches, like zombies walking through walls and fences, suggesting a neglect of fundamental gameplay mechanics.

It appears that the development team has invested considerable efforts in superfluous features, such as an overly intricate clothing damage system, complex food preparation processes, and an abundance of ways to succumb to natural causes. While these elements may contribute to realism, they seem to overshadow the essential task of establishing a solid foundation for the game.

While mods undoubtedly enhance the gaming experience, the fragmented nature of unofficial servers can be a drawback. Maintaining a consistent player base becomes challenging, leading to periods of low online activity. While this may be a personal preference, the considerable time investment required to configure mods detracts from the seamless experience one expects from a fully released game, exacerbated by the dwindling number of available servers.

The question arises: is it reasonable to support developers who have shown little improvement over the past four years? While individual preferences may vary, the consensus is that the game requires substantial attention and refinement. The concerns expressed echo a sentiment that significant work is needed to bring DayZ Standalone to a level that meets player expectations.

New Update: March 14th, 2023. 

Game still sucks, modding almost saved the game, still in beta < there were better updates years ago lol like 0.59 anything before .60 was great imo yeah some bugs but it was playable and enjoyable, I cant enjoy this game for the life of me, the mods were sweet a couple months into release of modding but now they barely function together. 

Vanilla game > unplayable, you will starve to death multiple times, get whooped by zombies if you start bleeding you will probably bleed out and die if you dont have rags, good luck finding a knife or any other cutting tool, Food is extremely hard to find, had to end several fresh spawns and eat them just to survive, Oh lol cars are still broken. I can continue with issues but I refuse. 

Modded > almost all right, some servers have the no sprint bar mod, food is easier to find on modded servers, but finding a decent modded server is really hard. Better than vanilla you will get bored after awhile.

OLD: So much potential!! 
I played the SA and the Mod since the first day so I could say I know what am I talking about.
Just to make this quick.
It came out about 3 or 4 years ago since then the developers implemented so many cool gadgets and expansions however an update every 7 months is far to less for such a game and the capacity bohemia has. There is just so much useless stuff which was introduced into the game that the game just can not go into a right direcetion. 
To many bugs, last time I died was because I was wet for estimated 10 to 15 mins although I was having a heatpack and sitting once a while next to a fireplace. 
Balancing and Community. The community has just gone to shit 80% of all players are just shooting on sight and the Zombies do not even make a slight difference on it.

This game offers a unique gaming experience that you will not find elsewhere. Somehow the first zombie survival game managed to be the best game of the genre and get things better than most games out there.
The game experience can be catered to your liking with modded servers. Whether you prefer hardcore survival experience where you have to fight for scraps and kill people with a shovel, or a more casual experience where you want to play PvE and build a homestead, or a more ''arcade'' feel where you want to build a base with a clan, do missions, raid other clans bases and carry a 50 cal sniper rifles and PKMs without being overburdened, you can find a server that has exactly the Dayz you will enjoy.

The game has come a LONG way from its alpha, and will be supported further as it is only gaining in popularity.

There are some negatives. The game engine has some drawbacks, due to its scale (250 sq km maps...) and its age and origins. Do not expect Unreal engine graphics here, and be prepared to deal with bugs and clunkyness of the game interface. Your experience may vary depending on the server you play.

It has come a long way since the days of being an Arma 2 mod, the game itself is great, the modded servers even more so in my opinion. Bought it when it first released, and still bringing me enjoyment.

Well before you do buy this game, I would recommend that you watch some videos of DayZ because it might not be your type of game. This game isn't perfect yet, it's still in pre alpha stage and will be for a while, there are small glitches (lag, running through walls, disconnecting) that might ruin your game experiance. BUT put that a side, this is a brilliant game and I would seriously recommend that you buy this game because this is the best zombie survival game (in my opinion) that you will ever play. My final verdict is that you go and buy this game now.

you can hunt bears wolves crocs and even alien vs predator type sifi severs alike.[with weapons armor form halo battle ground arma2 etc to match the theme]

The most redeeming quality about DayZ is the modded servers, and you soon realize that almost every good modded server just tries to emulate what makes tarkov good. Barebones Dayz is no better, it remains a buggy mess and the gameplay loop is horribly repetitive. traveling long distances and surviving the night is about as fun as being on hold for 2 hours because someone in New Mexico bought a tv with your credit card number. 

I am not saying tarkov is a better game, because that has enough problems of its own. But if you want a more rewarding and stable gameplay experience for essentially the same price, I would recommend EFT. 

Of my 400 something hours on this game, about 300 or more was spent running from location to location.

The development team breaks old features faster than they can implement new ones. This game is dead in the water, and likely will never be finished. On the off chance it is ever completed, the game is a far cry from what it was originally sold as; a multiplayer survival game based off a milsim for realism. Instead, what you're getting is deathmatch shooter built in a poor choice of engine. Do not buy.

Edit:
Returning years later, things aren't better. Fewer things are outright broken, but many have been simplified to a point that the content of the game is ultimately just as truncated. The game is a lonely grind up to an unsatisfying PVP experience - too little focus was given to why, and how, players can cooperate. Paired with a clunky interface, jittery NPC's, and limited simulation from a game built off a sim, I can't say much positive about it.",1447780435,1702618732,False,12,0,0.526340126991271973,0,True,False,True

 The zombies are dumb asf and barely anywhere to be seen and the melee is almost as pathetic as the Devs.

it took them around 9 years to get out of early access and besides a few changes and bug fixes its still the same empty crap game it was then and the only reason it stayed around this long was because of the hard work of dedicated modders. Only play this with mods, as the actual game itself is a laughable joke.

anyway, i've heard it's a great game for hunting the toughest prey, that being other players. cannot help you there as i actually play it on PvE. and everyone knows toughest game are actually squirrels, just ask my dog

so yeah i have heard it can generate adrenaline rushes like no other game. or you can, just for example, find a hunting oriented PvE/roleplay server where you won't get shot on sight. then just set up a base in the wilderness and go hunting for hours while sipping real life whiskey and enjoying a cigar (well a cigarette here as i'm a simpleton). animals are skittish, you hunt by sound and it's pretty relaxing, for me at least. well if it's not your thing there also are servers with fishing mods. not my thing really but well, these mods are made well. and it doesn't hurt that game is rather pretty visually as well

which brings me to modding scene. it's quite big. there's a variety of themed servers to pick from, even though theme on 80% is ""kill on sight"". but the remaining 20% will have a lower population, well it seems to me at least. perhaps KOS is quite fun, people do say so :D there's a ton of modded maps - Namalsk (sooo cold...), Deer Isle (parkour hell but good otherwise), Takistan (desert with little on it compared to other maps, good for sniping), Pripyat (yeah, that one) and that's just a few. recently played on 2 still not publicly released maps, both work in progress. both quite stunning, really

uh, and there are game mechanics. just check WOBO. i'm 5k hours in and still learning new things every now and then. basics are as follows: wear gloves, stay fed/hydrated, don't get shot/zombie smacked/become wild life food and don't jump off crazy heights. going deeper, you get character health mechanics, bullet speed and drop, bullet damage drop off over distance, other stuff. this game is pretty deep if it comes to it

would not recommend livonia DLC though. devs went out of their way to mess up solo players basically gatekeeping best loot unless you team up with someone. i do have livonia but due to that mechanic i've got no interest in playing it, as i play solo

all in all, would fully recommend. whatever your playstyle, you will find servers for it. even if you're into running around carrying a (modded in) lamp while wearing rather flashily coloured and weird outfit with your pals throw zucchins at other players and one even serving as an on foot speaker for blasting cheesy music. honestly, happened 2-3 years ago and still no idea what was that about... sometimes you just meet weirdos i guess",1702471476,1702471476,True,0,0,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,False

I remember the game's initial launch when it struggled to run on mid-range computers. Numerous game errors, server search problems, and even a simple vertical ladder could easily kill your character, putting an end to hours of loot hunting.
Only the community helped pull this project out of the mire, out of the abyss into which the entire DayZ team was rapidly descending. What is DayZ today without all the user modifications, wonderful servers created by the community's hands? Who are you without them? I know how DayZ operates on PlayStation—it's a completely dead game. Thanks to the community that still believes in the game and carries it on its shoulders, but this is not your merit!
And today, when developers can help and support each other, standing firm, the entire DayZ team has turned its back on its colleagues and started mocking the failure of The Day Before team. It's important to mention that the state of the DayZ game at the time of its release was no better, and perhaps even worse, than The Day Before. It's crucial to note that as of 2023, the DayZ team still hasn't learned to properly synchronize vehicles in their game, not to mention numerous other bugs that we all know about.
I am ashamed that I bought your game, and it's hard for me to tolerate the hypocrisy of the DayZ team. I will never return to it, wishing you all the best.

UPDATE: June 25th 2019 : getting better but then gets worse ... survival mechanics are too easy and fighting with zombies (with guns up close) is fucking AIDS especially when the damn melee with gun doesnt work,,, sigh, maybe another 6 months it will be fun?

EDIT : January 30th 2019:
Its broke as fuck my dudes, wait until they come back from christmas vacation (LOOOOOLLLL) and maybe they will fix this broken game thats apparently a 1.0 ... Boy did they rush this release for some sweet XMAS money.

Original : March 5th 2015:
An amazing game, highly recommended but not for those who can't endure bugs. Remember most games take about 3 years to be fully developed, and under an open-alpha is no different so expect for this game to be in alpha for at least another 9 months or more, but i have to say it's the only open-world survival game i ever play for it's attention to detail and promise of so much more. There are plenty of bugs, but don't let that deter you from purchasing the game now at a reduced price, as this game has more promise than any survival game out there (the forest may be close with it's multiplayer but i still prefer dayz for its large worlds, beauty, and zombies) .

Pros:
-Inventory system in which all clothing has seperate pockets matching real life (kind of arcadey right now as you can put large things in your pants and such)
-Large open world
-no arcadey crap to break immersion
-Deer, elk, pig, goat, chicken, and sheep to hunt the shit out of (first advanced ai stages just recently implemented)
-plenty of mechanics not limited to (and just in their beginning implementations) : growing crafting system for items and weapons alike, hunting, horticulture, lockpicking, a v3s (drivable vehicle), the beginning of a loot respawn and global economy loot system, exciting pvp system thanks to a local voice chat (most ""survival mmos lack this for some reason, we need voice to communicate in dire situations if we don't have teamspeak)
-Armbands that can be crafted from raincoats to be used as a realistic way to identify team mates
-Large scale of melee weapons, firearms, and long list of wearable clothing including medic outfit, firefighter, military (many types)
-new battle eye that has *somewhat* stopped hackers, and will always keep getting better
-amazing personal experiences if you stay friendly and know how to cautiously talk to others, many bandit fights.
-lots and lots of features planned to all be added within 2015
-console version coming out, not planned to be ""watered down"" at all, by the developers words, and i do believe it, noone would buy a crappy watered down dayz
-others daddy cant summarize cuz he's in the clouds

Cons:
-large amount of character killing bugs (mostly involved with connecting to faulty servers , pick a dozen GOOD and STABLE servers you can trust and stick with them
-lag and desync can happen on many servers , try and choose servers closest to your country 
-hackers come and go, but eventually large ban waves are handed out , i personally haven't had any experiences with hackers in my 1,186 hours except for 2 times back in the day when we all had m4's
-rubberbanding occurs on characters on servers experiencing heavy load (lol)
-PVP bandits everywhere, although i have to say out of the many people i see in my travels at least half of them are friendly, the other half shoot on sight , so stay hidden
-high learning curve at first for some, especially learning to avoid certain bugs in certain mechanics (they always get fixed some faster than others)
-vehicles kill you sometimes when you stand next to them on uneven ground or if the engine is on and you get out

All in all its a great game and i highly recommend it because it's given me nearly 1,200 hours of fun already and its only half way finished ! Be patient, if you can't handle the bugs, dont abandon the game just take a break for a month becuase progress is steady!",1425593032,1702072232,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But when the standalone game came out about a year later I was pretty disappointed, so I stuck with the mod (and its other mods) for a long time. It will be 10 years in a few days since the standalone released and now its finally in a good state.

I wanted to try this game long time ago and now, when I have it and it is in complete release state, it looks like a tech demo for the zombie survival shooter with enormous map, nice, but outdated graphics and lack of content. It can be relaxing if you want just check the view and play it like walking simulator.

Infinite empty houses, few zombies and, if you are patient enough - sometimes other players. Sandbox where you can not do much actually. Loot and try to keep yourself alive just to lose it all after you starve/die from disease/die from blood loss/will be killed by other players, that is pretty much all. Items detereoration rate is really huge compared to your looting speed. You can have some fun exploring, but actually this huge map is constructed with not so much assets, copy-pasted in different combinations. Same empty houses/hangars/containers/ruins again and again. 

Best way to interact with players - kill them first or run for your life away. In other case you can have a chance to obtain some different experience, but in 90% of situations they will kill you and you will have to start over this boring pointless game loop.

With mods it can be not so bad, but I think this game needs total rework if it wants to be interesting and fun to play.",1701993448,1701993448,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

                The first thing i want to mention is on the UI, If you are first starting the game there could be some confusions in the UI since there is no true tutorial for the game, But as you play it, it will become more obvious what certain icons do and get used to the Ui.

               The next thing i want to talk about is fps / third person aspect of the game. Although i love third person, in all general i love how immersive the first person offers when it comes to gameplay, The thing i like about this game is that it offers a range of first person / third person only servers to mess around in if you prefer one or another. The shooting / aiming mechanic could also use some work with some bugs but we'll get more into that later. The movement is not the best but for the type of game it is i do think it works well with the mechanics they have in place at this time. 

                 The next thing I'd like to focus on is the modding side of things. The game has extensive modifiable servers to offer hosts and players a wide variety of content, but don't worry if modding isn't your thing there is always vanilla official servers you can always play. 

                  Next i want to focus on some cons of the game that could stray players away. 
First thing is the cheater problem. If you play on official servers then you will almost 90% of the time run into a cheater. Its much better on non-official servers where they are highly moderated by the server hosts. Another con would be there is quite a bit of bugs that could break your immersion, for example: Sometimes when you interact with doors and other intractable things, it will cause your hands to be bugged. Which means most of the time if you don't have a friend to tie you up to fix it, you would have to re log, Another bug would be sometimes when aiming / shooting a fully automatic gun it won't let you hip-fire.

            Finally in the 956 hours I have in the game I overall enjoy its immersive, Game play filled, Modability of the game. Although the bugs are rough sometimes they are the small cons over many pros of the game and I highly recommend playing it if it's your style.

Edit: Me and my friends have been killed by cheaters numerous times. Vanilla is unplayable. The fact they don't have a way to report players who killed you is hilarious considering how bad the cheating problem is in DayZ vanilla. Fix your game. Or let the players report cheaters so we can have a system in place to clear out cheaters. This is so stupid.

Despite limited playtime due to not having a computer initially and its absence on consoles, I immersed myself in hours of watching role-playing server videos, compelling me to dive into the game when the opportunity arose. My experiences were consistently enjoyable, making it easy for me to recommend DayZ to anyone contemplating whether to give it a try.

Set in a vast map with numerous towns and cities, DayZ offers a rich zombie survival experience. The game's immersive world, although predominantly in a language other than English, can be navigated more comfortably with the help of online maps. As a free-roaming survivor, the game's loot system is rewarding, providing a variety of weapons and crafting options, allowing players to create bases and even drive cars.

However, DayZ truly shines in its PVP aspect. I strongly recommend diving into free-to-play, role-playing, or PVP servers with a group of players for an enhanced experience. Caution is advised, though, as the game's unpredictability can lead to encounters with untrustworthy individuals who may betray your trust, adding an element of realism to the survival dynamic.

Despite potential encounters with eccentric characters, DayZ is a game well worth the investment. Whether you're concerned about the return on investment or the overall experience, don't hesitate. With a couple of years under its belt, the game is likely more affordable now and promises an unforgettable and immersive experience.

The game's strengths lie in its realistic survival mechanics, vast open world, and the unpredictable interactions with other players.

What I Liked:

Realism: The need for food, water, shelter, and medical supplies adds an intense realism to the game, making every decision crucial for survival.
Player Interactions: The unpredictability of encounters with other players creates tension and excitement. Cooperation or conflict are equally possible, adding depth to the gameplay.
Open World: The vast map offers diverse landscapes and environments to explore, each with its own challenges and resources.
Crafting and Exploration: Gathering resources to craft items and discovering hidden locations is rewarding and keeps the gameplay engaging.
What I Disliked:

Technical Issues: Occasional bugs, glitches, and server issues can detract from the overall experience.
Steep Learning Curve: For newcomers, the learning curve can be quite steep, leading to frustrations early on.
Recommendation:
For players who enjoy challenging survival experiences and the thrill of unpredictable player interactions, DayZ offers a unique and immersive gaming experience. However, it's important to note that the game may not appeal to everyone due to its technical issues and learning curve. If you're patient and enjoy intense survival gameplay, it's worth giving DayZ a try.",1701758872,1701758872,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Only 30 hours total so far and the hardest part at first was finding food/drink and figuring out how it all works. Spent my first life cooking and learning that only to get blasted as soon as I left the building I was in. Fires give you away.

Second life, looting a major city to get instantly dropped. 

Third life, die from starvation.

Okay, fourth attempt. Ran around a huge city for a while. Figured out things to leave behind and what to keep. Few dead survivors laying around. Sure, means someone's ahead of me so the tension is on. I enter a house and see briefly a zombie across this small river running oddly as if it was chasing someone. I hear a bullet hit my window. Run out back and get a better angle only to see it was a stray bullet as a few more went flying in different directions. Okay, this guy doesn't know how to aim, I thought. Pull out my bolt action rifle, aim, line it up and I see a second guy right behind him. I don't think they've seen me yet, maybe just luck. I aim at the first guy as he stops in his tracks and pop him right in the head, guy goes down. Can see his mate panicking running around as I re-enter the house to get a different angle and the second guy comes back into view, right next to his mate. Pop the bastard, he goes down. Okay, I thought, let's check it out. As I cross the river I see ANOTHER guy running around towards my direction and back up to the first guys spot. I fire with my pistol, he turns around and returns fire. 3,4 hits and the boy goes down. I'm unscathed. Turns out 3rd guy was actually 2nd guy, don't know how he got back up but oh well. I scope it out a bit more before I start looting then quickly stealing their sub-machine gun, tactical gear and ammo. Firefight is over, I find a spot to log out and contemplate my heartbeat.

So here I sit writing this, hands still shaking and heart calming down. This game provides some adrenaline-filled, intense action and I loved every moment of it. Crafting is a bit tricky, getting the hang of it as you just gotta experiment or spend half the time on the wiki.

They made this longer by changing the game engine halfway through development, BUT this was the best possible idea they could have had, since the Enfusion engine was used, most of the graphical and physics based glitches were fixed.

We then entered the days of loot balancing issues, where you would simply just starve because you literally could find no food at all, the rumours of finding apples in trees was 110% a lie and I'm sticking to that, bullets for guns you never found and the zombies were little more than a slow nuisance. But with trial and error this was all eventually 'fixed' and the 1.0 release date came.

Now the game is smooth as butter, zombies are actually scary and even climb fences to catch you, weapons are in places they should be and food is as scarce as it should be (exists but not in copious amounts) base building and farming were introduced which added a little extra fun and longevity to playing sessions,  honestly there's more in this game now than you could wave a short stick at :D

The actual reason I still play this game after 12 years of rough development hell, poor patches and broken ankles is the sheer adrenaline it gives you when you're fully geared and you start hearing gunshots nearby, or see another group of players also geared up, do you attack, do you avoid? It really gets the blood pumping and i struggle to find games in the vast genre that is 'sandbox survival' that do this as they all kinda mould into one and are just 'meh'

The games not bad but due to its life cycle and it’s future plans I don’t recommend this game. 

What made this game so popular in the beginning is not because of what it is now. But of rather it’s  atmosphere, exploration, game engine, mili simulation ( built upon mili simu) 

The actual game mechanics of survival can be casually enjoyed but not for long. Base building and crafting are basic and sad considering how much time this game has been in developement. 

The engine now is amazing and a huge improvement. But sadly this is really the only astounding improvement since alpha release.

In an overall review this game can be enjoyed with its casual aspects with a couple friends and enjoy its world exploration. Combat is somewhat average, nothing great. 
The only advantage this game has is to created stories in peoples play throughs. Everything else is just shit. 

There are better games out there that have more to offer. If you have to buy this game just for its historical gameplay go ahead. But you will not be enjoying it as much as other games on the market. 

I do not recommend this game at its price point and it’s progression stages from early access.

Good:
-Decent graphics
-Sandbox world is pretty big
-Only lag really comes from driving cars/flying helicopters. 
Bad: 
-The devs nailed the Soviet era look, but some furniture inside the buildings would do wonders to make me NOT want to piss myself while exploring at NIGHT. Lol

-I don’t know WHO described that game as an MMO, but it’s not. MMOs have WAY more than 60 players, (low side should still be upper 100s PPS cap)  and typically don’t have you bounce around between zillions of player controlled servers.

I defended them for years, they were going through an engine rewrite, gamedev is hard etc, but years after release and continuous development, many major updates, you can't put things down without them occasionally disappearing. If your inventory has slots for the thing you're putting away, even if you're replacing a like for like item (eg: weapon mag,) it will just drop on the ground if they're different orientations in inventory. Even sometimes if they're the same. If you take out a, for example,  walkie/GPS (which has its own special inventory slot) with a hotkey, then put it away, the game will ignore that slot and if you have no other space, just drop it on the ground without telling you. Sometimes you'll spawn into the same server you left as an alive character and suddenly be dead for no reason with a new spawn. Walk down a staircase and your character has a seizure. Also - solid objects like walls are often a mere suggestion to the undead. You'll frequently get all the way to military areas, which takes hours, aggro a zombie, and then get kicked because the server can't handle the zombies and loot. But because when you leave your character stays in game for 15s to prevent combat-logging, your character just sits there dying helplessly, even when it's a server frackup, so you die through no fault of your own. which is a common theme

It can be a pretty mellow camping simulator, but the game is objectively bad. They removed the mechanics which change your appearance if you're friendly or a bandit because it's ""not realistic"" but then added a counter for survivors killed, which besides also not being realistic in game psychology means it's the only thing players can track as a form of progression, so of course they'll see that as ""what you're supposed to do."" Those together destroy any chance of not being killed on sight. The devs do not understand what made the mod back in the day a global phenomenon, because you could arguably look past the fact that the product straight up does not work because it had a great community which had reasons to actually create interesting human stories more interesting than ""saw a guy, killed him"". It really sucks if one of the best things in your game was the hackers, especially when you get rid of them and realise that substantially, there's nothing really left. You can learn the mechanics, but in any other game that's the start of actually having fun with it, once you figure it out there's nothing more ... There. Also, half of those mechanics are just outright dumb, while the game is supposed to be realistic above all. Open a tin of beans with dirty hands? Of course you'll get sick, because your character decides the best way to eat a mostly liquid food out of a cup-shaped container is to stick your fingers in like a 4-year-old instead of drinking from the tin like a functioning adult. But just-as-dirty gloves are fine. It's something you can learn fast, but it's one of many examples of ""realism"" actually being fake difficulty that makes no sense to pad out the time you spend in the game before realising its lack of anything real to offer

Pros: 
Can be mellow and beautiful at times if you want a camping / hunting sim with a chance of being murdered at any time. It's also a good exercise in nihilism and learning to accept and embrace loss as an inevitable part of life 

Cons:
Literally everything else. The game is an indefensible, nonfunctioning PoS. It still plays like a pre-alpha, and they actively turned it into a shooter with crazy long rounds instead of the fascinating survival game that made it famous. Which is a real shame, because they began with a winning formula that I adored and systematically fracked up every part of it. 10 years after they started selling the game, it still doesn't have feature parity with the mod that made it, which would be fine as a conscious design decision, which it famously isn't. A ton of people stan it because it lets you experiment with sadism, killing someone actually affecting something they've been working for for hours or days, so they really feel the loss, which is interesting and has its place, but doesn't excuse the product you pay for being outright broken, and it's the only way anyone you're likely to run into actually plays which gets old fast

Then, the actual gameplay is garbage. The game mechanics are clunky, there are no guides or tips to help you along, everything has a steep learning curve. And there is virtually no loot to find. You'll die of starvation or dehydration before you die from a zombie because there's NO food anywhere.

Clothing mechanics are broken. You could be wearing 5 layers of thick clothes and still shiver in slight winds. The clothing descriptions don't even make sense: the insulation on one pair of pants could be high while the other pair is low, but the low insulation pants will say they're warm while the high insulation pants will say they suck at keeping you warm. So it makes no sense at all.

Disease and injury are more so annoying than anything else. And, as with food being scarce, medicine is nowhere to be seen. So if you get infected, you might as well just start over.

My opinion? Go play 7 Days to Die. Way better game. And you don't have to double pay just to play. Unlike Dayz, 7 Days to Die doesn't require you to pay a subscription to host a server ON TOP of paying just to download.

I've been kicked off of servers more times in the last week than I have in all my years of playing on multiple platforms. I am severely disappointed. Although, I still love this game, and would still recommend. 
Now that I have 5 times the amount of hours logged in the game since the time of my initial review, I can properly review the game. I love this game, I'm still somewhat new to the game, there are aspects still lost on me. But that little nugget won't stop me. The opportunities in this game are pretty much limitless. The fact that you can work together in this game with other players, or delve into anarchy (which is the sad majority of servers), is amazing. There are things that can be fixed, like certain animations, the car driving has always been bugged. But I know the Devs are always working hard on this game, to make it better. I highly recommend this game. Happy Scavenging! 
Edit#1: Since my last review (20 Hours) I now have over 120 on PC alone. I also play on console. This game is fantastic and perfect for relaxation.

The game's open-world environment allows players to navigate through a post-apocalyptic world, where survival is the ultimate goal. The dynamic weather system adds realism, as players must adapt to changing conditions such as rain or fog. Crafting and scavenging mechanics enhance the gameplay, as players must search for supplies to meet their basic needs and defend themselves against both zombies and other players.

DayZ would be a combination of Escape from Tarkov and zombies, except way more hardcore, dont play it unless you want to know what true suffering is. the graphics look horrible still even with there new engine, and please save yourself from this abomination if you have a low end or decent pc, because not only does it look horrible it puts you at a major disadvantage against someone else who has a good pc. the gameplay loop is just you wandering around until you find a house which has nothing in it or you find zombies. even though it has been out for a long time i really expected better than this absolute garbage. and when you finally do get a gun every zombie suddenly wants to eat you. if you want a survival game kinda like DayZ then try escape from tarkov or project Zomboid, or rust.

Edit- November 2023 
still trash even after getting used to the game, it becomes boring and stale, not worth the money or dlc, its honestly sad how boring this game is, just waking gathering supplies risking your progress taken away. 3/10 it gets repetitive and a death can set you back doing the same shit over and over again. 
Edit- December 2023 
after steam wanted me to revise my review i still in all honesty cannot recommend. considering the 40 dollar price tag and the dlc its not worth your time or money. honestly Bohemia today just wants you to fork over money because Chernarus is such a shitty map. i play on my own server now just messing with mods and other stuff, about 20 hours are spent on an official and a low pop server and i hated all 20 of those hours, it was just walking around, and being shot dead. the dlc should be 4 or 3 dollars considering how the base game is 40 but Bohemia is a bitch and cant fix Chernarus, half of your time in Chernarus will be just roaming from house to house, town to town, looting and grabbing things until you get shot. or die of a disease or starvation. i am honestly wondering why people choose to play this game and id like to ask someone who plays DayZ how do they actually enjoy DayZ. now what i want you to do is put away your 40 dollars and go to escape from Tarkov right here: https://escapefromtarkov.com and go buy yourself an actual game worth 40 dollars. or why not spend it on rust if your looking for a survival game. honestly if i had to i would refund this game but steam wouldn't let me.",1688455869,1701516813,False,4,0,0.54495006799697876,0,True,False,False

Pros
---------------------------
Absolutely great game!
Open world
Great mechanics
Addicting (i have 100 hours played in 2 weeks.)
Tons of close, from a pink dress, to a military vest
Good amount of guns, and gun accessories

Cons
---------------------------------------
OK community (And weird) a good amount of hackers, it will be fixed in the next update.
Very bad glitches, such as randomly breaking your legs, to zombies running through the wall, to falling off a ladder randomly
LAG, no matter the computer, your destin to encounter lag during gameplay
Overall rating- 8/10
--------------------------------------------------------

2. Nearly all of the servers glitch and will kick you off during game play. 

3. Even after deleting and unsubscribing to mods, the non modded servers will still somehow detect the mods that you previously loaded and will not allow you to play on that non modded server?!?! There are mods you can load that are not for any specific server, and yet after loading them you can't use them on a non modded server, very baffling to me. 

4. Game frequently lags. 

5. Weird & annoying door glitch in this game.

It is a hyper-realistic zombie post-apocalyptic survival PvP game. It can be Vanilla and you battle against PvE with some PvP sprinkled in or it can be heavily modded with no zombies and mainly PvP for faster pace. You DIE a lot... You cannot win at this game. There is no trophy. Your mission is to survive as long as possible and make that one life a great one. Each life changes drastically to player encounters to loot possibilities. Maps are huge and can take 1hr+ real time to cross. This game is only for the hardest of hard gamers. You will suffer, you will sweat, you will yell, your heart will feel like its popping out of your chest. I have played for years and I still get huge adrenaline rushes with encounters.

In addition, there is a risk of being killed as other players and zombies, and even wild animals such as bears, wolves, or poisoned food or dirty water, for this also need to watch out. Each disease has its own symptoms.

The open world of the game is a 225 square kilometers area, with many cities, villages, fields and forests and many interesting places from bunkers to lonely houses in the woods, which are very coolly drawn without any internal barriers and downloads.
Almost every building in the game can be entered. Most of them have loot spawn points, even in high-rise buildings.
Created a separate system of building bases. You can build up almost all the houses 
Or just make a hidden shelter from the branches in the woods. You can bury caches.

If your looking for that ""Gritty"" post-apocalyptic survival MMO then you might want to give DayZ a shot. DayZ Mod is also a game I fancy obvioulsly for the simple fact that it has more content right now. Patience is what we need to give the developers of this fine game. And it seems with each passing update the content improves. Give DayZ a try, it will change you...

2018 edit... Well after multiple years in the works, Dayz finally hit beta is in fact a game worthy of a second try.

2021 edit... Still going strong

2023 edit... Still by far my favorite survival game, very nostalgic to me.",1401420081,1701113295,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
