The best way to describe Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin is like a warm summer morning on the porch, sitting back while enjoying the cool breeze, doing absolutely nothing and enjoying every second of it.
Essentially this game is a rice farming simulator with 2D combat stages where strong crops make your character stronger. The loop is careful planning and tending to your crop, then beating some animals with a raiment and farm tools.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Combat is a bit slow feeling (as well as somewhat unresponsive when you special attack one direction then try to switch directions) but otherwise fleshed out and feels well done. The farming is surprisingly fun and in-depth, where good farming practices are rewarded with decent permanent stat increases. Nothing feels particularly tedious, although it would be nice if you could gain stats faster since it does feel somewhat slow for story progression.

[b]Achievements[/b]
Nothing particularly difficult, the most annoying achievement being the Aphid Invasion one where you must do a gauntlet (with checkpoints) for 100 levels defending a tree. Most come naturally as you progress provided that you do your best to make a strong rice crop.

[b]Story[/b]
The vibes of this game are absolutely immaculate; the atmosphere is a Japanese farmstead with a small group of troublemakers turned friends where you only have to worry about your crop. You can take the story at your own pace. The overall story is well set up, like something out of an ancient Japanese tale to where it's quaint in sense of scale, very simple, and rather wholesome as you progress to the end.

[b]Hate[/b]
None comes to mind, the only improvement I would make is a faster progression. The only real grind is leveling your character fast enough to keep pace with the story.

Not a terrible game but its one of those times where steam needs an average rating. The farming is absolutely sensational with serious attention to detail from tilling the soil to temperature regulation even water regulation, it even goes as far to allow you to deal with weeds and pests in innovative ways like water levels and natural pesticides. The problem is it all falls apart in the platforming segments, either one team did everything or the dev team responsible for the platforming segments botched the job badly. 
First off the button layout is goddamn horrendous making default settings a chore to play with (also if you have the numbered gamepad display issue theres a workaround) but the attacks are relatively wonky with combos being a guessing game for the most part as one series of attacks is a phenomenal combo and the next minute they arent. However that was assuming that the inputs worked in the first place as half the time I would press buttons for a simple 2 button combo to no avail whatsoever.
Then there's the raiment which is like a budget grapple hook which is very difficult to use and will sometimes pass right through objects its supposed to grab and apparently has some sort of effect on enemies but it didnt appear to do squat other than get you behind enemies in combat.
Now the real kicker is the platforming plays like a precision platformer but is janky as all hell making bossfights a real damn chore.",1704008942,1704008989,False,1,0,0.470752984285354614,0,True,False,False

This rice demands attention - fighting off pests, maintaining the right water levels, and overall, micromanaging like that one boss we all secretly can't stand. You might even find yourself crafting a Ghant chart akin to the project timeline for that never-ending construction down the street. (Seriously, Bob, when is that getting done?)

Rumor has it, players have turned to Japan's actual Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries website to perfect their virtual farming skills. Now that's dedication! And just when you thought the season was over, it's time to process your harvest, old-school style. No tech shortcuts here, only grain-busting fun!

Now, let's not forget the soothing serenades in the background. This game boasts such harmonious tunes that if your rice plants had ears, they'd be jamming along! Opt for the Digital Deluxe Edition, and those groovy soundtracks are all yours, along with a vibrant PDF artbook to dazzle your senses.

The combat feels great and is a lot of fun thanks to the raiment abilities, which let you combo, toss enemies around and apply debuffs. The rice farming is unique and incredibly detailed/involved -- rice harvests affect your stats, resources and act as currency. It has a bit of a learning curve at first and some of the advanced mechanics aren't totally clear until you experiment around, but that's part of the fun (and thematically appropriate for how the story progresses).

The game creates an alternating gameplay loops of fighting hordes of monsters while platforming across the stage then back to farming, planning, managing your farm condition at home. This aspect helps nurture a more strategic approach toward the grind, in contrast to the more mind-numbing grind usual to JRPGs, as the loots you obtained can be used to improved your farm and your rice growth, which in turn are converted into stat growth after every harvest. Each year, you have to plan your farming and hunt for specific loots to help improve certain aspect of your rice before it ripened while keeping it from illness, weeds, or insect.

Namely: the rice farming simulation and mini-games, the cooking and dinner system, the story and character arcs, and of course the animals that hang out on the farm.

Unlike other farm simulation games, I actually can accomplish everything I'd like to do in a day, making exploration and farming less stressful. The tech tree combat skills are creative and exciting, as is the weapon customization, but the combat itself is a solid B+ -- frustratingly close to an A except for some small but notable flaws that make it unwieldy (e.g. mob enemy gain invincibility on knockdown, which doesn't make the game harder, but you end up waiting around for them to recover breaking the combat flow).

That said, I don't play this game to fight mobs or bosses -- or even to explore the interesting, puzzle-like levels with some neat platforming mechanics. You play this game to fight mobs and bosses while platform puzzling in between the main feature which is farming rice and hanging out with your buddies. And make no mistake, the farming and friendship is exceptionally done. The dialogue and character designs are wonderful, and the interactions have the kind of nuance and humor many games can only aspire to. Similarly the rice farming, which is Sakuna's leveling system, is implemented with the utmost care. It is in-depth and accurate to actual traditional rice farming in Japan, but it's forgiving enough, with enough scaffolding, that you're not punished for lacking agricultural knowledge.

Sakuna is a fantastic game that is truly its own unique experience.

=======================
Frustrating gameplay, janky controls and arcane mechanics make this game very unfun

Good stuff
=====================
- Charming cast of characters

Bad stuff
=====================
Played on Normal Combat/Farming difficulty

- There are about a million systems in this game between farming and combat, you can sit down and do all the reading but the in game explanations are lacking so its trial and error

- Fuck up one part of the farming phase and you're getting a shitty yield which affects your leveling progress and generally wastes your time

- There is no gentle curve for difficulty, everything is a plateau, once you get to a new section of the map prepare to be destroyed until your rice matures at which point you'll get a level or two if you're lucky. Screwed up the farming as previously mentioned? Well I guess you can do better next year but don't bother exploring any new zones until you're leveled.

- The scarf grapple mechanic is unwieldy and takes a lot of time to get used to. Biggest benefit is that you get some invincibility iframes when using it that you need to cheese to beat bosses. 
-Combat. It's really, truly awful. Like being juggled? Hit by flying enemies from offscreen? To top this off the bosses boil down to "" launch some enemies at it and pray you don't get hit""

The farming aspect is very unique and the side scrolling ARPG element are top tier. Whoever made this should go make an ARPG in the future.

I wouldn't call this game a farming sim as much as I'd call it an RPG where your level grinding is done by literally grinding grains of rice. The higher quality your rice, the greater your stat gain is. Everything else you do is gathering materials to either improve your rice fertilizer, upgrade your equipment or make a meal so you can beat down the boss the next day. That's about it.

All the mechanics would feed nicely into each other if your work on the rice didn't forcibly skip you forward to either night or the next day depending on what time you started, meaning that how quickly you managed to complete a rice preparation task doesn't actually save you time and let you squeeze in some exploration progress, which means you'll have less or even no food buffs going into the exploration day that usually follows. Preserving food should be your saving grace, but for whatever reason I could not get any my smoked food to be used, though I couldn't tell anyways because the cooking menu gives no indicators of what will be used in a specific recipe. That time skip is literally the only thing stopping this game from being a top 10 games contender since it causes the exploration and farming gameplay loops to clash horribly with each other.

I got destroyed, it was clear I was underleveled. So I spent about the next 20 hours just grinding materials and farming rice, since a year of farming with early/mid-game materials only results in 2-3 levels. Then, at another point, the game nerfs all your stats and your ability to farm, and sends you on runs through long levels to get everything back to normal. The runs were taking longer than my nerfed hunger gauge could handle. I can imagine someone getting soft-locked if they weren't leveled enough prior to that point in the game.

Two things made this game very inefficient time-wise... First, I would have traded every farming shortcut, tool, and machine in exchange for something that would automatically maintain water level. Having to return every two in-game hours to raise or lower a gate for 5 seconds was extremely tedious. Second, why do I have to start halfway down the hill every time I return home, instead of at the house?

My last issue is that the game gives you all these rainment skills, but they're pretty much useless. I would only care to use them against bosses, but you can only use them on bosses if they're down, which they very rarely are, and you have to apply the debuff before they get back up, which is usually too short a window.",1687570113,1687570113,False,2,0,0.48972359299659729,0,True,False,False

Sakuna's growth as a character felt genuine and so did her relationships with her friends. 
It never felt like the story dragged on for too long, nor like the pacing was too fast.
I can't speak for the English VA's, but the Japanese was very well delivered.
Likewise the music had some bangers that I will most likely put on my playlist, mostly traditional Japanese, but it is also a game with a focus on Japanese culture.
There are moments that made me laugh, but that's easy.
There are moments late in the story with huge pay offs and moments that almost made me cry, a story that can do that, is a winner story in my book!

I'd love to see it get an anime adaptation one day.

The rice farming felt very involved and very in depth, form a gameplay perspective, the most polished part of the game and it is actually fun trying to manage a small rice farm.
The big thing about this game, is that the main character dose not grow stronger from fighting, but rather how good you are at managing the rice farming aspect have an impact on your growth of power. But at least it feels like your character can grow forever, so if something is too strong now, just farm some more rice!
This makes it feel fresh and is a welcome change, we need more games where the main  character's power is not determined by fighting.


Combat is kinda stiff at the beginning and while you do get used to it after a while of playing, there are some kinks that kinda always gets in the way, like knocked down enemies can't just be attacked, unless you used the right Area of Effect skill or something.
It is satisfying to beat a hoard of enemies tho.

There are many good ideas sprinkled around, but the execution is very stressful.

First, the combat.
The combat conveys the idea that you have to be mindful of every button press, so you can pull off frame perfect combos and butt clenching evasions, and Sakuna feels very responsive that you can do this. Although the enemies are so cheaply designed, that some have attacks with little to no telegraph completely and unfairly break your momentum. 
The same enemy types are used over and over again as well. 

Second, the progression.
The game loves to waste your time. Torwards the end, the game artificially takes away all the progression you made for ""story reasons"", only to go on 8 different side quests to stages you've already beaten. It just feels like the devs needed to dillute and elongate the game so to meet a certain average play time.

The rice making mechanic is interesting, but nothing really to write home about.
Sure, you can learn about how rice was made back in the day in Japan, but that is about it.

What really surprised me was the characters, each one feels like they have a life and motivations outside of what you get to see in the game. Even minor characters are given stories of their own.

Growing rice is a major aspect of this game, you can manually plant, water and harvest your rice like other farming games. However Sakuna lets you control water levels, spacing, temperature and will monitor any intrusive pests or diseases developing. Change the way you grow your rice to change how Sakuna levels up. Ultimately these systems never really reach their true potential, and you aren't punished heavily for not focusing on these aspects.

There's a lot to love in this game namely the setting (feudal japan with fantasy (god / goddess)), farming progression, combat progression, pacing of the game, and discovery.

You keep unlocking new skills, tools, knowledge on how to farm, discovering new items. I think the game is best played WITHOUT looking up any guides.

I really enjoyed my time with this game, it's like the perfect balance between an action-game and farming simulator so you don't burn on doing either activities.

There's also a lot of farming spots that's easily accessible at all times and there's even a benefit of hunting at night so you're encouraged to do so.

Everything is done so well!!

Sakuna is a stellar game that is well designed with a great combat system and extremely in depth farming system. While you may flashback to games like Harvest Moon & Stardew Valley, Sakuna's gameplay is extremely different from a foundational level which somehow balances being both more in depth but less time investment. On top of a great farming system, the combat in this game is some of the smoothest I've seen with addictive combos & skills that keep things from getting stale. I absolutely love how it manages to go from 2D to 3D environments. Exploration of each location is delightful, with every location having some kind of hidden secret. I am legitimately surprised how a game this refined has not popped off. Here's hoping the developers continue the series. There's few issues I've had with the game thus far, dodging and parrying is a little wonky but the system is still smooth. I have been thoroughly enjoying it on Steam Deck, especially considering how the days are structured for quick play sessions.

The progression of the rice and your power is actually very satisfying. Not only your character grows in strength but your actual rice farming skill improves. It's a great feeling to see yourself doing better and better after each harvest. 

There is also a MASSIVE crafting economy here. You need to craft daily eating menus to have good stat boosts for the next day. You need to craft weapon, several types. Same with armor, headmasks, and so on. All of this is done fairly competently and the next reward is never too far away, making the character progression feel rewarding.

Despite all this praise, there is one drawback that is so unbelievably massive it basically destroys the entire game. The controls are SO BAD they have to be seen to be believed. At every opportunity, in every keypress, the controls work against you. I had actually forgotten that a game could have controls THIS terrible. Nothing is rebindable by the way, so good luck. This is actually the worst controlling game I have played in the last 10 years. 

Everything related to movement and controls is an absolute disaster. Dodging is not fluid and requires 2 keypresses. Parrying does not work 90% of the time. Hitboxes are not a concept that the game manages. Farming movement is done backwards and never straight. Rice hulling will give you carpal tunnel, for real. The scarf that propels you forward has a mind of its own so you end up just flying across the battlefield most of the fight. It is very difficult to put into words how disgustingly terrible the controls are. In every facet of the game, the controls fail miserably.

Like most games with awful controls, eventually you get used to it. But is it really worth it to learn some alien starship controls when you could be playing another game? I will probably finish this since the rest of the package is very compelling and I love farming sims, but for the rest of the world I think you will get frustrated and annoyed after the first 20 minutes.

Even with what I've come across thus far, Sakuna seems like a very deep game with dozens and dozens of systems at play. In fact, it was probably 2-3 game nights in before I ""discovered"" dinner with the family. I was using the resting bench to pass time at night. There's definitely a whole lot of meals to discover with varying effects on your stats. By doing various things such as exploring dungeons, pulling weeds, etc, things that you do naturally in the course of playing the game, I seem to be unlocking new skills regularly. I don't know if Sakuna is a perpetual game like Stardew or if it has an end to it. I suspect it's both, a soft ending when the stated mission is accomplished and the ability to go on indefinitely hopefully for a purpose, but I don't know.

Anyhow, I really like the gameplay thus far. It can be divided into two categories: side scrolling beat-em-up RPG and life sim farm/ranch builder. The former reminds me of Dust meets Bionic Commando - a whole lot of skills based side scrolling action in a movie quality animation style, with a hefty use of a grappling mechanic. I'm almost certain a newer metroidvania also used a grappling mechanic, but my mind is blanking. It's not Dandara I'm thinking of. I don't know. This happens a lot. The homesteading doesn't really have you building new structures on your property like other life sims I play, namely Stardew and Dinkum, but it's very in depth on farming rice, which makes sense given the name. 

Actually, it'd be more accurate to say that you don't pick and choose (at least early on) the locations and types of new buildings, but two new structures were added in the course of the story so far. It's a rice growing sim. You've got a nice single family living with you instead of a town, There doesn't seem to be an affection mechanic, or at least nobody's told me that sister really likes tomatoes and hates bugs or something, and I've not come across a gift mechanic in the options. I don't mind. It's my understanding that the core gameplay loop is using the action component to get the stuff to produce better rice, which powers up your character to do deeper exploring. I just made my first batch of fertiliser out of 34 chunks of spoiled food that I probably needed to give to mom for a few night's dinners I missed out on. It's in some empty soil now as I just did my first harvest and the rice is drying.

Sakuna is a whole lot of fun, and I suspect it only gets better with discovery.

Edit: I'm replaying the game 2 years later. With a controller, and after regaining some mobility in my left hand. With a controller it is indeed quite better.

Just could be better ya know. Also what makes it worse is that the game automatically picks your audio device format ie. 2-channel or stereo and all that and wont let you pick it yourself which is just like why, let me pick what works best for me.

Now while going from 3D farming to 2D exploration is totally fine and actually pretty dang cool there is a bit of a issue where the platforming is just kinda sucky, you use your scarf to grab onto ceilings and walls to get around but you can only aim in the 8 cardinal directions with it which just feels bleh could really use 360 movement especially since there doesn't seem to be a double jump so you gotta be pretty on point, thankfully in combat the game does a pretty good job at locking onto enemy's with it so no problems there and its actually super fun just the platforming is iffy. 

Now for bugs, just in that one and a half hours iv played iv already experienced several bugs i'm sure everyone who plays will have as they are quite ingrained, first is that there's quite a bit of character model clipping which isn't a big deal of course but is there. If you pick to turn off automatic synchronization of your camera in the options menu for some inexplicable reason it will just disable your Controllers D-Pad (Mine is a Xbox controller if that makes a difference) and doesn't even un-synchronize the camera like what?? Lastly if you die on a level it will quick-load to when you last saved and it seems the objects on it wont be properly refreshed and will un-intractable, idk if this applies to the whole game but I had this happen with the rocks you can use at Skipping Stone Hill. 

Lastly the rice farming is pretty intricate and honestly really well done but it would be nice to be able to expand the farm out and farm well, other farmables but from what i can tell you really are limited to that little plot of land for your rice the whole game. Again don't let that turn you away they went hard with it and if you like rice you will LOVE this i mean its literally the name of the game but it just a personal grip that id like to move away from the little spring and be able work on other things.

-Also the game just straight up doesn't support widescreen but does offer black bars and such which honestly i can live with since the game is so darn pretty.

So ya that's all i had to say and again i still totally recommend it. Obviously again if your a audio nerd its kinda pretty bad in that regard but i recommend the core game pretty highly actually and hope they go through with making a sequel",1651826710,1672585052,True,9,1,0.595505475997924805,0,True,False,False

*cough* So, here's the review:

TL;DR: Great story-driven farming simulator with beat em up combat. Pretty grindy at times, but so does rice farming irl. Treat this game as one to chill and spend your time instead of one to complete, you will enjoy it a lot more.

- Story: Satisfying and fascinating story of a spoiled girl who grow up mentally and become a caring goddess beloved by everyone. Side stories reference from Japanese folk lore, and each character have their own ""growing up"" story that is satisfying to follow. When developer decide to strike both aesthetically and mechanically a heavy blow to the rice goddess's rice field, the recovery process is perfectly handled for a painstaking hardship that player have to go through yet satisfying immensely when they surpassed it. Touching story about compassion throughout the entire game. God know how many time it took tear from my eyes.

- Mechanic: The game have upgrades that make sense and real, potraying the changes in rice farming history. Well, except the weather control part. There is one down side for perfectionists that is the camera when planting rice is like a balancing-on-a-rope game and never stay still, so planting rice in a straight line will never going to be a thing. Seeing your annual yield and compare it with the last year is immensely satisfying. Picking how to plant your rice to strengthen certain property of your rice (which map to your growth of stats) is a smart design. It's just planting rice, one kind of crop, but there are variants of rice I never know was a thing. I will definitely look more closely next time I go buy my rice. Each region have its own ""stage mechanic"" that make them special, not just a ""reskin"" of tiles and enemies with bigger numbers. Go behind the shielded boar, deflect the clam, flip the turtle, etc. there are always something unique about each of the enemies in the game and one have to learn how to effectively deal with each of them. And do you know that you can go mine ice at mountain springs in the winter which will help preserve your food? Yea, I didn't know either. Great attention to detail.

- Combat: There are flaws in physics and bounds, yes, but In my opinion it is nothing more than minor inconveniences. Skills that change both visually and mechanically the more you use it incentivize player to not just experimenting with all of their skills, but to use it in prolonged time and discover what hidden power their skills might hold. Beat em up style combat with grappling hook (railment) that let you mix and match skills for a style best suited to you. Either defuff/ hit-n-run, slow and big hit, magic caster or Devil may Cry up-to-the-sky-then-crash-down kind of combos. There is counter in this game.

- Drips: there are not many options in fashion, and they all affect the game mechanically, but I appreciate they change the character outfit and weapon visually for each piece of equipment. It's a nice and subtle sense of progression.

- Easter eggs and collection: There are stuff to collect, mostly ""modifiers"" for your gear, but they give you a ""radar-like"" equipment that help with the process of collecting them, there is also ""completion"" score to make sure you not missing anything.

- Endgame: there are new crafting material you can get at the no-turning-back last mission. *wink

- Music: I'm not a music enthusiast, but the music in this game hit different. The BGM not changing when you engaged in combat, but somehow give the adrenaline boost and not annoying when played for the entire stage at the same time. Cutscene's mood BGM is tear-stealing, boss music is epic, and don't even get me start on the credit music. I put that song on infinite loop for god know how long. It is not a song that made to catch your attention at first time, but when you hear bit and pieces of that song for the entire game, the credit introduce a strong sense of nostalgia, it's like a quick trip of thought thinking about what Sakuna has went through since the start of the story. Not amazing music, but they used it wisely.

- Humor: Tama *bleh* - *chef kiss. Nothing quite like having a nap on the porch with an army of kitties and puppies, and Tama.",1670055055,1670060866,True,0,0,0.492866396903991699,0,True,False,False

It's a strange, fascinating, easy-going experience, but peppered with pleasant challenge. It somehow scratches the itch for a comfy and intimate colony farming sim, while also operating as a satisfying platforming beat-em-up.

The farming consists of seasonal minigames, each with their own rituals for optimization. New systems get introduced with each harvest that keep the cycle feeling fresh. There's always just enough to remember and monitor that I never found myself doing everything perfectly - letting the water out soon enough, waiting for the right temperature to hull, bringing the ducks back inside when it sprouts. It feels great to see your character get buff when you do it all correctly.

The combat centers around this grapple hook that doubles as a generous dodge. You constantly sling back and forth throughout fights, set up combos in the air, and blast enemies into each other for big aoe damage. The tutorials aren't great and it might take a while to make sense of its quirks - some core mechanics don't get any explanation until 20 hours in. But it's worth the trouble - the loop is satisfying and reminiscent of Dragon's Crown or Odin Sphere.

There ends up being quite a bit of platforming in the level design, again centered on this grapple-dodge. It feels good to zip around the environments, but this is probably the jankiest mechanic of the game; there's too much guesswork involved in figuring out where you can latch on. Still, I was surprised at how much fun I was having even though I would often struggle to accurately attach onto ledges.

There's a million other tiny quirks and unpolished elements, but what's really holding this game back most is its size. Sakuna is begging for more than a 4-hut village and an archipelago of isolated combat zones. I want to survey the vast rice fields at the end of the game and watch my allies till the fields. As is, it just feels a little bit too small, too claustrophobic. My runner-up complaint is its resource variety and distribution; there's too much inventory noise for little meaningful impact.

I was surprised to realize I actually learned something about rice. Ten hours in I was getting excited for each new tutorial about the phases of growth, when to flood the fields, what type of fertilizer to use. It got me thinking about how important rice is - so many lives have been spent studying this one crop, thinking up new ways to cook and prepare it. There's so much cultural depth behind this one little grain. This game cares about rice, and it wants you to care, too.",1669935742,1669935742,True,0,0,0.492866396903991699,0,True,False,False

-It runs amazingly, 0 bugs, errors, crashes, or any technical problems.
-The game itself looks really gorgeous. Every moment feels like it's taken straight out of an old Japanese painting.
-Gameplay is really fun, the farming aspect is really absorbing because you get to see yourself get better at farming and it ties directly to the combat which is simple but really fun as well. I will never get bored of setting up a big strike that sends a guy flying directly into a group of enemies where they just explode into a satisfying mess of numbers, sounds effects, and special effects. The farming is also ridiculously comfy and is a nice rest from the combat which can be genuinely challenging.
-Progress is straight forward but you are not hand held. They won't tell you how to optimally plant rice, hell I still don't know if what I'm doing is right but it's still fun regardless just making your own rice. The gameplay loop is also very well defines so you will never feel stuck.
-The character development is really good. At the start you're probably going to hate everyone because everyone is a bumbling selfish, idiot, including the main character, but as time goes on they get closer and start to understand one another and all become very likable. The growth of Sakuna is really nice to see.
-Both English and Japanese voice acting is superb. I prefer the Japanese version but there were times when I really wanted to switch to English again.
-My only complaint is the weird mouse and keyboard control scheme which you can't change. Thankfully you can use a controller instead which allows you to map your buttons.
-If you like farming sims and metroidvanias then this game is for you. This game oozes SOUL from every crevice which is insane and makes me think that maybe the current gaming landscape isn't so bad.",1669385682,1669385682,True,12,0,0.657623529434204102,0,True,False,False

The realistic, in depth elements of rice farming combined with honing fighting skills plus surprising character revelations and development make [i]Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin[/i] a magnificent game. Beside its beautiful story‚ Sakuna's personal growth is a pleasure to watch. Her reason for living is tested to the limit. The balanced emphasis on farming and fighting provides a great variety of tasks to undertake, providing dozens of hours of fun.

But what makes Sakuna such a unique and memorable experience is just how well-made and in-depth its two core gameplay systems are. If you do not know the first thing about cultivating and harvesting rice, well you will DEFINITELY learn a lot about just how intricate and labor-intensive the process is simply from playing Sakuna. Everything about the rice-farming process is detailed and represented in gameplay, starting from tilling the soil to finding ideal kernels, moving on to planting seedlings, managing water levels, pest control, and weeding, to the eventual harvest, threshing, and hulling, all of which Sakuna is directly involved with (and yes, you'll have to make fertilizer the old-fashioned way, so prepare for lots of poop-scooping and waste compounding). It is an accurate representation of the entire process and really hammers home the amount of work it takes to make a quality rice crop. And you will want to make quality crops, because the quality of the rice harvest directly impacts Sakuna's level and stats--plus, additional food eaten during meals gives her beneficial boons during exploration.

The exploration sequences are also superbly done. Sakuna can run, jump, and use her Divine Raiment to grapple onto surfaces and past obstacles and enemies, deftly swinging around the screen to reach gathering and mining spots and hidden treasure chests filled with rare artifacts and soil additives. As you progress, these areas introduce new and interesting obstacles, like wind storms, jagged spikes, rolling rocks, and floating water platforms that require you to use your platforming skills to the fullest to reach hidden nooks and crannies. But this island is a demonic stronghold teeming with enemies, so Sakuna will often have to put up a fight using her farming implements and Raiment to smack some enemies around.

Sakuna's visual style and overall pleasant mood gives the game a warmth and beauty that really helps it stand out from the crowd. The visuals evoke a fantasy historical Japan that is filled with awe-inspiring beauty--I would frequently find myself sitting in my rice field at night, staring up at the starry sky as the wind blew through the trees, or admiring the detail of raindrops splashing on water bubbles as I went to explore in the midst of a storm. The story and characters also add greatly to Sakuna's charm, as this ragtag group of peasants-and-divine-beings grows into a close family that helps each other out. Listening to dinner conversations where foreign missionary woman Myrthe describes her hardships as a trial from God, or Tauemon describing his upbringing and misadventures adds a lot of life and connection to these characters.

Overall, Sakuna is a genuine gem. It is rewarding and engaging farming sim gameplay, with exciting freeform combat and meaningful stories. It really provide a warm and comforting experience while you play it. Whether you are big into action, simulation, or both, Sakuna's journey of redemption is one well worth taking.",1630856261,1669213533,True,23,9,0.744077742099761963,0,True,False,False

The parts of this game are actually great.  The combat is designed to be dynamic and fast paced,  the farming is a super interesting look at traditional rice farming methods and the story, as much of it as I could stomach the actual game for, was ok.

The reality is, the way each part of the game works is just horribly implemented.  The combo oriented combat is fraught with bad input buffers, unpredictable facing after move abilities, and sluggish response.  While at first I took this as a challenge, coupling these awful feeling combat controls with some genuinely bad-feeling environmental effects (like water droplets, which are just total garbage) makes the combat portion of the game feel like a beta,  not a released game.

The Farming, as well, is kind of a bad system.  As it turns out, simulating someone's full-time job well means you end up spending most of your time on it.  While you can choose to have your people do it instead, doing so yields meh results and prevents you from gaining the farming skills (which proc in real time as you do farming, sometimes messing up your vibe because they're quite impactful).

Oh, and the only way to level up is to grow rice.  That's right.  Getting your butt kicked in a dungeon?  Guess you've got to do a year of farming so you can get your stats up.  This game is half-baked to say the least.",1666736297,1666736297,False,2,1,0.471198439598083496,0,True,False,False

+ Game blends farming and dungeoneering into a seamless whole both thematically and mechanically. 
+ Complex well written characters, don't let their cutesy appearance fool you, each of the characters have realistic personalities and the game offers a good commentary on religion, class conflict and peasant life.
+ Adorable art style that feels like it came out of Ghibili's Spirited Away.
+ Great music. It ain't Mitsuda but the simple tunes are catchy and memorable.
+Well-Researched. As someone who actually owns farms, I can say that the techniques used to grow rice, while still abstracted, are legitimate within their time period.

Cons:
- UI ranges from terrible to downright adversarial. Farming skills aside, the game hides a lot of consequential data from the player. Like what attributes govern attacks, what items are for, etc.
- Controls are sluggish. The uses a lot of directional inputs in combat and response times and hit boxes, especially with the Ramient-related moves, can be inconsistent. This also extends to farming which uses several quick time elements and controlling Sakuna can be downright annoying when she is planting rice. Made doubly frustrating by the game's real time day night cycle which punishes you for not accomplishing tasks efficiently.

That said, its still a definite buy especially if its on sale.

Its a love letter to both in-depth farming/community sims along with brilliant homages to japanese folklore and culture. Its steeped in mythological symbolism reflective of the historical time within which it was from, along with a lovable cast of characters that begins to grow on you.

I could go on and on about how its ludonarrative gameplay and design tropes tie in so well within its core gameplay loop, but its been done by multiple Japanese-focused game reviewers like GaijinGoomba.

Whats more to love? Its a loveable farming sim that is brimming with charm and an eastern aesthetic that has LONG BEEN MISSING from the game scene. This is a gem of its time, I got it on 25% discount, and frankly I think I should've payed full price for this. I bought this thinking it would be another run-of-the-mill JRPG, instead I got a love letter to Iyashikei farming scenes like Silver Spoon and Non Non Biyori.

The combat system has an layer of complexity which is fully optional to explore, making it appealing for people who are not so good at action games but wants to still experience the heart-warming story while it leaves an option for MAD Combo action enjoyers to have fun of the variety of skills that the game has to offer.

The plot itself is a staple JRPG plot done right. It does not take itself seriously, but they focus on building up the characters by making them dynamic. This would lead to attachment to the characters along the game through dialogues when eating dinner and sidequests. The sidequests have all have its purpose. there is no point in the game in which the game tells you to fetch this for someone in order to get some point perk crap like the AAA open world games do. Instead, it is heavily influenced by the characteristics of the casts as well as gameplay advantage, and it is told through a dialogue which makes sense. This game does not need profound statements referencing philosophical figures in order to make the dialogue interesting. Its just people with different upbringings planting rice together.

The difficulty in this game is arbitrary. As it is the theme of the game, the harvest of rice dictates the power of the main character. In this aspect, if the player is having difficulties with a certain level, they have the option of cycling some years in order to stat-check every enemy in the game which is a welcoming concept since not everyone is good at action rpg games. However, it does not limit challenges as well. Much like how casual players can opt to plant more rice, hardcore players can also progress the game and complete areas which is too high for the level (given that there will be a limit since you will literally deal 1 damage if you ignore the rice growing part of the game). 

Even though I like this game so much, it does not come without its downsides
These problems ranges from minor inconveniences to downright frustrating

The keyboard/mouse controls is wack and cannot be rebinded, but it is tolerable given that you could adapt to the controls 
over time

The gameplay is not very challenging apart from the tower, but it is acceptable since the target audience for this game says a lot

There are random crashes to be experience, one in which the game will put a loading screen and will basically force you to restart. Luckily, the game autosaves every once in a while which makes this problem more of a minor inconvenience

Achievement Hunting/ 100% completion of this game is a PAIN IN THE ASS. There's one achievement that took me 3 hours just to complete, and the others I just gave up since it heavily relies on RNG. 

Other than that, the problems I encounter are negligable at best.

9/10 Would eat all of the rice in my meals from now on.

I will say that the music was lovely, as were the visuals. Thwacking enemies and having gems rain down on you is viscerally satisfying. 

I struggled at the start of this game, and mostly continued playing because I'd paid for it. After about 10 hours, I realized that this shouldn't be treated as a 2D platformer with farming elements, but rather a farming sim that sometimes has fighting. So, be prepared for that.

I did finish the game. It was...fine, overall. The fighting was fun, and once I had the farming rhythms figured out I was less frustrated with the farming. I very much enjoyed the leveling up of the farming implements, and watching the technology develop from, ""doing everything slowly by hand,"" to, ""letting machines handle the work."" It was like a bonus history lesson.

The platforming itself left something to be desired. The raiment was hard to control at times, and I detested the water bubbles you use to travel for a few of the levels. But there were a lot of skills you could place on equipment to match your fighting style, so that was a help.

I was least impressed by the story. There was a lot that I'm sure was meant to be deeply emotional, but there was no build-up to grant those moments impact. Several threads felt like they came from or went to nowhere. Other moments felt like they didn't pay off.

Artists, VAs, composers and everyone else who provided the assets, you did fine. Nothing outstanding, but it was all right. Game designers though... consider a career outside gaming.

Presumably the main gameplay loop and the whole reason I played this is the 2D action platformer, which seems to me heavily inspired by Odin Sphere (one of my favorite games). However, they got absolutely everything about it wrong. Where do I even begin?

Your attacks are stubby and have no range. In the very first level, enemies will already outrange you, and it only gets worse from there. You also have practically no comboability because it's trivial to juggle enemies out of your own range before you can finish them off or do a crash. Also, enemies become invulnerable while on the ground, which is like the very antithesis of Odin Sphere-style combat and ruins the flow like nothing else. Skills are pretty much your only way to fight, and you don't get any good ones until way later. And they use your very small skill gauge (at the end of the game I could use a skill twice before being out) that you can't replenish other than by waiting. Oh, and yeah, the game doesn't let you turn around mid-combo and generally seems to decide the direction you're facing randomly, so prepare to be missing attacks and skills A LOT. 

In terms of defense, you have... nothing. Your normal movement is slow, and you only get one jump (I've missed so many jumps...). There is no block mechanic. Your grappling hook gives you some invincibility, but it locks you in place and leaves you vulnerable before AND after. It's also short-ranged, only goes 8 ways, can only be used twice before landing, and completely ruins your day if you miss. Oh, it also deposits you at a random spot roughly the same distance from the enemy as when you started, so it's useless for approaching, as a GRAPPLING HOOK should be. You can also parry, Third Strike-style, but parrying only negates the enemy's attack and will let the next enemy hit you fine, not to mention it's pretty precise and not always available. Accidentally double tapping will make you dash, probably right into your doom. The dash has no uses whatsoever and is hard to do on demand anyway. Oh, and you can't heal other than by not interacting with enemies in any way for an extended period of time for about 80% of the game (when you get the heal on kill abilities).

And bombs. Just bombs. They're technically movable but not really, seemingly being made of solid lead and covered in superglue. They ignore invincibility, both that of enemies and yours. They have really large explosions that you can barely jump over if you time it well. They're often completely invisible because many levels have scenery in front of the arena. And they deal unholy amounts of damage. You will always die in 2-3 bombs. Try to kill the bomb throwers? They drop their bombs where they stand. Get out ASAP or face the consequences.

Oh sorry, I forgot to mention that the game uses not one, but TWO mechanics to prevent you from exploring. Hunger will stop your HP regeneration, and once night comes, the enemies get obscenely more powerful (level 7 going to level 20). There is absolutely not enough time in the day to explore many of the bigger locations. Also, if you die, you restart the whole location, losing any items or treasures found, which can be beyond frustrating.

All this boils down to combat being a mere test of your stats. Got enough? Just spam Swallow Slice and everything dies. Not enough? Enemies will poise through it and kick your ass. Did I mention they're ridiculously aggressive and have really fast attacks? Or that you yourself have no poise? Or that the enemies are very adept at comboing YOU? Even if you git gud, as it were, one or two mistakes (which won't even be your fault most of the time) will consistently kill you. As such, improving your skills is actually counterproductive because it forces you not to engage with the game and instead to focus on leveling to catch up.

Speaking of leveling. You can only do that by farming rice. I think it's really telling that all farming upgrades amount to letting you play less of the farming minigame. It's not like you get a bigger field or something, it just takes less time and effort to work on what you've got. Oh, and yes, there's pests and weeds and diseases (the latter two of which are completely invisible unless you decide to specifically look at the fertilizer... why?). The thing is, the best course of action for all of those is to completely ignore them. Cures are rare and expensive, and they don't seem to affect quality in a tangible way anyway. Just figure out a really basic pattern, polish rice till it's white, and you're good. Speaking of which, you'll only ever do about 10 harvests anyway. There is no time to experiment with brown and mixed rice. Food is pointless anyway, just eat cooked white rice for the regen and you're good. Finally, crafting. It exists. It's all you'd expect of crafting: grindy (and you can't even grind ores, so...) and unimpactful. Neither the two ""ultimate"" weapons you're given for the final boss nor the actual best weapons involve crafting. They're not even level-gated, only story-gated.

Finally, the story. I really flipped my shit along with Sakuna when the freeloaders at my house started accusing me of doing none of the work even though I'd been both hunting and working the field while they did nothing (and the game treated them as in the right!). That is all.

In short, as an Odin Sphere and Muramasa fan, I detest and abhor this abomination of a game. If you want to have fun, look elsewhere. Also screw the wood spikes for being glitchy bastards and killing me dozens of times in that one level, screw the absence of maps for the labyrinthine locations, screw the final boss for consisting entirely of oneshots and completely disregarding the prior game and forcing a garbage mechanic as the sole way to win the fight, and screw whatever else I might be forgetting in the whirlpool of hate I feel for this game. Let me reiterate my prior point: I hope every single dev for this game finds a fun and fruitful career far outside the gaming industry.",1655480089,1655481352,False,4,2,0.408507615327835083,1,True,False,False

However, this game I decided to give it a try because the visuals were interesting, decent animations for combat, and the game revolves around farming? Hmm, sure why not. I wasn't sure what I was getting into but almost 53 straight hours into playing this game, I was so engrossed that I even ignored some other games that I was playing just to keep playing this game. 

-The 'Bad'-

I'm just going to get the bad stuff out of the way first because I feel like that's what everyone wants to know first. So what's the problem with this game? Some quality of life stuff that annoys me personally. For instance, whenever you go back home, you start up from the entrance and have to run all the way back up the mountain to get home. I get it, you enter a place so you start at the entrance yeah sure but you play as a goddess, let me just magically teleport up there or something. 

Farming in this game is so realistic that I don't even know what to say. At least I learned a lot of knowledge about farming with rice! One thing I dislike immensely, probably due to my tiny smol brain, or it could be because the game has some minor issues with it, is when you're planting rice onto the field. The movement controls are fine but I wish you can strafe or something. It's hard to line up properly because the camera moves ever so slightly so even though you are moving 'downwards', the camera moving so slightly makes you veer off-course. Trying to adjust myself is battling the physics engine trying to get my character move to the proper position. It took me a very long time to get used to it.

For the length of time that I've played, the game crashed only once but thank you game for auto-saves so it was kind of moot point. And I've only been absorbed into the wall once but jumping made me pop out safely so that's alright I guess.

My last gripe is the story flow. There's a weird flow with the story here and there and without spoiling anything, an example would be like you start at point A. The story goes to point B and then C. Somewhere along they way, it feels like they would skip a point and go to the next one. It's the main story so it's not like I missed anything, the game's story seems to have cut out pieces of the story. This happens twice where it feels like the flow messed up. 

-The Everything Else-

The game itself, I would so love to give it a 10/10 but the minor problems that I personally have just can't give it a 10/10 but it will definitely win the award 'A Truly Hidden Gem.' The story revolves a super spoiled girl learning and maturing into a true Harvest Goddess was an enjoyable journey and how the character interacts with others shows this. I have no complaints about the story aside from the weird breaking points I mentioned. Still I feel like the ending could have expanded a bit more.

The combat in this game is truly fantastic. It is the core part of the game aside from the farming aspect. I feel like I am in 95% control of my character when exploring and fighting demons. The other 5% is due to wonky controls. You can press a button to send out your character's raiment, or divine shawl if you will, to grapple enemies and surfaces but the directions that you can send it out are the 8 directions, up, down, left, right, and diagonal. You can't send it out to a specific direction, only the general direction and it took a while for me to get used to it. Dunno why you can't double jump either, I feel like it should be a possibility but oh well. 

Combat feels very meaty. The sound effects and visuals when you hit and kill something are amazing. Also sending enemies flying where they can collide with other enemies and have those enemies collide with more enemies for mega damage feels really good. You are given with a huge pool of skills that you'll discover as you level up and progress in the game and they all have their uses. Some definitely feel more stronger than others. There are so many ways to kill your enemies, either by your normal attacks, strong attacks, skills, even the raiment grappling can throw enemies all over the place. Again dunno why double jumping isn't in this game as it would provide greater freedom but I digress. 

Farming in this game is too darn realistic. First you sort the seeds out. Then you have to till the field. Manually. Row by row. Then you have to plant the seeds. One by one. Adjust the water level with water gates. Add in fertilizer but wait, did you properly add in all the materials you want into the poop to create the best fertilizer? Did you added that chunk of bear meat? Or that demonic pearl? And the chunk of obsidian that I got from the volcano? You did? Good. Now you have to pull weeds that grow every now and then, adjust the water levels accordingly, After you start cutting the rice, you need to hang them to dry. After that you need to thresh the rice and the hull the rice. All of this is done manually like holy balls did I learn a lot about rice farming. Thankfully there are skills that you learn as you do this that makes it a lot easier and faster. It was definitely an experience though.

I enjoyed this game immensely. They pay attention to details a lot like for instance when you enter your house, your character wears sandals but when you jump up to platform that is 'home', your character is then barefooted. Amazing small detail. I wish there were more clothing visual variety. It's just the same outfit in different colors and patterns. 

Lastly... the English dub is actually pretty darn good. The game does allow you to change from English to Japanese voices but I decided to try the English after forgetting to change to Japanese and went through the introduction of the game.

Issues: 
-Many mentions, especially near the beginning, of drinking alcohol.
-Fake false gods and goddesses
-D*mn is spoken

I think this game is fine to play if the player remembers that the religious systems presented are fantasy, and made obviously so. And you can choose to avoid brewing alcohol when making food.

Regarding false gods and goddesses, my stance is..:

Funny though that the game is about tilling fields and fending of demonic beasts...

So let's start with an overview:

Pros:
+ solid 2D exploration/fighting levels
+ equipment/stats/fighting skills and raiment skills/meal bonus to help you fight
+ feeling of progression and increasing strength based on knowledge
+ meaningful day-night cycle
+ good narrative and interactions between characters
+ humour (better than having none)
+ voice acting (the english one is very on point too)
+ amazing creature/character design (reminds me of certain animation movies)
+ well chosen music

Cons:
- there is a lack of tutorials concerning raiment skills
(this could be fixed by patching (using the existing cave in-game) but I doubt that it will be added)
- the difficulty settings consist of ""low"" and ""default"" only
(maybe there could be hard one but some players already experienced difficulties, more concerning difficulty later)
- it is too difficult to obtain salt in the beginning, maybe ""Bounteous Earth Grotto"" could have slightly better drop rates
- changeable garments for working on the field would be nice (hats/masks do change which is nice)

Story (skip or don't):
Princess Sakuna is expelled from the realm of gods for burning the gifts belonging to the highest god on the day of tributes. Followed by her faithful retainer Tama she sets off to isle of demons in tow several humans who caused chaos in the capital of gods.
It is her mission to cleanse the lands and find the cause for appearing of demon hordes. At the same time she has to keep the humans alive by growing rice, preparing meals and aquiring new ingredients from enemies.

Main Part:
There is a lot of things that make ""Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin"" unique and therefore less comparable to other titles I've played before. Maybe you can say it is a little bit similiar to a ""Rune Factory"" experience but with different emphasis.
One part you have to fulfill is all about cultivating rice. Maybe the cover art and screenshots gave you a hint already. That means you have to till, to sow, to change water levels, take care of weed and so on. After failing you will obtain more knowledge and talking to the other characters will help you learn about cultivation and preparing food. A season ends after three days which means that the years pass by rather quickly accelerating your growth with every harvest.

Harvesting will add to your stats which are relevant when you go out into the wilds to hunt and take down smaller beasts and bosses. You are able to change your performance in battles based on equipment/stats and more as mentioned earlier. What does that mean? Essentially that means you do not have to pay attention to all. You can farm all day for a long time and fight later when your stats are already in the lofty realm or you can try to take on all enemies at the first opportunity using skill combinations and weapons/garments to your advantage. Therefore it felt more difficult for me at the start of the game and later on I did not have that many problems with certain bosses because I improved on so many layers and made use of the divine raiment.

The thing is you have to use it. I can totally understand if a player experiences problems with some enemies when you do not use the raiment at all. Even neglecting the skills connected to it, attach it to an enemy and fling yourself behind him. Attack the beast. Get into his blind spot again. Rinse and repeat.
Using that functionality only will already help you in the long run. You can also pass three enemies in a line and be on your way. Your choice. When you have practised you can become close to an untouchable thunder god irritating every mob on screen while smashing them into each other and from one wall to the other. I mean why not.
But the sun will set and you will be unable fight as all demons your level become more or less invincible and they will one/two-shot you. 

So time to go back home. Maybe some human collected some resources for you. And there are mushrooms and persimmons which will turn bad tomorrow. Do not to forget to adjust the water level because your crops to not like it too cold or too hot. Maybe a new weapon/armor can be crafted or we can put that new magical spirit bough into your old one?
There will probably some discussion after dinner (again). Ah, two more days 'till summer. Better prepare the correct ingredients for the best meals and get the summer garments.

You can say a lot about the characters and story but I think it is just weird and fun. You don't have to like everyone or every joke in-between and maybe even Sakuna seems like that childish and miffed kid she is at the beginning but they all learn to work their way out of the misery they were pushed into and start growing as a person.
I think the most memorable scene is the ""Rice Planting Song"". It held meaning and was still understandable for a western audience.

Conclusion:
I really appreciated all the facets offered by the game. Of course, holding the cat and dog played a big part, obviously. Considering this started as a two-man game and finished with more than ten devs, I consider this to be a solid job. There are far (far) too many games released today that seem untested or unfinished and this was a very positive surprise for me. Influenced by what I read before I was sceptic but I was glad I was able to play it.
What I would change remains: clothes for working on the field, salt for players at the start and making raiment skills themselves more easy accessible/learnable for new players. Difficulty is and will always be very subjective (fighting at sunset/night or de-equiping can always rise difficulty or use ""Low"" for less stressful combat).

All in all, I want to thank Edelweiss and Marvelous for making this a reality.
That means this is a recommendation. Stop reading and watching gameplay videos online.
Use your divine raiment and remember: Rice is power.",1645722236,1645722236,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This normally wouldn't be a bad thing if you could ignore one half of the game, but due to how intertwined they are, it's very unfun if you're trying to fight a boss and you're just not dealing enough damage. You have to play the 2D side-scrolling sections if you want a good harvest, and likewise, you have to play the farming simulator if you want to play the 2D side-scrolling sections.

On the topic of boss fights, what I like from a bossfight is figuring out the attack patterns and trying to strategize ways to dodge them; this may involve parrying tough-to-avoid attacks, platforming around the enemy making sure I'm not in their way, and generally focusing on a single super-enemy. However, the boss design in this game is very poor, as there are constantly enemies on screen during boss fights. Normally, this wouldn't be a bad thing; just kill them. Except, once you kill them, they respawn. Instantly. Because of this, I can't focus on one enemy, and end up getting hit because there's simply too much to keep track of. The best strategy is legitimately to tank it as opposed to not get hit, which doesn't work if you haven't gotten enough stat boosts yet from farming. 

The issues feed into each other. You'd be better off playing a survival sandbox game like Minecraft or Starbound if you want a mix like this, because if you get bored of one section, it's very easy to switch to a different mode of play.",1645567472,1645567472,False,8,0,0.489168822765350342,0,True,False,False

Now having finished the play through once, all I can say is that I loved this game.

Graphics and art style is quite nice. It has some friendly and wholesome feel to it that goes very well with the setting and the story. Then, regarding the story, while it is somewhat of a generic plot with a few strange and difficult to understand moments at times, overall it is nice and interesting with a great ending. That said, properly ending the story makes up bulk of the lasting impression to a game or a movie and I think Sakuna did it right in that regard.
I must mention here that the music and the song used in this game is very very nice, especially the end game song.

Gameplay-wise, this has one part a 2D scrolling hack-and-slash, which is overall simple but can get quite fun at times. Then, on the other hand has this rice farming element that is strangely complex and interesting.
I think it really should out to me that the combat isn't what determines the level and the ability of your character (Sakuna) but the progress of your rice farming (how great the quality of the rice is) is tied to your combat stats.

Just to note, if you progress the farming side well ahead of your story/combat side of the game, it'll greatly reduce the difficulty of the end boss. However, there are these extra bosses after you've finished the story that'll really make the combat challenging even with near max-stat rice.

Going back to the rice farming. This isn't some Harvest Moon or Stardew valley like game, but the complexity of the rice farming mechanics necessitates that you look up some guides online. I came across so many technical farming terms that it was overwhelming at first, but soon came to quite enjoy it. I found the rice farming aspect to be a very novel attempt and I think the devs did a great job in making it work.

The game has some ""end-game"" content as in 100 to 300 level dungeons at the end, but all in all, it feels like there really isn't much of a reason to replay the game since I've exhausted the story aspect of it.

Sakuna of Rice and Ruin’s story is a pretty bland one. Simple formula. You play as a silver spoon kid who gets sent to a farm to build character. In the prologue, we see the setup. A buncha hooligans somehow get set to the “Lofty Realm” (where the gods live) and make a big mess. As you attempt to stop them, you accidentally burn your tribute to the big goddess resulting in you being banished to Demon Island for not being able to offer tribute. You can return home when you’ve conquered the island for the big goddess. Turns out, mom and dad used to live on the island and their home is still kinda there. You rebuild the home and spend the rest of the game living there, growing rice and squaring away the mini-stories that deal with the hooligans you had to bring with you. Ultimately you have to slay the demon that your father fought to a draw (and eventually lost to) years and years ago. 

The characters in the game are really, really boring. They’re all incredibly flat tropes. I think the game really pulls a lot of punches with the characters resulting in them being their trope for the entirety of the game. I could probably have bought the story more had it actually tried to have consequences. But there are several deaths that are baited and then backed out on. I’m not saying I want characters to die but I feel real ripped off when you tell me the mcguffin will require the sacrifice of my first-born child and I really don’t want to use it but I decide to in the end because I’ve found something that I think is more important than my first-born only for the mcguffin to change its mind and decide I can do it for free. Really cheapens things. 

The game plays the character tropes straight as an arrow too and it’s really exhausting at times. Like Sakuna will be told something has to be gathered and we all know she’s going to gather it but she’s still going to complain “Why do I gotta do all the work around here?” forgetting that the other guys do the cooking and cleaning and they do just as much farming as you if not more. And it gets really tiring how the game pretends Sakuna is lazy when I’ve legit been on the island for like 20 years farming working hard every month and gathering materials every month like can we stop pretending Sakuna isn’t a hard worker now? Because she puts in the work. 

Here we kinda need to start splitting into the Farming vs Action elements. So what I do like is that your progress in farming directly impacts your progress in farming and vice versa. There’s no traditional leveling system in this game. How do you power up? Well, at the end of the year you harvest your rice and as a harvest goddess you gain power based on the quality of your rice. This is actually pretty cool and I like this a lot. When you harvest your rice, you’re forced to choose between food buffs and stats based on how you harvest it and that’s pretty interesting too. The primary way in which exploration and combat feeds back into farming is that the materials you gather out there can be used to improve your yields. This is kinda nice because if you ever feel walled you can just farm for a year while focusing on stats and try again when spring and summer roll back around. 

Food buffs are powerful. Not really a whole lot ot say about em. Buff your stats, gain resists, pretty simple. 

Combat is really wonky and its wonkiness is why I hesitate to full commit to calling it an action explorer with a farming minigame. You have a grapple. You use it for exploring and for combat. You have two different attack buttons, heavy and light attack. You can also use skills a-la Tales series where D-pad plus skill button unleashes a skill. You also have a second set of skills that apply for when your grapple is on the enemy but these are primarily setup or debuff abilities. You can parry enemies and in some cases it’s required if you want to apply your grapple debuffs. 

Exploration is a mixed bag. A lot of stages have stage specific gimmicks and they’re not terribly interesting gimmicks. One is “Kick enemy into wall to break it”. Another was “ride the bubbles”. A couple had “avoid the hot water” or “an enemy will continuously fire a cannon” gimmicks. It’s not hard to progress but eventually I got to the point where I had tired of it and just wanted to dash through the stages to the bosses. 

The game is really forgiving on failure. Death sets you back to the beginning of the stage. It doesn’t even come with a penalty in the way of time in the day-night cycle. It auto-saves as you enter the screen so you go back to the time as well if you die. Death really only happens if you’re not really prepared for something you’re coming up against. Maybe it’s your first time fighting night enemies or something and suddenly you do no damage and they do all of the damage. But using the grapple gives you iframes so it’s easy to just iframe through all of an enemy’s attacks. Even failing that, if you find your health getting low but you don’t want to lose progress, just pause and return to world map. You can do this at any time and there are no penalties for it.

But this brings us to my main complaints. 

First, the grapple is really awkward to use. I was playing on controller and whether I used the D-pad or stick, I had a really hard time with diagonal grabs to the point I just stopped using them in favor of just straight up grabs with a jump into a horizontal grab. This doesn’t work for a few sections in the game though, one of which I wound up using a damage boost for because the diagonal grapple was just so insufferable. 

Grapples are your main source of debuffs but it’s not clear which enemies require parries to debuff and which do not. This is annoying because if you come across an enemy you’ve never seen before you might be tempted to just throw out your defense debuff skill but this isn’t going to work because it’s one of the “parry first” enemies. The game didn’t communicate this to you so you sorta stand there grappling it, vulnerable to attack while you react “Wait, why isn’t my debuff working”. 

The hot water and poison stages exist to force me to food buff against them. It’s so dumb. The poison stages especially. The HP drain on them if you don’t have something like poison resist 3 is ridiculous.

The BIGGEST offender of “not clearly communicated” is the final fight of the game during which a COMPLETELY NEW mechanic is introduced which is all but required to beat it. It’s a really powerful gimmick. You can block all damage to kinda charge up like Bide in Poogeymun to blast the boss with a bomb when charged. Thing is, this ability eats SP and the game did not tell you this so I ate a few deaths to the final boss because I didn’t realize that when I used my skills between patterns that I used up all of the SP I was supposed to save for the special skill. 

Maybe my eyesight is just really poor (and it is really poor) but I felt that at times, enemies would just blend into the background so I had a hard time in certain fights because the palettes just started to blur together and I couldn’t see anything. 

That said, I think the game is really accessible and honestly kinda vibin. I personally enjoyed farming more than combat. I’m told it’s really in-depth and I can believe it. Not gonna find out but I can believe it. This game isn’t for everyone. But it does provide what I think is a fairly unique experience which might overstay its welcome just a tad in the second half but is ultimately quite charming and enjoyable.

The combat is sublimely satisfying to pull off and do, on the default settings it's honestly a bit too easy and cheeseable but it's certainly extremely fun to whip around and smack things around.

The farming is tedious and indepth in all the right ways, trial and error with a few hints here and there to help you along really does feel great when you improve your crop to improve your skills. A fun aspect of this is if you're not good at fighting, growing good crops makes up for it, and vice versa.

The game gripped me for as of this review, 51 hours; all within about a week. Insanely engrossing in a good way. Though I do admit near the end it started dragging on, but i think that's my fault for wanting to turtle a bit and caring about my rice just a tad too much.

The graphics are super adorable and will age very well, as well as running very nicely at 4k. Shame there is a 60fps cap but you don't really notice it.

Go into this knowing you're in for a kind of Castlevania styled grindy-ish game and I think you'll be happy. (This game is NOT a Metroidvania at ALL. It just has some of the RPG aspects of Castlevania in there a bit.)

The farming stuff is pretty in depth and the funnest part here. It's not your standard harvest moon style. You are making RICE and you're going to have to learn to take care of RICE. It's pretty cool! It's mostly QTE kind of stuff and just learning when to do this and this, but... it feels fairly immersive and is relaxing. I think this is where the game shines the most.

The other half of the game is a combat platformer. Noot much of a platformer really? Again think of like Castlevania in that sense. The combat, while a bit lackluster at times, has some fun gimmicks at least. The big gimmick here is throwing and crashing enemies into each other for big damage. It's pretty cool! I personally love throwing dudes around. It's not always totally viable, and when you're fighting major bosses you're kind of forced to not do that, but for the most part the combat gets the job done.

Level design is kinda... meh. In both the actual level design and just the interesting environment side. Music is acceptable but nothing quite stands out to me. Sound design ranges from stock noises and kind of annoying yelling to pretty cool immersive farm stuff? I really like the sound of all the frogs croaking in the night time summer for example... (again, the farming part I think is where the game was meant to be)

Writing is fairly decent too! Not the best in the world, but I liked it. The characters are all kind of jerks who don't know each other, but they learn to be... less jerkish as time goes on. Sort of. They're all fairly different and have some cool aspects. I like the main cast quite a bit.

While this game naturally WANTS you to grind, I really don't think you NEED to at all. There's a lot of equipment you can make but honestly... you really don't need to make it. I think that's probably for the best. If you feel like grinding, you can, but if you don't wanna, you don't gotta. You can even turn the combat level stuff down anyway.

The gameplay mechanics both in combat and farming are strangely vague. The farming I think is intentional and learning how to grow your rice properly is kind of important to the story as well! So it's okay there. But the combat stuff is kind of tucked away in scrolls you find in treasures that you have to read? It's a bit strange and could use more streamlining in that department.

My biggest issue with this game was just... it crashed TOO much. Luckily this game autosaves like every 30 seconds so I never lost any meaningful progress, but it must have crashed more than 10 times this playthrough. Fairly frustrating. Crashes range from the game just closing itself mid battle to (the more common one for me) loading forever and then you have to go to task manager to stop it running in the background. Maybe a better buy on console, but not sure. I didn't look into the issues or how to fix them whatsoever, since again, the autosaves made it so i never actually lost any progress.

All in all, I really enjoyed this game despite the crashes. It could absolutely use some more polish in places, but it was a fun time and I'm very happy with it. Very worth it on a sale at least!",1643333745,1643333810,True,5,0,0.598715126514434814,0,True,False,False

That expectation was partially met, but I'm sad to say that the sidescroller segments are, at best, thoroughly mediocre. I've played a lot of 2D sidescrollers, from Megaman, Metroid, Castlevania (and a ton of Metroidvanias), and so on, as well as a whole bunch of 3D hack-and-slash games in the vein of Devil May Cry, and it pains me to say that there are just too many issues with the core 2D gameplay of Sakuna for it to even hold a candle to most of them.

I'll start off by listing the positives.
 - The visuals are great, especially the lighting. It's a gorgeous game, and the way stages change with the time of day is very impressive. What was a beautiful, lush forest in the afternoon becomes haunting and creepy at night. The water effects stand out as well, as does everything to do with farming.
 - The voice acting seemed phenomenal. The titular Sakuna especially really nailed it for me. I do want to mention that the singing cutscene had not been dubbed, likely because that would require composing an entire song and matching it to a set of pre-made animations, but that's hardly worth complaining about.
 - Farming gameplay felt genuinely great! It was tedious, but incredibly satisfying. Tilling the field, planting the seeds, keeping the water levels just right, and so on and so forth all felt very rewarding. It wasn't necessarily fun in the moment, but it gave a genuine sense of accomplishment when you were done. I have zero complaints with the farming gameplay, outside of how it's taught to the player. More on that later.

Now for why I sadly don't recommend Sakuna.
 - A big gimmick of this game is the ability to grapple enemies and either fling yourself past them or fling them towards you. Or towards each other. Or fling yourself towards walls. Or fling them into obstacles like spikes. It's a really neat idea, but the execution just wasn't there. It immediately felt like a far more cumbersome version of Nero's Snatch ability from the DMC series, as there's no lock-on, only a finicky auto-aim that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't, or manual eight-way aiming. The game REALLY wants you to make use of this ability, as there are plenty of enemies that are flying around in spots that are hard to reach with melee, but well-within range of your grapple, and enemies that have been knocked down cannot be hit by regular attacks, but can be launched into the air for a juggle by grappling them. It's clear that a lot of emphasis is placed on this mechanic, but it unfortunately just feels very unwieldy, frequently hitting the wrong enemy, hitting terrain in the way of the enemy, not locking on to what you'd expect, flinging you into an awkward position, etc. This seems to be the most important part of combat (certainly the most unique part), but it's just not doing it for me, and it's actively being a bother during most battles.
 - I've fought three bosses so far, not counting the tutorial boss, and only one of them was unique. The first was just a larger version of a basic enemy with a single extra move, and who clearly had not been properly play-tested, as you could stand right next to him and spam your light attack chain without him ever being able to hit you with his basic attack. It looks like it should hit, but it just doesn't hit right next to him, apparently, unless you're against the wall. The second was a new foe, but the very next stage introduced this boss as a regular enemy. I don't know if the third one will become a regular enemy too, but it certainly wouldn't surprise me. More important, however, is the fact that they were all accompanied by infinitely respawning adds. The bosses themselves pose zero threat to you, and are only dangerous because you need to deal with a constant barrage of enemies that get in the way. This feels like a really cheap way to make a fight challenging, and it mostly just caused me to ignore the mobs entirely. Besides, unless the enemy has ranged attacks, if they're on the other side of the boss, they can't actually reach you, which feels and looks very awkward. You can end up having a conga line of adds standing around while you smack the boss over and over.
 - There is no dodge or parry button. You dodge by double-tapping a direction to go either left or right. This means that dodging an attack takes significantly longer than it should, and also means that attempting to make small adjustments to your position - which you will be doing frequently, since this is a fast-paced action game - can cause you to unintentionally dodge, maybe even putting you in harm's way. It's not as big of an issue for parrying, but I would still much prefer having it be on a separate button. I have had plenty of times where I parried attacks by complete accident, since I just happened to be trying to move at the right time.
 - The game does an absolutely dreadful job of teaching you its mechanics, which is strange, because it does have a tutorial. It has multiple, in fact! And yet, it fails completely at providing you with key information. Everything I just said about dodging and parrying? I discovered that *on my own*, long before the game thought it would be a good idea to tell me about it. You don't get told that you can dodge or parry until well after you've cleared a multitude of stages, including the first boss, and even then, you're only told in a scroll that you have to go and manually look at. This is even worse with regards to the farming aspects. I like the farming, but I would probably like it a lot more if I had been told how to actually do it. Instead, you're given very, very basic instructions and then let loose to do whatever you want. I'm guessing they want you to mess up at first and get better over time, but it genuinely feels like I just did not have a chance to succeed on my first go. So much information is completely hidden from you until you either happen to figure it out on your own, like I did with fertilizing the soil, or until the game decides that it's time, usually way too late.
 - Your stats are very, very important, and you gain stats in bulk. Whenever you finish a rice harvest, your stats increase dramatically, and this can be a massive boost in power and defense. This is a problem because of how it will essentially just gate off areas until your next harvest cycle. I went into an area and tried my hand at clearing it, but I thought I was doing way too little damage. Sure enough, one harvest later and my damage output had literally doubled. I hadn't gotten better at the game, and I hadn't learned anything or even really done anything, I'd just twiddled my thumbs until it was time to harvest, at which point I was good to go for the next area.
 - Lastly, I just think movement and combat in general can feel very sluggish. Notably, it can be very frustrating just to turn around during combat. If you're facing to the right and you start your basic combo string, then you're not gonna be able to switch to facing left during that string. You'd have to manually cancel it with a dodge or some such thing just to re-orient yourself. For a game with such fast-paced combat and an emphasis on dealing with large groups of enemies, this feels weirdly stiff. I would say that this is the kind of thing I'd expect from a slow, clunky Soulslike sidescroller, but even those don't make you commit to a direction to this extent. Really weird choice, and I don't think think it fits the game at all.

To briefly summarize, in case you don't feel like reading all of the above: I think the game does a very poor job of teaching you a lot of its core mechanics, and I think the 2D sidescrolling sections are really bad, and I don't think the excellent farming simulation and visuals do enough to make up for it.
It's a real shame, 'cause there's a lot to like here, but I feel like it just stumbles right at the finish line.",1640701922,1640701922,False,162,8,0.639698386192321777,15,True,False,False

I will over hype this game to the moon and back. I personally, do not enjoy platformers but Sakuna MAKES them enjoyable. The music and the characters along with their interactions with others and the world will absolutely suck you in. 
Sakuna isn't just some cookie cutter game, it's a fantastic story that will make you feel all the same emotions Sakuna herself does

A lot of games promise you can go at your own pace and then lie to you and lock things behind story process, as far as I've noticed Sakuna doesn't do that. You can freely go fuck off and do whatever you want and like and then come back to the story when you feel like you're ready.

My biggest gripe is that they introduce a new mechanic for the final boss and expect you to use it to win. It felt like all of the skills I had developed throughout the rest of the game were meaningless, and, as far as I know, that mechanic is not used in any other fight.

Story and characters were also enjoyable, but nothing really extraordinary. The combat was very simple, but was still fun. The artsyle was probably one of my favorite things about this game, it looked fantastic graphically and ran very consistently on my aging PC.

My main gripes deal with the rice farming and the main gameplay loop. The rice farming is...pretty complex and complicated and the game doesn't explain it well at all. Couple this with the fact that the quality of your rice is the only way to ""level up"" (you don't get EXP from defeating enemies), which will slow your progression unless you follow guides online.

The night/day cycle also sucks tremendously since, for most of the game, you'll want to finish exploring before nightfall since enemies get far stronger after dark. This really discourages exploration since you're always on a time crunch.

Enemy variety is also really lackluster, since you'll mostly be fighting the same handful of enemy models for the entire game, just in different locations on the map.

Overall I liked the game, but my aforementioned gripes definitely began to affect my enjoyment after awhile, which led to me rushing just to complete the game and be done with it.

Very reminiscent and likely taking inspiration from one of my favourite games, Muramasa: Demon Blade, so I'm partial to liking this game. The combat is reasonably difficult (and complex, moreso than Muramasa) and has a similar learning curve where you may find the combat very frustrating at the start of the game, but become more confident as you understand the mechanics and learn the various tricks. 

I'm not a big fan of sidescrollers with 3D graphics for no particular reason. I've had some very bad experiences with such games, but Sakuna doesn't have any of those problems, perhaps aside from the [i]slightly[/i] clunky combat. It does not have the snappy, intuitive controls of Muramasa possibly due to it being 3D or simply a lack of polish, but once again, the combat is more complex mechanically. Perhaps I'm wrong and simply suck at the game. With 2D graphics, it's also just easier to see what your character and your enemies are doing. 

[h1]Japanese peasant simulation and its consequences[/h1]
This game has found a good balance of RPG element variety. The 'rice farming' portion of the game is tied to character growth, and can be steered to some degree by the player, although it is easier (and therefore incentivised) to advance all character stats roughly equally. I have not reached the endgame, but I suspect this may change when I am given more options for how exactly I want to grow my rice. 

As the other reviews say, you learn about rice farming. It's neat. It's well done and I personally don't find it annoying. [b]Growing rice may possibly be the most difficult activity this entire game[/b] due to the sheer amount of variables you need to keep track of to optimise growth, yield, and the various stat benefits of the rice.

The home base where you play in third person looks and feels great, with a subtle charm and attention to detail. The music and the graphics in the sidescrolling sections carry their weight, but otherwise do not impress me much.",1633282665,1633282665,True,1,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,False

Advice: Farm in quick successions early in the game. A special event will cripple your ability to farm about mid to end game. This can be a skill-lock where battles are almost unwinnable because you don't have enough power. So farming to get more powerful can quickly become a grind.",1630940056,1630940545,True,2,0,0.525350570678710938,0,True,False,False

I beat the game in roughly 40 hours, not rushing and not going for all sidequests but I got most of them.

The 2D-fighting feels good and can be a total mayhem at times where you feel like you're a beast just throwing everyone around. :)
Nice mix of skills and equipment.
A few more kinds of mobs specific for certain areas would be a welcome addition. 

The rice farming was fun and interesting - I actually would have liked the game to be more focused on the farm life and with longer seasons.

The story was OK but I found it and the dialogues to be a bit tiresome. Slow, kind of.

Graphics are cute and the game has a nice flow in general regarding progression and also in performance. Zero issues. Very polished.
Music was chill and fitting but nothing spectacular.

I would have loved some more endgame content though. I feel I could play more because it's a fun game but I don't want to start a new game and the endgame content is kind of... meh.",1630597745,1630597900,True,5,0,0.576944231986999512,0,True,False,False

Pros:
+ Story is simple, yet very good, base on history of Japan. My best guess would be the Sengoku Jidai era
+ Art is beautiful and cute at the same time. Chibi art works well with the game theme.
+ Character has interesting background
+ Farming/Growing rice mechanic is very deep for a simulation game.
+ Side scrolling combat should belongs to 2000s but, unsurprisingly combines with the cute theme of the game, it is perfect. The game is not combat focused, but it is well done that it is not too hard or too easy.
Cons:
+ the mini game. played it once, it is so so. Played it for 2 hours to get all achievement, it is torturing. The mini game maybe the hardest thing thus far.
+ Some further combat attributes is not explained in the game

Overall, I absolutely love this game simply for everything chibi and cute. The news that this may have a sequel from the developer really brighten my day.

The combat can be pretty satisfying (like, slamming entire mobs to the floor levels of satisfying) and there are quite a few options for special MP attacks, which you can switch around whatever you need for a specific battle or achievement. My only problem with combat is that Sakuna gets stuck in a combo once she starts it, so it's easy to get hit. There are special weapon add-ons that can combat this, but it's a pain at first.
The farming is insanely detailed. It's really difficult to be perfect at first, and planting is still a bit of a nuisance (walking backwards in a straight line is hard) but I felt like I was learning and improving every time I got a harvest. Going from struggling to make enough rice to last the winter to maxing out my rice storage was really fun to witness. The story was really cute, too, and all the characters can help in their own way.

In farming even though there's only rice to be planted, you can mix it up with how you want the result to be based on how you treat and grow the paddy plant, there's plenty of variables to play with. And the result of your harvest will directly affect your character stats in combat.

In combat there's plenty of ways to defeat the different types of enemies and plenty of weapons to craft and use. The dungeon environments can be varied and offers a lot of variety in combat strategies for you to use.

You wouldn't think that these two go together……. And they really don’t. While I am all for trying new things, in my opinion this experiment didn't go very well. However, the combat is pretty damn good, so I'd still recommend the game.

Let's start with the main positive of the game: the combat. Looking at videos, it seemed like the combat was like Devil May Cry. It's not nearly that deep. You have a light attack and a heavy attack. While you can string light and heavy attacks together, fundamentally there's just 3 combos. A ground combo that ends on the ground, a ground combo that goes up into the air, and an aerial combo. That doesn’t sound like a lot does it? So why did I say that the combat is good? Well, the game has some very simple mechanics that make the combat a lot of fun:
	• Raiment: You have a ""Raiment"", that basically acts like a dodge and skill cancel. By pressing the RB button, you will latch unto an enemy and go behind them. By using the raiment button, you can both dodge enemy attacks and continue your combos, as well as pulling yourself closer to the enemies or pulling them towards you. This is a very simple thing, but it looks flashy and downright feels good to zip over all across the screen.
	• Fighting skills: In this game, you can use fighting skills to pull off really cool looking moves with just the press of a button. I particularly like the ""Swallow Slice"" ability which allows you to zip through enemies while dealing damage  up to three times in succession. You can use these skills at any time in a combo, so you can make your own flashy combos to some degree. Fighting skills cost SP, but SP regenerates quickly so you can go ahead and use fighting skills pretty much whenever you want.
	• Raiment skills: In addition to fighting skills, you have ""raiment skills"" which you can use by holding the RB button when latched onto an enemy instead of just pressing it. This will allow you to use various raiment skills, the most flashy of which involve tossing your enemies around like a ragdoll. I particularly like the ""Tiling Windmill"" that takes an enemy, does a full circle with them before crashing them into the ground. Feels good :)
	• ""Crashing"": In this game, enemies can ""crash"" into each other. More specifically, if you do enough damage to an enemy, they will be vulnerable and you can fling them in the direction of your attack. As they're sent flying and hit another enemy, it's likely that THOSE enemies will also be sent flying and on and on. So it's like playing with dominoes. It feels really good defeating a bunch of enemies by having them crash into each other. It's like instead of having an AOE ability to deal with enemies like in most games, this game has the crashing mechanic to deal with multiple enemies instead and it's so much more fun.

Because of all the above mechanics, the combat is simple yet fun. There's also an element of exploration to the game. You can use the raiment not only to fight enemies, but also to cling to surfaces and pull yourself to them. By making sure to explore levels thoroughly, you'll find chests with various useful items. There's a day and night cycle to the game where enemies become significantly more difficult at night, so you have to explore levels ""quickly"". While I didn't particularly appreciate being rushed in my exploration (I typically like to take the exploration slowly), I still enjoyed the fact that there was an element of exploration at all to the gameplay.

While I enjoyed the combat and exploration in the game, I didn't particularly enjoy the farming. I found that the farming gets old/repetitive fast. In most farming games, you're usually doing a bunch of different farming activities. In this game, you're planting rice and only rice. That's it. While the game tries to introduce different mechanics to the rice farming over time, most activities are simply a matter of mashing a button/series of buttons over and over again (Tilling, Sorting, Drying, Threshing, and Hulling). The few activities that aren't about mashing buttons (planting, managing water levels, and fertilizing) aren't all that difficult and you'll quickly master them after 3-5 times.

Even if you don't enjoy the farming, you can't just ignore it. In this game, you don't increase your stats by defeating enemies. You increase your stats by farming rice. The better the quality of the rice, the higher your stats will be. So farming rice is essentially the major progression system in this game. The game is divided into years and each year is split into Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. You do various rice farming things throughout the seasons, and you can only harvest your rice (what triggers the stat increases) once a year. Fundamentally, the game wants you to harvest rice at least once before every major boss battle. If you don't, you won't be able to progress. Like the enemies will one shot you and you will do 1 damage to them. This is honestly fine. If the developers didn't force farming in this way, I would imagine that some players would ignore this aspect altogether. If you enjoy the rice farming, you're also free to do it however much you want before fighting anything to progress the story.

What I don't like is how the developers made the progression system a complete mystery. Remember how I was talking so highly of the fighting and raiment skills in this game? Well, you can only unlock them by farming rice, since it's tied to your stats. Furthermore, you have no idea what you'll unlock and when you'll unlock them (unless you go on a Wiki)…….. This is bad game design in my opinion. By not letting players know what they have to look forward to in the future, you completely eliminate the excitement of slowly working your way towards obtaining these skills. I am not exactly a farming simulation fan, but I have tried them. Even I know that in those types of games, while there are CERTAIN things that are introduced randomly with the player having no idea what or when they'll appear, but a big part of farming simulation games is looking forward to the next big thing you can do (e.g. buying livestock, or getting a bigger field, or planting a more lucrative crop, etc..).

Another big part of the progression system that's a complete mystery to players is spirit boughs. These are items that you can attach onto your equipment that provide various passive benefits. While some spirit boughs can be found by exploring, a large portion of them (especially some really good ones) can only be obtained through farming. They'll appear randomly in your rice field every so often. Again, this is bad game design in my opinion because it completely eliminates the anticipation of getting these items. While I am fine with the rice farming being tied to stats, I really think the fighting + raiment skills should've been part of some skill tree (and you should get skill points by defeating enemies) and the Spirit Boughs should've all been found by exploring.

In conclusion, Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin is a jack of all trades type of game with one of the trades (the combat) being really good. It's just a shame that farming, another major part of the game, gets in the way of what really shines.",1627873184,1627873206,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First off, this is not a farming simulator like you're thinking. You don't grow lots of crops for fun and profit. You simulate every single step, from field prep to hulling, of farming rice. By hand. With button clicks to move your arm each time. Never has a farming game felt like as much as a chore as here. Wanna till a field with hundreds of mousclicks? Ever wanted to grains off every stalk of rice you harvested with a 3-key combo each time? Me neither.

And frankly it wouldn't be so bad if the controls weren't bad. Many farming tasks have you walking backward, not forward, so you can't see where the cursor is aiming, and walking backward like that takes some getting used to. 

The combat is just okay. Not great. The controls are, again, kinda wonky. There's no real dodge or block, as far as I can tell; just your little sash swing that puts you out of your own melee range. And using the sash to get around is also a pain, because the game only lets you aim up, up+angle, or forward. The sash aim doesn't follow the mouse, for example, or have any kind of smart aiming. It feels pretty clunky. So far, in terms of actually fighting, there's really nothing to do here except get a little closer and mash buttons.

So this game is trying to be a Rune Factory type situation. You got your rice farm that you need to take care of, but you also need materials from hunting demons. A lot of your time is spent fighting these demons, and the fighting mechanics are just awful. Long drawn out pauses between combos, slow responsiveness in controls, absurd amounts of time enemies are untouchable as they get back up... This is just the fighting! 

The controls, my lord the controls. If the people designing this meant it for a controller, shame on them. One of the most important tools in the game, your raiment (aka scarf) is the most useless thing in the game. You get all these nice abilities to use with it, but good luck using any of them! Most of the time they just don't work, other times you press back instead of down because you're a fool using a joystick when you should be using the D pad like it's the 90's. Even worse, this scarf can ONLY shoot out up, forward, down, or exact diagonals. Like... what? Grabbing onto ledges? Fuhgetaboutit! You gotta finish the level in 120 seconds but ehhh Sakuna just keeps missing the ledge cuz she can only aim at exact angles... T

Now, if you can get past the god awful monstrous control options and fighting, there's the farming. It's boring, tedious, and also the camera angles are lollll. It's almost comical how bad the camera is and how it screws everything up. All you want to do is walk (with terrible controls) in a straight line and the camera makes it so you absolutely cannot. Your field ends up looking like you were smashed while planting, and if it's bad enough you get a bad score and not so great harvest.

I dunno, I get why people liked the game... it's something newish and freshish? But honestly, it's really poorly done. The art's dope, the mythology is dope, but the rest? garbage.",1627150611,1627150611,False,3,0,0.411300539970397949,0,True,False,False

A great journey with our little goddess developing her character and being the respectable and praise-worthy person that we all wanted her to be. The little moments where characters interact and their little events had me very entertained throughout my playthrough. It is by definition a very heart warming story full of caring characters through beginning to the end. 

I've seen many people complain about the aspect of how tedious the rice farming is, however, I would disagree. Personally for me, it was an eye opening experience of using traditional methods to cultivate rice. The level of detail that the developers went into designing the step by step process of growing rice has left me more so intrigued by the whole ordeal than to be annoyed by it. Especially when the overall quality of the harvest affects the growth of your character. The better the quality of rice, the stronger Sakuna becomes. And it's something that made me want to perfect and achieve with each harvest. Additionally, as you play the game more, there are events and skill acquisitions that will help speed up the process of your rice cultivation which really answers the tediousness problem that people may criticize about. 

As for the combat, it's a 2D side scrolling beat em up adventure. The movements and attacks are very smooth to the point where I never once really had any issues combo-ing my skills and cleaning up an area full of monsters. Though I will say, trap placements and certain damage prone obstacles has made clearing certain levels incredibly difficult because it feels as if the developers knew what kind of skill-sets you maybe running in those areas, thereby consistently hitting those obstacles (which then takes a huge chunk of HP from you). It's even worse if you are under-leveled. 

I think my only complaint is that since I really went deep into researching on how to cultivate rice perfectly along with providing Sakuna the best stats, I never really had any real issues fighting enemies/bosses within the latter half of the game. I think I spent an extra 2 - 3 years (in-game) just farming rice, gaining stats, gathering materials while holding off the main quest and just doing side quests. Though to be honest this wasn't intentional but I was just enjoying myself. Then I noticed I was breezing through most things that would have been very frustrating to beat, and not even a little easier, like by ALOT easier. 
I guess if you want to breeze through the game just hold off on the quests and farm rice for a few years for those good stats. (^^;) since there's no penalty for taking it slow.

Rice farming:
This is the most important part of the game as it is the method in this game for leveling up your character. The game starts off simple with only tasking you to plant the rice, take out the weeds and manage water level. Over time more mechanics are introduced like sorting the seeds and mixing fertilizer. Farming itself can also level up by unlocking new skills like planting multiple rice seeds at the same time to threshing the rice faster or with better tools. You'll also unlock more visual guides to help with the rice planting spacing or to see which part of the field you haven't filled yet.

Combat:
You start off with limited but serviceable move set. As you perform more rice farming actions and grow your rice, you'll start to unlock new skills to use in combat to improve your combos. At the end of the game I was juggling enemies in the air with the combination of combat skills I had unlocked.

Platforming:
This is the games weakest point. Platforming is just bad. For example, in certain levels there are these mushrooms you can stand on. I found out that when you press jump while standing on them, the jump action is delayed. I often ended up walking off the mushrooms when I was trying to jump forwards from top of them. There are also levels that have platforming challenges that don't even seem to fit this games mechanics and I even found a level where you can get stuck in an infinite loop of taking damage from an environmental hazard, be thrown in to the air by that hazard and then fall back in to that same hazard over and over until you die or quit the level.",1626619106,1626619106,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a game about repetition without much payoff.

Combat really lags, in my opinion, and downed enemies are immune to damage for way too long, only serving to drag out the way-too-long process. Later levels go overboard. If I can clear 2 waves, why do I have to clear 4, 5? And if you die, do all 12 waves over again. I also always seem to get turned around with specials, too.

Enemies are morons. They gladly hop into traps and hazards. Maybe it's the pure hatred of demons for the goddess of cliches.

The rice farming is mostly boring. The only reason I did it is for the stat bonuses for combat, so I could get through that faster.

So I'm going to pitch it anyways, it's a rice farming RPG, translated by the same people who translate Story Of Seasons(Harvest Moon, if you don't know about the name change) nowadays, most of the story cutscenes are voice acted

It's also a platformer with a weirdly complex combo system that involves a lot of juggling and grappling enemies

Both of those things are weirdly, deeply interlinked, you can only get resources for rice farming by doing the platformer bits but also you only gain levels and skills for combat by tending to your rice fields

It sounds overwhelming but the game does a surprisingly good job of keeping things simple for the first few harvests while you're trying to learn how everything works, it's also 30% off right now

There's one big thing that the game fails at though, it seems like the developers were thinking about making a game for a controller the whole time, you are unable to change the keybinds on mouse and keyboard, most of the default controls are alright however you end up having some awkward mouse movements in some of the farming mechanics and other keys with multiple contextual functions that you sometimes hit in the wrong order or by accident that you really wish you could move elsewhere

The game loop of exploring, gathering, farming, cooking comes with a staggering amount of options, and for the rice farming, never strays too far from your interest with the welcome brevity of the three day seasons. 

I greatly appreciate games where all the pieces come together, so to speak. Be it the escalation of exploring the ocean with each new technology in Subnautica, or the wonder of seeing how so much of the map locales inadvertently connect to each other in a certain, famous action RPG.

The long of it is this game goes to great lengths to have you grow rice, in fact it's really the main mechanic and in fact as time goes on you learn more on how to grow your crops, what materials to use to make a good fertiliser and various other mechanics I won't spoil about the farming as each one expands and improves over time dood.

Combat is fun enough with an element of night and day for difficulty and a variety of skills as you level up, in the future I do feel the devs should consider a dedicated dodge button, which they could have easily done with either of the unused back triggers as dodging by moving the the same direction twice never really felt intuitive enough to be used in combat properly, as well as taking the dash attack (holding right then pressing attack) out as it never truly had a use and just made normal combos more annoying than fun to use which is a shame because the combat once you get into it is fluid and interesting at times but less so when you accidentally do a single hit dash you didn't mean to do and are left rather vulnerable to counter over it dood. 

The music really feels nicely themed, lot's of nice twang noises and instruments you'd hear for that era incorporated into everything, the visual designs were great too, levels looked pretty albeit at times samey, the characters, monsters and bosses all looked interesting, some even had some cool mechanics of their own even such as counters or buffing the other monsters ect dood. 

To end all in all it's a game that I think everyone should play, it can be hard at times until you get certain things but really it's a game to be taken casually for the most part, there's a lot to do, a lot to get, a myriad of mechanics, weapons, clothes (armour/equipment really) and things to fight even after you beat the game but the one thing I will say the game truly suffers for is no new game plus, this game is a one and done style game, maybe some people can go back and play again and it deserves that, it's a great game! but I feel a lot of people will be like me, as fun as the crop growing is no one want's to start over from the very beginning of that kind of chore, it truly grasped my interest and was fun to do! but once is enough to forever satiate my desire to do it again in Sakuna which means I must commit the story to memory dood.

Farming games have bored me to tears forever, and I could never put my finger on exactly why, until I played Sakuna. They never feel like I'm actually making anything for anyone, merely automating infinitely expanding factories that operate a hidden spreadsheet which assures me I'm efficiently pumping out a million different kinds of produce you never have the opportunity to see. A distant bird's eye view on an industrial empire devoid of anything besides numbers and percentages. At least it fills up a hunger bar, right?

Sakuna, on the other hand, has a laser-focused level of attention purely on rice farming, right down to the player needing to manually carry out quite literally every single step of the process by hand. Tracing the production cycle from sorting the seeds - tilling the land - planting the seedlings evenly - fertilising and maintaining a desired water level balance - reaping then drying the stalks on a rack - threshing and hulling for the type of rice desired - then preparing a meal to watch your beloved newfound family enjoy. It's tedious and arduous toil but completely thankful and full to the brim with charm, and I fucking love it more than anything. Quite literally made me more appreciative of a foodstuff I take for granted. Filled with sweet, reverent moments I found genuinely moving and will stick with me for a long time. Watching this humble rice paddy thrive was more uplifting than I have the words for.

You can miss me with the combat, which is my main sticking point because you spend so much time doing it. Labourious and dull even after the movelist opens up towards the end of the game. I'm thoroughly unconvinced the drudgery exists to further the game's themes of toil and spoil because it's just... so standard of a mid-tier Japanese game production.
Probably my biggest case of ""a sequel could make this perfect"", and the game's apparent success at least in Japan has me genuinely hopeful. A few minor deviations and we have a Strand game on our hands. Hear me out.,",1618911601,1618911601,True,0,0,0.46875,0,True,False,False

I love the character designs, they aren't anything crazy but just right and simple. Plus i think a lot of the characters look adorable. They're all really enjoyable characters, nothing crazy and i really have no complaints. The nice simple art style just adds on top of that. As for the story, it isn't anything insane or mind blowing but it is definitely enjoyable. Although i expected it to be a little longer, im happy with what i got and i honestly found it very enjoyable and was interested what happened next every time i was done with a quest. The world building surprised me with it's quite in-depth lore from the characters. I didn't expect to be this interested about the other parts of the world in this game. Wish we could've had more lands and places to explore. Having completed the main story, there is still much more content in the game which is always great. I was surprised by this game and i

I've been looking for a game to scratch my Rune Factory and Harvest Moon itch but not entirely as those two games take up a ton of time, and this comes along. Finally found something to fill that and this is that game.

As the description says, it's a farming plus combat platforming game. The combat aspect is pretty fun, emphasizing on using crashing skills that launch your enemies to hit other enemies, dealing more damage compared to if you just mash the attack buttons. This is also achieved by the Raiment system; generally, it is used to go about like a grappling hook for navigation or avoiding attacks, but is also used to get around enemies, sling them around, or even debuff them. It's a pretty fun system especially when you learn to juggle around enemies several times and keep combos going, using both your fighting and raiment abilities. It can seem a little bit overpowered at times, because when using the raiment to go around enemies, you're invulnerable, allowing for quick dodges. You also have a parry system similar to Street Fighter 3: press forward to an incoming attack just as it hits and you completely negate it, and can even stop smaller enemies giving you a window of attack. The general enemies though, are pretty relentless especially mid to late game to counter these advantages, doing stuff like attacks with high rate of fire, like deers or just by sheer numbers or attacks coming from multiple angles; a wrong sling-around to dodge and you'll put yourself in another monster's attack. Boss battles are definitely more fun, but a lot of them tend to be bigger versions of mobs with maybe extra signature attacks, and those that do use moves that are similar to regular mobs can be very predictable to parry. Still, bosses that are unique offer quite a nice match (unless you're overpowered of course).

Customization-wise and equipment, it's simple but effective enough. all the equipped items have different looks and no two equipment look exactly alike, although the actual body clothes tend to just be recolors, featuring different straps or sash here and there, but generally look the same. Equipment can be swapped at any time too, even during combat, mid-hit. Areas are plenty, and features different hazards and ways of going about, with boxes that contain stuff that act like chests, and renewable materials for gathering, such as wood and ores. You also have a hundred-floor challenge ""tower"" here.

The farming aspect is extremely detailed. Sure, you only plant one thing here: rice, but it runs you through the entire process. This includes sorting seeds with the use of mud, and later, salt, to determine starting quality; choosing if said seedlings are sorted thin or thick, which affects yield; plowing the field; planting the seedlings, and it's not planted like in Harvest Moon or Rune Factory with a predetermined square size, it's individual seedling, the arrangement of which affects their growth; irrigating the field and minding water levels; making sure weeds are removed; checking its status to see how its developing and if it has diseases; draining the field when the rice gets to a certain development point; and watering again when it's about to get ripe; reaping the rice; drying; threshing; and finally polishing the rice. All of these affect the rice, and, depending on your focus, can be done differently to reach your desired results. Weather and temperature are factors also, which you can later manipulate. This part is pretty important, because unlike other farming sims like Rune Factory, where the farming aspect is a means to earn money or obtain ingredients, your resulting rice here affects Sakuna's stats herself. It never goes down, at least from what I experienced, but the better your rice is, the higher Sakuna's permanent stat increases are. You also earn fighting and raiment skills from this, as well as Spirit Boughs, the game's slotted items on equipment for various effects. Trade will still be there, but not at the start. Fertilization is also your main means of increasing your rice's quality as it grows, adding various items as its being prepared to increase different stats, or give it a pesticide effect, heal diseases, reduce weed growth, and the like.

As usual, the farming starts really slow, but Sakuna does get better and better the more its done, like being able to plow faster, seeing actual water level percentage, being able to see weeds, be able to place more seedlings during planting at once, and a lot of other farming skills. Other tools will also be provided eventually to speed up doing the steps, or even automation later on, such as having access to ducks to weed for you. Also, there is automation even at the start, like leaving the work to others, but these starting automation methods end in bad results compared to doing it yourself, although it is there if you really don't wanna do some of the steps. If you totally neglect managing the farm, it will also be managed for you automatically, but as mentioned, this will yield bad results. It sounds like its hard work, but you'll probably be spending 20-30% of your time farming and the rest in combat. The actual heavy work if you're doing all of it without automation is only at the start, like plowing and planting, and at the end where you harvest, thresh, and polish the rice, and will only get faster as Sakuna gets better, or get access to better, faster methods.

There are other things that you can do but the two above take the bulk. As for the story, all the characters are loveable, and all important ones do get character development, the most of course is for the titular character, just simply loveable. Side quests are present but overall really few, and tend to give access to actual useful stuff. The plot itself though, is not something grand and is pretty simple, but it is still nice and comedy brought about by mood whiplash is plenty, Personally though, it's still better than most Harvest Moon games minus Hero of Leaf Valley main plot-wise. Talks during dinnertime are pretty entertaining too. My main qualm about its plot though is its length; if I didn't try to explore what I can do as much as I can and finish a lot of the exploration objectives, I would have finished the main story much, much earlier, and there are still quite a number of questions answered.

My issues about it are more on its technical side; the biggest of which is it's pretty hard to play effectively without a proper controller. Keyboard controls are non-configurable at the time of this review, and several of the commands are assigned in weird buttons that are a bit hard to reach from your WASD. It is playable, but is definitely much better and intuitive on a controller. Also, given that you're also allowed to change equipment mid-combat, maybe a sorting system or a set system would have been nice for maximizing its potential, especially since it's kinda encouraged for you to do so, such as when changing equipment from ones that give combat advantages, to those that allow you to gather more items when coming across gathering points.

All in all, I had a lot of fun. It probably won't be for people who doesn't like farming sims, but it definitely is a pretty good platformer game, and you can say it's just this if you totally ignore the farming. Biased call though? I really loved it; the graphical style, the detail on areas changing per season, your farm, small but beautiful especially when they have rice, the music, several of which stuck on my head, and the characters, nicely designed and developed especially Sakuna herself. I'm hoping there are more answers if there'll be a sequel, or more development. Sure, I've said the plot is simple, but it doesn't have to be grand to be fun. Heck, I'd love a sequel. Again, Sakuna is just plain lovable; I hope there'll be more runs with her.",1617396283,1617398003,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin (Sakuna just in short), what a rollercoaster of what to do...

Sakuna is game with quite a good decent start, with its music, combat, farming, and exploration.
The music to start with is usually quite nice and calming, combat is decent at the beginning and become a bit complex (I'll go more in depth with this later), farming which is essentially the most important for raising your stats, so this is where you have to take care of your rice farming, and then exploration, which is quite nice, although once you've discovered everything (or gotten exploration level to 160), you've pretty much found nearly everything noteworthy...

Storywise I'd say Sakuna has a good story, alongside a good cast of characters, with substories tied to them, and growing their characters (although the quests are rather short). In addition, they're quite distinguishable in how they look, act, and what they do. And each serve a greater or less valuable function to you, as a player.

Now to combat... Sakuna does some great things, as in putting in some nice skills which you can level up to 15 times, but unsatisfyingly the animations for the end combos are just way too long and can root you in place, which can and most likely will result in you dying or losing a good chunk of health... going mid- to late game of Sakuna, it just falls further and further apart, such as adding in aphid invasion which just makes it worse for you with the normal slow attack animations, the abundance of enemies which keep spawning.
In addition, once you get to a castle during the late game, expect to see a lot of cheap deaths due to hazardly placed spike traps which are hard to see once you get in, or gas chambers where you suddenly can't get out as you need to kill the enemies before you can go out of said gas... and to top it off with... the last boss is irredeemable.

This part is just about the last boss, so you start with a cutscene with the last boss, as soon as the cutscene is done, you do a special raiment shield bubble which is only designed for this boss... and tied to the worst botton of the game, the raiment itself, as the raiment is unreliable to use as a shield, as it can root you in place because you lack SP, because the enemy is not weakened enough, or just because it has terrible targeting, as aiming is tied with your movement...
So to use the bubble, you need to press the raiment button (default on a controller RB and B on an Xbox controller), and in an instant with about less than 0.250 seconds, the idiotic nature of this, is because the raiment shield button could be tied to either trigger button, as they are UNUSED throughout the whole game (unless you reconfigure the layout), in addition the big attacks the boss do are usually just 1 hit knock out, and requires SP to use the shield...

In addition, the story will only make a whole lot more sense if you do a side quest involving a character (which will be obvious as to why it makes sense once you complete said quest).

To conclude with... Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin is great, but marred with just a terrible late game content to keep up the difficulty... all in all, I wish they'd just keep it normal instead of trying to 1 up themselves in terms of difficulty... as it just felt cheap and artificially and just illogical... but the rest of the game is great.",1616770482,1616770482,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is well thought through with some serious moments that keep you on the edge of your seat and some funny moments that make you chuckle, the game balances between those two quite well.
The gameplay is what you'd expect with some moves and mechanics taking a little while to get used to, the combat is pretty much standard with a nice range of spells for anyone to choose according to their own style of gameplay. 
The equipment system has quite the range as well, but in terms of the weapons, I'd say that it's pretty clear which are better than the rest, although there is a lot of room to change stuff with gem sockets.
The buff system is nice, putting together a decent dinner to help you explore can get quite deep.
And the feature that I didn't expect to blow me away as it did is the Rice Farming. I could spend hours on hours only tending to my little field of rice, I love everything about it, you have to get the right fertilizer in at the right time, exact ammounts of water, sunlight and other nutrients. It really something trying to figure all the things out without any help and it's so revarding seeing your lovely little field bloom with rice and having a bountiful harvest.
And a little thank you to the Japanese voice cast, cause they did an amazing job.

But I fell in love with this game too hard to not to do it.
Everything in this game overflows with passion and you can feel it easily while playing.
Now on the more technical aspect :

-Story : you're playing as a spoiled goddess who gets banished to an island full of demons for a mistake you did, and a handful of humans joins you. Your goal is to bring peace to the island and prove your worth to be brought back to the divine realm.
While simple, you quickly learn to appreciate all the characters, their stories and background and you end up rooting for Sakuna in her quest for redemption. 
The story did what it needed to, give you a playground to enjoy action and rice farming.

-Gameplay : Sakuna works with a really interesting gameplay loop, which other games tried but failed. Many games tried to mix action and management only to have one side overpower the other. 
In Sakuna, both are linked in an effective way. You explore and fight to progress the story and get ingredients for your field and you plant rice to get stronger for your exploration. This is pretty much rooted in the lore of Sakuna, since she's the daughter of a god of war and a goddess of harvest, her strength comes from the rice you'll end up raising.
In Sakuna, you don't level up in a conventional way. You gain a few levels after harvesting your rice each year and the stats you will gain depends on the fertilizer you've been using. You can choose to focus more on hp/strength/defense/etc which allows you have a unique experience depending on what you'll invest in your field. You can get some ingredients by exploring which cements the loop of gameplay you'll be doing.
Now, while the exploration part is pretty simple but effective, the rice farming is really well made and done smartly. You're not spoon fed informations on how to make the perfect harvest or unlock the perfect tools that trivialize anything in the endgame. However, it's all based around hints, experimentation and trial and error. There's no real punishment for a less optimal harvest outside of getting a few less stats and you can't lose or fail completely your harvest, so you'll still be rewarded. Also, this game doesn't give you a hard cap on how many years/time you can play, which is a mistake in my opinion that a lot of management game does.
All in all, it's a really solid gameplay loop that becomes quite addicting in the long run.

-Game length : This game will keep you occupied a long time, thanks to some interesting endgame. Even the main story should give you around 30h of game easily if you're not speedrunning it.
For the endgame, there's still a lot to do after the main story, be it combat wise or farming wise. 
I think that Sakuna's achievements are pretty respectful to the player, since they can be done while focusing on the game, outside of a few ones, but it could've been far worse and insultingly grindier. 

-Visual/Soundtrack : The game looks really pretty with some amazing landscapes, especially from your house. The sprites for the characters and enemies are well made too. 
Now, what was the most amazing part of this game and made it a great experience was the sound design. While the music was good and effective (special mention to the amazing end credits song), all the little details and ambient noises really give a peaceful vibe to the game. I could've went to sleep while listening to the night ambient sounds and every seasons in the game feels unique thanks to the work put into the ambiance. 

Overall : I would highly recommend this game if you enjoy the Japanese aesthetic and want to play a good management game with some solid hack and slash combat. It's worth the price and I hope the developers have future projects in stock.

The voice acting (I played Japanese voices only but know the English side is also very well voice acted) is top notch and lovable, giving each character their own charm. A enjoyable gameplay loop and plentiful story content.



For the gameplay, it's simple yet tuned to be extremely fun and enjoyable. During the right seasons you can tend the rice field or go out and get food and materials/hidden treasures for many other uses. There are two types of game modes, tending your fiend is in 3rd person and you are allowed to move freely in any direction, then when you go explore and hunt you are playing a 2D fighter. I always come back to play at least one year of a rotation even after beating the game. To add on to this, it's just not simply a easy task to tend to the rice field or aimlessly tap the attack button, there's some thought needing to be put into it to maximize outputs, seriously it's so good.

The graphics side of the game is very beautiful, every camera angle you can take a screenshot and it'll look beautiful, every in-game interaction the camera nicely captures it all. During your adventures you come across many types of terrain, with details that are top notch. I find each enemy to be very detailed as well. It's not only the graphics that are well detailed, but the characteristics, character growth/development, and gameplay mechanics (from abilities to your harvest stats)

The music is so fascinating, I love [spoiler]how at the end Sakuna journeyed back to her home and it played a beautiful version of a song they all sang together to grow close to each other.[/spoiler]

[h1][b]This is one of the best thing that could happen, a great game at a great price, only one purchase and no pay walls or additional fees, I brought the Digital Deluxe Edition because I knew deep down this game was golden when I first saw the  old trailer as a teen, lost sight of it, and eventually a few months before launch found it again. 10/10[/b][/h1]

Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin is an interesting mix of comfy rice farming simulator, plattforming & combat.
The farming aspect is detailed and ever expanding in complexity if you want it to be. It interlocks perfectly with the plattforming & combat which is what you'll do for most of the game.
The quality of your rice flows directly back into your character by making you stronger in form of stat gains and new combat moves. Which in turn will make it easier to progress through the levels, filled with materials to bring back home to improve your gear, to cook food (giving you temporary buffs) or mix into your fertilizer to strenghten your rice further. There's also the odd side quest here and there asking for materials to upgrade & expand your little home with new tools.
The combat has some nice depth and complexity to it, but can also be played fairly simple if you want to.
Besides light & heavy attacks, a parry you get an ever expanding pool of special moves, giving you more ways to extend combos, deal with groups of enemies or simply knock them around and into each other. 
You also have a variety of raiment skills, which is a piece of cloth that functions as a grapple. It allows you to grab onto the enviroment for easier traversal or pull yourself towards enemies. But mainly it is used to grab & smack around enemies, causing devastating chaos on screen and a ton of damage. It is very easy to pull off and feels very satsifying to do. There is enough depth to pull of some impressive looking combos and grappling from enemy to enemy, finishing them off and throwing their corpse into other foes never gets old.
Enemies are also stronger during the night time but also drop items they wouldn't during the day time adding another layer of challenge for those who seek it.
On the audio/visual side the game comes with a very time period inspired soundtrack, perfectly accentuating the current season or area. The enviroments & character models are nicely stylized and areas are changing depending on the weather, time of day & season, making revisits anything but boring. 
The story is simple and told well, with some interesting twists & turns along the way. Synergy between the characters are excellent, just like the dub. Game had me smiling and laughing from beginning to end.

I honestly just can't praise this game enough. It has some small flaws, but those are some nitpicks at best or issues that a little polish can fix, nothing that creates any form of frustration or disappointment.
 It does the things it wanted to do well, it doesn't overstay its welcome nor is it too short. The presentation is great and it kept me interested even beyond the end. The combat is fun and I keep discovering new things.
The love and care put into this game is strong enough to push through the monitor and envelop me in a feeling of happiness & discovery I haven't had in a long time.",1611204413,1611204962,True,20,1,0.744546771049499512,0,True,False,False

The better your crops are the higher Sakuna's stats increase. The combat can get pretty hectic and challenging especially at night when monsters are much higher leveled than they are during the day. 

One of my favorite elements of Sakuna's arsenal is her Celestial Scarf that allows her latch herself onto walls, can be used as a dodge by allowing her to throw herself over her enemies, yank enemies towards or away from her, debuffing enemies and my favorite is a grab that spins an enemy around in a circle and then slamming them into the ground.  She can craft an assortment of different weapons and garments that give special abilities. She can also equip many different combat skills. As for farming you have a ton of mechanics in place that you can do yourself or you can force others to do it. I would recommend doing it yourself as your harvest will come out better and you get abilities that help you speed up all the processes. I would recommend spending time utilizing the fertilizer as it can give you huge benefits.

The story itself tells the story of a spoiled harvest goddess named Sakuna who is banished from the Lofty Realm after accidentally causing the tributes to be destroyed and allowing humans in. After that she and the humans are forced to live on an island that is infested with demons. Her objective from then on is to finish her quest of investigating the island and to harvest. The story is very wholesome and the cool part is that you get to hear more lore and world building during dinner as well as find out more about the cast. 

For performance, this game runs at a consistent 60 fps and I have yet to have any technical issue. I would recommend playing with a controller as it feels better. The sound is great as well as it is very atmospheric and the soundtrack is Japanese folk. The voice acting on both Japanese and English is pretty good as well. I like Sakuna's voice in both dub's.

All in all I would recommend this game as it is really fun, charming and is one of the best hidden gems of 2020.",1610900658,1610900658,True,4,0,0.563276410102844238,0,True,False,False

This is one of the better games I have played this year. Only succeeded by Mobius Games' The Outer Wilds. 

Things I enjoyed: 
The story...damn they did a very good job here. I really enjoyed it, the amount of character development is amazing, and you feel connected to all of the main characters because of how different and special they are sin their own ways. 

Voice acting: very important for me. It's good here, I was skeptical at first.. but there really is a vibe they were going for here and they really nailed it. All the VA did a great job. 
The combat, is amazing. It gave me super smash vibes, but significantly more mobility, and abilities. 

The rice farming! i am a person who hates farming sims. They bore me. In this game it serves a core purpose, and it's fun. It's so in depth i feel like i could walk out into my backyard come spring and grow rice. In all seriousness, this mechanic is very detailed, and very fun to play around with. Many people will say they don't like how you learn to farm in this game. I couldn't disagree more. Learning as you go is part of the process. If they gave the master course to you straight out the gate the rice farming wouldn't have been interesting or enjoyable at all. 

ENDGAME: I'm still farming rice and kicking ass. There is a floor system at the last part of the game. Nothing new here, grind to fl 100 get special prize..but here i actually enjoy it. I still farm my own rice trying to get it perfectly the way i want it. And i actually enjoy the combat enough to keep playing after the story is complete. Something I havent had for a while. 
Things I thought could use a little improvement: 

Weapons, while fun leave just a little too much to be desired. I really would have liked a few more relevant options here, and a little more diversity would have been nice as well. However the weakness mechanic was a nice touch. 4 core dmg types include pierce, strike, slash, and magic. With different enemies being weak to one or sometimes two types. 

Clothes: same thing as the weapons really. However i do really like the mask system here i found myself wanting to find every single one of them....which led me to only wearing one of them for nearly the whole play through. 

Lastly: ENDGAME: it's a little too familiar for me. Fun..yes, but i wouldve liked something a little bit different here. The game distinguishes it self so well until you reach the part you'll actually be grinding to reach fl 100.
Also after you beat the game the home area feels a little off.. almost like its less alive. Idk i could just be me.

All of these offer a vital component to a game that gives the player a chance to relax between core gameplay sessions. But they are just that, side dishes to act as an interim between the core gameplay. Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin takes this concept to another level and offers two main courses.

To call either the platforming element or the farming element the core gameplay would be unfair, as they are both intertwined to create a vastly complex genre that neither could accomplish on their own. While the platforming offers fast-paced, hectic combat that will test a player's reflexes, the farming offers a more relaxed takeaway filled with its own intricacies. It is exactly what I enjoy about many games, except both concepts are full-fledged and both are core gameplay. The game feels very responsive (my PS4 controller works flawlessly) and quality of life features, such as being able to assign skills to my preferred input, make it very satisfying to play. Even though I enjoyed the game from the start, it still grew on me as I played and learned the various mechanics behind it.

I am glad that I purchased the digital deluxe edition, as the soundtrack is extraordinary (I am listening to it as I write this) and definitely something I want to have on hand. The game supports my 2560x1440 165Hz display and I am happy it does. The visuals are a treat for the eyes, as a superb art style is further enhanced by high-fidelity lighting and shadows, complete with a full day to night cycle to flex them. And, while the cycle looks amazing, it is not just eye candy, as the time of day heavily impacts various gameplay elements and the way the game is played, as I frequently found myself feeling rushed to finish something before sunset or sunrise. Which brings me to another point, the reality of the rice farming.

Be it the changes in weather, the feeling of there not being enough hours in a day, or the sheer difficulty of many rice farming methods, Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin highlights many realities of rice farming that I was previously unaware of and is topped off with a delightful story that further emphasizes the importance of rice. While it all translates into a very enjoyable gameplay experience, I personally found the education and culture behind it very eye-opening. I will definitely look at rice differently from now on.",1609735341,1609735341,True,1,0,0.522900760173797607,0,True,False,False

Sakuna is a base-building action-platformer with RPG elements tied to farming.

[h3]Cons:[/h3]

- Planting rice feels incredibly jank on KBM, but still kind of jank on controller
- New rice planting skills are enabled as you unlock them, causing you to accidentally plant in a new pattern halfway through your field
- Rainment controls can be difficult a time, either grabbing your intended target, or using the rainment skill you want to use
- Game events that skip time periods without indicating how long it will skip or what will happen, leaving a bad taste in your mouth if you're playing blind. I would highly recommend skimming a guide to make this less painful, as I had to quit the game for a day after one of the game events.
- Final boss does not have a target level, unlike the rest of the content. This can cause a lot of wasted time if you're able to breeze through the final area but not kill the boss.

[h3]Pros:[/h3]

+ Platforming feels good most of the time
+ Combat feels fun
+ Game manages to really well balance how you utilize resources for different purposes
+ Areas don't really become completely obsolete until post game, meaning you'll like revisit a lot of the starting areas throughout the game
+ Food bonuses can actually matter enough where you'll want to manage what you're eating late game
+ Farming isn't cumbersome except planting
+ Total content is more than 1$/hour for full price game
+ Various skills with very different uses
+ Weapons & weapon abilities matter a lot for use case, and have a lot of wild combinations",1609698051,1609698051,True,1,0,0.522471904754638672,0,True,False,False

It does not require as much polish as certain other game but there are so many annoying little things which make the game less and less fun to play. Farming rice is really fun and the character interactions are interesting, which makes it weird just how rough the dungeon crawling feels like. If dungeon crawling wasn't such an important feature or if it was improved, this game would be great. The combat is actually really fun when it works and reminds me of Muramasa The Demon Blade in a good way. The fun just keeps getting interrupted.

The camera in dungeon crawling sections is awful. It is more interested in the environment than the enemies, causing you to get hit by enemies you can't see. When you are enough high in the air, the camera doesn't zoom out to show what is below you. When you use the scarf to move behind an enemy, the camera starts moving only after you have stopped flying, meaning you get hit by invisible enemies again. When the camera does eventually move, it is so slow you get hit by an invisible enemy before the camera has moved. The camera only zooms out far enough to see all the enemies when you're in the center of specific arenas.  

The inputs for dashing are bugged. You need to input left or right twice to dash normally. However, simply doing quick left -> right or vice versa also causes you to dash. Since you can cancel attacks into dashes, this causes annoying situations where you try to attack forward and then parry an attack from behind but get a backdash instead.

Hit-, hurt- and collision boxes have lots of wacky stuff going on. Some enemy attacks can't hit you if you hug the opponent, sometimes your skills hit less than they are supposed to. The scarf has an annoyingly small hitbox which makes it clunky for grabbing opponents or platforms. If larger enemies move legs or jump even a little bit, the scarf will miss. Sometimes the scarf keeps you in front of the enemy you grabbed (outside hitstun) when it should send you behind them. Trying to use the scarf to extend mid-air combos can be difficult due to how small and specific the hitboxes are. Pulling the enemy into the air with scarf can be awkward because your attacks can easily cause opponent to float higher than where you are. Your attacks don't push midair opponent forward either, making combos more inconsistent. 

You can't switch sides while hitting opponents, leading to even more inconsistent combos. Some attacks can be cancelled immediately into scarf grab, others have really long minimum time before you can cancel into scarf. When you combine this with bad camera and long range attacks, it can be annoying to be forced to limit your move set just in case someone snipes you with off-camera arrows. And then you add the inconsistent movement with the scarf.

Enemies can combo you just like you can combo them, to the point I have been stunlocked to death twice. Enemies have been stuck inside objects I can't reach twice, forcing a restart. The game has a dynamic time setting where enemies are generally too strong for you to fight at night if it is a new area. Enemies have so bad AI they often run into spikes and other hazards. Some enemies - including bosses - only attack you if you are in front of them and they turn so slowly you can kill them without problems. 

Some of the dungeons can feel like very long mazes, meaning it is better for you to just avoid fighting when you visit a new area so it isn't night at the end. There are no checkpoints in most dungeons, meaning you have to spend 5-10 minutes walking back to the spot where you died. You can't save at specific spots to save time either, you always start at the beginning of the dungeon. To advance the story, you have to keep completing exploration quests to unlock next dungeon. These range a lot from fun (exit dungeon in 120s) to tedious and boring (defeat enemies with piercing attacks, pray rng to give you item x). 

Outside dungeons, the only actually bad thing I can point out is that the runs at 30-40 FPS if V-sync is disabled - no matter what settings I use. The game can also make you wonder when the story will progress but it isn't that bad.

Edit: Apparently a new update fixed framerate drops with Vsync disabled? Haven't tried the game since the review so I can't confirm it.",1608235773,1609619397,False,8,0,0.496491551399230957,0,True,False,False

The farming stuff is pretty different from usual, it follows a more ""realistic"" view of rice farming in the middle-ages period (feudal japan if you prefer).
Instead of a simplistic ""till, plant, water a few times and harvest"" you have a pretty complex set of systems and no real ""best"" way to do things.

The rice's ""stats"" are directly linked to the stats you get for your character after the harvest but it is also a key component of the diet of your small group so you have to balance things between getting a lot of medium quality rice to get great food buffs to help your exploration and fewer high quality rice that raises your character's stats but might not last the whole year.

Later on you get enough quantity regardless but there is still no ""perfect"" rice since there are vrious stats and they rise differently depending on several factors when taking care of your rice, so you still have to either balance things or go heavily towards a specific stat.

You don't get overwhelmed by all of this right away, the first harvest is very basic and you slowly get more informations and more ways to influence your rice as you go.


The brawler side is solid as said above, you just don't get exp from defeating enemies and stats and skills are related to how well you are doing in the farming but even the basic kit is more than enough to keep the skilled players happy, including a ""parry"" system that in theory allows you to take on much stronger opponents if you are good enough.

+ Light-hearted, funny story with a cast of cute characters.

+ In-depth rice growing sim that rewards you for paying close attention to your farm at all times while still letting you coast by if you take a more casual approach to it.

Because at the end of the day these are the two most outstanding points of this game.

The story and the characterization is good , it reminds me a bit of the Ni no kuni franchise, cookie cutter children's bedtime story,
and sometimes it's ok to enjoy that kind of stuf, personally I love this aspect of the game ,having said that let's start pointing out the bad.

The Controls: 
Camera controls are terrible in 3d view and the farmwork is tedious due to how bad the camera and movement is.
In essence the game handles like a console game with the imprecise camerawork and movement you'd expect from a console game. For some reason the camera also hates to stay centered it swings to one side , making farmwork all the more annoying. All of the problems that ports from Consoles to PC usually experience this game  has them. Now I don't know if this game is a port or it is by design consolized. It suck on PC. ""just get a controler"" doesn't fix these problems at all. It's like asking modern day smith to use stone age tools for his day to day work. Not fun.

Sakuna as a Fighting Game: Fails 4/10
The combat is clunky ,targeting difficult , there is a very distinct input lag, animation lock and poor range/mobility balancing. 
The game plays a bit like monster hunter, where you're waiting 1-2 seconds for animation to stop before you can do anything. I'm constantly having trouble even starting a simple combo with weak attacks , because the character simply won't attack , if I spam or carefully tap makes no difference, the character simply does the dash attack or 1 taps and I'm not even pressing forward in the moment, it just doesn't register properly.
One thing that works properly at least is the parry mechanic.
The game also has shitton of trouble when changing direction movement , you cannot change which way your facing mid air , but more importantly you have to pause before you change direction and attack on the ground, it's super clumsy.
Also there is no good way of positioning yourself in combat , you either overshoot or undershoot. It's not a matter of ""gitting good"" , I've played Tekken on tournament level , a fair bit of Dbzfighters I know my fighting games, this game is simply clumsy.

It reminds of ""Dustforce"", when it could be like ""Celeste"" the superior game.

Sakuna as a Platformer: I'm unimpressed , first the terrain hitbox detection is very poor , the aim of the scarf also poor. 
As of 7 hours into the game I've been wondering about the same looking maps , same-ish obstacles, sameish enemies.
It's really underwhelming.

Going from speedruning celeste to this... it's just painful

Also It's not just me , I've watched few of your let's plays before writing this out, most people seem to struggle with platforming in this game. 


The game does not deserve such high praise, Yeah it's a very cute and very heartwarming story, but a very sub-par game at core.

I really recommend if you like action rpg side scrollers. The rice cultivation mechanics are solid and surprisingly complex, but I loved learning how to optimize my next harvest by reading the farming scrolls you find.

There are some small issues though, like for example, it took me a while to get used to having no ""cancelling"" of animations whatsoever. This means that if you start a combo, you  won't be able to move again until Sakuna finishes her animations to the last frame. This was annoying at first and made the pacing of the action quite different than what I'm used to but in time I ended up accepting it. Exploration and progression are very rewarding and fun and the game also offers a surprisingly big amount of voiced cutscenes and events throughout.

Visuals are bright and colorful; the music is pleasing to listen to.  The real meat n’ potatoes are in cultivating rice and the small interactions between characters.  Cultivating rice isn’t as simple as planting and leaving it alone until it’s ready to harvest; no, you have to understand how soil, weather, disease, etc. can affect the quality of your crop, ultimately affecting the stats you get from them.  What I really loved the most is the interactions and round dinner conversations between all the characters creating this meaningful relationship between everyone.  

The game ain’t perfect though.  Sure, the combat is flashy and fun to pull off combos, but man, does it also feel incredibly clunky and unintuitive.  There are quite a few mechanics in how to properly cultivate rice, but none of it is really explained to you.  Does that leave the game open to experimentation and for you to figure out?  Sure, but even the simplest mechanics can leave you confused. 

Bottom line, Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin is a fantastic game and is well worth your time and money.  Even if you don’t care about the farming aspect, you still have the action platforming and exploration to dig into to.  I highly recommend it!

You need to be a really experienced developer to do genre-mixing right, and this game is clearly made by amateurs, which is why Sakuna ended up being bad a farming and bad beat'em up game.
There are also big signs of a kickstarter game, where a lot of things clearly weren't properly planned to fit the whole picture, which made every mechanic unnecessary complicated and cumbersome.

One of the worst offenses of bad beat'em up game is bad character controls.
Sakuna feels stiff to control - you can not cancel attacks or switch their direction with anything  BUT her divine scarf, which also has huge  amount invulnerability frames.
It is mandatory to master it If you want to progress through the game, because you oftenly get overwhelmed by enemies or just simply stuck in animation and scarf is the only way to get out. That along makes the combat irritating and easy at the same time.
Why easy? because once you master the scarf, you master the game and it becomes a cakewalk.

Other signs of bad sidescroller is amount of enemies and their variety. You will be fighting same monsters over and over and over. But how about bosses? Oh yeah, they will be also reused and not just few times, every level you will be seeing same monsters INCLUDING bosses.

AI of enemies is also pretty bad and can easily be abused, for example If you stand behind the wooden spike melee enemies will try to run through it until they die.

There is a night mode - at this time of day all enemies become  super extra strong - why it has to be like that, nobody knows but there is no reason to even bother with it. 

Worth mentioning that because there is a realtime day-night cycle while constantly ""hurries"" you and interrupts the already pretty boring exploration.

As for the rice farming minigame - every time I had to do it,  it felt like a huge waste of time. There is nothing fun or interesting about it - the difficulty is low but you get easily overwhelmed with tons of useless mechanics and ""press down then up for a miniute"" bits.

That is not the only boring and useless part of the game. 
You also absolutely have to eat to get full every day. But here's the catch - you have to make your menu too (out of farmed mats), because If buffs are bad, you won't be able to heal in combat. There is also a ""fullness"" gauge which after deplition removes the healing. Why?
There are so many mechanics that pile up on each other and goes in a way of the having fun from playing the game - it's crazy.
Gladly, there is a ""difficulty"" slider which makes the game slightly more bearable to play, but not enough to recommend it for the base price


The story is boring nonsense with unskippable dialogs and made up lore about made up countries and religions - seriously, who wants to read all that garbage? Dialogs are so painfully long and dull, you it's clear as day that devs jumped over their head here too.
The characters are very cliched and not interesting at all - apparently they all have sad backgrounds, but since they all lack any kind of charisma their mumbling is really hard to take seriously.

But the worst part, the worst part of this game is - 

SPOILER WARNING
[spoiler] it never ends. There is a point in the game where you open whole map and go fight big bad guy after developing your rice field for a while and then - bam, you get soft reset and have to visit SAME locations and kill SAME monsters to remove the ""curse"" you got.
It's crazy, game is crazy long AND bad and costs 40 bucks.[/spoiler] 

English dub, well, as bad as always have been, so no reason not to play with original japanese VA.

The art and music are pretty good for an indie, but not 40 bucks good.

It has some flaws, but they're all pretty minor or easy to compensate for. The combat is pretty fun, and the different skills, equipment, and clothing options all serve to modify combat. You craft new weapons and clothes by going out, exploring, and fighting, and bringing back materials. Your skills, as well as all of your stats, are tied to how well you manage your rice farm. You can also gather cooking ingredients for dinner preparations, which will boost your stats and give you things like health and stamina regeneration on the following day. The farming process itself is downright educational without coming off like an edutainment game at all.

The game is simultaneously pretty casual while also being quite challenging. The casual aspect comes from being able to tackle enemies when you want, generous auto-saves, and the game healing you to full and starting you back at the beginning of the level you're in if you die. If a challenge is too difficult, you can spend some time farming and grabbing resources to help out with farming to raise your stats and unlock new skills, or you can put in a slight bit of grind to grab some materials for crafting more powerful equipment. If you really don't want to spend your time farming, you can let the game do that for you, but you won't get as much from it.

The developers also put into place a couple systems that really help with the gameplay. If you do actually spend time farming, you gain new skills that make it much easier and faster. Your combat skills also increase in power the more you use them and become more proficient with them. Your character, Sakuna, is a goddess, a daughter of a Warrior God and a Harvest Goddess, and over time you really start *feeling* those dual aspects in Sakuna as she naturally gets more powerful.

At first, I thought the story was going to be more focused toward children, perhaps a PG fairy tale with a good moral at the end. The dialogue and general direction at the start definitely gave me that impression. However, I started to see just how much effort was put into the writing to carefully manage the audience's expectations to create that much better of an experience. You start to see that it's not so one-dimensional, and it was refreshing to see what would have been tired tropes instead played in different ways. There's real character development in this game as well that you experience over in-game years of shared struggles and stories swapped at dinnertime. By the end, I was actually pretty impressed by the story, because it did a lot more than I expected from an indie title or the apparent premise and cast of characters you see at the beginning.

For audio, I played the game with Japanese voiceovers and English subtitles, and the Japanese voice-acting is actually solid. I can't speak for the English voice-acting, though, since I didn't use it. None of the music really jumped out at me, though I did note that it does a great job playing in the background to set the tone for the given scenes.

As far as drawbacks go, the controls *can* feel a little clunky at times, and I felt that some encounters toward the end of the game came off as pretty unfair. However, I was still able to beat the game, and it's more likely that I was just underpowered and should have spent more time boosting stats and getting better gear. I also crashed probably around 8 times or so, about half of those on start-up and the other half during gameplay. Thankfully, due to the generous autosaving in the game, I never really lost any progress. While the game does give you all the info you need to do well at the farming portion of the game, it doesn't convey it in the absolutes gamers generally prefer so they know exactly how they should be doing something. I don't consider that as too serious of a flaw since you can do as much farming as you want (or don't want), and the game does convey it as a trial-and-error process that you're learning as you go along, so it fits.

The game took me about 30 hours to beat, though I'm admittedly not great at the combat in this game, and I definitely didn't 100% it. Probably in the ballpark of 80% unless I somehow missed a lot of side content.

Overall, I definitely think the experience this game gives you is well worth the full price, and I can easily see this game being among favorites for a lot of people that play it. It's just a really charming and enjoyable time the whole way through.


Oh, yeah, there's also a bunch of cute and fuzzy animals that show up and hang out on your farm, and you can pet them, rub their bellies, and carry them around, so definitely some bonus points there as well.",1607254121,1607254121,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I finished [i]Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin[/i] today, and I absolutely adore it. It might seem simple at first glance, but it's more than the sum of its parts---with the fun farming and platforming gameplay comes a story of a spoiled young goddess, Sakuna, who grows up as she learns about the importance of hard work and friendship. I won't comment on the story; it should really be experienced without spoilers! I teared up at some moments, and especially at the end.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

Gameplay is made up of farming, exploring, and fighting. To feed yourself and grow stronger, you must cultivate rice and hunt demons for their meat and other supplies. The allies you befriend will help you gather materials used for cooking and equipment. Finally, exploration within each level is rewarded; if you don't know where to go next, try accomplishing some of the goals set by the game to open up new areas!

[h1]Achievements[/h1]

[i]Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin[/i] features a good number of achievements for players, and most are not too difficult to obtain. (I managed to get them without trying too hard, anyway.) As of this writing I hope to complete [spoiler]the aphid challenge, exploration and treasure hunting, and the levels past one hundred in the Amagaeshi Shrine [/spoiler] soon. The last thing mentioned isn't marked with an achievement, but it's extra content, so naturally I'm going to get my money's worth from the game.

[h1]Issues[/h1]

The only issues I had with the game are technical in nature. 

Sometimes levels would not load, leaving me stuck on the loading screen, and I would have to restart the game. The game also froze once (earlier tonight, actually) while I was farming. I think, however, that that was an issue with my computer . . . 

Overall, I didn't experience too many problems with the game, so my enjoyment of it was not diminished at all.

[h1]Final comments[/h1]

I really love this game! I'm so glad it's selling well. The developers did a really good job, and I hope to see more from them!

Is it flawless? Of course not. Trying to move around Sakuna around when trying to plant rice seedlings is very awkward. Some platforming sections are very tedious in that you must find the exact spot and angle to able to reach the next platform (flashback to platform games of the old days, and not for the right reasons). Sometimes a grenade just insta-kills you from full health for some reason. Falling at a certain angle can sometimes get you stuck bouncing on dangerous terrain, so you can just sit and watch until you die.

But everything else is just damn great. The rice farming feels rewarding and you keep on getting new tools and features to play with. The platforming becomes great once you get used to the control - and even greater once you start figuring out how to combo your way in / out of trouble.

I had a huge annoyance with using the Raiment, since it's stuck to 8 directions instead of the full 360 degree, which would've felt nicer to use in my opinion.

This game is absolutely garbage if you plan on playing with keyboard and mouse. For a game with only ""partial controller support"" (according to the store page), it makes sense that keyboard and mouse controls would be in order for the game to be on the store. It's not even in an early access state.

When farming, a significant portion of the game, you're going to suffer. Badly. The camera just wanders around, and you won't be able to plant straight lines. You get penalized for not planting properly, so this is a significant issue. There is no setting to lock the camera or fix it from a player perspective in any way, this must be fixed by the developer or it'll stay in this utterly trash state of being.

How this has good reviews is beyond me, when key portions of the game are so bad as to be nothing but hassle due to poor implementation. That's not a good way to develop challenge, it's only good for letting people know that the developer is incompetent or negligent. It's not a game that the developers poured any passion into. It's just garbage that they threw onto the store to make a quick buck. Fixing the camera for farming wouldn't even be that big of a job, but they cared so little that they didn't bother. Terrible. Unfun. Miserable.

The other part of the game, the side scrolling combat stuff, that's fun. But the farming part? No. Unless you like spending hours going step sidestep adjust move step sidestep guess ok plant darn it's not in the right spot well I can't fix it now repeat. I'm not interested in doing that. As another reviewer said, the controls work against you.

Edit: Also, the developers only post/comment/reply in their native language. So, unless you can read/write japanese, expect to be completely ignored.

-Rune Factory: Its have more exploring. Its various areas/dungeons. but is pure platform hack slash.

You don't have to grind hordes of enemies to level up. You could sit at the porch watching the rice grow, tend to the field to by pulling out weeds, applying pesticide in the fertilizer, managing the water level, and applying remedies to cure rice diseases. You can reap the stalks, thresh, and mill/hull the husks. And when spring comes, you sow the seeds and plant the seedlings.

   I was hesitant yet curious coming into Sakuna. A game that's half side-scroller beat'm up, and half in-depth rice farming is something unique and interesting to me.
 
   We are introduced to Sakuna, a daughter of harvest goddesss Toyohana and war god Takeribi. Sakuna is a goddess who resides in the capital indulging herself on all sorts of expensive luxuries until one day she meets a certain group of humans and gets involved in an unfortunate event that has her and the group exiled to an isle of demons called Hinoe. It is on this isle that Sakuna will grow rice, hunt demons, and come to learn more about the humans that were exiled along with her.

  I was worried the farming part of the game would be half-realized, but it's much more. The process of making rice consists of 8 steps; sorting you seeds, tilling your field, raising seedlings, planting your seedlings, maintaining your rice and the field, harvesting, drying, threshing, and finally polishing. All of these steps are gradually explained throughout the game and you learn that the choices you make determine how your rice turns out later. Each and every one of these steps you can choose to do yourself, or let someone else handle it at the cost of the quality of your rice which impacts the stats you receive. You progress through  four repeating seasons, each of which have three days and three nights. Every day/night will have different weathers that occur depending on what season it is and shows even when you're out exploring other areas.
 
   Why are your rice stats important? Sakuna is the daughter of a harvest goddess and a god of war meaning she will grow as strong as her rice does. This growth also translates into your six combat stats which are; HP(Yield), Strength(Taste), Vitality(Hardness), Gusto(Stickiness), Luck(Aesthetic), and Magic(Aroma). After each day/night cycle you will be updated on how much your stats increase. Not only that, every now and then you can also unlock new combat skills and other passive bonuses you can equip on your weapons and gear.
 
   Speaking of combat, how's that play? Pretty great actually! It has nice tight controls and it's some good experimental fun. You get your basic light combo, heavy combo, parries, mix/match and special moves/skills kinda deal. You also get a mechanic that encourages you to collide enemies into one another called ""Crashing"". Crashing is a great way of clearing and/or staggering the massive amounts of mobs you will encounter later on. Besides, it's silly fun watching a horde of demons fall like dominoes. Another addition to combat is a grappling device called ""The Divine Raiment"". What makes this so special is that not only is it used for grappling/relocating on mobs and environments, it can also come with skills of its own. 
   
   While you are out hunting and exploring, do be aware of time. At night the demons get much more stronger than they would be in daytime and it's very easy to get absolutely demolished if you aren't prepared. Thankfully, if you do happen to lose all your HP in any of the fights, you reset to the last entrance of said area and can leave at any time.

   The music in Sakuna fits very well. Depending on where you are and what you are doing, the music changes. That even applies to day/night times as well! My personal favorites are ""Flourish"", and ""Ringleader"".
   
   Here are some neat things I found out as I played:
   •You can parry every single enemy in this game.
     -Most parried enemies have a dark glow that shows you've broken their poise. This means you can juggle them and even crash them into others. Bosses included!

   •every grapple you perform without a directional input on an enemy results in an invulnerability period that puts you behind that enemy. Be careful though, since you are only allowed two of these until you touch the ground.

   • You can check rice status in the pause menu under the stats tab and just look to the right.

   •You can pet AND pick up doggos and cattos. Try it sometime, they're adorable.
       
    TLDR: •Farming is complex, yet rewarding
               •Combat is tight and flows well
               •Music is nice and fits
               •Pet and carry your dogs and cats",1606775835,1606779621,True,24,0,0.754670321941375732,4,True,False,False

The game revolves around two main parts, farming rice and fighting. The game has a good balance between the two, some days you'll want to stay home, look after your rice and do field work, some days you'll want to go out into the world map and advance in the stages and thus the story. The map unveils in a fashion similiar to Atelier series (you unlock a location when you meet certain criteria)but this game has no time limit which gives you far more freedom and less pressure.

Farming seems bit cumbersome at first, but as you progress and unlock new abilities it becomes very fun. There are plenty of fine details and innovative mechanics like real time water level. Soon you find yourself trying out new techniques and combinations. Seeing and learing about ancient methods of rice farming is also interesting in my opinion. Seeing the rice grow and sprout is fun, and farming/rice processing animations are well done.

Combat is in a 2d platformer fashion, and at first not as fluid as one would expect from such a game. You eventually get used to it and be able to perform some good combos, but it can still be a bit frustrating at times. Perhaps it would feel better with a controller. Basic combat is not hard but going out in the night can be challenging.

There are plenty of sub systems, like gathering, crafting, exploration, weather, food preparation and preservation, food bonuses which can make a huge difference in combat. The game keeps introducing new mini-mechanics almost until the end of the game.

All these are backed by charming characters, that motivate you to keep playing. Your small field really starts like feeling like a home, dinner time especially can be quite fun. The story is not complex, but by all means not boring. 
It keeps expanding when you think it's about to end and the actual end is pretty good. Voice acting (the Japanese one) is great and ancient Japanese is a very nice touch, and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing.

Overall, great game. If we had an expansion or sequel, I'd definitely get it instantly.

Pros
+ Relaxing atmosphere and charming characters
+ Detailed and innovative farming system
+ Plenty of game mechanics
+ Large world map
+ Great OST and art

Cons
- Combat can be a bit clunky sometimes

It's really strange how the forward+attack input is a single attack, you would expect it to be a combo. Once you figure out you can combo into light launch attacks from it, it stops being an issue. Your attacks are just limited enough that you can't just mash buttons mindlessly to kill everything on screen, but you have plenty of options and insane mobility so it never feels like you can't do what you want.
The double tap to dash is also pretty bad, but it never really mattered to me since parrying is better than dodging 100% of the time anyway, and if you wanna slip behind someone then using the grapple to spin around them works better than the dash. I didn't dash once for the entire second half of the game and it was fine.

Once you get past those quirks, the combat is by far the best I've ever experienced in a 2d platformer action game. You can zip around the map grappling off walls and enemies, toss them into each other, whack them into each other, air juggle, and use good variety of special moves to keep it all going. 

And this is on top of what is by far the best farming game I've ever played. Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley have always lacked appeal to me from the get-go, it's just kind of a mindless, slice of life, chill-out genre but not one that's really engaging. Rune Factory was a lot better, since the crafting system is kinda cool and has an insane amount of hidden ability inheritance mechanics the game never tells you about, but even then the farming eventually becomes a boring chore that you wish you could automate so you can play the rest of the game.

This game? You get a shit load of skills to make farming quicker and easier and even a little bit automated, and have the ability to turn them off if you want, and I found myself actually turning some of them off to have more control over my rice fields even though it took longer. You have to worry about water level and temperature, and how the weather changes them. You manage nutrients in the soil to make sure your rice grows, and more specific nutrients in the soil that boost stats and/or make your plants more sturdy or vulnerable to different things. Said things include multiple different types of pests, diseases, and weeds. Do you want to sort your seeds thoroughly and plant a few high-quality ones or just toss them all in the field for a big yield but less quality since they have to compete for nutrients? Are you planning to make this year's harvest into brown rice which gives really good temporary stat boosts when eaten, white rice which gives better long-term stat boosts and is worth more for trading, or mixed rice? There's a lot more stuff to think about that I won't get into so this review isn't ten paragraphs long. Point is, it feels like you're actually taking care of some plants, not just splashing them with a watering can every morning.

I have never and probably will never again find a game where I'm mid-combat fighting a bunch of goons and think ""oh, it's noon, time to go check on my farm"" and be more excited about tending to crops than I was about the fighting, and I'll reiterate that the fighting is pretty stinkin' good.

Your main character Loli Goddess Sakuna is not your typical Jrpg protagonist who believe 100% in power of friendship . She is extremely spoiled due to her powers , status , not hesitate to throw insults, lazy and finally savage as Fock . You are not going to like her at first but her development in story is damn satisfying . And look at her human companions ... all of these have their unique problems and not likable at first either . Imagine this goddess forced to live with these humans in the isle filled with demons , shit things starting to happen . All of these characters have flaws and this makes the story great ! And their interactions and development along the story are simply charming . 

     Gameplay : well .. when you read this review , you probably have little idea about gameplay from Store page . Yup it’s Farming Sim with side scroller combat . Let’s talk about farming part . You can only farm Rice in this game but rice alone can make you headache since mechanics are directly taken from actual Japanese rice farming methods . This means you are going to deal with multiple problems that the farmer faced in real life . Seriously , adjusting water level , mixing fertilizer, pest prevention ... all things makes the rice farming interesting and fun ! 

Combat wise , this game allow you to perform massive combos with OK amount of enemies and bosses . Areas are detailed and backtracking is necessary for a lot of stages . Remember this game is developed by 2 men team . So this is more than good with their resources . 

  Gameplay Loop : well you know this game have 2 different features . The major reason what this game is so good is that developers did outstanding job at connecting these 2 features . 
First you wake up early morning , take care of your rice field and then go hunt , comeback when your belly is empty , eat dinner and repeat ! Sounds Harvest Moon huh ? Simple aye ? Yes simple but not boring . Taking care of rice field is more than watering plants and you need to change care methods for each seasons . 

And this game involves RPG mechanics , this mean Sakuna have Stats and you can upgrade her weapons and armors , even enchant these with divine powers . Her stat growth related to How good you can make quality rice and strength of her gears depends on crafting . This makes both rice farming and monster grinding important . Most rare materials spawn at night and monsters have ridiculous buffs at night ... so !!!

And finally there is meal system ! Sure being a goddess you can work the whole year without eating and sleeping . But eating meals offer you massive buffs that are too good to ignore . This meal system is even more complex than Monster Hunter Meal system and even more rewarding . Meats got from your hunts spoil if you do not eat them in time .. wanna stop this ? Dry them , smoke them , salt them , Freeze them . But fresh and dry meat gives you different buffs . 

The more you gather materials from hunt -> The more complex and better meal options you unlocked -> This mean the more buffs you have and finally the more night exploration you can go -> The more rare materials to craft weapons and armor = The Stronger Loli Goddess . 
More night exploration and more rare materials also mean more production of high quality fertilizers and result in High Quality Rice ! High Quality Rice = The Stronger Loli Goddess . 

      Music and Voice Acting : Personally I give 10/10 in this section because of Sakuna Voice acting and “Yanato Planting Song (Oracle)” Alone ! 

      Graphics : it’s good and Art gives me Okami Vibes . 

      Game length : This game have 30+ hrs for main story and can easily hit 50+ if you are willing to do side contents and take your time . 

So what are cons ? Only bad thing for me is lack of difficulty system . Sakuna only offer easy and default . Default as highest difficulty system is kinda lacking . Having Hard Mode as post launch content can make this game much better . 

Final Thoughts ! 
This game have real slow start ! After charming prologue , you basically stuck with unlike able characters , combat that need to get used to before having fun ! Not explaining too much about rice farming at first .. all these things makes you quit at first 10 hrs . But trust me , if you are experiencing these issues .. give it a time and it will certainly get better . I even planned to refund the game but giving the chance was the one of the best choice I have ever done ! 

First ... Combat is clunky and you need to familiar with it at first . Plus some cool skills that add fluidity in combat will come sooner than you think if you give it some time ! Just don’t expect combos from trailer if you just start the game lel . 

Rice farming is poorly explain at first and it’s intended . Developers expect you to learn from trail errors and mistakes . Both of you and Sakuna are supposed to get bad crops at first and getting better and better after each mistake you commit ! You have knowledge of planting rice and Sakuna have skills that make things easier .

Just do yourself a favor and don’t read farming guides from Internet . It’s basically spoiling yourself . Later explanation in game coming from scrolls are enough to produce Perfect Crop if you are willing to learn and give some time ! Trust me getting better crop without Reading guides is super rewarding and it’s part of the game’s charms ! 

At first , this game offer you how it is look like “real farmer” planting rice !

Later , this game offer you how it is look like “Harvest Goddess” planting rice with her super duper almighty powers !

In Conclusion , Sakuna : of Rice and Ruin is the game that give me sense of progression in both lore wise and gameplay wise by committing tons of trial errors and mistakes ! Combine with charming character development and amazing music , this is simply Satisfying experience !

Pros: 
- Good character development/story
- Sense of progression
- In depth combat system
- Knowledge to agriculture
- Nice visual

Cons: 
- Memory leaks issues on several maps, only happens when you paused for too long, and crash right after the moment you killing the boss, recommend not to pause in middle of mission.
- Forward direction + hit ends up to a single hit combo, it feels really weird at first, you can only get used to it after 10 hours of gameplay or more than that and not everytime you can just combo it with an upper attack, there's tons of environment hazard that can punish you from doing that.
- Pressing attack button without directional input sometimes it flips your character to opposite direction and results as hitting air.
- If you insists on farming loots at night, remember to go back farm having dinner once in a while, otherwise you might end up progression stuck, there's 1/3 missions requires you to do that in order to proceed further, ofc you can do that after the main story ends. Nonetheless, if you skipping dinner, the fertilizer on that day won't deduct, but the deduct effect stacked on, so it might consumes fertilizer more than usual in one night if you skipped dinner for multiple times.

Some things to consider before you buy:

Pros:
-There is tons of unique and engaging skills to make combat fun and customizeable to your play style
-A fun addition of leveling and stat gain tied into farming through time management, resource management and learning to balance out all elements for optimal growth
-The characters are cute and seeing your main character's growth is simple but pleasing and heart-warmingly soft
- The raiment  (aka the thing you see in the videos that launch you around or pulls people to you) is a nifty addition to combat and mechanics that you can enjoy toying around with and steadily mastering how to use it for all it can do
-Combat is tons of fun. A lot like a muso game but as a 2d side scrolling platformer.
-You get dogs and cats at your base that you can pet and pick up!
-The style is crisp, soft and great!

Cons:
-The raiment has moments that agitate you as it doesn't connect to surfaces when it should, aiming it can be painful and some mechanics you use it to get 100% exploration/treasure in an area can be absolutely annoying. This won't be an issue if you are not a completionist like me.
-The farming can be difficult or convoluted for some and may be a struggle grinding out stats and levels. I personally didn't have a problem, but I can see where this can be an issue.
-Combat can be rather simple after you gain enough power and skill that make it a beat 'em up that becomes trivial once you learn how to abuse it. 

I love this game so dearly and it is worth all the time and the cost! Of course, with anything that is fun and enjoyable there will be always room for improvement, but the cons I ran into were something that did not take away from the overall experience and enjoyment.

It's a lovely, colorful fun game that blends together a traditional platformer with a farming simulator and I enjoyed it quite a lot.

Pros:
1. The art is great. Both 2D and 3D segments are lovely and the atmosphere with the changing seasons. And for those that might not be too much into anime style, don't worry, it's not that heavy on that end.
2. The music is good and fits the setting, it's nice that it changes with the seasons.
3. Combat is simple, but fun non the less. Really, you probably won't face a challenge you can't overcome and you can get about by just spamming a few moves, but it's flashy and exciting and just cool.
4. The story is nice, but not too complicated. Nothing groundbreaking, but fun, entertaining and even emotional.
5. Characters - This is one of the biggest positives imo. You get to see how all the characters grow little by little and begin to bond and how Sakuna transitions from a spoiled brat into someone more mature that cares about others.

Cons:
1. Some of the controls, especially during rice planting can be a pain in the butt.
2. Lack of early game explanations. One of the most important aspects of this game is growing the rice because that buffs your stats for fighting. However the game explains this way too slow and way too late and never in that much of a detail for you to not have to look up guides. While later on you discover scrolls with tips on how to grow rice to buff specific stats, that doesn't come until way later. And if you followed just the tips the game gave you early on you'd be buffing primarily your HP. Another problem is you get only a vague on what some stats do early on.

For a game that relies so heavily on it's farming part, that part lacks a significant amount of info in the first half of the game.

3. It's a bit repetitive. A lot of your time would be devoted to revisiting old areas to gather materials either to craft gear, upgrade your gear or most importantly, hunt for fertilizers for your rice. And while I personally don't mind it as much, I realize some might be put off by the idea of revisiting the same area for the 30th time looking for garlic, wheat, mushrooms or grinding mobs for beast hides.

Finally, taking in both the good and the bad, the game is enjoyable, not too challenging, colorful and relaxing, with a decent and entertaining story, lovable characters, beautiful art, fun combat and a good combination between two different game genres.",1606600250,1606600470,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the 2d action part is fun and the combos you can do are flashy and fun to execute. the farming part is where this game truly shines. take care of your little plot of land, plant rice, tend to it, remove weeds that damage the yield, watch out for different diseases that can potentially ruin your crops. all of this will keep you engaged and on your toes until the day comes when your are finally ready to harvest your crop.

Its 2d side scrolling combat is not my cup of tea, and i cant rebind keys on pc..
Just use controller, well -10fps if you do..what? 
The only game i cant play 4k on my setup on high. 40fps down to 30 with controller.
The farming movement when planting is idk how to put it like why. I am sure they have a reason to do it that way but what a headache, controls all inverted and i am planting all over the place..They tried something different but its just not for me.
I dont review games much but for few people like myself if you see this keep this in mind. I got bored really quickly the story didnt draw me in and nothing really happens day by day, random skills and rice growing, well thats enough for me.

If you like really precise growing of crops in your games, this is for you.  I didn't really think it'd be fun growing the rice, but every little step that I get right in the process feels great.  Yeah, it can get repetitive sometimes when things pop up in your little humble patch of land, but after a long trek through the fields slaying demons Muramasa: The Demon Blade-style, it feels rewarding, and every little buff you get from growing the grain really helps.  I was dying at one part repeatedly, grew some of the grain, and boom, killed the thing blocking me in under 30 seconds, so you really feel the buffs when you raise that rice.  Not only that, but planning what's for dinner can really affect how you fight the next day.

The only thing I'm having a bit of a hard time with, in general, is the camera at times.  I'll be fighting a big boss, and sometimes, the camera focuses on the minions that spawn with them.  Same goes with planting rice, because Sakuna isn't locked to a grid, and the camera moves around a little, so it makes it almost impossible to plant a perfect line of rice that's with the square farmland.  I mean, you don't have to get it perfectly but I kinda wish there was a little camera snap option for planting with the right skills.

Loving the soundtrack and the characters so far, and I'm addicted to the battle system. Crashing opponents together is a real fun mechanic and combos feel great to pull off.",1606557748,1606557748,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

[*]Farming system is complex and satisfying. Lots of room for optimization, and a nice drip feed of tips to help you improve.
[*]Combat gives you lots of moves to play around with, enabling plenty of fun combos. Feels very fluid once you get the hang of it.
[*]Gameplay loop has strong ""just one more day"" energy.
[*]Soundtrack is great.
[*]Voice acting is excellent on both the JP and Eng dubs.
[*]Excellent art direction and character design more than make up for technically simple graphics.

Sakuna is a game that speaks to the player directly,  more subtly than in Nier: Atomata, and clearly aimed at a younger audience, but with generally good game play, a passable story, and ideas to think about for the adults.

The core theme presented is cultural appreciation and this is portrayed through its diverse cast, all of which have unique backgrounds and places of origin, and in how it portrays the culture around growing rice. Diverse casts don't always imply the writers are aiming at cultural appreciation, but much of the drama between characters revolves around differences of ideas in how they see the world, including religious ideas that entirely contradict each other with seemingly no concessions possible. Yet, they are able to work through their differences as they all have a common aim to support one another and grow rice.

Perhaps the most memorable scene for me so far is when everyone is working together, planting a field, and they start bickering with one another until the exercise becomes a shouting match. Then, one of them starts singing a rice planting song, saying that this is hard, back breaking work and if we get to talking, we start complaining and everyone feels terrible. If they sing in unison, they can bear it together. Unity through a common goal.

The planting itself in enormously tedious and this is why I say what makes this game special is going to be proportionate to how much this theme resonates with you. Planting the seeds, you have to place hundreds of them, equally spaced in the field, one after another, manage the soil and water levels every day, harvest (you walk around and press the square button), thresh (press down, square+left, right, down, square+left, right, ...), and hull (up, down, up, down...), wait, and then till the field. In most games, I would say this is awful design, ridiculous, but I *appreciate* it because of how it makes me think about the importance of rice and the culture that developed around it. This game will make you love rice.

Before moving on, I just want to say that it's pretty hard to absolutely mess up growing rice in this game, but there's a pretty great amount of complexity and depth to these mechanics and the player is graded on when they planted the rice, if they gave the right amount of water at the right times, etc., and you're not just maximizing one thing here, you can grow for quality or yield or a mix of both!

When not working the field, you go out into the world in a surprisingly deep 2D platformer/fighter. Grappling with your arm ribbon-things is fun, both for mobility and combat abilities, you can light attack, heavy, and special. Parry by pressing left or right in the direction an enemy is attacking, or double tap to sidestep. There are three or four different damage types depending on your equipment and the weapons, hats, garments, and masks you wear can have special abilities as well as slots to put in additional abilities. And it's not just deep, but frantic with often around ten enemies to fight at once. 

Unfortunately, some of this depth can create ambiguities. Left can be pressed either to parry an attack, with circle to do a special, grappling, or as the first button press in a side step and sometimes you just want to turn around but are stuck in a combo. Fewer enemies, but with better move sets and AI would've made ambiguities like this more controllable.

New areas are unlocked by gaining exploration points which are gained by accomplishing goals in different areas and this is one of my bigger gripes with Sakuna. Secrets aren't just bonus content that rewards observant, diligent players, they actually block progress. And because this all happens in real time, there's a real opportunity cost to re-exploring old stages for secrets and not finding them. Some stages just require that you mine a resource hub until a rare material pops out a number of times so, even if certain equipment can raise the likeliness this happens, it's often just luck.

Mechanically, Sakuna is a great example of a Japanese design philosophy that starts with a simple concept and game play loop, then adds as much complexity and depth as it possibly can to make for a deeper experience, and it's able to pull it off through a thematically interesting premise.

The game is about a goddess who is expelled from heaven due to her being a spoiled brat. Over the course of the game her power grows (she levels up) by tending to and harvesting rice, the higher quality the rice the more her stats grow. She uses these powers to rid the island she was banished to of demons, hunting and foraging for food.

Combat in S:RR is 2D platforming with the ability to swap out powers with her weapons and grappling raiment. It really reminded me of the Subspace Emissary from SSB: Brawl in the way enemies can be sent flying in various ways and getting through puzzles to navigate the area.

The other side of the coin in this game, rice farming, is extremely rewarding in the sense of the work you put into growing the rice and the reward for it. Sakuna gets stronger by growing the best DAYUM rice she can, not by combat, and the game does a great job of telling just how to grow that rice, while later on telling you how to grow the rice in specific ways to your character growth. On top of leveling up, the rice can be cooked for food to grant Sakuna further bonus's, and eventually being able to sell the rice for rare materials.

Sakuna: R&R has an extremely rewarding game play loop that has you constantly growing, and planning for the in game days ahead.

What a great and fun experience!

Main mechanic and progress is from growing and harvesting rice. You will get stronger each cycle by eating rice.
The better you put the rice through many processes, the stronger you become! (more LV. up and stats you got)
such as planting, growing, water level, temperature, weather, pesticides, and rice's illnesses.
You will have no idea how to take care of these rice, but NPC and guide scroll will teach you how as you progressing the game. It's fun to go to trial and error to grow the rice.
But it might be dulled in few cycles if you guys get bored easily, since it put much effort and attention to do it.

Battle mechanic is fun, challenging and satisfied too. Movement animation is so fluid. So many air combo, air juggle, and environment combo (crashing enemy to each others or objects). 
I have a good time exploring the map. It has a feeling of metroidvania genre game too. Each map has different gimmick, hidden treasures and passages.

Story is so-so to me, nothing special.
Voice over is god-tier. (I have tried only Japanese voice since I'm a weeb)

Only 2 real major nitpicks and they're both about early game progression. Unlocking more areas is tied to achieving little objectives throughout the world map. Some of these are just straight grinding or luck based, so if you don't find enough copper or whatnot in one area, you're stuck just repetitively cycling through the days over and over. It creates a soft lock that is just boring.
Lastly, combat early game can be a slog until you unlock some interesting skills. But once you do unlock some skills, combat enjoyment ramps waaay up.

You explore the island through side-scrolling action gameplay, you farm rice crop to level up and gain stats (get it, because she's a harvest and a warrior goddess). Both gameplay feed into the other. The real gem is the farming, if you are open minded going in, you will lose yourself into the rice farming, trying to make sense of the mechanic, and strive to min/maxing. The music serves the atmosphere very well. There's some solid character writing here and there and the overall visuals and scene compositions are well done. Overall storyline is 30~ish hours unless you speed through it.

The overall story is very basic, game does progress wall you (you need specific amount of ""stars"" to open up new areas, each area awards you ""stars"" for completing different conditions) which sort of dampers pacing. The early farming tutorials are not exactly thorough, you can obtain scrolls with deeper info as you progress the game, so I can see some people getting frustrated by that. You will also need to worry about not OVER farming or else you will end up too overpowered, which is easy to do since there's no time limit in the game.

For a very small team developed game that's been cooking for many years, it's filled with charm and you can tell the dev team put care and effort into the game. You might also come away with a deeper appreciation for rice itself afterwards.",1606370897,1606370897,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Mostly to do with controls and the fighting. The controls are pretty bad in both the farming and the fighting, in the farming the camera is constantly moving with or without your control, which messes with the planting, it is ridiculously hard to plant a straight line in this game. The combat has many flaws as well. Your move set has many attack that just fail to smoothly transition into any other attacks that it left me feeling like i was fighting the controls rather than playing the game. The grapple ability if pretty trash, you hover in the air for a second if you miss which slows game play and ruin flow and you can only shoot it in the 8 cardinal directions, if the wall your trying to grab if slightly to high than you fall. During the fighting as well there seems to be some issues with which way your character is facing. When starting a fight your character just flips around and attacks air for no reason.

Knocking an enemy into the air, zipping up to them using your raiment, juggling them for a bit, then send them crashing back down into other enemies never gets old; it almost feels like an odd mix of Devil May Cry and Spider-Man (though Muramasa fans will feel the most at home).

I am enjoying this game, but lost 4 hours of progress 5 hours in. I quit to eat and upon returning just mashed through the continue screen.

1. The joystick was too sensitive, when I release my joystick, the character will turn back sometimes because the the joystick spring back a little over.

Of course it will be better if you can let our player to set the range of the area like other games did.

Very nice game that combines both two different types of playing - '(classic) Rice farming simulation' and 'action game'. Each volume is proportionally 50:50. Therefore, perhaps not for those expecting 'action game' only, though I'm positive. 

Characters and the story as well as music are unique and interesting, probably expressing the mood of the Japanese myth.  I was impressed with it, generally. 

The rice farming of this game is performed in traditional Japanese ways. This means you can experience how the past Japanese farmers had lived with rice. (Rice-)cultivation basically requires you to follow some sensitive steps, which might bore some of you. However,  the cultivation is inevitable to enjoy both 'action game' and 'the story'. 

This is because...
the leveling (and advanced actions by it) in this game is quite or only depending on the quality of your 'rice'. You are probably not able to slay every boss without making your effort for better rice in the cultivation. I mean you need to cultivate rice whenever you are stuck for a boss enemy. In other words, forced rice farming often stops your concentration on the story. Which is a negative point. 

However, I am really enjoying this game. ...and personally waiting for a new DLC whereby I can learn how to 'cook' rice in the Japanese classic way.

It does have some outstanding features, such as cute graphics and interesting story. The essence of the game is intriguing and exceptional. 

But the shortcomings are really apparent. It's a farming game, not just literally a farming game but a game with a routine procedure. You'll have to do the farming every single day/year, plowing the soil, transplanting the rice seedling, fertilize the soil with proper ingredients, managing the water level, weeding your farm. Yearly, you got power up, you can beat the stage you couldn't pass, you may got new materials to craft new weapons and armors, then you do exactly the same things year over year over year.  That makes this game is not easy to sell to some customers.

The battle is not easy though, not as easy as it appears to be :), and you'll find you're in a situation that battling is not an option at all, as you cannot defeat the main stage, yet to collect some manure, ore, fibers are the best move you can do at that point. There are some recycling bosses, which I'm not really a fan of it. The battle experience is great to me overall, there's a need to practice counter hit and change your weapons and armors for different bosses.

About the farming, I was not familiar with all the stuffs and I still do not fully grasp the knowledge of farming after playing this game. (As an Asian, shame on me.) But I'm having a good time. Watching character interactions, how they deal with difficulties and everyone has his/her own story. It's filled with warmth and paint the pictures of how the ancestors got their ways to survive and treasure any possible moment.

In conclusion, during this crazy pandemic, this game saves my days, I bought Switch version but that only supports 30 fps so I bought on steam after the day I started on Switch. This game really stands out on slow-paced farming life while having challenging battle components.

7 hours in and I can see the training wheels slowly coming off and the full breath of this game is fun. I can see myself easily putting in at least another 5 hours, or possibly finishing it. That being said there are a number of things that I had to overcome to finally be able to ""enjoy"" this game, that might turn you off.

[b]What kind of game is it?[/b]
One third Harvest Moon, one third Devil May Cry, one third uh... minigames.
Farming rice to boost your stats, boosting stats to help fight demons, fighting demons to gain materials to (you guessed it) help you farm rice.

The Harvest Moon comes out as a crop maintaining simulator.
The DMC comes out as an actually deeper than it looks combat mechanic.
The minigames come out, in well the farming minigames.

If you can't accept all three, and I do mean ALL three, then immediately just back out. 

[b]MORE Hurdles[/b]
Ok, so you've accepted all three now for more hurdles.

Do you like anime? Do you like how some Japenese phrases/cultural references don't translate well into english? Do you like a loli protaganist that exclaims ""I'm a fully grown woman!"" two to three times in the opening hours? 
This game is quite, for lack of a better word, Japenese-y, and at my current age some of the more creepier and off putting cultural things are becoming more uncomfortable for me. Thankfully, heavy dialogue scenes drop off significantly as you play in favor of small character vignettes. As for lore, the dialogue where they [i]try[/i] to explain how the lofty realm sits atop of clouds and also somehow has an ocean are skippable and have no bearing on the gameplay or major plot. 

Secondly, this game incorporates a very gentle hand when it comes wanting you to master it's mechanics. Most tips are not taught to you through either a tutorial or a cutscene. Instead they are relegated to npc dialogue that you must hunt down and could possibly miss. The tutorials are also relegated to just pages of text that you must either hunt down and manually opened.

The most handiest of skills takes (in-game) years to unlock.
Grids that show you how to plant rice, the ability to plant multiple seeds, and the ability to see your current water level by number are all very helpful; but must be unlocked through  wandering blindly first. You just randomly do it, and eventually through time you'll get it.
To learn in this game is to suffer through a fog of confusions. On the upside the game gives you a sensation of improvement through a quite impressively made rice growing simulator. On the downside, you have to think of it all as an upside.

Finally, you really do have to accept all three faucets of this game. There are times where the combat will really open up and you'll just want to fight more and more monsters BUT the day timer limits your exploration. There are times where you might want to just tend to your rice but you are gated by your exploration progress. There are times where you don't want to play the farming minigames, but the auto-complete option could ruin an entire year's harvest.

[b] Wow that's a lot [/b]
Surprisingly, the game does not inflict much punishment for any mistaken actions.
Personally, I love to save scum. Fallout, Mass Effect, etc. If I know there is a better outcome things must go my way or the highway. 
For Sakuna, I haven't especially decided to do this. When you die in this game there is literally no punishment except a boot back to the last (pretty generous) checkpoint. If you do want to retry a section then the auto save probably won't reset you back too far or too near. =
 
If you get a bad crop, well you've unlocked a handful of helpful skills to make the next one great.  Do you feel like you need a certain item but don't want to go out and get it? Well you will unlock the ability to have people get things for you. Food spoils, but it spoiled food can be recycled into good fertilizer.

The game doesn't punish you for taking it slow, or not going fast enough. 

[b]So, it's good?[/b]0
Yes, and hopefully it'll get even better with patches/mods.

tl;dr
Sure, it's a large pill to swallow and you probably have to look up guides for the rice mechanics. It's uniqueness and passion for rice making flows through in spades. It's stylistic graphics keeps it looking good. It's combat will surprise you. Some mechanics will frustrate you but will turn around and reward you by displaying helpful information.
It could be easier, but somehow it isn't back breaking.

If you're interested in technical aspects of the PC port itself (including controller and ultrawide screen support), rather than the actual game, It'll be the bottom two paragraphs of this review.[/i]

The combat is fast and chaotic, with a focus on tossing enemies around and smashing them into each other for big damage. It feels great with a generous helping of hit stop to give the impacts from crashing enemies together feel meaty. Sakuna's Raiment gives her an astonishing amount of mobility if you get good with it. It acts as a combination hookshot/whip and can be used to maneuver you or enemies around the field, as well as navigate the bite-sized metroidvania style platforming levels. Using it takes a bit of adjustment because the raiment only has 8-way aiming, although there is a bit of auto-aim to help snag enemies if one is close enough to the direction you fling it. I found using a D-pad instead of a control stick in combat helped me get to grips with it. There are some basic 3 to 4 hit combos you can execute with a mix of the light and heavy attack buttons and holding a direction while attacking will usually alter the attack (i.e. hold up to do a launcher, hold forward/back to do a distance-closing slash). You'll unlock a variety of skills as the game progresses for both your weapons and Raiment. You can set 4 skills for each at any time and they are executed by holding an input direction and the skill button or raiment button. Once I found a set that worked well for me, I didn't switch it up much and focused on mastering those skills, but the variety is there if you want to play around or refit for a specific encounter.

The farming half of Sakuna is very in-depth. I've never personally played a game with so much going on in a farming system that wasn't some type of simulator game. At a bird's eye view the farming loop is basically the same as your standard Rune Factory/Harvest Moon/Stardew Valley system (i.e. plant, water, harvest, repeat), but every aspect of it is expanded significantly. There are more steps to take and several of them have their own minigame-esque tasks to complete, with your performance affecting any number of stats for the eventual harvest. Sakuna will grow more skilled in agriculture as the years go on, and she unlocks various skills to make these tasks easier to complete. As the game continues and slowly reveals all of these skills and all of the mechanics of growing and harvesting rice, the sheet amount of math that is happening under the hood begins to be apparent. Weather, temperature, water level, water temperature, fertilizer composition, spacing of the seedlings, the ecosystem of flora and fauna in the rice patty. All of this is happening on an hour to hour basis and all of it it contributes to the final result. The final result is not a simple 0-100% scale either. The parameters for success change depending on your end goal. Did you want a lot of rice or did you want extremely high quality rice? Did you want it to be aesthetic, or aromatic? This changes how you grow the rice. You will discover and unlock tutorial scrolls throughout the game that will spell these mechanics out for you, even if they don't give you the exact math for it. The process is supposed to be iterative, and learning what needs to be done is only half of it. Figuring out how to do those things while juggling all of your other responsibilities and adjusting to factors outside of your control is the other half.

The story is a light touch affair. You won't be sitting through hours of expository dialogue or experiencing grand revelations and genre-defining character examinations. What's there is good though, and the translation is top-notch, like most of XSEED's work. The English VO is above average too, even if there isn't a lot of it to begin with. Sakuna is a petulant, immature harvest goddess who fritters away her days drinking and lazing about in the realm of the gods, skating by through the making of offering of rice from her departed mother's massive stores from when she was alive. An inciting incident happens, and she gets exiled to a demon-infested island with a handful of humans and told to expunge the land of the demons and grow her own rice offerings for a change. That's basically the entire story for the first half of the game. The middle third of the game is mostly concerned with showcasing tiny little character vignettes between Sakuna and the children of men, and slowly transforming Sakuna from an entitled and lazy but preternaturally gifted brat goddess, into a more empathetic and benevolent (but still marginally petulant) goddess.

I would consider the PC port to be above average; Significantly so if you consider the scope of the game and the size of the team that made it. It's got a few different graphical knobs to tweak, like bloom, anti-aliasing, shadow qualities etc, but given the visual style of the game it isn't the kind of experience you need to mess with settings to get the most out of. It has options for windowed, fullscreen, and borderless. While it doesn't fully support 21:9 aspect ratios, it thankfully will gracefully run in borderless fullscreen on an ultrawide monitor without stretching or cropping anything. The one weird thing about this is that the game will not throw up black pillarboxes to the left and right of the rendered 16:9 game window, so you will still be able to see what's on your desktop behind the game. It wasn't a problem for me personally, but I know a few people might bristle at that.

You will find some reviews here or discussions in the Steam forum about lackluster controller support, but I consider that to all be complete hogwash from people who don't know what they are doing. I've personally run the game with a PS4 controller, a Switch Pro controller, and an 8bitdo SN30 Pro+. The game detected all of them immediately out of the box and automatically adjusted the button prompts accordingly. In the case of the Switch Pro controller it even swapped the Accept/Confirm mappings for the face buttons to match Nintendo's reversed standard. Edelweiss patched some support issues for 3rd party controllers the day after launch so take that into account when reading up on it. I can't personally speak to the keyboard controls, but I do know that Edelweiss has already patched a couple of improvements in regarding them, so be careful when reading anything about the KB/M controls written prior to November 14th, 2020.",1605546425,1605546440,True,4,0,0.547837495803833008,0,True,False,False

The game has good ideas but absolutely abhorrent execution. There is a combo system in place that allows you to chain attack to deals more damage mid air than using the standard combos but the game gives enemies every tactic to break your combo. invincibility frames(causes you attack to not register on enemies after a number of attacks or if you chain light attacks and heavy attacks together), glitching out of existence and back in to hit you in the face and buttons would sometimes just stop responding until you hit the ground. The Raiment system is terrible, it consistently target the wrong enemies and sometimes just doesn't work which leaves you stunned mid air and vulnerable. The game also tends to punish you if you attempt the use the parry system, many bosses would just enter an invulnerable state if you parry them, and some of them would use this period to hit you with an extra strong attack takes half your HP away, why do you have a parry system and makes it not fun to use? Enemies have invincibility frames, but you don't; stand in the wrong spot and they can (and will) combo you to death with subsequent attack growing stronger in the combo. Difficulty, the games has 1 difficulty style, spawn more enemies, the tactic is to overwhelm you with and increase their combo (you to death) potential, this is especially bad in bosses where there is always an endless horde of enemies replacing the ones you killed. Those are just a few of the many, many, MANY flaws in the combat system with great ideas but highly questionable decisions. 
Farming: slow, tedious, boring with ""hints"" and quality of life changes that comes after (and only after) you successfully perform the tasks perfectly.

The game has great graphic, good voice over and a, well, passable story/writing. The main reason I don't like this game is that the game's control is very restrained.

My feeling throughout gameplay is ""The game is easy, but controls work against me"". It's like a tuned-down version of the running game QWOP where it make simple tasks unnecessarily tedious.

----

Let's use combat/movement as an example:

1. There is no ""running"". Sakuna always run at about 70% of what speed you hope she would run. When you double tap forward she does a forward dash step (evade dash) similar to what you see in fighting games.

2. Attack changes based by analog direction. That is normal. But if you press forward + attack, it's a single-hit forward lunge with a huge recovery time (the kind of ""dash attack"" that usually executed while you are dashing in other games).

If you want to do combo attack (multi-hits attack), you have to release the analog and have completely zero directional input.

It doesn't sound that stupid in text. But just imagine in game where you run toward the enemy, then release the analog stick, wait for the split moment until analog flip toward zero (remember, you are now immediately in front of an enemy) before pressing attack.

If you are too hasty, you're punished with executing a forward lunge attack that gosh leave you open for like forever. She keeps the lunge pose long enough for me to write this review.

Another huge problem is when you release the stick, if it happen to over shot you'll end up facing the other direction. Oh did I mention you can't change direction during combo? Yeah if you keep pressing attack you will be locked in the wrong direction. I had to config deadzone to more than half of the analog range.

3. There's a very cool feeling mechanic that is using the divine garment to fling yourself behind an enemy. It feels ""weeeeee~~"" to fling yourself back and forth. But in combat application, it's... weird.

First of all it fling you waaaaaaaaaay behind you enemy, like half a screen behind (look at it in gameplay video trailer). You actually have to move back in order to get in range (don't forget to release the stick before attacking). It getg extremely frustrating when you're fighting agile or airborne enemy (like the little birds you fight at the end of first dungeon). By the time you got into position, the enemy is already gone.

Another problem is that it, well, idk it's very random. 

- Sometime you fling yourself behind the enemy
- Sometime you fling yourself behind the enemy [b]and[/b] the enemy turns blue and is pulled toward you
- Very rarely you grab the enemy toward you without moving away from original spot.

Idk it make no sense at all I have absolutely no idea what will happen when.

4. Everything else in the game just don't ""flow"" together. 

- Restrained attacks as described above.

- The divine garment doesn't snap toward wall/ceiling. You have to aim the retro/NES era way.

- You have to wait until the garment returned completely before the game recognize the next throw command again. Normally in games you have a small windows of buffer, like you can press RB 0.3s before garment fully return, and the game still recognize your input and throw garment immediate after. Without that buffer you usually just fall down doing nothing while holding RB and a question mark on your face.

- When you want to do wall jump you have to hold the garment button and then press A. The full combo to wall jupm is RB -> Hold until you are pulled to wall -> Keep holding RB and press A. If you release RB at any moment and press A you'd just fall down because she can't jump midair nor can she wall jump normally.

----

I only used combat and dungeon movement as an example, but other controls are weird in a similar way. The rice planting thing especially, my god that was totally QWOP incarnate.

Well you might feel I'm just nitpicking little details. But I play the game for enjoyment, and the game is frustrating to understand.

It's one story when the game is hard this way: you choose Attack, your character Attack, but you die because attacking is a stupid decision. 

It's a completely different story when you choose Attack, your character be like ""Oh nice weather today innit?"", and you die because to write Attack you must press Caps Lock then press a and press Caps Lock then press t twice, pressing Shift+a doesn't work.",1605146475,1605245954,False,187,23,0.552773714065551758,29,True,False,False

Sakuna: of Rice and Ruin places you in the shoes of Sakuna, a goddess banished alongside a group of humans to the Isle of Demons. Here you must rid the isle of Demons while surviving alongside your human companions. The story is nothing special, and the characters mainly fall into stereotypes we've all seen before, but there is something very endearing in the way it's presented. The cast of characters grows closer year by year, and while not groundbreaking, their bond and individual development is heartwarming. 

Farming makes up about 50% of this game and has a surprising amount of depth to it. Combat, while necessary to progress, is not the main focus. You'll spend a lot of your time navigating the UI, be it in farming, cooking, composting, or just resource management. Your experience is tied to your harvest. A larger harvest means more leveling up, but compost nutrients are where it gets complicated. Soil has 6 nutrient stats which correspond to Sakuna's 6 character stats. Micromanaging your soil nutrient level is possible via composting, but it will take up a lot of your time. 

Speaking of time, that's also a resource you'll have to manage. Time is constantly moving, whether you're farming, dungeon crawling, or just standing around because you forgot to pause, time is always against you. Specific seasons and rice growth stages require different water levels, temperatures, and steps in the farming process. Seasons last only 3 in-game days. Farmwork and dungeon exploration can be done during the day and night, but dungeons have a separate, higher level at night so be careful. Harvests are yearly.

Cooking (and eating) is a big part of the game as well. Using ingredients gathered in dungeons to create multi-dish dinner combinations provides decent stat boosts and extra skills such as out of combat healing (which isn't something you're able to do via items). Eat well and you'll have a much easier time in dungeons.

Combat starts off pretty simple, but opens up a lot more after unlocking skills. There are 2 types: Fighting skills and Reiment skills. 

Reiment skills are for the ribbon Sakuna can shoot out to pull, debuff, launch or dash towards enemies and terrain. This is the main way in which you dodge enemy attacks and move around dungeons.

Combat skills are just damage dealing abilities that get better the more you use them, but keep an eye on your SP meter.

Combat just FEELS amazing. Dungeons go into a 2D platformer style with combo and knockback focused gameplay. The closest comparison I can think of would be Super Smash Bros, but with a lot more movement options to keep your combos going. If you like the feeling of pulling off incredible combos with relatively easy execution, you'll have a ton of fun here. Dungeons also provide different terrain challenges and obstacles you'll have to adapt to.

As daughter of the God of War and Goddess of Harvest, Sakuna's weapons are all farming tools. There are 4 weapon damage types (so far): Slash, Pierce, Strike, and Magic. Different enemies have different weaknesses, so you'll have to experiment to find optimal builds for the different areas. In addition to weapons you can equip different clothes, hats, and masks. Equipment and weapons usually have unique abilities, some of which can be leveled up. Some equipment has empty ability slots you can fill in with Spirit Boughs found while exploring for specific abilities which can be moved around your equipment as you see fit.

If you're hoping for a quick and easy game to pick up and play, this probably isn't the one. Farm micromanaging, equipment management and combo diversity becomes more and more necessary the longer you go. If that doesn't sound fun, and you just want to ignore those aspects of the game you might still find enjoyment playing it on the lower difficulty.

Thank you for reading and happy harvesting!

This games progression is absolutely great. It rewards you for doing things yourself and the progression is also intuitive. The first year you're left kinda confused on how to do things better, but as time goes on and you get new skills it only gets easier and becomes less of a chore. The game also doesn't really penalize you if you're going super slow either, take your time and go to those gathering points, that's cool the story will progress when you want to (though I haven't waited too long to continue). Don't let the farming deter you from the game! The mechanics are great, the combat is great, the music is great!

My only qualm at the moment is actually with farming and trying to plant in straight lines. When using the controller the camera drifts ever so slightly making the rows uneven. Not game-breaking but definitely a little frustrating.

Previous review at 2.6 hours:
Sometimes pace seems a little slow in between stages, but the combat feels great and intuitive. The inclusion of the rice field also takes the attention from the hack-and-slash-esque combat (it's only kind of like it, you can't actually hack and slash your way through this game) and turns it toward a side job that increases your stats. Overall the game feels balanced thus far, and challenging content is there if you're looking for it.",1605046101,1605167992,True,6,1,0.583053529262542725,0,True,False,False

I was desperately waiting for it to come out after a consistent flood of roguelikes and uninspired “retro artstyle” from independent games, this seemed like a diamond in a rough.
After years upon years of waiting, all I can say is it was worth the wait!

There are many aspects to this game that surprised me, I thought I had a rough idea of what I was getting into, but that truly was only the surface. I will touch upon this later on but if you are looking for a chilled game, this probably is not quite it, you can certainly play it casually but the game is definitely demands micro management for success.

The main character Sakuna, is quite deceiving visually from a marketing perspective. This is no cute little girl, this is a grown goddess who loves getting wasted on booze, in a girl's body, she has one hell of an attitude, and her dialogue is genuinely humorous. She is spoiled as hell and is a pure love and hate character, although I get the feeling she is on a brilliant path to redemption. Surprisingly, the Story and the supporting characters in it are quite well written, are not something you have not seen before. Yet they are a somewhat brilliant composition, there is a nice range of different archetypes, the dialogue exchange between the MC and some of the supporting cast is fantastic. Even the interactions you see between the supporting characters themselves is genuinely entertaining.

Regarding the gameplay, which I will touch upon later, it’s split between combat/exploration and farming. You have to explore and fight the demons to earn vital resources that expire to keep food on your table, the story encourages you to explore, so there is absolutely reason to not just farm.

The farming is actually more in depth than I thought, I have completed a full cycle, and there is a surprising amount of depth if you want to strive for perfection. Bearing in mind the better your crops, the stronger Sakuna becomes, so you really do want to achieve the best result from the fruits of your labour. There are correct ways to plant, fertilize, maintain crops, and water levels etc. When it is finally time to reap the fruits of your labour you can let someone else do it or do the manual work yourself. However the manual work is almost zen-like and If you do it manually you have much more control over the yields, whether you want white or brown rice, and how husked you want it etc. There are a lot specific aspects to each stage of farming, so there's actual thought that needs to be given into what crops you want, and how you want to process them. There are also seasons in the game, which all require different aspects of farming. While this may potentially sound like a lot of work, and in a way it is, due to the nature of the seasons which are short lived (3 day cycles each), the balance of combat/exploration and farming is borderline masterfully done in my opinion.   The seasons do also influence the zones/areas you explore visually, which gives a nice sense of time flowing. 

In relation to the areas, there are what you could call Biomes, but every area seems to have it's on environmental quirks, regardless of the biome it is in. Some areas allow you to launch rocks at enemies, and even blocked areas to gain access, some areas let you bounce enemies off mushrooms, I appreciate the unique flavour of each area to try and keep the grind interesting. It may not be perfectly pulled off, but I appreciate the conscious effort and it is somewhat effective.  

The combat is great and allows a lot of room for creativity.  
All the combat interacts quite well with the aforementioned environmental quirks. 
The combat primarily focuses on light and heavy attacks, however there is a lot of depth despite that, with meter management, parries and so on. You have different attacks based on the direction you are inputting, up for example launches enemies, you can juggle, parry and grab onto enemies to either spina round them or launch them towards you. You can throw enemies into other enemies launch them in the air and send them down flying into other enemies and so on, the grapple mechanic really adds to the mobility of sakuna and the speed of the game. If you control your positioning you can setup some really good moments, all of this means that you are not encouraged to just mash. You think about the best ways to deal with what is in front of you, and occasionally be flashy for the sake of flashy.  While there is depth, it is however very accessible, nothing is technical to pull off and it comes together naturally, resulting in an almost DMC like feel in the form of a side scroller. 
Health stops regenerating after a certain amount of time, and you must return home and rest if you want to recover HP once it reaches the night. If you feel up to it you can risk fighting into the night, but the enemies see a big buff, so there is quite a big risk, the areas are also very dark. Also the resources you gain while fighting either goes to forging, farming or food you eat at the end of the day. Maintaining the correct food is quite essential, as the meals you eat can give you buffs. It is also very easy to farm for what you need exactly as each area gives you a list of all the resources you have found there and even leaves some things blank, letting you know you have not discovered everything. The food you find however spoils, you can preserve foods but even then they will not last that long. So you have to think about what items you want to farm and make sure your stock is constantly regulated.

At this point you probably have a sense of the micromanagement and might even feel overwhelmed, however, It really is not as bad as it sounds. Thanks to fantastic tutorials and the games helpful nature of letting you know where to find resources, everything is incredibly easy to keep on top of. If I was to be critical, the controls when farming could definitely be improved, you can not really keep a straight line or complete control of where you are planting things or ploughing the ground for example. Logically you would think the left stick would be mapped to up and down and the right stick to left and right to ensure you can keep a straight line, instead the controls are left stick to move Sakuna and right stick to control the camera. I’ve often struggled to keep my planting lines precise, the game does not really punish you too much, but this seems like an oversight, given the emphasise on spacing between your seeds. 

The music is serviceable, I do really like it, but it is nothing to write home about.

The graphics are what you would expect for a 2-man game, it's a passable generic art style that gets the job done. There is however one character that has their own artstyle and it is absolutely stunning, and somewhat makes me wish they had to budget to explore it further.

To summarise, the gameplay is fantastic, the characters and their interactions are brilliant, the story is oddly endearing, the loop between the almost zen line farming and combat/exploration is well thought out and there is a lot more depth than you might expect.

While other indie games have often faltered when trying to offer a unique spin such as running a shop where you sell what you find, Sakuna does not. 
Nothing in Sakuna is a gimmick or poorly thought out.
It is not flawless, and the pacing and loop could definitely be improved with a bigger budget, Sakuna 2 please. However, this is a brilliant game and deserves recognition for its achievement after being planted so long ago, there is nothing like Sakuna and it definitely deserves your time.",1605048624,1605126749,True,20,2,0.492781519889831543,4,True,False,False

For a sidescrolling beat-em-up, it's both too fast and also not fast enough, leading to combat that feels super clunky and the polar opposite of what a good action game should be.

The main character has basically two moves: she has a grappling hook that allows her to grab walls and swing past enemies to get to their backs, and then two attacks that take freaking FOREVER to come out. You hit the grappling button, swing behind the enemy, and in the time between when you press the button and when her attack goes off you could probably go to the kitchen, make a sandwich, eat the sandwich, make another sandwich, eat that one, and then when you get back maybe her attack has gone off.

I played up to the tutorial boss, which was.. not a fun experience. It wasn't hard - I barely took a hit. Instead, it was tedious as all get out. I'd grapple him only for him to jump halfway across the screen before I could get an attack off. The entire fight was spent running after him hoping an attack would land before he decides to jump away. It's like playing Hades only Zagreus has brain damage and has to stop for a few seconds after dashing because he gets confused. 

There's a directional thing for attacking, which is great because you can use it to do the only attack that is at all viable - the ""helm splitter"" downward air thrust. It's slightly less slow than the ""quick attack"" and does far more damage. 

Don't get me wrong, the game's not horrible - the graphics are actually pretty good for an indie title and the English voiceacting is passable if a little too Disgaea for my tastes, but it's just weighed down by that slow, clunky combat system.
