I can finally play the game I have missed out for so long...

You leave the vault to see the world after psychic wars as a veteran. If you get that reference then you listen to good shit. 

Simple story that gets you exploring the place and that is all I will say about the game since many play this but still is addicting with it almost coming out 15 years ago. Game of the Year edition is alot of fun with new things I can never get on my xbox so this is well worth the experience to feel fresh and new despite playing this already. Only issue I have is when you hear stuff on a PC, the audio goes all over the place from the left side to then the right side depending how you look around with the mouse. As well as the dialogue going very quiet when interacting with people, or it does that to my computer but only thing I hate about the game on my end.

That is all I will say but to know why this is one of the best video games of all time, you need to experience it yourself like we all have. Only way for you to love this like I have. If the audio issue on my PC are fixed or besides that, I give this a good recommendation...

FO3 also holds a dear place in my heart because I am very nostalgic for it.  I never got to play FO3 when it came  out, parents would've NEVER got it for me, nor would the PC run it back then.  Instead I was stuck watching walkthroughs back then, seeing how you could blow peoples heads off and I'm thinking ""Holy crap!  That's cool!"".  The story isn't anything to write home about, but the world, the atmosphere, the locations?  The DC Wasteland is the true main character of FO3.  The side quests are good too, good variety of weapons as well.  

I will say, the only reason you should buy NV and FO3 is to play the Tale of Two Wastelands mod.  It is the DEFINITIVE way to play FO3.  Combining all the updates to the game that NV brought to FO3 as well as being able to use NV mods within FO3 is a real sweet deal.

All I can say is play it before making a final judgement. From my personal first hand experience with Fallout 3, I was stunned by how good it is, and even that is an understatement. The first time playing it (in 2018 to add), I was hooked for hours and days on end like a Wastelander addicted to Chems, Fallout 3 is a game you can't live without. 
It left me wholely satisfied with my time and money invested, it gave me pure joy blasting Raider's and Super Mutant's heads off!
Provided below is an unbiased list of my pros and cons.

Pros
-There is a variety of unique characters, locations, and quests
-All official DLCs are whole other experiences in themselves
-Locations are well designed that offer a lot of fun in exploring everywhere
-Some really unique and qwerky characters wander the Capital Wastes that tease your intrigue
-There is a lot of freedom of choice, you can be the Hero of the wastes, a Cold-blooded Tyrant who everyone fears, or something in between, it all falls to you
-A nice variety of weapons
Cons
-It can randomly crash in-game sometimes if you play it for too long in one sitting
-Some guns and lasers can be a total pain when it comes to reloading, I suggest to time your reloading well
-There are no steam achievements which is a let down for me personally

Final Verdict 9/10
With a few minor issues aside, Fallout 3 will get you hooked for a good long time! It's worth playing and I recommend it to any Fallout fan!

It might take some getting used to especially for newcomers, but sticking it out is rewarding and can be fun after a while when you’ve gotten a good foothold with the right amount of resources you need to fare well against the bad elements and harsh environments (especially since repairing weapons is a necessity). 

From my understanding, this game is known for its bugs and hiccups. On my end, the game would crash at times (ran it on Windows 10 OS). Nevertheless, I was able to play through the entire game plus the DLCs with this being the only issue. Aside from that, there was also one side quest (Head of the State) that I ran problems with completing due to it having its own issues. The quest can be completed but I had to make use of a discussion thread which confirmed that it was indeed bugged.

The main story itself is fairly short, which makes the Broken Steel DLC included in the GOTY edition make the entire thing more satisfying to complete. Without it, the original ending feels anticlimactic. Fallout 3 is very open world which makes exploring fun as you get more experience and more used to the combat system. However, it can be somewhat confusing if you simply want to go straight for the main story since progressing isn’t simply going from Point A to Point B, what with the several areas of the DC ruins you have to explore both on the surface and underground (interconnected railway system) to reach your desired destinations.

What the game does completely right though is its apocalyptic atmosphere. I’ve come across discussions on how Fallout games have changed for every release and how well or badly it has captured this supposed dark or bleak feel/atmosphere that a post-apocalyptic world is supposed to possess. Fallout 3’s feels right to me. The places I’ve visited, the humans and non-humans I’ve encountered and interacted with, and the side quests and main story I’ve played through, captures the definition of a “post-apocalyptic wasteland” well.

Fallout 3 is worth purchasing only on sale, preferably the GOTY edition. With the DLC, there are hours more of content and equipment that can be accessed and different side stories to explore. Broken Steel is a definite must play while the rest are optional. The Pitt for its intriguing story with one of the more morally ambiguous choices to choose from, and the other three which are only mostly worth if for some loot or added world-building lore bits (Operation: Anchorage and Mothership: Zeta mostly for its items, and Point Lookout being the least significant one for me, especially as you enter the late stage of the game).",1706968308,1707641444,True,2,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

22370,50003555,76561198059803378,434,10,262,0,262,1706456939,"Abysmal writing, terrible gameplay, black and white morality, and severe lack of depth makes this into one of the weakest entries in the Fallout franchise. The story is awful and has almost no involvement from the player himself, since your dad is the actual protagonist of the game making all the decisions. Almost all characters are extremely one-dimensional and forgettable. Factions are also very one-dimensional, the BoS is presented as the Hollywood good guys trying to help everyone out while the Enclave are the generic bad guys. There's no nuance whatsoever.

Something that frustrates me about this game is the worldbuilding, or lack thereof. It's absolute garbage. Even basic things like how there are no farms, no trade routes, no explanations to how people get electricity, nothing. Why would they build a town around a f*cking nuke? I can understand religious fanatics doing that, but why are normal people going along with it despite perfectly understanding how utterly retarded that is? Two-century old food scavenged from a pre-war supermarket is still edible, and seems to be the main source of sustenance for people. The game feels like it takes place 20 years after the war, not 200. Why is the east coast so undeveloped after all this time? Fallout 1 is set about 84 years after the war and its world was leaps and bounds more developed than what we can see in Fallout 3, and then you look at Fallout 2 with places like Vault City and you can't help but be entirely confused at how everyone in FO3 is a scavenger living in absolute misery. Are the residents of D.C. just imbeciles? Where the hell is civilization? 

Still on the topic of worldbuilding, it's extremely disappointing to see just how creatively bankrupt Bethesda was when developing their take on the universe. Moving the setting to the east coast could have been one of the most interesting things about this game, but of course, it ended up being completely wasted potential. Bethesda does almost nothing to expand or advance the lore of the universe, and everything just feels stale, recycled, and uninspired as a result. [url=youtu.be/M8U4k2Ik6yk][u]This video[/u][/url] explains what I mean pretty well.

The game also holds your hand as much as it can, assuring that none of your actions can have any long-lasting consequences, which is one of the many things that make this game lack depth. I absolutely hate the concept of essential NPCs and quest markers. I'm not sure if Bethesda did this in an effort to appeal to its bottom-feeder fanbase or if it was because of sheer incompetence to develop an RPG. Probably a mixture of both. And holy f*ck, don't get me started on the wretched hellspawn that is the Gamebryo engine and Bethesda's ineptitude to optimize and work with it.

Credit where credit is due, though: the game has a pretty decent atmosphere. It's not hard to get lost in its world, since it has somewhat of a stark beauty to it (well, at least if you use mods to remove the disgusting puke-green filter). The sound design is also pretty nice for the most part (minus the guns, which sound like garbage), and I really like both the ambient tracks and the music selections on the radio. And, as much as I hate how the game holds the player's hand by leveling everything alongside them (ensuring that there is a very weak sense of progression throughout), I have to admit I really like the overall game world and design, and the game definitely rewards exploration. Also, and this is the best thing about Fallout 3 by far: New Vegas wouldn't exist without it. Of course, it's a double-edged sword since Obsidian was forced to use its god-awful engine to develop NV, but it's better to have a great game on a crappy engine than to not have that game at all. That's pretty much it, though.

Fallout 3 isn't the worst game ever made, nor is it the worst entry in the franchise (that title would probably go to Fallout 4. FO76 doesn't really count since it's just some worthless spin-off developed by a B-team with no effort put into it). I think it has some redeemable qualities like the game world and atmosphere, but I don't think those are nearly enough to make up for the great number of faults the game has. Overall, I think it fails as a shooter, as an RPG, and as a Fallout game. [b]4/10.[/b]",1554608867,1707199525,False,5,3,0.354833006858825684,4,True,False,False

The first main town to get to, is 1 of 15 different places within the first region. Not a good way to introduce people to the wastelands. There are multiple ways you can go right out of the bunker and most of them are pretty lethal, with you having minimal ammo. One of the biggest drawbacks to PC users is the simple fact that aiming seems to be pretty worthless for the PC version. On the Xbox version, it had an auto aim feature which was very accurate. On PC, the accuracy is TERRIBLE. I'll have a ghoul sighted 3 feet away on the cranium and STILL miss 3 times. With limited ammo, that is not acceptable. You can shoot a raider 9 times with a pistol, or rifle, and they will still charge you, while smacking them 3 times with a lead pipe somehow kills them. What kind of logic is that in a world with limited ammo... Compared to how this played on the Xbox, I can't recommend this to PC users. I quit on the Xbox when I got to a certain city where I glitched under the map and lost about an hours worth of save progress.

Set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland near Washington, D.C., now known as the Capital Wasteland, the game blends open-world exploration with a compelling narrative, set against the backdrop of a society struggling to rebuild. This review evaluates the Game of the Year Edition of ""Fallout 3"" based on its gameplay mechanics, story and character development, graphical and audio presentation, replayability, and overall entertainment value.

Gameplay Mechanics
Rating: 9/10 - Excellent
""Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition"" offers a vast, open-world experience combining first-person shooter elements with traditional RPG mechanics. The game's V.A.T.S. (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System) allows players to pause the action and target specific enemy body parts, adding a strategic layer to combat. The inclusion of all DLCs introduces new weapons, areas, and quests, significantly expanding the gameplay options and exploration potential. While the game mechanics are robust, some players may find the combat and movement slightly clunky by today's standards.

Story and Character Development
Rating: 9/10 - Excellent
The narrative of ""Fallout 3"" is engaging and immersive, with the player's journey beginning as they search for their father in the vast wasteland. The game's story is enriched by its well-developed characters and moral choices that impact the world and its inhabitants. The additional content from the DLCs further deepens the lore and player's understanding of the game's universe, offering new perspectives and challenges that enhance the main storyline.

Graphical and Audio Presentation
Rating: 8/10 - Very Good
At the time of its release, ""Fallout 3"" was praised for its atmospheric depiction of a post-nuclear war landscape, featuring dilapidated buildings, desolate landscapes, and a hauntingly beautiful sky. The Game of the Year Edition maintains these visuals while also introducing varied environments through its DLCs. The audio, from the eerie soundscapes to the iconic 1940s and 50s soundtrack, complements the game's setting perfectly. However, the graphics may appear dated to new players, with some textures and character models showing their age.

Replayability
Rating: 9/10 - Excellent
The sheer scale of ""Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition,"" combined with its branching narrative paths, multiple endings, and extensive side quests, ensures a high level of replayability. Each DLC pack offers unique stories and locations, encouraging players to explore every corner of the game's world. The variety of play styles supported, from stealth to brute force, allows for different approaches in subsequent playthroughs.

Overall Entertainment Value
Rating: 9/10 - Excellent
With its expansive world, deep narrative, and the addition of substantial DLC content, ""Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition"" provides exceptional entertainment value. It's a game that invites players to immerse themselves fully in its post-apocalyptic universe, offering dozens, if not hundreds, of hours of exploration, questing, and character development.

Overall Summary and Score
Overall Rating: 8.8/10 - Excellent
""Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition"" is a definitive version of one of the most iconic open-world RPGs, offering an unparalleled blend of storytelling, exploration, and player choice. Its impact on the genre and the enduring appeal of its wasteland setting make it a must-play title for fans of RPGs and post-apocalyptic narratives.

A all-time masterpiece and a must-play game for RPG enthusiasts and those seeking a rich, open-world experience with deep narrative layers and extensive content. ""Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition"" stands as a testament to Bethesda's ability to craft immersive worlds that captivate and engage players for countless hours.

""Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition"" remains a landmark in the RPG genre, offering a post-apocalyptic world that is as fascinating to explore as it is harrowing. Its blend of compelling storytelling, player-driven choices, and a vast, explorable world ensures its place in the annals of gaming history as a classic that continues to be celebrated and enjoyed by new and returning players alike.",1706983015,1706983015,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When I went into this, I expected to dislike it based on my initial impressions when trying to get the game to actually work. Once i had managed to get past that, however, I Truly managed to see what Fallout 3 is.

Mediocre

It's not a terrible game, and it's assuredly a Fallout game. Unlike 4, 3 feels right, and really conveys that post-apocalypse well. But It's sorely lacking in a few areas and it leaves a lot to be desired. Level design is mostly stagnant, and the metro system seems awesome at first but then quickly becomes exceptionally frustrating, your progress to other areas limited by arbitrary walls of rubble but yet somehow perfectly functioning underground tunnels. Characters are... a mixed bag. Autumn was extremelly shallow and underwhelming, but Eden was pretty interesting. Your Dad is a reasonably complex character, and people like Doctor Madison Li take away from the slew of side characters that make no impact.

The companion system is horrendous. There's no bonus to using a companion, as they burn through ammo, have ZERO death protection, get in the way constantly, have inconsistently tagged skills, and have almost no depth to them. There are almost zero companions that are actually interesting with a good story of ANY sort behind them, and Dogmeat is the most useless mutt i've ever met.

The main story is at first, exceptionally boring, but it does get better except right at the end where the game slaps you in the face with it's abysmal ending, and before Broken Steel the game flat-out REFUSED to let you make the smartest choice because ""you have to be a martyr for no reason other than story closure"". Side quests can be quite fun, such as the superhero quest, but some are extremelly tedious - like the Wasteland Survival Guide.

Combat is standard Bethesda-Fare Open-World combat, and it's of no suprise the best weapons are the ones that DON'T use ammo (Specifically the Shishkebab). Levelling is slow, but actually very well-paced. I Hit level 30 just before the end of the game, so in that sense, good job. The Karma system can take a hike, especially on morally ambiguous quests like Tenpenny Tower - where the best option has that god-damn radio announcer calling you a scumbag because it was ""the wrong thing"". The karma system would be less of a joke if it wasn't for the fact I could murder, steal, and pillage the ENTIRE of Rivet City, eating corpses, picking locks, hacking terminals, everything - and then just... donate a few caps to make myself a messiah again.

DLC-Wise, here's a quick rundown.

Operation Anchorage: Probably my favorite. Well-paced, self-contained, excellent and powerful rewards that are reasonably balanced by the repair system, decent story and never outstayed it's welcome.

Mothership Zeta: A little too bulky in places, almost felt padded at times, but otherwise was a refreshing change of pace. Self-Contained, fun and light-hearted story witha bunch of interesting and fun items.

The Pitt: Very mediocore until the very last choice of the DLC regarding the ""cure"", which goes down as the single most interesting and hard-to-make choice in the entire game. Otherwise, extremelly passable (although it does have some AWESOME weapons)

Point Lookout: If it wasn't for the disembodied brain, this would be a steaming pile of crap. Luckily for Point Lookout, the brain reminded me of Old World Blues from New Vegas. But yeah, don't waste your time.

Broken Steel: I'm a really big fan of the BoS. Seeing the story evolve past that travesty of an ending was really nice, and the stuff it added put a nice bit of flavor into the world. It wasn't amazing though.

The problem with Fallout 3 is that it's shockingly bland and safe, in a lot of ways. UNlike Vegas, which pushed the stories and quests to their limit, Fallout 3 carries a very strong ""meh"" vibe. IN Vegas, you could overlook the shoddy combat because of the awesome story. You could ovelook clumsy mechanics and bugs because of interesting characters and fascinating locales. In truth, Fallout 3's biggest crime is playing it safe.

When it tries, and it takes a risk, Fallout 3 can be really fun. When it doesn't, it's the gaming equivelant of white rice. Bland, filling, and overall - not very good.",1499401331,1706910001,False,1,0,0.480562984943389893,0,True,False,False

That said, I should definitely mention that the PC version here can seem to be hit or miss with some people depending on their system. I haven't had too many major problems, but its potential technical problems are definitely worth keeping mind, especially due to it being an open world Bethesda game. 

Actual Review:
I love the mood of Fallout 3 much more than that of Fallout: New Vegas. The dreary tones with a grayer palette overlaying desecrated major US landmarks create beautiful storytelling through simple visuals without the need to rely on dialogue or strong plot writing to substantiate it.

This mood is important because much of the writing--at least when moderately scrutinized--is too milquetoast to be compelling on its own.

Fallout 3 began Bethesda's reign over the Fallout franchise and saw it grow progressively more estranged from its satirical origins. While I haven't played much of Fallout 1 or 2 due to them lacking a user-friendly interface, I know enough of them to recognize the dark humor behind their writing which sought to emphasize the devastation of nuclear war while satirizing the pro-corporate and nationalistic culture which led to such an apocalypse.

By contrast, Fallout 3 feels like an opportunity for a fun power trip through a post-apocalypse which happens to contain some haunting visuals and some franchise-inherited social commentary. This might seem like a criticism, but it's actually the game's strongest suit and what makes it worth playing. 

Exploring the wasteland with the knowledge that you'll be able to handle almost whatever situation you come across with some classic radio music playing in the background is straightforwardly fun, which is an element the original two Fallouts comparatively struggle with--at least for most mainstream or modern players. Fallout 3 is able to combine that straightforward fun with the tragic yet sardonic tone that the Fallout series is built upon. It's a game whose gameplay doesn't get it in its own way.

That said, Fallout: New Vegas offers a vastly more interesting depiction of the wasteland with stronger roleplaying options which encourage more replays as compared to its predecessor. New Vegas is the better game in many ways, but the hard hitting mood feels more impactful in Fallout 3 thanks to 3's drearier setting and visuals.

The last thing to note is definitely the most important and the most open to debate as of recent years: Bethesda's writing ability.

I will play devil's advocate and say that Bethesda's writing is technically very strong, but only in that technical sense due to how it accomplishes its goal of being fun and player-empowering without offering much else. Its comparative shallowness (at least when compared to New Vegas) is a boon in some ways since it allows the player to pick and choose what they want to become involved with and shirk off anything that disinterests them due to no individual quest demanding it be treated like it's important through either its high quality of writing or requirement for main narrative completion (save for mainline quests, of course).

Disregarding that boon of encouraging player agency over their play experience, the Bethesda approach to writing has rightful received more scrutiny over the years and this game hasn't broken this highly-criticized mold in any major way. That said, if you can embrace a form of compelling storytelling that is based more on mood and atmosphere, Fallout 3 won't disappoint.

Recommendation:
This game receives a mild recommendation from me. Fallout: New Vegas is the better option in most ways and other open world games have learned from Fallout 3 and implemented both enrapturing atmospheres and interesting stories with accompanying solid gameplay. That said, Fallout 3 still retains a unique mood and feeling which many of these later games have not yet captured--not even the largely better New Vegas. It's a worthwhile Fallout game if only for a single playthrough. Newer Fallout fans seeking to check out older games in the franchise would be remiss to skip over this one due to accusations of lackluster writing. Those accusations aren't wholly wrong--the writing here can often tend toward being fairly milquetoast--but the comparatively better written Fallout 1 and 2 are less player friendly than this ps3/360 era rpg, so I would sooner recommend it over them. Ultimately, it probably won't keep you coming back the same way other Fallout games can, but the single playthrough it can offer is definitely worthwhile for those who are curious.",1706116712,1706116712,True,6,0,0.592592597007751465,0,True,False,False

to make a long story short: i decided to try out fnv and fo3. i gotta say... fo3 has been my absolute favorite. it was my introduction to the series, and it did not disappoint. loved the story line and loved the dlcs. i had to install a program to get it to run on my laptop but besides that, it has given me no issues. while there have been a handful of crashes due to mods and their process of elimination, the game runs beautifully and barely crashes, it does not give me any issues. i love the companions, love the atmosphere, and would definitely play it again and again. the dialogue is great as are the choices that form your personality and storyline. 10/10 game, i definitely recommend it!",1705963067,1705963067,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Stay away from the main quest line, once you are out in the waste just go the opposite way and explore.. The main quest is insane how short it is, I mean I thought I was holding off on it and doing a little bit at a time with some side quests
. But even then I still got to the end quick.

I also picked up most of the DLC ' radio transmitter quests' and did them early which although useful meant I leveled up very quick and I hit level 30 before even getting to  Broken Steel. And I played it on hard.. it wasn't hard at all.. Especially if you do the Alien Spaceship this gives you some pretty awesome weapons that beat most others.

I found the crafting disappointing compared to FO4 and NV. 

In some areas FO3 is a an open world FPS.. perfectly executed in others..it feels like a demo of what followed later.

If you are on PC, get the BethINI standalone tool that will sort your config out.

Also there are some worthwhile Mod Collections on Nexus. 

I have enjoyed the game not as much as FO4 or NV.. but I think I just peaked too soon.. but will remember that next time I play.",1705860435,1705860435,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's a ghoul who explicitly asks for human flesh, a request you can only refuse, despite the many gore bags around super mutant hideouts, and the cannibal perk you can acquire yourself. There's a woman who asks you -not- to free their enslaved son in another city for fear of repercussions. If you return to the son, there's no new dialogue options. There're kids who will run away if you call one of them a brat. Their mother will go drink at the bar; the kids will get captured by mercenaries. If you rescue them, nothing happens. Over and again, the wasteland presents organically unfolding stories that go nowhere.

I keep playing because the glimpses of what Fallout 3 could have been are mesmerising. There's a museum where the ""present"" exhibit is blocked off by rubble. Corpses and meth lie scattered around displays of technological wonder. There's a nuclear family that espouses democracy and voting, while cannibalising any foreigners who stumble onto their property. After helping a man out of a coma, you can tell him you merely wanted him conscious before killing him. People say Fallout 3 failed to capture the black humour of its predecessors, but it seems pretty wry to me.

The main story is dreadful, unfortunately. The factions involved in it have been thoroughly simplified from Fallout 1 and 2. For example, the Brotherhood of Steel were once a faction of tech-hoarding isolationists, driven by the belief that tech in the hands of the masses will end in bloodshed. In other words, they were reactionary, elitist, and self-serving. In Fallout 3, they're humanitarians, who serve to protect the masses. They're still elitists, but now technology is something to help others with, rather than to hide from others. It's just . . . far less interesting a take.",1705794307,1705811248,False,2,0,0.187631025910377502,0,True,False,False

I liked the Elder Scrolls series, but turning Fallout into a first-person 3D game sounded like it could end very poorly.  I still prefer the old isometric, turn-based games in many respects, but this turned out to be pretty fun.

If you're not into Bethesda's open world games, the writing and role-playing will likely seem shallow.  It recycles some plot elements of the older games, which is both good and not-so-good.  It's familiar and comforting to step into a world where so little has changed.  However, it's also kind of like reading fanfic written by someone who is worried that if they don't constantly rehash every major franchise element, people will hate their story.

The combat is fun.  There's a pseudo-turn-based mechanic called VATS, which is a nice bone to throw to us old-school fans.  Most of the game mechanics were also kept.  You've got your attributes, skills, perks, and so on.  It's a bit streamlined, but it's still recognizably Fallout.  Character creation itself is a bit long and involved due to it being a bit of a heavily scripted tutorial.  It leads you to the main quest, which is reasonably interesting, but in typical Bethesda style, it's totally optional to follow it.

The series' black humor is retained.  It's a lot wackier than the first game, but I kind of blame the second game for this tonal shift -- it was already starting to get a bit wacky back then.  Bethesda just ran with it and cranked it up a few notches higher.  If meeting someone named Dave who leads the Republic of Dave sounds amusing to you, you'll probably quite enjoy the humor.  I thought it was amusing.

If you like the Elder Scrolls series or the early Fallout games, it's worth checking out.  If you're coming here after playing a hardcore RPG, you may be disappointed.",1705383705,1705383705,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One of the primary villain groups, referred to as 'Raiders' in the game, are surrounded by mutilated bodies tied to beds, heads and bodies hung on hooks, or viscera scattered on the floor. A villain group called 'Super mutants' have gore bags containing mutilated body parts also in their occupied areas. A particularly unsettling villain group called 'Deathclaws' can elicit a traumatic gaming experience if one is not prepared.

The quests and locations is Fallout 3 present an amalgamation of good ideas from Science fiction, Futurism, and Post Apocalyptic books, film, and games. Concepts from sources like Logan's Run (Little Lamplight), The City and the Stars (Oasis), The Twilight Zone (Vault 112), are inspiration for memorable quests. Locations called 'Vaults' explore human experimentation, and the world map, set in Washington D.C in the USA, weaves in American history tidbits into the experience.

A rather clever gameplay mechanic called 'VATS', allows one to freeze time during an attack and display a Matrix (the film) style, slow motion, camera panning view of the attack you choose. Their are villainous gameplay elements, such as pickpocketing items from people, a ""perk"" that allows for cannibalism, a weapon and collar for enslavement, among others. There are also empathetic gameplay elements like escorting friends to safety, donation, and encouragement that provide small counterbalances to a very harsh game world.

Despite the extreme violence, the classic toys called 'Crash Dummies' are more reminiscent during gunplay, than say, a wartime torture film. The Crash Dummy toys, had buttons to eject the head and arms, and to eject the legs. The villain class known as 'Raiders' make for enjoyable Crash Dummies.

I have been waiting to buy this game on Steam for a while now, just didn't do it till now because of the bad reviews and everyone saying that the outdated Games for Windows stuff was making it unable to play the game. But the update they made in October 2021 finally got rid of it! And I played for an hour, I'm on Windows 10, i7 4790k, RTX 2060, 16 GB ram. It seems to be working fine and no real issues.

Pay no attention to the noobs that are still complaining and saying that it's STILL not even launching for them. I mean I really don't know what to tell ya, you're a noob. Try uninstalling, then reinstalling your game.

Anyway, still I wouldn't say it's the best game to play on Windows 10. still not optimized enough. I was Alt+Tabbing a few times to see something and game just got stuck with the sound still playing in the background, I couldn't go back into my game after I Alt+Tab'd out of it. So yeah...that's an issue that can happen sometimes...but what did you expect, it is a pretty old game, and Windows 10 or 11 is fairly new so there's bound to be some optimization issues. Just don't Alt+Tab I guess. If anyone knows a fix for this, let me know.

You loved both of them so much growing up, and now you're supposed to be seeing your father during visits, meeting at restaurants to talk, the such.

But when you get to the restaurant, when you get to the visit, he isn't there. He lied about meeting you there, and you and your brother bawl your eyes out. It puts a sense of longing in your life for someone you thought loved you, wondering why the only father you ever had would just abandon you.

And then you find a game about a character that's going through the same stuff you are. The main character is in a foreign world that they had never known, trying to find a dad that's been missing for an unknown amount of time. It brings you shelter.
It brings you comfort.

In a way, Fallout 3 could have been one of the sole reasons I got through those years. The sting of losing my father was horrible, and yes, I cried a lot when I realized he wasn't coming to meet us when he said he would. But seeing how the Fallout 3 main character could get through anything, even when he felt betrayed, lost, and forgotten by someone he just wanted to love, it made me strong enough to stand on my legs and be my own person.

Fallout 3 is the first installment of the series, reimagined in 3D by Bethesda. Although much different from its predecessors it still managed to get many fans. 

This one takes place mainly in the year 2277 in the Capital Wasteland. You grow up in Vault 101 raised by your father named James. One day for some reason he decides to leave the Vault and you behind, creating a big ruckus in the isolationist underground community. This forces you to also abandon the safe walls of the Vault and embark on a wild chase throughout the Wasteland in search of your dad. 
That’s all of your character’s established lore. The rest is up to you. Will you become the Wasteland’s messiah or its ruin? 
Main story is alright. The game is filled with quests and different stories for you to experience. Problems have many solutions. Reason with somebody or gun him down? Pickpocket the key item or get it off a corpse? Open a door by picking its lock or maybe by using a terminal? 
Quests offer moral choices which not always are simple and different endings award unique awards. Some side missions are better, some worse. 
The world has its highlights, but not every random shack found in the Wasteland is going to be equally interesting as is The Oasis or Tenpenny Tower. 
F3 vibe is different than the previous games. It seems far less serious and dark. I don’t know if it’s because of Bethesda’s new take on the game, tons of memes that I’ve seen in their engine or the fact that the NPCs look and behave in utterly goofy ahh way (like Sarah, the proud and upstanding brotherhood knight, gunning down this one unlucky merchant that just happened to be walking by during the Liberty Prime escort for no apparent reason). 

The biggest flaw of this game in my opinion is its terrible combat system. I’m not sure if they wanted the shooting to be more RPG like or whatever, but it just doesn’t work. Sure, this wasn’t supposed to be a shooter, but it became one anyway so why make it so bad? Your guns don’t shoot straight, sometimes they even straight up refuse to shoot even if you click the d.amn button. Opponents’ movements are either completely chaotic which sometimes defeats the point of even trying to aim or they just stand still waiting to get blasted (or for you to shoot and then they move away at the last moment). Later parts of the game, especially DLC content, becomes the real pain though. Enemies are bullet sponges. Try shooting this one high-level ghoul. Half the shots you are going to miss and the other half it will just absorb somehow. Sure, the iconic V.A.T.S. system makes a comeback, but you can’t use it all the time. 
The leveling system is very cool. After the initial distribution of SPECIAL points which establish your character’s main strengths and weaknesses, each level up lets you upgrade skills you want to invest in and pick a perk. All those things you can later use to solve problems and quests by playing to your strengths. Not good in a fight? Sneak past a guy or reason with him. 
One of the best things about modern Fallout games is the exploration and gathering junk. Learning what is valuable and worth taking and what is not. What will come in handy and what is worth selling for caps. Stuff you can find in various containers or just lying around. Actual locations are cool to explore and scavenge in, but after a while the environments start to feel very repetitive. DLC locations spice it up a little though. The only thing that was sort of annoying is trying to move around the actual city. It’s hard to get to some location on your own when you are constantly being blocked by some debris. Now [b]IF[/b] you figure out you have to use the metro system to get to some specific places you still must look at metro maps to not get lost. This normally wouldn’t be a problem, maybe a fun puzzle of sorts, if it wasn’t so different than the rest of the game when you just pick a direction and walk towards it. 
The additional content of this game is interesting and worth playing through at least for the new gear. Main game doesn’t really have a big selection of weaponry, there is only one actual shotgun really if you don’t count the sawed-off. But man, again, the amount of health enemies have in DLCs is just a step too much. It doesn’t make the game harder, I had like 300 stimpaks on a hotkey, but it just makes the game tiresome as hell. 

Music fits the vibe and it’s alright, although it kind of gets repetitive after a while. What is a lot better though are various radio stations you can listen to while exploring the Wasteland. Some real bangers out there. You can also listen to the good old Lady Agatha. 
Graphically the game did get quite old, but you can’t say it doesn’t have its unique aesthetic. The world is dirty, dark and full of junk (da.mn, that’s a nice rhyme). 

Fallout 3 started a new era for the franchise. It took a step towards a more modern approach. Was it a step in a good or bad direction? I don’t know, but it was sure in a different one. Although not the same as the older titles, it’s still unique and it’s still the good old Fallout universe which the game expands upon, even if it’s a bit less dark and serious.",1704385989,1704386342,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When you start out there are like no stimpaks or ammo but once you find them the game is really easy. Just don't go to old olney because there are deathclaws. Also good luck getting the game to work well. Its almost broken.

Tips: When you are 19 and the vault is mad at you in the start don't forget the baseball bat or stimpaks also lvl your explosives perk up so you can disarm the bomb in Megaton, so you could get a house. Don't go to superdupermart when you start cause it is kinda challenging. I would recommend going to galaxy news radio because the BOS help kill super mutants and you get hunting and assault rifle + ammo. 

Pros: The story is good and the game-play is relatively good. Vats feels great and the perks are good. I like the fps take on Fallout. People are interesting and the comedy is amazing as usual. Dialogue is by-far the biggest pro.

The doctor merchants never seem to have more than 10 stimpaks at a time making it a struggle to keep on top of damage. Also companions straight up dying was a BIG adjustment coming from NV and 4, it made certain companions (cough, Cross, cough) more of a hindrance in combat as you're just constantly loading quicksaves whenever they fall over. 

The story is good but the pacing is kinda strange, for example:
In one line you can convince Eden to k""ll himself, same with Autumn but he just leaves
The main quest is given such a sense of urgency that on your first playthrough you likely won't see much outside of the main quest and a few areas on the way between main quest areas
The ending feels kinda out of nowhere, you're looking through vault 87 and then boom you're talking to Robobama and the game is almost over :/
All the content in the main quest is fairly enjoyable but if you play the way the game wants you to, practically just bum rushing the main quest it's extremely shallow compared to all the content that the game offers.

Coming from the newer games it's definitely an odd experience, if you've ever gone back to an old console and just felt weird playing it's similar to that. Definitely similar to the console you love and probably an enjoyable experience but BE PREPARED FOR JANK and also a lack of polish compared to newer games.

Also IDK if it's just the steam port having issues but I had way more crashes and freezes in 3 than the other games, even more than NV and even the classic games whenever I tried running them.",1704187630,1704187630,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

not to mention they are charging this virtual paper weight for $20.00 also, so unless you have linux or a steam deck because the game runs with no problems but good luck trying to get this game running on todays modern windows without the use for mods or other programs unless you got windows 7 or 8? but from what i have herd microsoft are discontinuing those versions if they hadnt already.

but yeah bethesda should make this game freeware like they did to their older TES games on their website or actually go back and fix it instead of having the community do it for them because theres only so much people with the creation kit can do in comparrison to a whole studio backed up by a million dollar company can do.",1704066577,1704066677,False,1,0,0,1,True,False,False

I wish I had played this game first because it was such a unique experience. Even though Fallout being an impressive universe already, I felt like this game especially showed how F'ed up the world really is. It is an old game so there are some minor bugs and the graphics are not the best. You can't aim down sights with your weapons (Besides scoped one). But this game was more like a survival game. Generally speaking unless you are playing on a survival difficulty the FNV and F4 is relatively easy. This game was very hard at the start, I played on Hard difficulty from start to end (This game does not have a survival difficulty). Resources are scarce and weapons suck at first levels. You have to use everything you have accordingly, I never looked for beds to sleep this much in any of the Fallout games. World is fun to explore but the main quest was not the best, not at least towards the end. DLC's were not bad but a bit short. I recommend this game to everyone who loves the Fallout universe (BOS especially).

One the one hand, this is an at best tolerably written watered-down version of the Black Isle's Fallout universe, full of the worst of Bethesda's trademark tropes. Bland and rushed main story, critical lack of memorable quest-lines, locations, or characters, two out of the five DLCs absolutely awful, while the other three are alright at most. But the worst is, of course, the glaring black hole in place of the exquisite dark humor and post-apocalyptic fatalism that the Fallout universe (the most unique video game universe, in my opinion) was so good at.

On the other hand, this is one of the first [mature] games that I have played, way back in 2007 or 2008, and, what the heck, I absolutely loved it back then. Even today, I cannot be completely objective with Fallout 3 because it is full of nostalgia and childhood memories.

Furthermore, I see it as essentially a prequel (gameplay and worldbuilding wise, not story wise) to my absolute favorite Fallout New Vegas, which, I swear, becomes even more enjoyable if you first complete Fallout 3 and then move on to New Vegas.

It would be dishonest to give thumbs down to a game that I had so much fun with, BUT, let me be clear, it could have been so much better if not for the good-old ""Bethesda treatment."" But hey, at least the franchise is not dead. So, anyway, thanks, Todd!

Story: The story and role-playing options are abysmal. You are allowed to be good or evil, with no real depth to your choices. The dialogue options also feel extremely limiting for role-playing, so it's hard to be a different character than what was predetermined form the devs. You also can't greatly change the ending, which is and was a staple in most other Fallout games. Watch a video from Cretosis on YouTube as to why the story itself sucks, I agree with around 90% of his points.

Game-play:  The game play is janky, however, I think some things add to the fun of the game. The amount of variety in ways you can play (Not role-play) are really fun, you can pick between multiple different combat styles, how you dress up, different SPECIAL stats and perks, all the basic stuff like that is really fun. Even though the shooting isn't the best, I still think it's fun, especially since VATS really helps with this. The gore, gun sounds, all of it is really arcade-y but still suitable enough. It's not a hard game, but it sure is entertaining imo. I really like the act of finding and then completing quests, collecting, well, collectibles, etc., which is what Fallout 3 was designed to do, and does really well. Even though not every quest is perfect, I still think it's amusing.

Graphics: Horrible FOR THE TIME, which is important since it would be unfair to judge it's graphics to today's games.

Art direction+Atmosphere: Easily the best part of this game. The choices of both ambient and radio music to listen to while walking across the map IMMENSELY elevate the Fallout experience. That with the world design and art direction make the game good to look at. The green filter hurts the experience, but I feel like that's kind of the point, to make the world look like shit.

Overall, while the game on the surface should be absolutely horrible, it still manages to be FUN. Sometimes it's a fun bad, sometimes it's actually good, and sometimes it's just plain old stupid in a fun way. Overall, a 6.75/10",1703555414,1703555414,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Disliked: Since it's an older game, there is a few small issues I've noticed where the dialog does not change when they speak.

This review is mixed of retrospective and overall thought from me on Fallout 3.

Fallout 3... The first 3D Fallout that I experience back in 2014-ish. To be truth Fallout 3 was my first entry to this series. At first I thought Fallout game is ""Post Nuclear-Apocalypse RPG game"" but once I stepped in more into classic Fallout (after Fallout 3, I played Fallout 1 & 2) it felt like tonal shift of the ""Post Apocaypse"" stuff. Bethesda did a good job bringing this IP from dead as Bethesda bought Fallout IP when Black Isle studio went bankrupt (while also making Fallout 3 Van Buren). Fallout 3 expands Fallout lore into East Coast as most Interplay/Black Isle canon are taking place on West coast and mid west.

My steam playtime hour is not accurate as back then I played Fallout 3 on pirated copy before I bought one on Steam.

Let's take a dive on review shall we?

[h2]Setting:[/h2]
Fallout 3 sets in Capital Wasteland, once Washington DC that now ridden with Super Mutant and infested ghouls, FO3 differs in setting compared to previous where the story take place on West Coast. By making the story on new location, Bethesda can make the lore as much as they can while also give some reference on previous Fallout entry. In my opinion Fallout 3 did great job capturing the bleakness Post Apocalyptic of Capital Wasteland especially when you play it without companion. While on West Coast everyone is already on Post-Post-Apocalyptic world where society is formed and Nations shaping up, on here it feels like the bomb dropped several dozens year ago.

The faction also felt like more ""black and white"" compared to classic Fallout where some Faction are more well written and morally ambiguous. In Fallout 3 you can summarise faction like ""Enclave bad, BoS good, Super Mutant dumb"" that feels really 2 dimensional meanwhile on classic Fallout, BoS is xenophobic faction that would not even share their stuff with towner or wastelander around them, NCR which developed from being band of raiders group into Nation, Enclave which motivated by pursuing Old World America by seeking Old World tech from Vault Tec (hence why they seek Vault 13 inhabitant and your tribal village Arroyo [b]not making everyone become miserable[/b] like on Fallout 3), Inter-state caravan link and much more. Honestly I'm not annoyed on the scope of Fallout 3 but on the whole view of Fallout lore, it bits irk of me.

The DLC portion is interesting.
(a) Point Lookout give us a view of what Southern looks like, the swampy world make the exploration bit interesting but the inhabitant are bullet spongy.
(b) Ops. Anchorage gives you VR mission that gave very overpowered equipment from get go.
(c) The Pitt. the more I see it more it looks like Dead Money of New Vegas but not so ""Dead Money"". The Industrial landscape is step up of the setting which inline with established lore.
(d) Mothersip Zeta... everytime I played Fallout 3, I never tried this DLC.

[h2]Story:[/h2]
You need to find your dad, and your dad want to help everyone, so you help everyone and then died. Suddenly you wake up because DLC installed.

Lone Wanderer felt like to take picnic trip to Southern, ended up getting violated by random Ferryboat captain, and for some reason you get a little bit of ""espionage"" mission and random ghoul want revenge for what happend centuries ago.

Lone Wanderer stumbled upon random Outcast BoS, decided to take a play on them, and raided their bunker.

Lone Wanderer going north but only to find they get enslaved. In process making revolt against the faction in control and free the slave in the Pitt.

I do not know Mothersip Zeta.

[h2]Gameplay:[/h2]
For me the character building seems overpowered, this even more apparent when all DLC installed where each DLC adds +5 level cap (so in tally it is 50), another one is the perk system where you would get perk each time you leveled up. Perhaps this decision to make Fallout 3 more ""console friendly"" as previously Fallout is exlusive for PC.

Combat system also differ from previous fallout where you have Damage Threshold (DT) and Damage Resistance (DR) stats, somehow dumbed down than previous games.

While on classic Fallout you can approach (almost) every quest with every possible character build, in this one is bit limited.

Companion on this game require karma check for you to recruit them.

[h2]Graphics:[/h2]
The Graphics holds up perhaps due to the color selection and filter (back in this era games notoriously have those ""Color Palette"" as the game identity.

I cannot say if you think the game graphics is bad if you're coming from modern spoiled gamers who starts playing from 2010s era.

[h2]Control Design:[/h2]
Control layout holds up pretty well although some movement can be a bit buggy. If you want to play Fallout 3 you can just skip base game and use TTW to get better support of New Vegas engine fixes, and mod support.

[h2]Difficulty:[/h2]
I can say the Difficulty is pretty fair on early to mid game, but once you understand the game mechanics, the combat can be pretty ""trivial"" if you can cheese encounters.

Perk system and leveling is butchered in this game.

[h2]Personal Note:[/h2]
I recommend Fallout 3 in sense if you want to understand what happend on East Coast. However as every classic Fallout fans pointing out, Bethesda Fallout games are breaking some established lore.

In case you want to play Fallout 3 in Definitive way, get New Vegas too and install TTW. You can thank me later.

Cons: The maps are not designed to be viewed at maximum settings, and visually retain a sense of smallness characterized by landscapes with no aesthetic organization. If you walk through a well designed park, one see views that open and close. Fallout 4 has this characteristic, while Fallout 3 does not. In other words, there are no grand vistas, just many small experiences, many small views. This is probably due to the limitations of graphics at the time of creation.

[h2]Introduction:[/h2]
Fallout 3, developed by Bethesda Game Studios, stands as a landmark in the realm of open-world RPGs, transporting players to a desolate, post-apocalyptic wasteland filled with danger, intrigue, and moral ambiguity. Released in 2008, the game has endured as a classic, setting the bar for narrative depth, player agency, and atmospheric storytelling in the gaming industry.

[h2]Immersive World and Atmospheric Design:[/h2]
Fallout 3 introduces players to the Capital Wasteland, a sprawling, irradiated landscape that teems with both despair and hidden wonders. The game's atmospheric design is a testament to Bethesda's attention to detail, capturing the eerie beauty of decay. From iconic locations like the dilapidated ruins of Washington, D.C., to the irradiated glow of the landscape at sunset, every visual element contributes to the immersive world-building.

[h2]Narrative Depth and Player Agency:[/h2]
At the heart of Fallout 3 lies a narrative of personal discovery and moral complexity. The protagonist's journey, from emerging in Vault 101 to navigating the harsh realities of the wasteland, is a captivating odyssey. The game's commitment to player agency allows for a variety of choices, shaping the narrative and leading to multiple endings. The moral dilemmas presented force players to confront the consequences of their actions, adding layers of depth to the storytelling.

[h2]Memorable Characters and Factions:[/h2]
Fallout 3 introduces a cast of memorable characters, each with their own stories, motivations, and quirks. From the mysterious Three Dog, the charismatic radio DJ, to companions like Fawkes and Dogmeat, the wasteland is populated with personalities that leave a lasting impression. The inclusion of distinct factions, such as the Brotherhood of Steel and the Enclave, adds political intrigue and dynamic conflicts to the narrative.

[h2]Open-World Exploration and Discovery:[/h2]
The vastness of the Capital Wasteland invites players to embark on a journey of exploration and discovery. Abandoned buildings, hidden bunkers, and underground vaults hold secrets and lore, rewarding those who venture off the beaten path. The sense of freedom to chart one's course through the wasteland fosters a connection between the player and the game world, creating a truly open-ended and non-linear experience.

[h2]S.P.E.C.I.A.L. System and Character Progression:[/h2]
Fallout 3's character progression is rooted in the iconic S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system, allowing players to customize their skills and attributes. The choices made during character creation and level-up decisions significantly impact gameplay, fostering a sense of individuality and strategy. The variety of perks and abilities ensures that each playthrough can offer a distinct and tailored experience.

[h2]Dynamic Combat and V.A.T.S. System:[/h2]
The real-time combat in Fallout 3 is complemented by the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (V.A.T.S.), adding a strategic layer to engagements. Players can pause the action, target specific body parts, and unleash a barrage of calculated attacks. The balance between real-time and turn-based combat allows for dynamic and satisfying encounters, catering to different playstyles.

[h2]Sound Design and Iconic Music:[/h2]
Fallout 3's sound design contributes significantly to its immersive atmosphere. The ambient sounds of the wasteland, from distant gunfire to the howling wind, enhance the sense of desolation. The inclusion of iconic '40s and '50s music on the in-game radio stations, including tracks like ""I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire"" and ""Butcher Pete,"" adds a layer of nostalgic charm to the post-apocalyptic setting.

[h2]Technical Stability and Performance:[/h2]
While Fallout 3 has faced technical issues, especially upon its initial release, subsequent updates and patches have improved stability. The community's dedication to modding has also played a role in addressing performance concerns and enhancing the overall experience. Despite these challenges, the game's enduring popularity attests to its capacity to captivate players.

[h2]Legacy and Lasting Impact:[/h2]
Fallout 3's legacy extends beyond its initial release, influencing the design and narrative approach of subsequent open-world RPGs. Its success paved the way for the revitalization of the Fallout franchise and solidified Bethesda's reputation as a powerhouse in the genre. The game's enduring popularity and critical acclaim underscore its lasting impact on the gaming landscape.

[h2]Conclusion:[/h2]
Fallout 3 stands as a masterpiece in the open-world RPG genre, seamlessly blending narrative depth, player agency, and atmospheric design. Bethesda's commitment to crafting a rich, immersive world has resulted in a game that transcends its post-apocalyptic setting, leaving an indelible mark on the gaming industry. A decade after its release, Fallout 3 remains a shining example of storytelling and world-building in video games, inviting new generations of players to explore the unforgiving beauty of the Capital Wasteland.",1701012139,1701012268,True,1,0,0.488047808408737183,0,True,False,False

I still have the physical PC release from the day, but i bought it on Steam too so i can play it with Proton on Linux. It hasn't aged that well, it does show its age, but it can still be an enjoyable open world RPG. Do i recommend it? Yes and no. If you haven't played Fallout 4, definitely get 4 instead. If you have played 4, i don't think you will be missing much if you skip 3, it doesn't have an essential story or anything like that. Get this only if you like the franchice, have already played 4 and/or New Vegas, and would like to play a new game in the franchise, knowing that it has older gunplay and graphics and lacks some features from the sequels.

The writing, often hailed as a strong suit of the Fallout series, disappoints with a lackluster narrative and unengaging dialogue. Traversing the vast open world feels tedious and empty, lacking the immersive qualities seen in contemporaneous titles.

The gunplay, a pivotal element in any FPS game, is subpar, leaving players frustrated with clunky mechanics and unsatisfying combat encounters. Comparatively, Dead Space, released in the same year, showcases superior shooting mechanics, dismemberment that incorporates itself into the gameplay, and stunning graphics that immerse players in its haunting atmosphere.

Final Fantasy XIII, while a different genre, introduces the paradigm shift mechanic, showcasing innovative gameplay. While Fallout 3 struggles with antiquated combat, FF13's dynamic system offers a refreshing and strategic approach to battles, highlighting the stark contrast in game design evolution during that era.

Looking at other contemporaneous releases like MGS4 and Mass Effect, Fallout 3's shortcomings become even more apparent. Both games offer superior narrative depth, engaging gameplay mechanics, and graphical prowess, making Fallout 3 feel like a relic of its time.

In hindsight, Fallout 3 struggles to hold up against its peers and has been overshadowed by titles that have aged far more gracefully. While nostalgia may cast a favorable light on this title, objectively assessing it alongside its 2008 counterparts reveals a game that falls short in the face of evolving industry standards.",1699778020,1699778020,False,0,0,0.479041904211044312,0,True,False,False

Unlike previous titles in the series, you play the game from a first-person perspective (or an ""over-the-shoulder"" third-person perspective once you complete the tutorial).  Your early life in Vault 101 acts as a tutorial and character creator, as you configure attributes using the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system (Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck).  You also learn how to use your Pip-Boy 3000.

Finally, you come of age and emerge from Vault 101 into the Capital Wasteland where your adventure begins.  Lots of quests and many, many side quests later (this is a Bethesda game, remember), you will achieve your goals.

The survival mechanics are alright, but they aren't enough to keep me playing. The gunplay is serviceable. The real shining beacon of a Fallout game, the quests, barely exist.

There's very little connective tissue to keep you wandering the empty space of the world, and as a result, the entire game feels empty. In a word, boring.

Also, there are some issues getting it running on Steam. Once I got my mods together it worked perfectly fine, though (or at least, fine enough for a Bethesda game).",1699559172,1699559172,False,3,0,0.520249903202056885,0,True,False,False

[h2] Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5) [/h2]



Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition is an absolute must-play if you're a fan of post-apocalyptic role-playing games. This game takes you on an unforgettable journey through the ruins of Washington D.C. and showcases why the Fallout series is hailed as one of the best in the genre.

The open-world environment of Fallout 3 is truly a masterpiece. The attention to detail in every nook and cranny is astonishing, and exploring different locations never fails to be exciting. From abandoned subway tunnels to crumbling buildings, every area has a unique story to tell, making the wasteland feel alive and immersive.

The story is gripping and full of twists and turns. As the Lone Wanderer, your quest to find your missing father leads to uncovering a larger conspiracy that threatens the very existence of humanity. The choices you make can have lasting consequences, affecting the inhabitants of the wasteland and shaping the outcome of the game.

The gameplay mechanics are perfect for both newcomers and veterans of the series. The VATS system, which allows you to target specific body parts in combat, adds a tactical element to battles. Whether I chose to engage in intense firefights or stealthily take out enemies, the gameplay was always satisfying.

The Game of the Year Edition includes all the additional DLCs, which further enhance the gameplay experience. The extra missions, weapons, and armor provide more variety and extend the content, ensuring that you'll be engaged for countless hours.

Graphically, Fallout 3 may not match the standards of today's games, but the art style and the overall atmosphere make up for it. The desolate wasteland, accompanied by its eerie soundtrack, creates a sense of despair and survival that perfectly fits the post-apocalyptic theme.

Furthermore, the community's support and modding capabilities have allowed the game to age like fine wine.

now graphics...they take some time to get used to, and you might have to turn off some effect that just cause screen tearing, it does take some time to get used to.

we also seem to be experimenting some techmological differences!!! the game crashes quite often, but it seems to be related to specifics active quest though(dont through mines inside merestis station the game will crash), Bethesda should address bugs such at these and even release a patch for the sake of optimizing this game for modern machines.

seriously , this game is awesome, even with all the stuff I mentioned, it terms of story, and setting, I do like it better than FO4, like holy crap the yao guai and the deathclaw are actually scary here! I do wish many of the features found in FO4 were present in FO3 though, like how every piece of trash have its use, or how the power armor is represented, and the legendary weapons.

it is one of the best games Bethesda has produced, and it looks like they simply abandoned it? polishing the graphics a bit, and optimization would go a long way to revive this classic. yeah sure, there are modders who have taken it upon themselves to fix it, but this game deserves better from its creators.

Some of that is because of the technology of the time, but most of it still revolves around Bethesda's poor writing and baffling design decisions. The intro is very good and the world design is mostly compelling. There are few moments in gaming that equal stepping out of the vault for the first time and seeing DC in the distance. Yet that's also immediately where the problems start. Combat in this game is awful. The concept of VATS is brilliant and was a great bridge between the older games and the new ones, but it's also basically easy mode and not so much a tactical option the way it should have been. There's surprisingly little content in the vanilla game compared to the Elder Scrolls series despite similar dev times and so much of what is there alternates between bad and silly. Did they really think things like collecting bottle caps for a lady in a shack was compelling content? There are a few great quests and some of the DLC is very good, but mostly it feels like filler. The main story is fun to go through and the ending is iconic, but it's also one of the worst overall storylines in gaming if you even have a middle school level grasp of science. You don't need a magical fusion machine to clean water of radioactivity, you just need a few feet of dirt. That and it's not likely there would still be radiation like that in the area after all that time in the way they portray it. I'm not looking for ultra realism, but I am looking for something of the most basic quality and intelligence. I got the game at release and despite what Steam shows, I have probably three full playthroughs of this game. One vanilla, and a couple with all the DLC. I admit that on release, this would have probably gotten a positive review from me, but time and experience have soured me on just how small and badly done this game was and is today. If you're a fan of the IP then yeah it's probably worth a few bucks with all the DLC, but I could never be convinced this is a great game.",1698767659,1698767659,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I may be biased with my review because I have so many memories with this game but I must say I've never been let down whenever I played Fallout 3, this game has new surprises for me on every playthrough and if you get bored of the base game + dlcs there are always tons of mods on nexus mods too

I first played Fallout 3 14-15 years ago when I was between 10-11 years old the hours on my steam account don't do it justice, I've played this game for far more time than my review shows back then I had no steam account. I purchased the game again back in 2022 after I played Fallout New Vegas many times, I wanted to revisit FO3 and what do you know? The 24 year old me in 2022 had the same feeling the 10/11 year old me had back in 2008/09 when leaving the doors of Vault 101 for the first time. The very first view of The Capital Wasteland was astonishingly breathtaking.

Since 2022 I played FO3 3 times already and this is my 4th playthrough in progress and I'm still uncovering secrets, it's a huge world with a lot of secrets and you have a lot of things to do below is just a few of them

[list]
    [*]Trade
    [*]Explore
    [*]Build an arsenal of weapons such as Energy Weapons, Explosives, Assault Rifles, Shotguns, Sniper Rfiles, Miniguns
    [*]Power Armors
    [*]Quests
    [*]Collectibles
    [*] etc...
[/list]

Now you may ask me which is the better game between 3 and New Vegas? They're both different games despite what people may tell you I have a combined hour count of 450+ for both games and believe me when I say that they're both amazing games

Don't listen to elitists and fanboys they're just salty, you can like and enjoy both games at the same time there is no need for stupid competition, they're both masterpieces, flawed but masterpieces nonetheless

Get both games and enjoy them both.
One more important note, the steam version Fallout 3 GOTY has several issues because of stupid Bethesda patches, but there are community guides that fix the game (It's worth it).

I'm not really sure what to say. It's a lot of mediocrity and even outright bad decisions involving actual role-playing that completely brings you out of the experience sometimes. combat is outright and objectively bad so I went with crit vats because I'm not that much of a masochist (yet). Exploring is fun when it doesn't involve navigating DC. Characters aren't really memorable, I care more about the vaults in this game than people. Liberty Prime is awesome and will always be awesome. If it's your first time I would tell you to play through vanilla FO3 as intended instead of downloading TTW (as it changes certain mechanics and restores a lot of cut content). That being said this game let's you be a real piece of work right at the very beginning, so if you wanna be a very mean mean guy you might have a good time.",1698520905,1698520905,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I re-downloaded the whole thing and no surprise it didn't work. Plus most online tips are the same lazy generic 2000-ish copy paste compatibility and driver bs that does nothing on it's own.

BUT:
After some poking around I found a tip that the Fallout.ini in documents\my games\fallout 3 may be or is broken and if replaced with renamed Fallout_default.ini from steam\steamapps\common\fallout 3 goty and setting the Fallout.exe to run in compatibility mode for Win Vista SP2 it could work. AND IT DID WORK! Now the game runs. At least for me.

BROKEN AUDIO:
Sametimes the game stops or from the start won't play some sounds like reloads or footsteps. These are directed to the center speaker so you need a 2.1 (or more) capable speakers. W11 is very good at detecting what you use like basic headphones or speakers and sets them to 2.0. I haven't found a way to change that setting like the old sound cards could. Only option is the software simulated surround sound but those suck.

Now to get mods running:
The base game has been patched to 1704 which removed GFWL but added some new encryption or something. W/e. It broke mods. Most importantly FOSE which needs 1703 to run. Now there is a a Fallout Anniversary Patcher mod that downgrades the exe to 03 but I had no luck with it as FOSE didn't recognised the patched exe.
BUT!
I found a video on YT: watch?v=1CwW03B8Mr8&ab_channel=StayRetro (MVP!) This guy uploaded the original 1703 exe so if ""FAP"" ain't doin' it fo' ya' get those! FOSE will also want to be ran as admin. It's a Vista thing. It'll tell you if you forget.
Now the not-so-fun part. Mix mods to make the game not look like a smeared poop while having it run at least semi-stable.
Good luck.

My history with this game was interesting, as New Vegas was my first Fallout game and after loving that, I got this game and was a little disappointed by it at first. In comparison to NV, I didn't like how the metro tunnels were the main way to travel around the city, the repair skill being tied to weapon degradation, is logical to me now but back then I was so used to the streamlined nature of NV. But playing through it recently to get the platinum made me appreciate it more. 

To start with the good, the story while straight forward is very enjoyable to play through, with Liam Neeson voicing your characters father to add that extra zing. The go where you want, do whatever you want mentality from Bethesda works well here, as you have a vast world to explore and fantastic side characters to meet along the way! The side quests are where the game shines, as that is really where the roleplaying aspect comes in (something Bethesda would sadly slowly move away from), as you can be good or evil, it really is up to you! The combat is basic but I don't really play these types of games for super-smooth combat, rather for satisfying roleplaying gameplay. VATS helps a lot in combat though as using it to blow enemies limbs off never gets old! Overall this game is a good balance of streamlined RPG mechanics but still feeling like a good roleplaying experience compared to later entries in this series. 

As for the bad: the main story while enjoyable is very black & white and is probably the most linear aspect of this game. While there are multiple ways to approach and end side quests, the main questline forces you to be the good guy and doesn't allow for any real choice and consequence. The Brotherhood of Steel are the good guys and the Enclave are the bad guys, that's it, you have no say in the matter. The open endness of this game also works against it sometimes, as in my original playthrough, while I was exploring the wastes, I found an area where one of the later main quests takes place, I entered and ended up starting the main questline there essentially, missing out on some of the earlier main missions (and their achievements). The game is also very buggy, especially on PS3, where you will run into multiple crashes and bugs the more you play. My copy of the game is pretty much broken as no matter what I do (uninstalling the game, starting a new game, deleting my save data etc..) I can't play the game at all for 2 minutes without it crashing completely. I had to end up borrowing a friends copy of the game so that I could continue to pursue the platinum. Also, the other main issue, is how OP your character can get; from having more skill points whenever you level up (in comparison to NV); the ability to increase those skill points to over 20 and the fact that you can get a perk point every level, makes your character really overpowered and playing a specialised role difficult. I understand Bethesda wants you to be able to be a jack of all trades in their games, but I personally prefer a system where I have to make tough choices when building my character, which gives the game more replay value in my opinion. The Karama system is also weak as no matter how evil you be, you can always fix it by giving water bottles to hobos in the wasteland. Overall, though despite my gripes this is still a solid entry in the fallout series and I can definitely recommend it to fans; just be aware of buggy performance going in.",1696262047,1696262047,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But Fallout 3 has some great moments, even if the story is somewhat lacking and there's not enough side quests. The biggest difference between this, and the original Fallout games (and New Vegas) to me is that choices in this game are pretty obviously good/evil, there's no morally ""grey"" choices (even one of the DLC, The Pitt, which advertised itself as a return to morally grey choices, really ends with a choice between freedom and chaos versus tyranny and order, which is pretty common video game theme).

That first step out of the vault is really something and still holds up today, the tutorial is neat (but tedious on a second play-through). The game looks its age of almost 15 years old, but because the wasteland is supposed to be desolate, it's not too bad, really. Exploring the desolated Washington DC area and sneaking through ruined metro stations to get around to see some devastated landmarks is really cool. 

The DLC is... fine. I had never bothered with it before and had to force myself to do it this time, and it was enjoyable but nothing special. But the game itself is fun, even if the gun play outside of VATS is basic (VATS is still cool though), and at high levels the enemies have a tedious amount of health. 

But man, some of those side quests and levels are still a lot of fun. And the most iconic quest ([spoiler]nuking Megaton[/spoiler]) is a top-ten evil play-through moment in ANY game. It's good to see the American dream of [spoiler]being such a NIMBY that you need to get rid of an entire settlement of people just because it ruins your view of the post-apocalyptic wasteland[/spoiler]is still alive and well.

I run at a higher difficulty and I play as a woman instead of a man, kinda interesting since it gives you different dialog options and such.

Yes, it may have not aged as great as New Vegas, such as having a lack of side quests, a rather polarizing plot, or not having refined the mechanics yet (its the first 3D Fallout, i mean). It's also glitchier than New Vegas, and may or may not even run on modern systems.

But this game feels very... humanitarian in a way.

Yes, the world is ruined, there are still sketchy people around, slavery is somehow back (it never left, unfortunately) and people that will outright kill you, but the main objective is finding your father, then choosing to purify the entire water supply of the Capital Wasteland (or not). I don't know, this game kind of gives me hope in humanity the same way Half-Life 2 does, maybe i am too emotional.

The atmosphere is amazing, while the Mojave Wasteland feels like a very glamourized view of the post-apocalypse, the Capital Wasteland feels so depressing, while also giving you that sensation of dread and fear, which kind of adds to the humanitarian touch of it, because the people there are still living or trying to, and it's rather beautiful. 

I feel like out of all DLCs, Mothership Zeta is the best one, as i wasn't too fond of Point Lookout and The Pitt. They were okay. Broken Steel is a nice welcome given how the vanilla sequence goes.

Maybe i am too biased, as i first played this in 2013, and i sucked at it, honestly, then i truly beat it at 2016, and it was fun. It was also my first Fallout game, maybe that explains it.

Revisiting it in 2022, i re-bought it in December at a somehow rather low point of my life, and i felt really happy playing it, to the point the radio songs feel so awfully nostalgic.

It's just amazing how much detail went into creating Washington D.C. and the surrounding areas. Granted, the terrain and scaling may not be realistic, but as far as the cities, buildings, and monuments it's nearly identical. On another note, I've enjoyed the fact that the npc's / ai are fully voiced and actually talk to you compared to a wall of text (example: Morrowind). Story wise (as an alternate history / timeline, that's set in the future), it's very enjoyable and immersive. Because of this, you'll feel like you're actually there. As such, be prepared to easily lose track of time and spend 50 if not 100+ hrs in-game.

Epitome of the Western RPG

Have not found a way to get this stable at 120FPS, but very stable at 60FPS with the use of mods.

Otherwise however, a good game, i just cant give it an honest thumbs-up in this day and age, maybe when it was released it worked fine, but just not now. 
HOWEVER, with mods as i stated, its awesome, like any of the fallout games, mods in the community are your best friend. Mods not only make the game actually playable, but wayyyy cooler.
Highly recommend getting the game cheaper if you can find it for less. but its fairly cheep and good otherwise

That alone warrants a negative review in my opinion.  This game is worth playing but the only real way to play it without a huge headache is through the TTW mod for New Vegas, it makes it stable and brings a bunch of much needed changes and features from NV.

Once you get into the actual game it's a pretty mixed bag.  There's so much about this game that clashes itself and contradicts itself.  It takes place 200 years after the nukes drops but it feels and looks like only a few decades have passed.  The atmosphere is probably the most praised thing about this game, and I do think it's really good but it doesn't feel earned by the game.  So many of the game's problems would be fixed if it took place sooner to the nukes, and it would actually make the atmosphere fit well.

The main story and quest line is horrible and by far the worst in the series.  The intro is slow, boring, and really accomplishes nothing.  The ending is even worse and insultingly stupid in my opinion.  They then locked the real ending behind a dlc.  It's astonishing they got away with this with so little controversy, if Fallout 4 did something like that you'd never hear the end of it.  The middle chunk of the main quest doesn't get nearly as bad but also isn't interesting, nor does it do anything special.  The Broken Steel stuff is mainly just combat but the quests are slightly more interesting than the base game ones, still nothing great.  There's only 1 ending for the game, 2 if you're being generous so there's really no replay value as far as the main quest is concerned.  You also never really feel like the main character but more like an apprentice to James and the Brotherhood.

The side content is the best part of the game, and from what I understand, is the reason Fallout 3 fans love the game.  There is actually quite a lot of interesting side content, most notably Harold's quest, which is probably the best and deepest in storytelling in the whole game.  A good chunk of the side quests are pretty generic but overall unoffensive.  I'll lump in the dlc here and say that the Pitt is the only good one.  Mothership Zeta and Operation Anchorage are terrible given this games combat (Anchorage might be bearable in TTW with NV's iron sights).  Point Lookout is fine but pretty generic and nothing special, I really don't get why people praise this dlc so much.  Broken Steel is also fine but it's a scam that it's a dlc in the first place. 

Another thing about the side content is that the poor world design really clashes with it.  The best content in the game is super easy to miss, and most people will never see it in their first, and likely only, playthrough.

My last big gripe is the rp opportunities.  Your story is set in stone and is very boring.  You can either be a saint or cartoonishly evil, with not much in between.  There's really not much room to make a morally grey character, which is one of the most interesting ways to play rpgs in my opinion. 

I have huge issues with the factions as well but this review is already unnecessarily long.",1693445449,1693445449,False,3,1,0.501452624797821045,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)

Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition (GOTY) stands as a testament to timeless gaming experiences. As a longtime fan of the Fallout series, I was absolutely blown away by the immersive world, captivating storytelling, and endless exploration this game offers.

The desolate wasteland of post-apocalyptic Washington, D.C. is beautifully crafted, showcasing a hauntingly gorgeous blend of destruction and rebirth. The attention to detail is astonishing, from the crumbling ruins of iconic landmarks to the eerie, irradiated landscapes that beg to be explored. Each location tells its own tragic story, painting a vivid picture of the world before and after the nuclear devastation.

One of the game's strongest suits is its narrative depth. From the moment you emerge from Vault 101 into the unforgiving wasteland, you're thrown into a whirlwind of personal discovery and moral choices. The characters you encounter are memorable, each with their own unique stories, motives, and flaws. The choices you make ripple through the wasteland, affecting the world and its inhabitants in profound ways. Whether you choose to be a selfless savior or a ruthless mercenary, every decision feels impactful.

The inclusion of all the expansion packs in the Game of the Year Edition adds tremendous value to the experience. Broken Steel, Operation: Anchorage, The Pitt, Point Lookout, and Mothership Zeta each bring new areas to explore, quests to complete, and challenges to overcome. These expansions seamlessly integrate with the base game, enriching the overall narrative and providing hours of additional gameplay.

The gameplay mechanics strike a balance between role-playing and action, allowing you to tailor your character's skills, attributes, and playstyle. The V.A.T.S. system, which lets you target specific body parts in a turn-based manner, adds a strategic layer to the combat and gives you a cinematic view of your actions. Whether you prefer engaging in intense firefights or negotiating your way through conflicts, Fallout 3 caters to a variety of playstyles.

While Fallout 3: GOTY is a masterpiece, it's not without its quirks. Some technical issues and occasional crashes can disrupt the experience, but the sheer brilliance of the game overshadows these minor hiccups.

In conclusion, Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition remains a crowning achievement in the world of gaming. Its rich storytelling, immersive world, and endless opportunities for exploration make it an essential addition to any gamer's library. Whether you're a fan of RPGs, post-apocalyptic settings, or simply outstanding storytelling, this game is an absolute must-play.",1692999053,1692999053,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Id say this game (or fallout franchise in general) attracts a certain type of players. I am that type of person, and i really like the game, and franchise. But since it has problems with Win 7 and up, I say be careful... Know what you are getting, but its not as bad as it sounds!

Mine somehow freeze randomly occasionally, sometimes within the first minute, sometimes I can play 2-3 hours with no problem, only to ALT+TAB and try to come back a bit later I often find it frozen. So DO NOT ALT+TAB, and SAVE as you do things, and you should be fine. 
MY Rig is madly fast, so even if it crashes, i can load the game back within seconds.
Also, I have NO MODS installed. I haven't checked all anti-crash etc mods, but the less mods, the more stable the game in my opinion.

I made some INI file edits, the game seems slightly more stable but you can never be so sure, it crashes and alt+tab freezes seemingly randomly... Random crashes are actually both bad and good. they are good because once it crashes somewhere, you can re-start from your last save and its very rare to crash at the same place... During my entire play-thru there were maybe 2-3 constant crash areas (1 major unavoidable location is when you go to Adams Airforce Base). After 5-6 reload from the last save, i passed them thru. Just be sure to not knock of objects. I think they tend to confuse the game engine time to time.

I already managed to get GNR and Rivet city and Pinkerton for Moira's quest And I only had maximum 10 crashes. Heck I was playing this game on Win 7 since mid 2014 not knowing it was not supporting win 7. I thought all of my console commands, long playtime, etc bugged the game, Id make myself as big as possible and try to walk across the waste without falling and dying :D

Such a bummer! I still remember it like it was yesterday, as my young son (who sat through most of the game while I played it) and I just stared at the screen in shock and horror.  

Well thankfully, those days are long gone, and since the advent of Broken Steel, that atrocious ending is no longer an issue.  Now we can just concentrate on the game as it was first designed, and it was a beauty.  Although I am still partial to FNV as the #1 Fallout game, Fallout 3 does not rank all that far behind.  There are loads of quests, places to explore, decisions to make, and beasties to kill, to keep you occupied for hundreds of hours. And with the addition of Broken Steel, the level cap got jacked up to 30, making the experience even better and longer lasting.  

Not to say that F3 is a perfect game.  It does have some shortfalls that were greatly improved in FNV.  The biggest for me is the economy.   Quite frankly, though you can make a ton of money if you set your mind to it, there is simply nothing worth buying.  All those thousand of caps are mostly used simply to keep stocked up on ammo, stimpaks and drugs.  There are no elaborate, super expensive weapons such as you can save up for in FNV.  The merchants just carry the same old gear and weapons, which you really don't need, since you can get all you need from drops.  

The Main Quest line is also a bit too linear in F3, particularly as compared to FNV.  Without giving anything away as spoilers, your basic choice is to be evil or good.  There are no factions per se in F3, not like there is in FNV, only your karma as either a goodie two-shoes, a neutral onlooker, or an evil psychopath,and everything plays off of that.  Once you choose the Karma path you are going to take, the Main Quest just falls into place.   This is not to say that the game doesn't have depth. As I said earlier, you can spend dozens, if not hundreds of hours exploring the depth of this game, and you still may find something you'd never discovered before on your next playthrough.

[b]Important note[/b]
 
For some reason the game crashes on my solid state drive, but not on my hard drive.  


[u][b]What liked about the game[/b][/u]
[list] 
[*]	I loved exploring the Capital Wasteland. I really like the retro-futuristic look. I enjoyed seeing all the robots, nuclear powered cars, power-armor and etc. Throughout the game you will be exploring abandoned Factories, military bases, hotels, museums and etc.  There are so many places to visit and secrets to find. I really enjoyed finding and reading notes, emails, and also listening to recordings.

[*]	The combat is a lot of fun. I like how you can turn enemies into big chunks of gore. The Vats system is a nice addition when in combat.

[*]	A nice selection of weapons. I really like the Davy Crockett inspired nuke launcher. 

[*]	I enjoyed the story for what it was. The main story quest has some really cool memorable moments. Fallout 3 has some awesome side-quests like Oasis, The Superhuman Gambit, Blood ties, and the Wasteland Survival Guide. 

[*]	The game has some really cool enemies, like the Deathclaws.

[*]	 I love the games 1950s sci-fi references, for example, the Protectron being based off Robby the robot from Forbidden planet or the Mirelurk king being based of The Creature from the Black Lagoon.

[*]	Brilliant soundtrack.  When I’m exploring the wasteland, I will play Galaxy News Radio in the background.

[*]	I like the games leveling-up and perk system. The game has some really cool perks, like Bloody Mess, Mysterious stranger, and Animal Friend.  

[*]	I like that you can own a property and also customize it. I also think it’s really cool that you can make weapons out of junk. 

[*]	Fallout 3 also has some kickass DLC, like Point Lookout and The Pitt. 

[u][b]What I disliked or was disappointed with[/b][/u] 

[*]	Fallout 3 is very rough around the edges. You will find textures missing, objects clipping through each other, Galaxy news reporting news that hasn’t happened. 

[*]	The main quest line is a bit short. The game could have done with a few more side-quests, especially ones tailored for evil players. 

[*]	I feel that some parts of fallout 3 could have done with a bit more content, like energy weapons, workbench, dialogue and etc. It’s also a shame that unique weapons look the same as the normal versions. 
[/list]
[u][b]Conclusion[/b][/u]
 
In my opinion, Bethesda has done a fantastic job making the third Fallout game into a 1st/3rd person shooter. Unfortunately I could never get into Fallout 1 and 2, because I am not a big fan of turn-base games.  I really enjoyed exploring the retro-futuristic wasteland and the combat is a lot of fun. It’s a shame that some people to this day are still having trouble getting this game working and like I said before the game is very rough around the edges. If you enjoy games like Borderlands, Mad Max or Rage, then I highly recommend you buy this game.

22370,66394866,76561198115760834,95,10,5639,0,5639,1692292205,"I recently revisited this game after a few years. I originally gave a negative review, mainly because I thought that it was an okay game but overrated. I decided to give it another chance and came to the conclusion that it's worse than I remember in many aspects. My main gripes are with the gameplay, the main story, and atmosphere.

The gunplay is way worse than I remembered. Massive, uncontrollable spread and little to no feedback on hits makes shooting feel impotent. I can't count the number of times that I line up the sights (metaphorically, since there is no aim down sights) at an enemy at medium range, only to see the bullets miss by a few feet. Very unsatisfying, save the occasions in which the enemy gibs.

The story is pretty simple and lacks meaningful choice and nuance. Without spoiling anything, the main story only really comes down to doing helpful thing to wasteland or doing harmful thing to wasteland. All other choices essentially lead to the same outcome. I'm not complaining that there are multiple ways of completing the main quests, more that a lot of the choices are framed in a way that it makes you think you're making a difference, when in reality, you aren’t, and the outcome is the same.

Finally, I'm not a fan of the game's atmosphere. A lot of the locations of the game just seem contrived. They have no reason exist and are just there for the sake of ""wouldn't it be cool/funny if..."". As such, the outlandish premise of many of the locations seems to matter more than their believability. I don't mind that a place has an unusual premise, but it would be for the place to also be somewhat grounded in reality. This is more of an opinion, but it's just too wacky and zany for what I'd like to see in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. 

I also think its bad for more reasons than I have already listed, but I am not trying to write a massive analytic essay, just my main issues.

If you like the game, more power to you, but I think the game has some big, objective flaws that shouldn't be overlooked and shouldn't deserve apologetics to explain them away.

Bethesda's reputation as a studio was at an all-time high when this game was released, in 2008. Allowing players to roam through the desolate Capital Wasteland as I crafted my own personal story as the Lone Wanderer, In the Wastes.  Many places in this game were some of my favorite locations to venture to like Agatha's House, bringing her a lost violin. Big Town battling Super Mutants. Megaton disarming the Nuke and making the town Safe from the snobs of Tenpenny Tower. 
Other than those main locations Downtown DC is my favorite as a History buff protecting the Declaration of Independence is a vital important part as to why this game will always have a special place in my heart.

At first, you need to follow instructions so your new PC can be reformatted to be able to play this game. I had to spend 30 minutes or so to figure out how to prevent game from unable to start turns out to be a PC compatibility issue because of my PC. After starting this game, I had lots of fun. I was able to enjoy a story rich and rewarding tale of playing as a hero (although in real life, heroes obviously are extremely rare if non-existent). This game offers tons of hours of endgame grind after you finish main story. I figured out some tricks after using console commands to maximize building people. To play as a hero after finishing the entire story line(fictional), you can use wemod and i would for example:
 1. reward good NPC's with Essential NPC console command setting making them unkillable/invincible in a fight so they always kill bad guy, note when they get catastrophic 1 hit killed then the npc set to essential cannot die and just pass out and wake up a few seconds later :D, this is done indefinitely. Essential characters never die. NEVER! :D  
2. Do the many dozens of repeatable quests and random encounters... 
3. Sell many millions of items to shop for free which means basically handing them billions of worth of coin... this can be done by console command player.additem ___ __ __ (for cheat commands check online, this HELPS! I actually heard the character(a kid) actually bought/ordered fresh carrots that I sold to the food vendor for caps when I was walking by food vendor, since the food vendor does not have fresh carrots for sale in stock it had to be mine. Also I sold the millions of food for free and the price went down. Note you can get up to 2billion of each item by using console command. also note player.additem 0000000F 2000000000 will give you 2billion coin after you press the ~ / ` key.
 4. you can use console commands and basically play as a super good guy and help everyone and kill evil characters like Mr. Burke and Allistair Pennyton etc... repetitively by summoning copies of them and then kill them for positive karma... those 2 baddies tried to get me to nuke a town of good decent folk just because they were in a high tower and did not want to see the poor town of Megaton in their view. So I sent those nuke hungry baddies to the underworld. 
5. You can gear up your companions etc and make copies of your companions.. I had summoned Fawkes and had 2 Fawkes following me and fighting enemies for a bit(not sure if this gets buggy)... I assume if you can summon more than 2... Also, I have always been doing positive karma stuff... lol I decided to reward myself and typed rewardKarma 800000000 and I got 800 million karma... no joke... the limit is 1k but
6. i think it records above 1k karma since I reverse pocketed NPCs and lost karma and my karma was still maxed out. Also reverse pocketing allows you to equip any NPC with the most powerful gear obtainable in game that is not DLC, 
7. just use console commands to obtain 2billion of each of the best armors and weapons and food that is not DLC (DLC gear is better but not accessible by console commands at least I haven't figured out how) and go on a free give away. All NPCs including you can carry a little over 2b max copies of every single item except unique items and go on a massive giveaway! (You can do it! go go go....)
8. DLC's give best gear... and are fun... also, you can summon respawnable NPC's like Wasteland Scavengers, Wasteland Doctors, Brotherhood of Steel Paladins, Knights and initiates etc... (non-named NPCs and named as well but summoning copies of unique named NPCs are buggy maybe(?) ) and reverse pocket them to equip them with tons of goodies...
9. You lose karma for giving away free items by reverse pocketing! However! It's worth it! Why?! Build a better world! The NPC's who are green/allied with you and do not like you reverse-pickpocketing them still get to use it to fight super mutant monsters and all the baddies! so make a difference! you will feel great!
10. The world gets more 'damaged' the more evil choices you make. the world in your game gets more healed(literally) the more good choices you make, One simple example is: if you decide to bomb Megaton, the people will be cursed and turned into ghouls/monsters and hunt you and spread damage and chaos. if you fix bomb and disarm it, you get a house and people can get more resources and share. Also another example of how choices matter: if you choose the best ending in final quest, the world gets purified water! if you choose worst choice, the virus kills the world's many remaining human citizens! A simple logic is this: if you kill good karma NPC's, they die and are no longer able to contribute to help each other. Be a goodie! NOTE: You can become friendly with every base/encampment/city that is not EVIL and help them and you will make your Fallout 3 world better. Smile for your reborn new baby picture! :D
11. the world is affected by your choices, there are about 100 or more non-main story like side 
missions/quests and probably some hundreds of different things you can do in this game... also.. make your daddy the doctor proud! Revelation 21:6!! Also, the characters seem like living breathing believable real guys! its great! also some intense action scenes.. HINT: USE WeMod  + CONSOLE COMMANDS and MAX OUT YOUR CHEATS TO DO THINGS I SAY HERE SINCE YOU CANNOT GET 2BILLION RARE PURE WATERS/ANTI-RADIATION MUSHROOMS ETC... IN A LIFE TIME! SO USE CHEATS IF YOU WANNA GET RICH QUICK TO GIVE AWAY BILLIONS OF CAPS WORTH OF STUFF TO SHARE WITH THE OTHER NPCS! Some NPCs are good but broke and almost penniless! Some NPCs are lost kids! Some NPCs are slaves! So set the poor and lost souls FREE! Give to the poor! And drink free purified water of life!!!! :D
12. You can also put items in containers in NPC's with good karma houses/interior buildings. This will most likely allow them to have more resources to survive and do deals. Also make sure your 4 wasteland merchants that you invested in to are SetEssential  __ 1 (set to invincible mode) so you can always have your 4 traders never die. Also you can summon/spawn protectors/doctors on the wasteland out of thin air (console commands check online search Fallout 3 Console commands cheats, you can max out all skills, special stats, get all non-DLC/Storyline perks and boy those perks are well over 20 of them its good) 
13. Again, choices matter. Every word matters. The general rule of thumb for the optimal world outcome is this: Be kind hearted, soft hearted, helpful, but do not show mercy to evil(like Mr. Burke and Allistair and monsters  and evil aliens (no joke, DLC you can get alien gun after escaping prison in alien shapce ship prison cell and escape back to Earth) etc. Just keep the commandments, also do not steal! Reverse pickpocketing is ok. ANOTHER TIP: BE CAREFUL HOW YOU SAVE! If you save a file or 2 or 3 or so and delete every previous saves and all those saves you made a CRITICAL ERROR/or something that damages the world a lot, you can't go back!!! Example: choose worst ending and all saves are after worst ending!BAD!
14. I rate this game as Infinite stars/ 5 stars. THIS IS THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE SO FAR IN MY 25~ YEARS OF GAMING(STARTING ABOUT 25~ YEARS AGO). IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A FUN TIME BEING A GOOD GUY, USE CHEATS! MAX OUT ALL STATS GET BILLIONS OF CAPS/COINS AND SAVE LIVES! WHY STEAL WHEN YOU CAN MOD!! (NOT CHEAT!) (WEMOD! SEARCH WEMOD, THE BEST THING EVER.  LITERALLY. AND I am building the imaginary Fallout 3 world better and better. Please give this game at least 5 stars out of 5 stars. GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO!!!!!
NOTE: IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO PLAY AS GOOD GUY SINCE IF YOU PLAY AS EVIL CHARACTER , (REMINDER AGAIN), KARMA TENDS TO BITE YOU BACK AND THE WORLD GETS MORE MESSED UP AND IT JUST GETS DEPRESSING.

When playing on PC, if the game doesn't launch when you press Play, type ""graphics settings"" in your search bar on Windows, and add Fallout 3 as well as the Fallout 3 Launcher to the program list. Then change them to high performance, then it should launch. When modding, I highly recommend Mod Organizer 2. Install the Anniversary Patcher. Make sure you make the MO2 instance portable so you can add this command in the Fallout 3 launch options on Steam:

""<path to MO2 here>\ModOrganizer.exe"" ""moshortcut://:Fallout 3"" %command%

With this command, you will be able to launch Fallout 3 via steam but the game will still start on MO2, meaning that you can both play with mods as well as have your playtime recorded. In that part that says <path to MO2 here>, just copy the path from wherever you MO2 is installed. It's installed on my D drive which is not the default location so I didn't put my path.

Likely because when I did play this originally oh so many years ago, Windows Live or whatever it was called caused so many issues and I used mods and tweaks  which clearly messed up the hours played.  I do know I beat the main story + the anchorage DLC. Nothing else though at the time.

Most recently I installed Fallout: Tale Of Two Wastelands, so played through the entire story, a lot of side quests and 4/5 DLC (need to do zeta still) in about 42 hours. What an amazing experience. Loved nearly every second. Being able to play it in the New Vegas engine also helped with a lot of the issues I had way back when. Now  I am in the mojave , but since Benny stole all my stuff (mod) I might need to save up to buy a ticket back to DC where I still had some goodies stashed away in my house at megaton. 

Main Story - Awesome. Enjoyed it plenty. The ending wasn't what I expected. To the point that this time around I didn't even realise I beat it until I finished Broken Steel. 

Broken Steel - Favourite DLC by far.  Like I said I hadn't even realized it wasn't part of the main story and that I finished the main story at the purifier.  The ending was epic as well. Excited to play it again at some point in the future when I try hardcore.,

The Pitt - Eh. Not too bad.. Was kind of weird and I wasn't inclined to do extras, just the main. 

Operation Anchorage - Was fun to power through just blasting some commies. Getting some awesome loot at the end.  Nothing special though.

Point Lookout - haha this was a weird one too but in a good way. From the inbred looking dudes who I never came around to finding more about to the ghoul vs brain fight which was funny.  I enjoyed this one more than the previous 2.

Now that I’ve played the Interplay Fallout games as well, it’s impressive how this manages to translate the feel of those games into a 3D, first person style. The world is massive, especially for the time, though unfortunately a lot of it feels empty - which does fit for a nuclear wasteland, but isn’t great to play. The gunplay is really not great (you can’t even aim down the sights on most guns) but it’s serviceable, and I feel like the quests and exploration are the main appeal here, and they’re great! This is a classic RPG, super influential to the series and, despite these caveats, I recommend it. Especially now it’s excised the tumour that is Games for Windows Live.

[b]ADDED [08/02/23]:[/b] [i]IF YOU HAVE NOT BOUGHT NEW VEGAS, COMPLETE THIS GAME FIRST AND THEN NEW VEGAS! I've seen many people say that playing Fallout 3 before New Vegas made them appreciate both games more.[/i]

Just like Fallout New Vegas minus a few features and some different tweaks to the game. [i]A lot of things are the same, but a lot of things are different. If you've played New Vegas, you'll be aware of how different the game's mechanics are is from the jump.[/i]

[b]EDITED [08/02/23]:[/b] For example, you can't make Stimpaks or drugs at Chemistry stations. The workbench is different (can't recycle stuff/craft bullets/etc.) It's a weapons only crafting bench [i](you can only craft certain special weapons here)[/i]. The story of the game is different, but the mechanics are still there. [i]It does connect to New Vegas' story, and if you play Fallout 4, you'll see some references to some of the people in this story. Different perks/skills than F:NV. Compared to New Vegas, there aren't as many secrets to look around for, nor does this game have the amount of missions that New Vegas has. The karma system is vastly different here, and it affects the companions you travel with. You don't have reputations from factions, but you do have karma based on what you do. Some companions will only travel with you if you have negative karma and vice versa.[/i]

Still a good game, though. I know some of these reviewers have had issues with crashing, which put me off of the game for a while (because what if it just crashed after I bought it? There's no purpose there.) But, it hasn't crashed on me once, so I don't know what the difference is there. A good buy. I like it. [i]I know Fallout 3 and NV have issues with crashing, but both of them behave fairly well for me.[/i]

[b]ADDED [08/02/23]:[/b] [i]For New Vegas, which is very prone to crashing like Fallout 3 is, I run it under Viva New Vegas modifications. The same modders who put that together also have something that combines Fallout 3 and NV called Tale of Two Wastelands! They also have made a Skyrim mod set and a Fallout 4 moderation set. Moderation in the Fallout community is HUGE. If it doesn't work for you, please go hunting for some mods to increase the quality and try those out before you refund this game. Same goes for NV. These modders often have very active Discord servers and simply require a crash log to tell you what happened with your game.[/i]

[b]ADDED [09/19/22]:[/b] Another thing I forgot to mention! Steam DOES NOT have achievements for this game. This is kind of a bummer, but it's okay. It wasn't a deal-breaker for me personally, but I do know people love achievements. 

[b]ADDED [09/21/22]:[/b] If you complete the the downloadable content that adds The Pitt to the game, you get access to a way to craft more ammo, so not all is lost, I guess.",1663621631,1691034508,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

However, the main issue is the green tint that is EVERYWHERE(it gets really annoying after like 10 minutes), also I don't like the way you have to mod it. Modding it requires you to get patches and other things just to be able to actually put mods onto it(annoying process). Oh boy, the mods actually suck. All of them are different, and not just for what they do, it's the way you activate them. Some just take a simple put it into this folder, and some take a whole list of instructions, also you may have to get other mods to make those mods work. It really sucks because you then have to get the load order correct. What I believe they should do(even though they would never do this) is they should just add a workshop. The workshop can provide content and other things to make the game better(Like getting rid of the green tint(And even NSFW things)). But they won't do this the game is so old that Bethesda won't even look at it. Overall Good, but modding SUCKS",1691028861,1691028861,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Initially, it was frustrating to play due to my limited knowledge of the RPG genre and the buggy nature of Bethesda's engine. However, mods often helped improve the overall experience.

Despite the bugs that could potentially hinder the gameplay, it doesn't change the fact that Fallout 3 is an amazing game, contrary to what some people may say.

The game offers a completely open world that rewards exploration with items and encounters with interesting characters throughout the Wasteland. There are numerous fascinating stories to uncover if you take the time to thoroughly explore the locations. Most importantly, the path you choose and the decisions you make in the Wasteland significantly impact your experience.

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.

I guess I'll bury my love for yet another venerable gaming franchise in the same shallow grave I've been using to dispose of Electronic Arts' innumerable victims."" As gamers, we expect the worst because that's what we've been conditioned to expect. But every so often, we're wrong, and a new developer/publisher violently disgorges from their money-stuffed orifices a glittering gem rather than a reeking turd. Fallout 3 might look a bit like a turd (no one's going to be winning any awards for graphical fidelity here), but the joy to be found in exploring its countless nooks and crannies remains very real, even in 2023.

After the mandatory intro cinematic, during which Ron Perlman once again growls his way through a ""War... war never changes!"" monologue, you're introduced to the sphincter-clenching horrors of first-person childbirth. Worse, you're forced to listen to Liam Neeson's profoundly disturbing performance as your father. I've played this game several times since it was first released, and every time I'm compelled to listen to Neeson dribble his way through ""Hey there, little guy! I'm your Daddy!"", it makes me want to hurt myself. However, it's a necessary evil as during these birth/childhood/adolescence montages you create your character, selecting from a limited variety of unattractive faces and hilariously bad hairstyles, assigning your SPECIAL attributes (Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck), picking three favoured skills (anything from energy weapons to hacking computer terminals), after which you're shown how to use a weapon.

All of this takes place inside a Vault-Tec nuclear fallout shelter, or 'vault' as they're commonly known. Safe from the predations of raiders, feral ghouls, slavers, mutated wildlife, and supermutants, you grow to adulthood in blissful ignorance of the numberless horrors that await you in... the Capital Wasteland. Until one day, when you wake up to discover the entire vault has gone insane and your dear old dad has done a runner. (That's some stellar parenting there, Neeson, you deadbeat.) Anyway, after a bit of radroach murdering, police brutality at the hands of vault security, sneaking, thieving, and an awkward conversation with the Vault Overseer's daughter, Amala, during which you essentially say, ""Your father is a horrible fascist, and I'm leaving you here to deal with the blood-soaked aftermath of the collapse of his tyrannical regime!"", you leg it to the exit and emerge into the radioactive glare of Washington DC circa 2277. And Christ on a bike, has this place seen better days, or what?!

No, really, both graphically and given you're dealing with the aftermath of global nuclear war, the whole place looks... bad. First, the snot-green filter Bethesda smeared across the proceedings like a fistful of Vaseline -- it's not a good look. I get they were going for post-apocalyptic ruin with a dash of atmosphere-clogging radioactive fallout, but all it really does is make the game look like someone's been messing with the RGB slider. Everything looks dreary and oppressive. DO. NOT. LIKE. You will get used to it and it doesn't detract from the gameplay, but the colour palette is nowhere near as vibrant as either New Vegas or Fallout 4.

The wasteland itself, with its shattered houses, burned-out cars, stagnant pools of noxious water, and charred and blackened trees, still holds up fairly well considering the game was released in 2008. As you might expect, there are some fairly primitive 3D models and some of the textures look as though someone has up-ended a bowl of porridge all over your screen, but taken as a whole the game won't make your eyes bleed or induce nausea and vomiting. (Although, you may want to tweak the HDR lighting and bloom settings because it likes to stab you in the corneas during sunrise and sunset, and whenever you use the torch on your Pip-Boy.) Temper your expectations. You're dealing with an old-timer here, and back in his day there was none of that new-fangled graphical wizardry with which you kids are so enamoured. Ray-tracing? Hahahahaha... get out of here.

Right, so you're out of the vault and off you trudge to look for your absentee parent. First stop; Megaton -- a rickety settlement erected around a live nuclear bomb because, you know, who needs scenic coastal views when you could instead live with the ever-present risk of being vapourised whenever someone sneezes.  It's here the game opens up and allows you to go wherever you like, whenever you like, interacting with whomever you like along the way. There are some introductory quests to pick up as a way of easing you into the core gameplay loop, but you're largely left to your own devices. Which is as it should be because if Bethesda do anything well (apart from hilarious physics glitches), it's environmental storytelling.

The Capital Wasteland is vast and fairly teeming with caves, ruins, bunkers, settlements, abandoned factories and ghoul-infested subway tunnels. There's always somewhere new to explore and something interesting to find. You'll encounter hastily-scrawled notes from long-dead residents, dust-covered terminals detailing secret military projects and shocking corporate malfeasance, and grisly scenes illustrated only through the use of props -- the skeletons of children in the ruins of Springdale Elementary, or a family who sat down to breakfast seconds before the atomic shockwave stripped the flesh from their bones. The world of Fallout might be full of robot butlers and retro-futuristic satire, but it's also a relentlessly bleak and often cruel place. (And genuinely unnerving. Stay away from the Dunwich Building. You have been warned.)

If you're used to the fast, responsive combat of Fallout 4, brace yourself for some clunky old-world jank. No iron sights for you, young man, although VATS does freeze enemies completely while you line up a shot, which is something Fallout 4 ""improved"". Enemies will explode into red mist and juicy gobbets of viscera when you drop the hammer, and all your favourites are here -- powerfists, supersledges, lasers, plasmas, missile launchers, flamers, a host of ballistic weapons, and of course the trusty Fatman for when a scorched earth policy is the order of the day. Also, power armour... but you need a special perk in order to use it.

Speaking of perks, whenever you level up you earn a perk and a bunch of skill points. The higher your intelligence score, the more skill points you'll have to distribute each time you gain a level, so if you're going to favour any of your SPECIAL attributes from the beginning, make it intelligence. Because this is the GOTY version of Fallout 3 which includes all of the DLC, your level caps out at 30. You will likely hit the level cap long before you exhaust everything on offer here. From memory, I completed three of the DLCs and about half of the main quest line prior to hitting the cap, and I still had vast swathes of the map to explore.

Once character progression is a thing of the past, your incentive to keep playing is basically down to how much you enjoy the exploration and narrative. If your sole reason for playing is the acquisition of ""MOAR POWER!"", then you're going to be a little disheartened and your interest may wane. What doesn't wane is the level of challenge even at higher levels. Those hillbilly mutants in the Point Lookout DLC will mess you up.

Fallout 3 in 2023 may look like something your dog regurgitated onto the living room carpet, but it tells a compelling story in an enthralling world where what you do genuinely matters. It doesn't have all the quality of life features of its successors, but this in no way detracts from the countless hours you'll spend trundling about the Capital Wasteland gibbing supermutants and radscorpions.

I like the fallout game, it is all about exploration, apocalypse, survival and moral choice. I love the game. 
The best fallout is The Fallout 4
This is what I think about this game :
- the main quests are not too long(plus side quests).
- the map is huge
- the locations are a lot, but the reward/loot are not compatible with the effort of visiting the location. some location have certain path that sometimes its hard to find. honestly, I dont check every location. it's waste of time.
- the side quests are not many despite how big the map is. it is like less than 15 side quests. it is low compare to the Oblivion.
- there are ""unmark quest"". few unmark quests ask you to collect things, this collecting things gives you xp and caps but most of other unmark quest gives you nothing. you can easily forget the quest anyway.
-the maximum carry weight is 300. it is so limited, I only have free less than 100 carry weight left. in Oblivion, I could get like 400 carry weight plus 300-450 from alteration and enchanted armor. total 800.
- the DLCs are fine. my favourite DLC are the outcast and the PItt, they are very good. the worst is the riverboat/Point Lookout. map is huge but feels empty, enemies are buffed for no reason even tho they dont use armor, and the story is mediocere does not make any sense.

I will rate this game 6/10

Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition is the first game in the series in 3D, taking us to Washington D.C. and the surrounding area. The game of the year edition, includes all DLCs and minor improvements. Don't pay attention to my play counter, because for some reason, the game only counts hours when the launcher is active, not the game itself.
[h1]The Plot[/h1]
We start the game as a resident of Vault 101, and we get used to it by jumping between events from our childhood; first steps and conversations with dad, our tenth birthday and receiving the Pip-Boy, and the exam to determine our role in the Vault. Each of these segments is full of optional conversations with Dad, our peers, and other residents. It's a short and at first glance boring intro, but it makes us more attached to the people around us (mainly dad), and our character is much more believable. Our dad is also played by Liam Neeson, so he automatically becomes the best character in the game. Leaving the Vault, story-wise, we don't have many options, and it's quite linear and predictable, but in its simplicity, it's effective, and it's enjoyable to experience it along with the interactions with the main characters. And to expand on my earlier thought about the linearity of the plot, there is no faction system here like in Fallout: New Vegas, so the game specifically draws us to one faction, the plot of which will be continued in Fallout 4.
[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Starting from the beginning, the game definitely focuses on the destructiveness of war. Compared to Washington, New Vegas is heaven on earth. The capital city is completely destroyed, full of rubble, destroyed buildings, vehicles, craters, etc., which I really liked. You can really feel the brutality and destruction that a nuclear war can cause. The map is large, apart from Washington itself (full of interesting buildings with unique interiors), it also gives us a large part of the surrounding area, which is full of dilapidated smaller towns, factories, roads, etc. Each of these locations is interesting to explore, so it's hard to get bored. Coming to the quests, they're solid, they're not brilliant, but they're not bad either, they're okay, short, and fun. Our arsenal of weapons and armor is impressive, but it does not overwhelm us. Well, it may sometimes feel that more of them would be useful, but it's not bad, each piece of equipment can be used in different ways when fighting the large number of potential opponents that the game presents us with. However, there is one thing that is bugging me, and that is the subway system. Possibly due to technical issues, the developers figured out, that Washington would be divided into a lot of separate sections (due to suspiciously stable walls of rubble), so we have to use the subway tunnels every now and then, which are terribly large, monotonous and boring. In addition to the fact that it slows down our progress, it's also, tiring, and sometimes even the game doesn't know what to do with it, so the markers stop working, and we cuddle up to every wall in the whole city, praying to find a way to our goal. Finally, I want to describe the character skills/perks system, which is solid, but it has its problems. There are many skills in the game that, apart from the usual bonuses, also give us new dialogue options. However, it seems to me that the perks were done by force, a large number of them are boring numerical bonuses to statistics and skills, and unlocking them through level ups does not give us any satisfaction.
[h1]Technical Matters[/h1]
The reason why this game broke me a little bit. Starting with the graphics, they're okay, nothing special, and the greenish filter makes everything look like vomit, but it could have been worse, and it adds a bit of vibe and charm. The voice actors did a solid job, but as I said before, Liam Neeson blew away the competition. Moving on to the music, as usual, I'm very positively surprised here, exploration without the radio is full of dark grunts and sounds, but when it comes to the radio, it has a great range of music from around the 60s, and it's great to listen to, although personally I prefer Fallout: New Vegas music anyway. But let's end with the worst, i.e. stability and bugs. During gameplay, quests often break irreversibly, due to the fact that the game simply doesn't know what to do when we do things in our order, and the stupid AI certainly doesn't help when the quests finally work anyway. Basically everything is twisted and buggy here, once on the radio I even heard the main presenter talk about events that haven't happened yet, so it really broke my immersion. And ending with stability, the game crashes very often. While playing the game, it would freeze at least three times within an hour, and it's not a typical crash where it throws you to the desktop and you can quickly go back, but it's a complete computer freeze, so I had to restart the whole PC every time. These crashes, apart from frequency, are also completely random so at some point I just gave up.
[h1]Summary[/h1]
Great game, but it's barely keeping up with the time pressure and definitely needs a Remaster or Remake. Despite the lazy efforts of the developers, the game barely works without mods, and unfortunately I don't have the strength to go through all the DLCs, accompanied by constant crashes. I will say this; if you're ready to install mods or spend hours on YT and in game files to make everything work, then I'd definitely recommend buying it, but if for whatever reason you don't want to mess around with all of this, then you'd better not waste your money. It's a real shame, that this game gave me so much trouble, because Fallout in Washington D.C. is my dream location for a game in the series (although to this day I'm most interested in what New York looks like in this universe, but with Bethesda working on their games at the speed of a lobotomy patient, I doubt that the next Fallout will be made in my lifetime, so I probably won't know).

Fallout 1 is one of the best crpg games of all time, and Fallout 2 is a very worthy successor in most regards. Bethesda decided to turn it in to one of the most braindead experiences imaginable. Fallout 3 is a fun enough game, if you get too high to see five feet ahead of you before playing. I have no objection to lowering the barrier of entry to a series for a more casual audience. But that's not what bethesda did to this game. They either removed or contradicted most everything that make the games good in the first place. This was NOT necessary to streamlining the game. Every few years since 2010, the first time i played fo3, I've thought to myself 'I'll play through it again, it can't be as bad as I remember', only to be disappointed each and every time. Thinking about this games existence makes me so upset to the point where I don't want to go any more in depth than I have here, in this short review, otherwise I'd be risking my own mental health and saftey. Do NOT play this game, or fallout 4, if you have any emotional attachment to the three good games in the series (Fallout 1, 2, and New Vegas). You will put yourself at high risk and get admitted to a mental hospital, unless you manage to kill yourself before anyone finds you.

edit: put some more hours into the game. dislike it even more.

One area where Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition shows its age is in the graphics department. Released in 2008, the visuals may not be as polished or detailed as modern titles.

In addition to the main questline, the Game of the Year Edition includes all five expansion packs, providing hours of additional content. From the eerie atmosphere of Point Lookout to the high-tech escapades of Operation: Anchorage, each expansion offers a unique and immersive experience that expands upon the already rich world of Fallout 3.

I still recommend this game, if you can start it, i hope you enjoy this wonderful classic, if you can't, i feel for you, and suggest you keep trying somehow



Now while looks may be decieving, being only listed as 25 hours, i bought the game of the year edition when it first came out, and wore the disks out, so i bought it on Steam because i did not want to spend the time trying to hunt down new disks, but i degress...

Fallout 3 in of itself, when i started it, ran slow and was difficult for me, it was frustrating at first, but once i got a better computer, and monitor, the difference was amazing! Yes, this was not my old Fallout and Fallout 2, and in one case, i was as glad as fuck it was not Fallout Tactics. Eventually it grew on me, the story not as much, but the wasteland enviroment, the action, the having to look out for enemies as i least expected it, radiation around every corner, even the random enounters and respawning encounters always had me on my toes. It got to the point where i had to put the difficulty up to very hard everytime to have a good challenge, but i loved it as DC became a death trap of Feral Ghouls, Super Mutants, and Mirelurks. The DLC's were wonderful, some were weaker than the others, I will admit my favorite DLC's between this and New Vegas was in New Vegas, but each had their own unique fun, irregardless if they were good or not.

So to sum it up, for a first attempt, Bethesda really did good. Yes, they could have done better, a lot better. Story needs work, accurate map more based on real life road system would be nice, more variety in weapons, and mods for weapons without using mods, but it was a far better attempt at bring Fallout to a new audience, Better than New Vegas in my humble opinion, but not by much only because of the bugs, and how it can still be more difficult to survive here than in New Vegas. It was a good way to wait as well until i could catch a ride on the Prydwin to the Commonwealth, it was a lot closer to there.

Before i end this, i want to address one more thing, we need to stop this petty infighting in our Fallout community, and come together as one community. Yes, i love all the games, period, end of story, no one game is superior to another, and each game is flawed in their own way. So are humans, if i must remind you all, and if we cannot stop this pointless bickering, one day, we may not have another chance to go back to the wasteland, because our own great war destroyed it.",1487690238,1689297747,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Why I don't recommend it is that it takes a lot of work to get it to a stable place, the game does not run well on modern machines and Bethesda has done nothing to alleviate that issue.

And my honest opinion is that it just isn't good. There are MANY reasons why, but they range from the voice acting being mid, the story just being very meh, as well as the mess that is the open world. There's a lot I could say, but in comparing it to New Vegas I'd say that NV was far more accessible.
The layout of New Vegas' open world meant that it was easy to find everything, as it was all centred around the main highways and the city of New Vegas itself. Exploring the Capital Wasteland is, at best, a disjointed maze. There are SO MANY LOCATIONS that are nowhere near the main quest line of the game, that unless you have the Explorer perk at level 20 I found that actually finding all the other locations in the game that weren't Megaton, Project Purity, the Museum of History or Rivet City it was all just WAY OUT THERE.

I'm not even sure if I'm explaining it right... but playing New Vegas came easy to me. Just by playing the main story I was completing most of the side quests along side, playing Fallout 3 I have had to actually go looking for all the side content. Which, for me, is bizarre.
Instead of completing the base game 100% like NV and then starting the DLCs, I've been playing the DLCs for Fallout 3 when most of the Capital Wasteland has been left undiscovered.

Not matter what though, I'm just not interested in the story behind Fallout 3. Exploring the Vaults, abandoned buildings and completing side quests just isn't interesting for me. I'm the kind of guy who played New Vegas for two months straight gathering HUNDREDS of hours, meanwhile I'm 40 hours into Fallout 3 and I already want to stop.

Not sure what else to say, but 3 isn't the worst game ever. It's just not interesting, the story is not compelling.. there's a reason why The Pitt DLC is talked more than anything else as it's the most compelling Fallout 3 has been with its stories.
I'm 40 hours in, but I just don't see myself returning when I've completed Point Lookout and Mothership Zeta. 

If you want to play a Fallout title, I recommend Fallout: New Vegas. It has the story, the gameplay, the characters and morally grey DLCs and main story. 

(And that's without even mentioning the bugs and constant crashes! I played New Vegas for 400 hours and it crashed five times. I've played Fallout 3 for 40 hours and it has crashed more times I can count. Also the Radio's just do not work, Agatha's violin and GNR are bugged out when it comes to the music and no matter what I've tried I just cannot get it to work.

This isn't hard to run anymore, as many reviews complain about. Bethesda patched out the GFWL nonsense and added compatibility with OSes that are actually supported by Microsoft. That's a hell of a lot more than most developers will do for a 15 year old game. All you need to do is install the unofficial patch and maybe limit the framerate to 72fps via your graphics drivers if you have a high refresh monitor. It's really not rocket science, and it's not like it's a fast game that would benefit from a high framerate, although there is something to be said against Bethesda games always requiring the user to essentially finish making the game that they purchased.

I only run one mod for FO3 - the unofficial patch, and maybe blue skies + no green filter if I feel like it. New Vegas? Like 25+ mods mainly centred around stability, despite it being the better game tbqh.

Anyway, on a personal level, FO3 is a very special game for me, despite problems with the writing and the world being full of pointless landmarks that stand in the way of the locations that actually matter. A good example of this is the school near the starting town - it's full of raiders but... there's nothing there apart from a bit of XP for killing the raiders. It's not even part of a quest. Like I said, NV fixes this and has infinitely better writing. FO3 comes very close to genuine social commentary but backs off the very moment that it could harm Bethesda's share value.",1688098661,1688799462,True,0,0,0.471014469861984253,0,True,False,False

Pros: 
I loved many of the side quests which really made the game worth playing, because without them the game feels much shorter. I'll just say a few I really enjoyed: Trouble on the Homefront (You return to the Vault to a civil war there), Oasis Quest (You meet the only green part of the world and decide the future of it which is stop it from growing, don't do anything, allow it to continue growing and maybe faster I think), Agatha's Guitar (You find this Grandma a Guitar and she plays you tones on the radio), GNR stuff (pretty much main story but whatever), GARYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!! 

The Tone of this game is crazy scary I felt genuinely fearful at the start with such low stimpaks and protection against what lurks there. Without the GNR radio station this game has an entirely different tone, one that is much more serious and scary while Three Dog got me jumping up and down to Jolly Days. 

Since this is game of the year I might as well talk about the DLCS: They are incredibly fun besides the alien ship one and im pretty mixed about the Anchorage Mission. But the Pitt, Broken Steel, and Point Lookout are very fun additions to the game.

It's dirt cheap especially for the content. 



Cons: 
My god the raider gangs it just doesn't feel realistic, I feel that they want to give you reward for finding places but there is raiders everywhere, I understand they fight eachother but it's been 200 years since the nukes fell and all you can think of doing is keep on fighting cause Mr.krabs in the Pitt gives you 5 caps to keep the instability going. And a measly few settlements pop up while in California they are thriving and creating a state and a half sized empire (flawed but still an empire) 

I understand the situation of a heavily bombed out area such as D.C. but everything is grey and boring, I can't blame them too much for this since it was their first take and were probably basing it off of the style from the First and Second games. 



Conclusion: I hardly talked about most of aspects but I just think you should give it a try because I think it's really fun.

steam://controllerconfig/22370/14

I did thoroughly enjoy this game but it does have it's caveats that I'll list out first. I've seen and read so many issues stemming from Windows 10/11 not running this properly. This game does have crashes, even on the Steam Deck, so do be prepared and have saves going regularly. It's nothing new, per say, but it is something to be prepared for when it comes to most Bethesda games. Additionally, I wish that Bethesda would've added the achievements from the old Games for Windows LIVE service that was deprecated.

Bugs and issues aside the game was absolutely great. It's a tough pick between this and New Vegas as my favorites. I didn't like the direction that Fallout 4 took where it's geared more towards base building, random weapon generation, and some other key elements that has slowly been stripping away the RPG elements in favor for more streamlined experiences. 

The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stat tree is a key element in the game relating to the RPG mechanics. If you've played previous Fallouts, you'll know what I mean. This game is a lot more bleak than the other titles that have came afterwards. Personally, feel this is more bleak than New Vegas, even if that game gets pretty heavy at times. This game feels a lot more isolated and alone than the others. The DC Wasteland is barren which is good or bad depending on who you are. There are a bevy of secrets littered about that you can find but they are scarce. Some may find it boring and tedious to do so but it's the exploration that makes it shine above the other titles.

The DC ruins has a lot more content packed in it compared to the Wasteland. The major cities, factions, and choices you make only make an impact at the end credits - for the most part. There are some choices that does effect the overall game but, for the most part, is minimal. Since this is the GoTY edition the end isn't as bad as the original was/is. That being said, I can't review the individual DLC as this is an all-in-one so here's my review of the DLC's I played in order:

[h2]Operation Anchorage:[/h2]
I really enjoyed this one. It was quick and linear. It never outlasted it's stay and had a decent storyline. The gear you obtained afterwards was spectacular and could be considered overpowered if you did this DLC at the suggested level of 10. I didn't run into any bugs throughout the playthrough.

[h2]Broken Steel:[/h2]
You pair up with the Brotherhood of Steel in this one to take out the remaining remnants of the Enclave. The suggested level to do this is somewhere in the range of 20+. You'll be around there by the time you beat the game, which is where you'd start this one up at. It's got great unique weapons, unique armor sets, unique location (and revisits old locations), and a storyline that is linear but does a good job at keeping things consistent and concise. It also upps the level cap to 30. Great DLC in terms of quality of life improvements.

[h2]Mothership Zeta:[/h2]
Hated this one. I recommend to not even go through this broken mess. I've had multitudes of bugs that made the game crash, teleporters that stopped working, corrupted a game save, and more. There is hardly a story. The weapons are cool, admittedly, but that's about it. The DLC outstays it's welcome and has so many repeating corridors that look exactly the same. It does have tougher enemy types but it's just a buggy shooting gallery.

[h2]The Pitt:[/h2]
From the onset it's a darker themed DLC. Personally, the darker themes are what draws me in so this was a fun one for me. There is a large amount of content in here. Custom armor sets, good main storyline, custom weapons, and varied new enemy/friendly types. Overall a great DLC that's worth your time. It is a depressing setting though but honestly if you've completed Fallout 3 I don't think that will bother you. I didn't like the steel ingot fetch quest for all of them but it's not required. The choices you make don't necessarily matter at the end either, which is neither good or bad

[h2]Point Lookout:[/h2]
This isn't as dark as The Pitt was and is by far the best DLC. This is truly an extension of Fallout 3, from my perspective. There are additional zones, varied new enemy types, new items, tons of new assets, custom weapons, armor, and multiple branching storylines throughout. It's clear this is the most worked on DLC out of all of them - or at least the one that has/had the most direction. Depending on who you are, this might not be for you. It's open world akin to Fallout 3 unlike the other DLC's which were more streamlined experiences (think Point A -> Point B). Some people prefer the DLC to be more focused and this one isn't but that's what makes this one my favorite.

Figured out how to enter Console commands in Fallout New Vegas...is same here: Must be in ""mouse/keyboard"" mode for Controls. Then in the game hit the ""~"" key which opens the Console. Commands are found online in various sites. E.G. tgm is 'god mode'. Once Console commands are entered hit the ""~"" again to close Console. Switch back to the 360 Controller setting if you are using that. Not very convenient process, but it works.

Fallout 3 is the first of the fallout franchise to become apart of the First-Person shooter genre, including an alternative Third-Person, adjustable camera capable of flying and rotating several feet around the player to get a better grasp of their surroundings, and a karma system that effects the outcome of character interactions, conversations, dialogue, in game choices, perks, and ending. Actions effect gameplay, resulting in either negative, or positive outcomes. There is very rarely ever one way approach to any given situation or scenario that is unavoidable, safe for the death of Liberty Prime in the DLC Broken Steel, and the death of James in the Washington Monument. Even with leveling up the maximum level cap of 20 to 30 in the DLC Broken Steel, it is impossible to gain every perk in the game, reinforcing the strategic value and priority of the players choice, further adding to the experience and replayability of the vast, barren and cruel wasteland of DC. Counting the abundance of content offered by the games several DLCs, Mothership Zeta, Broken Steel, The Pitt, Operation: Anchorage, and Point Lookout, the wasteland is full of hours worth of discoveries, whether it be discovering one of the six vaults hidden within the wasteland and their secret Vault-tec experiments, hidden unmarked caves, or even finding bobble heads hidden throughout Washington D.C. My only complaints of the game would have to be that the environments and atmosphere of Fallout 3 can become rather drab and dull at points. There is never enough Fallout 3, even with its replayabilty and discovery. I thoroughly enjoy my experiences of Fallout 3 on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC, (Despite its flawed launcher that requires personal patching) it is by far one of my favorite games I've ever played, and I would recommend this game for both new, and returning audiences of the Fallout franchise.",1417401512,1687923147,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1] Base Game: [/h1]
I think the base game is as good as the FNV base game, but for different reasons. I feel like the gameplay is much better and the capital wasteland is a more interesting location than the Mojave, the game does a great job at making the wasteland a big space, using the starting vault to do this. However in terms of story, this is what I find FNV does better than this game. There is actual factions and choice, unlike this game. That is why I feel that these games are equals, FNV has a better story, but Fallout 3 is better in terms of atmosphere and some gameplay aspects, but the lack of choice affects this game way too much. I give the base game a 8/10.

[h1] Operation Anchorage: [/h1]
A Frankenstein monster of Call of Duty and Fallout, this DLC is hard to judge. It isn't a fallout game because it is a linear shooter. The concept is interesting, being in a simulation playing one of the most important events in the Fallout timeline. However it just doesn't work because, well, they tried to do Call of Duty in, not Call of Duty. Great gear, though. 6/10.

[h1] Broken Steel: [/h1]
DLC is worth having for the after-game content, but the little story it adds is also adds is pretty good. Basically when trying to take out a group of Enclave, spoilers, Liberty Prime is killed. You spend the DLC trying to find what killed Prime, and then destroying what it was, or blowing up the citadel. The missions are pretty good, however there are only three. 7/10.

[h1] The Pitt: [/h1]
I struggle to see why The Pitt is held in such high regard. Although it has a fantastic premise, the execution is horrible. Nothing happens hear, there is nothing to talk about here. The moral dilemma, the characters act like it isn't one. Neat environment, neat premise, bad execution. I won't say it's bad and the gameplay can be good, but just prepare for something that you likely won't want to replay. 4/10.

[h1] Point Lookout: [/h1]
Easily the best DLC of Fallout 3, the atmosphere, the story, the main quest, gameplay, it's all great. You head to an island, and meet up with a ghoul named Desmond, before trying to find out why these tribals are attacking Desmond. The few problems this DLC has are the swampfolk being bullet sponges, and the fact that it still falls into the Fallout 3 trap of a lack of choice. 10/10.

[h1] Mothership Zeta: [/h1]
I might not be the person who should talk about this, but I actually really like Mothership Zeta. In all reality it has the same linear gameplay of Operation Anchorage, and little challenge, but I still find it fun. The characters aren't horrible, overall it's a middle of the road DLC with great gear. 7/10.

[h1] Conclusion: [/h1]
In all honesty, I think the base game, with Broken Steel, is the best of Fallout 3, it just works, as one man said.
Here's all the ratings:
[b] Base game: 8/10 [/b]
[b] Operation Anchorage: 6/10 [/b]
 [b] Broken Steel: 7/10 [/b]
[b] The Pitt: 4/10 [/b]

Firstly we must talk about the technical problems with installation, because in all likelyhood this hunk of junk will crash on start-up until you download a third party social program from Microsoft that is completely obsolete and no longer supported. There aren't even mods to circumvent this, some exist that graphically remove any trace of it from the menus, but if you want to play the game you have to install unrelated bloatware, that's the bottom line. 

As for the gameplay, there are MMO's with more interconnected questlines than this. Sure you can travel wherever you want from the start of the game but every location is like an independent universe. They have no impact on the wider world, save for what is said on the in-game radio. The locations themselves are cool, killing slavers with Abraham Lincoln's lever-action rifle is endlessly fun, but there are rarely any choices to be made outside being good or evil, there are very few grey areas to ponder. It is incredibly hard to acquire an evil rating on the in-game morality slider without actively murdering people in the street or doing one particular quest that bottoms out the scale, because you can gain ""good"" points for simply killing enemies. The attitude of the general populace will swing wildly if you ever switch between a good and evil reputation. Kill a few monsters and your the paradigm of all that's good with the world. Murder a civilian and the other civilians won't be afraid or even permanently hostile, they'll just make snide remarks around you. Do a good deed for someone on the opposite side of the map and suddenly your a saint again like nothing ever happened. The number of memorable characters in this game is less than five. 

Then there's the combat which wasn't good at the time and still feels like throwing broken pens in the vicinity of your enemies with a rubber band until they give up. Without DLC everything is stupidly easy past the first dozen or so hours and with DLC everything is brokenly hard by the endgame, forcing you to change the difficulty slider to the opposite end of the spectrum by three quarters through the game. 

Here's the most disappointing part, the world, which is usually the highlight of a Bethesda game, is terribly boring. Save for some small mountainous sections in the far northwest corner, the map is largely flat and featureless outside specific points of interest. Sure there are small knolls and gentle hills about the place, but none of it is memorable, save for the raised railway line, or impedes you ability to travel in a straight line from one place to the next. If someone asked me to draw a map of Skyrim or Fallout New Vegas, I'd have something to work with because those games have biomes and mountain ranges and lakes. The one feature Fallout 3 has is the city in the southeast which is a nightmare to traverse as its split into many small sections requiring you to travel through endlessly boring subway tunnels to reach them. This was done due to hardware limitations of the time, but it still isn't fun to play.",1587719236,1687154844,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fallout 3 is marketed as a post-apocalyptic first person role playing game, but player choice is minimal, and Bethesda's idea of the post apocalypse is making everything tinted green. The writing for this game is abysmal, with a main story line that is deeply uninteresting and filled with plot holes wider than a nuclear crater. Almost all of the side content is completely unrelated to the main conflict and is more interested in making a zany, ""wouldn't it be so cool if [insert half-baked, poorly written idea here]"" scenario than providing a compelling issue or introducing a difficult choice for the player. Bethesda seems to think that the Fallout franchise's themes are confined to over the top satire of stereotypical 1950's Americana.

Set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland of Washington, D.C., the game offers a compelling and immersive experience that has captivated players since its release.

One of the standout aspects of Fallout 3 is its atmospheric and detailed world. The game presents a desolate and decaying landscape filled with ruins, mutants, and morally ambiguous factions. The attention to detail in the game's environment, from the devastated cityscape to the eerie underground vaults, creates a sense of immersion and exploration.

The main storyline in Fallout 3 follows the protagonist's search for their missing father in the wasteland. Along the way, players encounter various factions, make choices that affect the game world, and uncover the dark secrets of post-apocalyptic society. The narrative is engaging and filled with memorable characters, providing players with a sense of purpose and driving them to uncover the mysteries of the wasteland.

The gameplay mechanics of Fallout 3 combine first-person shooting with RPG elements, allowing players to engage in intense combat while also making choices that shape their character's development. The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system, which governs the player's attributes, skills, and perks, offers a deep and customizable progression system. The ability to make choices and face consequences adds depth and replayability to the game, allowing players to have unique experiences and explore different paths.

Fallout 3 is also known for its rich side quests and exploration opportunities. The wasteland is filled with hidden locations, unique items, and interesting characters, encouraging players to venture off the beaten path and discover the game's secrets. The vast array of weapons, armor, and other items further enhance the sense of exploration and customization, as players can tailor their character to fit their preferred playstyle.

However, it's worth noting that Fallout 3 does have some technical issues, especially on older systems. Some players have experienced occasional crashes or performance problems. Additionally, the game's graphics, while atmospheric and immersive, may feel outdated compared to more recent titles.

Despite these minor shortcomings, Fallout 3 is widely regarded as a modern classic and a seminal entry in the Fallout series. Its gripping narrative, immersive world, and compelling gameplay mechanics have left a lasting impact on the gaming community. Whether you are a fan of RPGs or post-apocalyptic settings, Fallout 3 offers a thrilling and memorable experience that shouldn't be missed.",1666057385,1686676613,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You do not need games for vista extantention anymore, just follow the steps described in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R50kJNFXG10&ab_channel=IntelligentGaming. The first 2 steps explained in the video likely will not work because they are old suggestions right now, but the third mentioned in the description does. Download the files for the intel bypass and follow the intructions. If you have an nvidia graphic card and the pc will not even launch the game go to: Settings>System>Display>Graphics, then scroll down to fallout 3 and select ""options"", then select the Intel graphics card instead of the nvidia one by choosing the ""power saving"" option.

I found the base game to be extremely enjoyable, yet sometimes its writing did not make much sense. I also believe that the DLC all have their pros but have a lot of cons. Specifically how some can be done very early in the game, and give very OP or just straight up bugged weapons as a result of finishing. 

I did Operation: Anchorage about 1/4 through my play through and found the rest of the game not too challenging given the equipment you are rewarded as a result of finishing the DLC. Even though I say that, I did not notice till the end of the game that the T-51b armor doesn't even break at all, so I did not take advantage of that.

I have been playing this game a ton since I got it on April 14. At the time I was looking for a game that either just had a great story or a sandbox type game where the player had the control and could do whatever they wanted. I have always considered playing the fallout series but never got into it since I have never been a fan of dystopian atmospheres. I really always enjoyed the opposite; Modern futuristic Utopias and Bustling Cities. But I decided to anyway since it was cheap and it had character creation. The game starts with the intro stating ""War... war never changes"" and describes the backstory of this wasted world. It all stemmed from the great war. After World War 2, nuclear power became trending and that trend carried on forever. It lead into a total nuclear warfare that everyone lives the aftermath of 200 years later in this game. You live in vault 101. Many vaults were created before the great war to survive for as long as possible. SOMETHING NEAT: Every Vault is different. The premise of this game is finding your father who left the vault (that which is not allowed) and you leave the vault to find him. This game has decent combat, great story, decent visuals, great customization, great characters, great open world, and best of all you are in control. You can kill a main character, good or bad, even if it is crucial to the story. You control your adventure for the most part and I love it. Also the music in this game is amazing. You get a ton of music from the 20s-late 50s and it really fits the atmosphere. The game can also be scary at points (Scariest fallout game by far) and some of the creatures in the game are truly diabolical. Sorry this review is kind of all over the place, but I am telling you, if you like elder scrolls or you like open-ended open world rpgs this game is just great and I think you will love it.",1685916943,1685916943,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The year is 2008. I have just begun 10th grade. Upon getting the opportunity to take a game design elective at a sister high school I ran into a classmate who'd just bought the collector's edition complete with Vault-Tec lunchbox. I'd had vague recollections about how popular the franchise was and what it generally was about but had never had the opportunity to look into the game prior due to us not having the means.

At the time I was big up on piracy and decided to acquire a copy of the game. This and GTA IV as I recall would end up being some of the first games I'd purchase on my Steam account after entering the workforce.

The good:

- Along with FO:NV basically the reason for Nexus Mods' initial growth and entrenchment as a centralized modding scene resource
- Story, environments and replayability are pretty incredible as they stand and is tangibly expanded with each DLC, props to Bethsoft for Broken Steel retconning the hard-ending, this fundamentally made the game a sandbox to live in (in partial opposition to FO:NV which has a final showdown at the end of the main story arc that needs to be prioritized dead last, but is the only major consideration)
- Helped to repopularize 50's popular music, Googie/Atomic Design for mainstream science fiction fans
- Possibly the only time I've seen the National Mall represented in first-person in a video game
- Every single damn DLC is a banger, Bethsoft really busted their butts on making expansions for the Oblivion/FO3 era
- Weapons, armor, player homes and collectibles are all timeless and arrive at a steady pace
- Characters are well-enough written and are mostly there to paint an aesthetic picture as opposed to FO4's character design which is primarily (with some exceptions): here's some generic emotional appeals as to why you need to go here and accomplish this task, okay bye~

The different:
- In contrast with Fallout 4 and later, power armor is differentiated from regular armor only by a prerequisite ""Power Armor Training"" skill provided only mid-game. Upshot is that no supplementary items such as fusion cores are required for usage - this is in line with long-established franchise canon stating that the fusion cores integrated into standard-issue power armors have such longevity relative to power consumption in active use that they effectively retain a charge indefinitely as opposed to like 20-30mins realtime in FO4+
-In contrast with FO4+, there is no settlement system or native item modification/crafting outside of inventory system-based stat mods. This is an upshot in that the uniqueness of unique items is preserved from user modification to the point where the gun's unrecognizable, and a downshot in that it limits user customization. Certain mods will expand this to an extent, and FO:NV does incorporate an expanded ammo/weapon modification mechanic.

The bad:

- Games for Windows Live requirement - kind of not their fault as it was an attempt to provide feature parity with the Xbox 360 version (cheevos) but Microsoft really just didn't know what they were doing then. It really blows chunks that we now have to mod the game immediately after installation to get it to avoid immediate CTDs related to the missing xlive.dll dependency. I do wish Bethsoft would return to patch this out of the game at this point as the primary feature is deprecated, it's kind of a failure to support their own product.
- Classic Gamebryo Engine bugs - worst offenders: CTDs, issues with Alt+Tab/focus hijack/black screen, save corruption, multicore/4GB+
- For as much as I love the survivalist journey of traveling through the DC Metro to get into the oasis of infrastructural integrity amidst collapsed hi-rises that is southeast D.C. it can be a real slog to go through again. Really atmospheric but pretty strenuous, kind of like replaying GTA IV
- The game is helped somewhat by the gritty subject matter and environmental storytelling but the graphics of the Gamebryo Engine have not aged terribly well. That said, mods can help immensely
- Engine support for mods is more of a known quantity without internal Beth.net mod marketplace -- however, the content package system was clearly not designed for stability in supporting extensive changes to the game, especially when it comes to mod order, Archive Invalidation, texture/asset changes or save dependencies. This is also kind of a mixed bag in that it's partially as a result of the amazing ambition and creativity of the modding community.

This game is the first hands-on impression I had with Fallout beyond I think maybe 5 minutes of playing a FO1 port to Mac OS and watching my brother play about the first hour of FO1 on his PC as a kid, in relation to the beginning of this review. So as a primary exposure point, and as a diehard fan today, I'd say mission accomplished.

If you're interested in a combined experience with Fallout: New Vegas, I'd seriously consider checking out Tale of Two Wastelands. It's an effort to get installed but once you're done you literally have a modified FO:NV engine supporting all content for FO3 and NV in a single character's game session.

The game will launch from steam, but the mods won't recognize this version of the game.
You'll have to download a mod called ""Updated Unofficial Fallout 3 Patch"" in order for the mods to work which isn't a huge deal, its been running smoothly for the last 5 hours with mods activated.
You'll also have to download mods called ""Command Extender"" and the ""FOSE"" mod from the link that's provided.
It was a really easy set up with clear instructions. If you're having trouble you can always YouTube it.

Muddy graphics and stiff animation can be somewhat overlooked given it's 14 years old, though I feel Dragon Age: Origins did a significantly better job in these regards despite only coming out a month later. My main issues however are that the gunplay and open world are absolutely pitiful by modern standards; the Capital Wasteland is often totally barren for large stretches, and has random massive rubble piles in the city that severely limits the amount of space actually available to explore. Gunplay feels really bad, especially with no iron sights (or scopes at all except on snipers), meaning that your options are to either hipfire or hipfire but zoomed in, basically. Shots are clunky, weapon variety is lacking, some weapons feel utterly useless (hunting rifle and lower calibre pistols especially), and bullet spread is too wild without enough indication of where a player's shots will land relative to their crosshair.

Main story and side quests are usually okay and around a 7/10. Very obviously doesn't come anywhere close to New Vegas, but it's serviceable for a Fallout game. Main story has its highlights and lowlights (running errands for Little Lamplight utterly killed the pacing in my opinion) but it's alright; side quests however can often be pretty annoying and tedious. Do not talk to Moira Brown, worst mistake I ever made. Do talk to Mr. Burke, best mistake I ever made.

The story is basically a worse version of Fallout 1/2's stories. The purifying water aspect of Fallout 1 and the enclave of Fallout 2.

this game... god this game... both top 3 and worst fallout... for context, i played New Vegas first, so that is my base line. 

Fallout 3 is very close to new vegas, but also not close... the reputaion system is non exsitant, with karma acting in proxy, and for some god knows why reason some/MOST companions NEED a karma type (this in-fucking-cluds neutral karma) so you can't have some companions at times. now the leveling encouters to the player is a double edged sword, on one hand it stops players from being steam rolled, but on the other it takes more then 5 clips with a 10mm pistol to kill damn molerats.

most quests lock you into a single path, with the path it being depending on karma.

From the immediate beginning, when the child player looks up towards their father just after being born, it's clear that Fallout 3 demands curiosity. A wee babe, wailing desperately for the player to pay attention, to look here. A hapless parent, dangling shiny objects in front of your face, hoping that one of them in a long sequence of unconnected and brief experiences will resonate, and stick to your mentality. Over and over, Fallout 3 rams home the theme of the child - both in thematics, and in narrative. The expansive open world is an exciting and certainly interesting romp, but it's weakened at the knees by juvenile writing, a surprisingly barren variety of weapons and customization, and a supreme lack of logic and nuance, things that it professes as necessary in the rhetoric, but fails to deliver within its own confines. Quests will frequently end without conclusive resolutions, character questions will routinely skip what you actually wanted to or needed to know, and dialogue options within conversations seemingly forget about the existence of each other, creating a disassociative mess of an experience without strong personalities or ideologies. Built-up moments of glory are quickly shuffled to the side once their snapshot moment has been reached, and a persisent abruptness to just about everything leaves a ""well, that's that"" taste in the mouth until the very end. The foundations of the worldspace are what makes this an interesting idea, but the execution of the morality and of the heart of the game, so decayed and wimpy, forced the vast majority of my engagement out and away.

It grounds your character in the setting in an organic way, more so than any other Bethesda in my opinion. Which is why I find it funny that I felt least connected to the setting and my character of this game than any other.
These games have always have always had a theme-park design to them, sandbox with toys to play around for you. But if you decide to meet the games half way, acknowledge the limitation and roleplay within the confines of the sandbox, they can be some of the most immersive experiences in gaming. But here I felt really hard to connect myself to the world. The writing and the quest design lacked the extra oomph for me to get immersed in the characters and their struggles. The main story is supposed to be deeply personal to the PC, but the none of the main characters have enough depth to make you care. It felt more like playing an outside observer briefly looking into the stories of the people in this worlds and way too happy to kill some mutants and raiders. It really was like being in a theme park.

This is not to say I didn't have fun with it, the labyrinth of DC metro aside exploration is a lot of fun like all Bethesda games. There are a lot of attractions in this theme park, both quantity and variety. The comically evil choices also makes more sense with that perspective. I even got used to the janky gunplay after a while, it's oddly satisfying blowing up meat bags with bullets. That's why the positive rating here. Still, this is probably my least favorite Bethesda game.

I didn’t have my own money or a modern console so there was a no chance I’d get it at launch.

However, a couple years later my friend told me at lunch that he purchased Fallout 3: GOTY Edition, but his computer wouldn’t play it. GameStop wouldn’t let him return it either. I immediately offered to trade him a PC copy of Oblivion I had, since he might be able to play that on his older pc. He accepted.

God only knows how many hours I played Fallout 3 at like 15fps because my computer sucked too.

After a couple years I got a job and bought a ps3 and another copy of Fallout 3 for that. I remember one of my files has 300+ hours on it.

All these years later I got a steam deck and decided to play through Fallout 3 once again. It still stands as one of my top favorite games ever made. It ran like crap on Windows 10, but crashes were so minimal on the Steam Deck, it is definitely the way to go.

Installing the Fellout mod to remove the green filter is a must have. I also like the essential companions and merchants mod. I added the zero degradation mod this time around so I wouldn’t spend half my time taping things together.

TLDR: I really like this game, and will probably play it until I die.

However, while the game's FPS combat mechanics are a significant improvement, Fallout 3 falls short on story detail.

It's worth playing, but at the same time, it's not worth playing. This is by no means a Fallout game, despite the name. Your choices feel as if they have no impact on the wasteland. The worst that can really happen is Liam Neeson being disappointed in you, Three Dog talking sh*t about you on the radio, or you just losing some karma.

Basically, no one cares about the water crisis, which is what the whole story is about! There are three water beggars in the wasteland, and they are really the only ones that seem to care about the lack of water (besides the scientists and your father, duh), and like one or two scripted events where people fight over purified water, everyone else seems like they could careless about the hopeless situation they live in.

The story is extremely disjointed, bland, and poorly written, along with the side quests (with what little there are), and the world that it takes place in doesn't really make any sense from a realistic standpoint. The food chain should literally be broken; there is no vegetation growing in the wasteland besides in Oasis, and even then, Oasis isn't even known to the rest of the wasteland, and the labs in Rivet City are just experimental. And if you're a person who is thinking, ""Who cares about what they eat?"" Then I truly hope you don't create fictional worlds or even make video games as a whole.

The lore is completely disregarded; The Brotherhood of Steel goes against their core values, with super mutants only being brain-dead killers compared to the ones in previous entries that have super mutants that are actually smart and are retaining their humanity. The only thing that feels sort of retained from the older games is the Enclave, and even then they feel cartoonishly evil. (Especially goddamn Colonel Autumn.)

This game also has no original factions; despite the fact that this game takes place on the other side of the country, Bethesda got extremely lazy here. And all the factions that are present in this game are just the ones from the original games, but they are poorly implemented and thought out, as I stated above. If you're going to copy and paste stuff from the original games, at least actually follow the damn lore.

There is a lot more I find completely stupid with this game (Megaton, for one). This game has more going against it than going for it. I would say give it a shot, but don't expect too much in the way of role-playing and world-building.",1636488621,1682069273,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

On one hand i have the nostalgia of me playing this around 2009/2010 and having a blast with the game and on the other hand i have my hatred of this game for playing it in 2023 because of the crashes, bugs, crashes and even more crashes.

At it's core the game is an improvement compared to the older fallout games, this being the first 3D game in the series. With this change came a lot of things that got better:
-gone are the walls of texts from when talking with a character and welcomed is the voice acting (not that i mind it but i do enjoy some voice acting)
-gone is the bad inventory system that is replaced with an easy to navigate inventory
-gone is the bad UI that is replaced with a clean and useful UI

The improvements didn't stop here, we did get a better main story plot line and better side content as side quests or locations to visit that can tell a story of what happened there even without the help of a quest in that region.
The majority of the items are common items that you can encounter on people from the wasteland or in the inventory of merchants, but some are unique items and i loved hunting them down. Some were in unique locations where the previous holder met a gruesome ending while some of the unique items are rewards or you find them on the enemies you kill.

I loved the karma system and wish more games implemented the morality system this way and not just the annoying and boring 'X will remember that'.

The main quest line was fun, but a bit cliche to be fair. I did enjoy going through it.
The side content was more interesting for me compared to the main quest line. There were so many small side quests that impressed me way more that any of the quests in the main plot line.

The companions are brain dead. Their AI was written by interns and you can't convince me otherwise. The companions always stop in corridors and won't let you pass, yell random voice lines during fights, get in front of you shooting at an enemy and eat your bullets. I played solo most of the game and only got a companion (Fawkes) while doing the last quests from the main plot line.

The dlcs were a let down, yep all of them disappointed me with how shallow they were. It was a balance from what i saw, some either had a new map but only one quest and others didn't have a new map but had a bit more quests.
-Operation: Anchorage was boring and annoying to play just so you have the cliche ending where the people you were there to help wanted to kill you while some were on your side.
-The Pitt basically made you choose between 2 evils and let you decide who is the lesser evil. I liked that they did this, but that the only good thing about it everything else was a sad excuse of a dlc. Would have regretted my purchase if i payed full price at release for this.
-Broken Steel was awesome. Loved that they continued the story and let you see the outcome of the decision you made in the main quest line. Had some nice side quests too so i'm glad i played this one.
-Point Lookout was trash. Main quest introduced an annoying rich asshole and his 'enemy'. Ended up killing both of them just because i was sick and tired of them. There were some nice side quests, one comes to mind is the evil book that you had to destroy.
-Mothership Zeta was trash just because all you had to do is run around the ship all game. The map system from this game doesn't help out when there are multiple layers (like floor 1, floor 2, etc.) and you had to hunt for that stair case most of the time.

The bugs and crashes were horrendous. I encountered everything from textures floating to random crashes in some places that made it impossible to continue.
Yeah i get it, the game is from 2008 it's normal to have some out of the place textures. But, and it's a big but, TES 4 Oblivion came out in 2006 and had less textures floating and random crashes.

The random crashes were so annoying to deal with. Literally did every fix possible and it was still not enough, let me enumerate them:
-tried using the unofficial path, but that wasn't any good because i got crashes still and some doors were forever locked (talking about the general shop in megaton)
-tried to put the game in compatibility mode with admin privileges, did nothing and still had crashes
-disabled steam overlay, did nothing and still had crashes
-disabled the auto saves on travel, wait and the third one i can't remember, did nothing and still had crashes

At this point i kept getting crashes, but pulled through and finished the game even tho i still got random crashes just starring at a wall or a floor. Had no mods installed so the crashes couldn't be caused from them.
For a game that has this many issues it baffles me that you can buy it even tho it's not working 100%.

As a conclusion i loved this game playing it for the first time back in the day and mostly enjoyed my time with it replaying it. I cannot recommend this because it's not working properly, even if you jump through hoops to find a fix for the game it will still crash out of the blue.
Buy it if you want fun gun play, good quests and interesting locations to visit, but be prepared to have a lot of crashes and save often.",1681731898,1681732459,False,8,1,0.544897377490997314,0,True,False,False

 https://www.youtube.com/user/ClassyManIAm . He's a great guy that covers lots of things about fallout 3's big and somewhat exciting world. But if you really want to experience this game download mods they fix most of the problems in this game. 

Pros
-The world of fallout 3
- The intresting lore
-Dlc's
-Vats i guess
Cons 
-Repair system
-Karma system
-Weapons
-The ending
-The slow start which can be fixed by mods
-The gamebryo engine
-The fact that in the main story you're mostly just being handholded by other characters. Or in other words the lack of decisions.

It works. 

[b]Long version: [/b]

No, really. It needs a bit of fiddling to get it running on modern hardware under steam, but it is actually doable. If it doesn't work after installation and first time setup (they patched the game in 2021), you can download the old depot (preferably for your language) via steam console and install the Xliveredist... file (Windows Live folder) or you can try your luck with one of the many guides here on steam *caugh.

You don't have to create an account or sign into Games fo Windows Life.


Since that's out of the way, up to the game itself.
The graphics are very dated (old) in 2023. But the game still good under the hood. 
The story is interesting and entertaining. Just ignore the mainstory for a while to gather enough sidequests and you're set for days. 
The pathfinding of the npcs is very rough around the edges. Remember this game was developed almost 20 years ago. The overall graphics aren't crystal clear and sharp like modern games, but if you played Oblivion or Fallout New Vegas recently you get used to it really quick.
Gameplay is actually fun. I personally prefer the old skill based character development and constant skill checks while on a mission. Everytime you level up you have to think and plan, how you invest your hard earned points. The level cap is not so great, reminds me of Fallout (1). All great games, no question there.
Sprinting is not allowed, or I haven't found it yet. So, activate always run and auto-walk and enjoy the show.
Hostiles are pretty rare in these parts of the wasteland, but when they show up it gets messy.
A working karma system to affect npc behavior towards you, important for access to companions.
As a former member of the thieves guild, I play as an evil person. Because every item you steal gives you bad karma, doesn't matter if anyone sees you taking it or not. But I was finally able to get a crazy Mr. Gutsy as companion. I played a lot of Fallout3 back in the days on X-Box and PC, but I can't remember having a Gutsy.
It's quite refreshing to take a break from good ol'Boston and visit the Capital Wasteland again after so many years. 

Bugs and crashes: So far, no bugged quests and only two crashes on fast travel. If save on travel is active, this shouldn't cause any trouble.

I already killed the Overseer of my vault in front of his daughter, who helped me escape after this tragic incident. (bad karma) Why? It's a tradition. 
Helped Button Gwinnett to forge the Declaration of Independence (for good karma).
Watched a Paladin of the BOS getting killed by a radroach. Hey, free power armor. (no karma effect)

TL;DR:
You may have played Fallout New Vegas, Skyrim or Fallout 4. This is very similar. It's an open-world sandbox RPG where you explore, complete quests & unalive your enemies. Fallout 3 is a reboot of the Fallout series under a new developer and manages to capture the atmosphere perfectly as it recreates it in 3D.

[H1]Setting[/h1]
Fallout 3 takes place in the Capital Wasteland, a post-apocalyptic Washington D.C. in 2277, the capital of the United States. This is around 36 years after Fallout 2. In 2077, the world was destroyed in a thermonuclear exchange known as the Great War; it only lasted a few hours but left the world in ruins. Fallout 3, 200 years after atomic annihilation depicts the ruined capital of the US, once a seat of power in the world, now a wasteland of mutated creatures, raider and the last remaining few trying to survive.

[h1]World Design[/h1]
The world design of Fallout 3 is fantastic. Understandably, the graphics themselves are a bit dated, but the design is beautiful. Bethesda are masters of world design, as many know. The Capital Wasteland features fantastic locations such as the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, The White House, United States Capitol Building & Bethesda itself!
In the Capital Wasteland, there lives only a few bastions of civilisation; notably the town of Megaton, Tenpenny Tower, Rivet City along with a few smaller locations such as Big Town, Little Lamplight & Oasis. 

The urban environments are very well done, featuring makeshift homes and buildings, barely functional infrastructure and creative defences. These settlements are a reminder that there's hope for humanity to rebuild, and that the world outside is dangerous and unforgiving. 

Between these cradles of civilisation is a desolate wasteland where near everything is a threat. Raiders want to kill you, animals want to eat you & radroaches want to... i'm not sure, better shoot them anyway. As it's designed to be a wasteland, most of the landscape is rocky, barren and notably devoid of life, almost. The beauty in the game design of Fallout 3 is the pacing between discovering something new. You will often come across ruins occupied by raiders, animals and settlements to take refuge; all of these things remind you that the world is not as empty as it seems, life is there if you look close enough, and with life, there's hope for the world.

[h1]Story[/h1]
The main story is the weakest point of Fallout 3. It mostly serves as a narrative tool to entice the player to keep going and experience the rest of the game. It also serves as justification for being in the world and going to key areas. Still, it's not terrible and the main characters are done really well. Your father, a scientist desperate to bring clean water to the wasteland, wonderfully voiced by Liam Neeson. Elder Owyn Lyons of the Brotherhood of Steel, a recurring faction of the Fallout series that returns here in a different way. Madison li, a colleague of your father working on Project Purity. These are just some of the fantastic characters in this game.
You grow up in a vault, one of many underground bunkers designed to preserve humanity from the nuclear bombs. One day your father leaves and you follow shortly after him. Now shut out of your home and everyone you know, along in the wasteland, with your only objective to find your dad. 
Where did he go?

The side content of Fallout 3 is far better both in it's design and narrative. Your choices may have consequences and your options may not always be so clear. They often involve you picking a side in a conflict, with different ways to achieve your goal. Interact with the characters, listen to them, understand them and make your choice, just be prepared to live with your consequence.
Fallout 3 features various companions you can encounter and take with you on your adventures. Some of these characters are locked behind a karma level, something that will change depending on your choices throughout your experience playing. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2949488171

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
This is an RPG that allows you to create and build your character throughout your experience with the game. As you play you'll gain XP from killing enemies and completing quests. Upon levelling up you can allocate skill points of your choosing into thirteen different skills such as bartering, small guns, lockpicking and speech. These skills will make you better at each of these things and may even unlock new dialogue options and quest choice opportunities.

The game itself is a sandbox. You will freely explore at your leisure, going where you want, when you want. You start in the centre of the map and are free to go wherever as soon as you leave the vault. It controls like other Bethesda games, you move around in an open 3D space, have an inventory system and are able to use whichever clothing, armour and weapons you want. You take damage from enemies but also take radiation from irradiated food, water or nuclear waste.

Overall, Fallout 3 is a beautifully melancholic experience that puts you in a sad and ruined world with only a few remaining iconic features of the old world long gone. There's hope that humanity can keep going, rebuild and perhaps one day thrive, but first it has to survive.

The DLCs in Fallout 3 are like little slices of heaven. There's Operation: Anchorage, which is like a military simulator on steroids. Then there's The Pitt, which takes you to a post-apocalyptic version of Pittsburgh that's just dripping with atmosphere. And let's not forget about Point Lookout, where you get to explore the swamps of Maryland and fight hillbilly zombies. It's like a redneck rave, but with more blood.

The best part about the DLCs is that they're all so different. Each one has its own unique story, characters, and challenges. It's like getting four different games for the price of one. And let's face it, who doesn't love a good bargain?

The graphics in Fallout 3 are a bit dated, but that just adds to the game's charm. It's like playing a classic movie that's been remastered in HD. And the music? It's like a trip down memory lane, with classic tunes from the 40s and 50s.

All in all, Fallout 3 is a game that will suck you in and never let go. And if you haven't played the DLCs yet, then you're missing out on some of the best content this game has to offer.

However, when the player's father mysteriously disappears, the player is forced to leave the vault and venture out into the wasteland to find him.

The game also features a robust character creation system that allows players to customize their character's appearance and choose from a variety of skills and perks. This allows for a high degree of player agency in how they choose to approach the game's challenges.

Players can use a variety of weapons, from guns to melee weapons, to take on enemies. The game also features a V.A.T.S. (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System) system that allows players to pause the game and target specific body parts on enemies, adding a tactical element to the combat.

Had to use a mod just to make the game work, this is after multiple weeks of attempting to find work-arounds that did not involve actively installing a third-party. If a third-party is needed to make a game work, the game seriously needs to be looked at.

The game is also very laggy, even when the settings are all turned down, they still do not help with the lag. This is strange for my computer, which can run most games, including Fallout New Vegas, in a far better and much more stable manner.

Game crashes or bugs out when tabbing out, forcing it to be forcefully ""stopped"" in steam or ended by task manager. This includes the game turning into a single white bar with the name running across the screen and being unable to tab out of the game with it crashing, forcing me to go to an entirely different screen and end it with task manager there.

When pausing the game with a controller, options like ""vibrations"" turn back on, and there is no permanent way to turn it off as of writing this. I don't like mouse and keyboard controls and I wish to feel nostalgic, but playing with a constantly vibrating controller that cannot be permanently turned off is very annoying.",1658099641,1679468390,False,1,0,0.504132211208343506,0,True,False,False

-Decent map detail and exploration

-liam neeson is your dad

Cons:
-Startup issues with newer windows systems
-traveling to other places sometimes crashes the game
-graphics aren't the best
-Combat feels clunky, no iron sights like new vegas
-the ending without broken steel was dumb.

Coming back to this title after playing it upon its debut in 2008 reminds one more clearly of its strengths: more focused quests and environments (albeit less charitable to the player), enemies that continue to frighten well into the upper levels of your player-character,  and an underlying approach to the whole thing which feels less designed to offer compromise to the player; you must adapt more to it, than it has been adapted to you (which is truer of most games the further back you go). 

As it would turn out, the dialogue and NPC interaction of its successors—FO:NV, and FO4, primarily—are not categorical improvements, but merely different. They don't necessarily feel much more or less 'organic' than this, which is a point in FO3's favour, here. Now-typical of Bethesda, you do hear the same lines repeated from about 5 different voice actors over and over again (or so it seems), even delivered in the same intonation. It seems something inescapable to Bethesda's developmental approach at this point, being a problem that is common to most of their titles. 

Graphics are what they are, ie products of 2008, but still manage to impress at surprising instances. Many vistas are downright gorgeous, and the various locales all just 'look right'. More importantly, the art & visual direction which go into crafting the 'feel' of the game is tightly-coordinated and nearly always achieves what it sets out to do (the feeling of the rust-ridden, abandoned Vault 87; the desolate emptiness of a super duper mart which nevertheless still hides raiders; the high-camp, saccharine pleasantry of the Tranquility Lane 'experience' come to mind, or the familiar dread that comes with probing into dark environments). This is a relatively consistent strength among the Bethesda titles. 

Technically, its sound design is impeccable. However, the overuse of a number of stock sounds which are deployed very frequently can give it a mechanical (ie repetitive, automated/cyclic) feeling. Between this and the issue already mentioned with dialogue, which continues to plague their series, it's practically to be expected. The benefit here, however, is that as of 2008, Bethesda hadn't overgrown their britches just yet, and so you don't get quite the same smug self-satisfaction of a developer proud of including 28million more lines of dialogue . . . from the same 5 voice actors. (I know there is more variation than this—I am being facetiously simplistic—but it's a clear problem of theirs'. ""I used to be an adventurer like you. . . "" come to mind?) 

TL;DR Verdict?

""Mostly excellent, with some deserved critique""—but a AAA title nonetheless. Ironically, it's less the technological limitations to its development hampering the experience, than it is the many elective choices they made which paved such a road to this destination. 

Forever-tailing the illustrious trajectory of this series, however, remains the inescapable reality of the fact that Fallout 3, in contrast to FO1 & 2, is now condemned to forever remain an ""Elder Scrolls: Morrowind"" game grafted into the diagetic 'world' of the Fallout series, departing only from its design and narrative logic as much as is necessary to 'pass', for a while, as an original iteration of the seminal series. The threads, so to speak, cease to self-weave and are now part of the same, impressively-lucrative tapestry.

Yes it says I only have 11 hours playing this game and I have reviews several years old of the previous main Fallout games on here.  But this game was my first experience with Fallout when I purchased it in 2009 on my Xbox 360, because my parents wouldn't let me purchase GTA 4 as I was only 13 at the time.  I have to say what I couldn't have imagined saying back then: Thank you mom and dad for not letting me get GTA, as I probably wouldn't have gotten into this series as soon, or ever.

Fallout 3 is a massive RPG where you can explore a post apocalyptic wasteland where there is absolutely no shortage of things to do.  Fight mutants, talk to morally questionable characters, enslave people, be Nicolas Cage and steal the Declaration of Independence, the works!  The way to accomplish this is all up to you as well as you can customize your character in multiple manners that offer several unique ways to experience the game.  Whether you want to be a brute that clubs enemies to death, or a finesse assassin that takes out targets via stealth, or a smooth talker that uses words to get his way, or even some combination of all of them!  There is great variety in weapons and enemies to fight.  You can use melee weapons, firearms, explosives etc. to deal with bloodthirsty raiders, freakish zombie ghouls and the rest of irradiated abominations that you will encounter in the wasteland.

The amount of quests is also very abundant as you can easily log 100+ hours doing activities in the wasteland without even focusing on the main story questline.  Many of them are unique and interesting.  Others are relatively ""meh"" at best, but will normally reward you quite generously with Exp, and item or even possibly a Perk that upgrades your character.

There are few negatives to this game I can provide, one being that it does take approximately 20-40 minutes to get to the true freedom that you are normally provided within the first 5 minutes of the other games in the series due to this games intro.  Also the shooting aspect of the game can be a little wonky even once fully upgraded as the game does try to put the RPG aspect first and want you to rely on the VATS system to properly shoot.  And something that is not this games fault, but New Vegas to me is definitely a superior experience in almost every facet and it is hard to not compare the games due to how similar they are, but this game will offer unique experiences you won't find in New Vegas.

Overall I cannot recommend this game enough and the series is legendary for a reason.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone that would love to get into Fallout or even to just enjoy a great RPG.",1677174114,1677174114,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has been 10 years since I have seen the Capital Wasteland. Ten years since I have visited the foggy swamps of Point Lookout. Ten years since I have fought my way through the grim of The Pit. Ten years since I have regretted buying Mothership Zeta. Like many others, my first Fallout experience was Fallout 3, a game which I still have the physical disc. A game which stole hundreds of hours from my life and Games For Windows Live holding my achievements and records until the day that it died like an ember falling to the ground. The official walkthrough with map has long been buried under dust and forgotten about. Ten years...

It was time. It was time to dust the walkthrough off and drag out the map. It was time to return to Point Lookout and taste the fruit. It was time to cause an uprising in The Pitt. It was time to go and take the tower for the Ghouls. It was time to rewrite the Wasteland Survival guide again. It was time, to say goodbye to a childhood friend again. All this and more, a time before the Zone of STALKER, there was the Capital Wasteland it was time to return. Setting foot outside 101 once again, the burning rays of sun wash over me and the jet powered gate of Megaton lifts. Before the Zone there was here, and I have returned.

This game is awful. The art design is inconsistent, ranging from pure greyscale to moderate colors of rust and dingy greens.

The difficulty balance is atrocious, with a sweet spot of around levels 15-20, but damage sponges being the most common enemies around after that. The DLCs are also a let down, as they have very interesting concepts that are completely wasted. Strangely enough, as much as it is fun to hate on Fallout 4, it is just the superior game.

I don't know why this is happening, but no solution I have tried has worked. I've followed every guide I could find from the past 3 years, including going into Nexus and downloading the Intel bypass that someone said worked for them; it didn't do the trick for this laptop. Game is very fun, but I can no longer play it due to whatever the hell the team that are updating this are doing. It seems like 50% of the players say it runs perfectly fine, while the rest were suddenly locked out of being able to play after getting past the main menu, where the game looks like it'll load but then freezes and then kicks you out. Again, very fun game, but whoever's been left in charge of the Steam port needs to fix this issue. If people are having to jump through so many hoops just to play, and you say that you eliminated the need to do that anymore, you clearly haven't.

EDIT: I found a video that FINALLY gave me the solution, and I'll post the link here. It's the most recent one I could find and is literally just a bit over a minute long.

A seminal part of my gaming history, Fallout 3 will likely always be my favorite of the series. From growing up playing the first with my dad to the modern day iterations, Fallout 3 still has the most engaging, heartfelt, and enjoyable storyline and gameplay for me. Though 4 is a marvel and the settlement system certainly stole my heart, I still love 3 above all. Far from a perfect first person shooter (this ain't a shooter, no matter what they want you to believe), Fallout 3 is more about the absurd fun you can have, the emotional connection to your father, and the people you help (or destroy) along the way. 

[b][u]Character Customization[/u][/b]
Still a game from 2008, so don't expect too much. The game still had quite a few options for it's age and more than many modern releases, so it's certainly still a good example of character customization! Just don't expect Fallout 4 levels of customization. There's plenty of clothing and weapon options for you to customize your outfits and load-out, so there's plenty to use to express yourself. 

[b][u]Open World[/u][/b]
Large open world map for it's time that still holds up in 2023. This is a open world map circa 2008 so there will be large swaths of open space with nothing but a few enemies. Still plenty of fun things to stumble across that aren't on the map though, so keep exploring. I swear I find something new every time I replay the game.

[b][u]FPS[/u][/b]
The game was never originally designed to be a true shooter, so don't expect perfect shooting mechanics. No inherent cover based system, so be prepared to spray and pray. 

[b][u]Mini Games[/u][/b]
A constant feature, but you'll figure out your own way around those if you don't enjoy them or learn to game the system however works best for you. Lock picking can be finicky on PC (or maybe it's just mine?) and I much preferred it on both PS3 and PS4. Computer password cracking is always my least favorite part, but the rules are fairly simple once you know em. 

[b][u]Replayability[/u][/b]
I've probably played through this game a dozen a time and still find something new to explore or experience each time. Story can change pretty drastically depending on your choices, so try to replay with different karma levels or choices. It'll keep it pretty fresh. I've conservatively put more than 100 hours into multiple playthroughs, so this is a game that keeps on giving.",1675551633,1675552445,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its stories is okay for a novel, but not for a game! A GAME! Do you what is a game? A game is about strategy, experience and different choices. But Fallout 3 always feels so stiff and contrived. Why the hell I lose karma when killing hideous xeno workers? Why people in Big Town rather snuff it than move to other places? Why letting Fawkes enter the code makes him a REAL HERO and I a cheeky little bleeder? Why? WHY!?

The karma system is terrible, and this game always judges me, judges me, judges me. I played this game when I was young, and now play it again. I just don't enjoy this game. I tried, but I can't. Fallout 3 has a really strange moral standard. Many dialog options are so weird that a normal person won't choose them at all. We don't live in a world of black and white morality!

[i]Fallout 3[/i] is an action role-playing game. The story is simple and interesting: the plot takes place in the year 2277, in the ruins of Washington D.C. mainly. The cities were devastated caused by the nuclear holocaust after strong tensions between countries due to the scarcity of resources. Some people were called to take refuge in the shelter sponsored by Vault-tec. Over the years, people began a life inside the vault. Our character, a role to play (he/she), shelter 101 is born. [i]It grows, it was formed, and it reaches youth[/i]. One day its father, Dr. James, leaves the shelter and the most important quote in the game: the biblical passage [i]Revelation 21:6[/i]. As soon as our character and all the vault staff find out, we decide to leave before the security lockdown. The adventure begins when we explore the wasteland with the only clue in hand: visit the city of Megaton. With all the means to find the father, we will find him at the Jefferson Memorial. He is working on the purity project, a project that aims to provide clean water to all of Washington. For that we will need a Garden of Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.). A type of war technology and, in turn, it will allow the activation of the purifier. We will deal with the Enclave and decide the fate of the wasteland.

It is difficult to summarize the content seen in this game. The way of describing it is generally considered two strong elements of the game. The artistic design and the narrative. The art of the game has two important aspects: the aspect of desolation (the wasteland) and what remains of the big cities. In the first case we will immerse ourselves in places similar to a wasteland with ruins of buildings, bridges and roads. The game is an open world. We will see what remains after the great wars: ruins and that feeling of desolation and hostility. In the second case, at the same time the appearance of the colourful past of cities is included. It draws on 1950s US culture, albeit with a steampunk twist. Well, it is a world parallel to ours, a universe with different technological progress but, up to a certain point, similar. The drab and warm colours of the landscape blend with the rust tone of the metal, while the festive or cheerful tones, for example Nuka Cola, create a good aesthetic-visual balance.

Visual art maintains the balance between past and present. This is reinforced with the game's narration. The story unfolds and takes place in a world parallel to ours. Each moment of the story plunges us into a different world, hostile but also well known. The most important [i]incipit[/i] of the game as well as the sequels is pronounced like this, ""War.....War Never Changes"". We will see how people look for a way to survive. Each character speaks and tells the story of his life in the city, or what is left of it. They will talk about their experiences in the new world. But they will also talk about their past before the war. This makes the role-playing game immersive, rich in narrative, interactive with the different characters. There are different characters with personalities from charismatic to evil. It contains a wide variety of well-crafted dialogue lines. We will constantly make decisions until we reach the outcome of the story. Fallout is a new world.

[b]Playability[/b] 10/10

The game consists of the role-playing game. We can build our character according to our way of playing. We choose, the importance of freedom and determination in this game, our appearance as well as the path how we will walk it for what is basic at all times. The look is selectable, aspect and gender. At the beginning of the game, more choices will appear, in the prologue, such as the adoption of certain essential skills for the character in the so-called S.P.E.C.I.A.L. With that we can decide and prefer whether to be charismatic to have good conversations or resistant to survive the fierce battles. It also includes an additional test to award points for such skills that we will prefer throughout our tour. It's called G.O.A.T., it is the set of skills with which we will specialize. As we progress through the game, we will acquire experience points to improve our character. We can improve our ability to be medics, handling weapons, melee, opening locks, stealth and among others. Added to this is the karma system. Depending on our decisions and actions, we will get good or bad karma that will affect our path in the wasteland as the interaction with other characters, with which it will affect our ending in the game.

The game is not necessarily about shooting. Not even fps. The type of camera can be adjusted and configured. It depends on the gameplay and the choice of gameplay through the selected skills, we can have a lot of possibilities how to play it. To this is added, once exposed to the elements of the wasteland, the need to obtain resources. This game depends on the levelling system and looting. This way we will get the wasteland coins, the bottle caps, to exchange them for services and products. Looting we will find the essential resources: from water and medicines to weapons and components and scrap metal. We will have the support of an ally, as well as the support of some communities, we do help them with their needs. We will be able to take a companion, like [i]Dogmeat[/i], a dog that we will find in the junkyard or Star Paladin Cross, among other characters and some depending on our type of karma. There are many things to describe and what the game offers in an almost free, kind of creative sandbox. Perhaps the negatives are the classic funny mistakes. But nothing that affects the gameplay and its features.

[b]Music and FX[/b] 10/10

The music is an interesting and well done work. We can consider it in two ways as they are in the game. The soundtrack as background, ambient music and music from the radio. For the first case, the music is linked to the story of the game. It consists of a mixture of tones such as military marches with classical and dark ambient. Like the soundtrack to some war movies, but with a post-nuclear and leading-a-battle feel. While other times, music is present in our battles, or ambient music on our journey. Sometimes it sounds pompous and energetic. Other times we hear mysterious, sinister or desolate. They certainly managed to find the sensation after the catastrophe with those ambient music tracks.

The other part of the soundtrack is found in the music on the radio. By activating the Pip-Boy, we can see the radio stations. Some only speak (Enclave Radio), but others broadcast music from the 40-50s. Well we can choose the radio station with the voice Three Dog, that is, in Galaxy News Radio (news more music). Or, help Agatha get the Soil Stradivarius violin so she will pass on unique violin pieces in which she interprets pieces by Bach, Dvořák and Sarasate. We can enjoy classical music as well as what remains of the radio. Styles like swing, jazz, rhythm & blues, rock n' roll or dixieland are among those. Some artists that we will find, Roy Brown, Cole Porter, The Ink Spots or Billie Holiday. Music that will accompany us in the wilderness.

[b]Duration[/b] 10/10

This is a vast game with many locations and sites to explore. In addition to having the freedom to do different activities within the game. It contains quite interesting missions and side quests. Without forgetting the diversity of characters and discoveries within the wasteland capital. We can re-play it in different ways, with a wide possibility of combinations. It is worth mentioning the presence of the DLCs. Each contains an interesting story that allows us to understand the context of the world of Fallout. Or, explore other places with unusual stories, after our exploration we will have a reward such as new weapons. With a vast content, Fallout 3 offers a different world, rich in history, a universe parallel to ours.

I did have an issue on my desktop, but wasn't able to replicate it on my laptop, so I'm gonna assume it was a compatibility error, one which was fixed by downloading a third party dll fix. Again, after that it worked absolutely flawlessly. Miles better than the trainwreck of compatibility that is Fallout New Vegas.

I could comment more on the story/gameplay, but honestly most will know it by now. It's really good, if not a bit short due to the map size and main questline length(to be fair, you're not intended to do it back to back, but it's an important point to note). The GOTY edition really makes this game. Broken Steel fixes one of the biggest logic-holes the franchise has, and adds a much better, more fulfilling ending. The rest of the DLCs are truly great, full of cool new items and vastly different stories. Operation Anchorage specifically fixes one of the biggest gameplay issues by teaching you Power Armor Training at the end of the DLC, rather than having to start the final main quest to unlock it otherwise.

Even excluding DLC, this game has by far the best and most creative side quests of the Bethesda era games, and it's not even close. DLC only amplifies that. It's truly a phenomenal game.

Well well well, 130 hours spent in this game under 3 weeks, talk about dedication!

To put it bluntly, I've already played and finished Fallout 3 'vanilla', without any DLC, back in 2008. Really loved the game and once I wanted to fire up the DLC, my saves were corrupted somehow. Didn't had the will to restart the whole thing back then so kept the game on hold ever since...

Until lately, had the immense urge to really play it again... with the marvelous help of Fallout 3 WIKIA though! Could save lots of time that way!

What can I say about this game? Perfect blend of First Person Shooter and Role Playing Game, in a post-apocalypse setting. I had already played, quite briefly, F1, F2 long long ago and even if the Turn Base was appealing at that time, I still prefer this new formula, where you can explore the world in full 3D!

What else to add? One of my favorite game of all time for sure!


[h1]POSITIVES:[/h1]
[b]+HUGE world to explore, with lots and lots of locations.
+Freedom to explore what you want, when you want.
+Fantastic quests that can be completed in a variety of satisfying ways.
+VATS combat system results in all sorts of tense and gruesome encounters.
+Outstanding art design makes for a desolate Capital Wasteland.   
+Rewarding mixture of excitement and atmospheric exploration.
+FIVE awesome DLC additions on the game which add lots of content and about 15-20 hours of additional playtime.[/b]


[h1]NEGATIVES:[/h1]
[b]-The story and characters can feel a bit sterile.
-VATS mode can make the overall combat very easy to accomplish.
-Lacks enemies/monsters variety.
-Dated engine in today's term.
-VERY BUGGY on Windows 8 Pro x64... until you patch up the game from many tutorials found on the web. Mainly, the game crashes often until you setup the number of CORES your PC has. And, the radio station stuttering was annoying too until you find the fix! Look the web!
-Only ONE companion at all time (unless you count Dogmeat as companion, then it is two).
-Fawkes companion makes you *almost* invincible. But hey, that companion truly rocks! *There is safety in mindfulness!*
-Can't join the Enclave :(  Really liked those evil basterds![/b]

I'd recommend this game because (like many Bethesda games) the world design is top tier and exploration is simply amazing. There are so many unmarked locations and cool places to explore not to mention unique weapons/loot. The game's story is also top notch and builds perfectly upon the previous installments. The DLC is also great and adds even more interesting exploration and story to the base game with The Pitt being one of my all-time favorite DLCs in the series. The freedom of choice the player has in Fallout 3 is excellent via character customization (through leveling) as well as in-game choices. The combat system certainly shows its age and is not as good as Fallout 4's but is still pretty decent. The game does have its fair amount of bugs and glitches (like many Bethesda games do) but they don't significantly impact game play. One major issue is that the game is not optimized to run on newer computers and crashes a fair amount in my experience although there may be ways to remedy this.

Should you buy and play this game? Yes. If you like FPS games, you'll like this game. If you like turn-based RPGs, you'll like this game. If you like 3D action/adventure games, you'll like this game.

The stories are great, the DLCs are hit and miss (but when they hit, they hit exceptionally well) and the combat works pretty well regardless of whether you use V.A.T.S. or just run-n-gun.

A con of this game is that the bugs are catastrophically bad. I mean they are so bad that you can glitch to the point where your save file becomes worthless because restarting the game and reloading the save file do not help you get unstuck from the environment.

You really need to install all the community patches and updates before you start a campaign because unless you do, the game will crash. A lot.

There is easily over a hundred hours of content in this game (not counting replays where you pick different choices). The choices matter and really affect play through, and the decisions made by you and others permanently alter the state of the game.

The other thing that annoys me is that traversing through DC is pretty tedious because you must use the metro system since so many parts of the city are obstructed by rubble, and often in ways that don't make sense geographically. Sometimes the map can help you figure out which metro you can use but a lot of your navigation will come from trial and error and you'll  have to revisit the same metro stations over and over trying to reach your destination. The metro maps provided in game don't provide a comprehensive list of all the stations accessible nor do they give you a detailed architecture of the tunnels, you'll have to make your way through it yourself and they are quite dangerous. Save often.

I'm 81 hours into it and while I took the trouble of visiting every single explorable location on the map, I think I've only actually entered and interacted with maybe 40% of them. I really wish I had installed all the community patches and mods before launching the campaign because the time I would have saved from not dealing with bugs would have allowed me to progress through the game much more quickly.

Final score: 8.5/10 with a point deducted for how bad the bugs are and half a point deducted for the tediousness of navigating the metro. To be fair, the mutants inhabiting it in this game aren't much more hostile than the people you'll encounter on the train in real life, but the navigation could be more clear in terms of which stops are connected.

I spent many hours on this game on my Xbox (and later PS3) and loved just about every second I spent on this. 13 years later, and I'm still convinced this is my favorite Fallout title, possibly a contender for my favorite video game of all time.

Pros
-Fun bits of storytelling and writing across many instances in the game, mostly in side quests, but sprinkled into the main plot too
-Radio system is revolutionary to the series, and creates not just a tone modifier for the game's feel, but also reinforces you with a station that has a personality that provides you with feedback on your decisions and actions (basically, does he think what you did in this town was good or bad); It makes you feel like your actions have impact and consequences
-The game is very subtle in it's willingness to guide the player, but it succeeds, and very actively encourages the player to explore, which is great because there are so many dungeons scattered all over the wasteland
-Fun, adventurous DLC

Cons
-It's basically a huge pain to even get to work properly on devices with Windows 8 and newer
-Even if you get it to run properly on a newer device, it's still an old Bethesda game, so bugs galore
-Linear plot-line, very easy to be discouraged when you know it only leads to the same ending (side quests are still very fun)
-Level scaling gets too easy at a certain point in the game; even on Very Hard difficulty, once you reach a certain level, only a handful of enemies will give you any challenge. It can make progression and achievement very boring very fast
-Metro tunnels are not properly introduced and are thus very confusing to many players, even veterans. I didn't even learn how it worked until I watched a youtuber replay Fallout 3 and when he actively explained how the metro system actually worked (this is about 14 years after I had ever picked up the game in the first place)

Overall, this is easily hands down my favorite Fallout game, and favorite Bethesda RPG to date, and I strongly encourage this game to anybody who's even remotely interested in any of Bethesda's other RPGs, including any other Fallout title, or Elder Scrolls.",1451804302,1673418154,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its not a true role playing game because you can pretty much invest so many points into each stat that your character becomes a god by level 12 or 15. The Tesla Cannon weapon added by Broken Steel is too powerful, with enough ammo you can destroy any enemy in the game.

The quests were fun if a little boring, however you can easily just save before every speech check in order to bypass the games speech checks. Speech being one of the most important skills to invest points into of course. The side quests and main quest are some of the high points of the game and pretty much the reason for playing it in the first place. Still, the voice acting is terrible and all of the characters are forgettable and one dimensional.

The Deathclaws and Super Mutants were never strong enough. By level 15 the Deathclaws are like puppies and the super mutants are incredibly easy to take down with the sniper rifle or Chinese Assault Rifle. They could have made the game more difficult by making stimpacks rarer and more pricey to buy from merchants. Its insanely easy to become rich in the Capital Wasteland as well.

You could hypothetically just wait endlessly and then return to locations where there’s raiders to get infinite amounts of experience points. Another problem with the game is that energy weapons are not available to the player until they progress significantly in the game. This is not true to how a Fallout game is supposed to be designed. Energy weapons such as the laser and plasma pistols are supposed to be found very early in the game for a player that wants to make an energy weapons oriented protagonist. There's some pointless npcs in the game. Also the Brotherhood of Steel is not supposed to be helping the people in the wasteland if you know about Fallout's lore.

The Karma System always made sense to me. To people who haven't gotten around to playing Fallout 3, the game will occasionally reward the player for not doing things that are unlawful. An npc in Megaton will occasionally give you stimpacks and ammo if you disarm the bomb and have very good karma. If you choose to be sadistic and kill people indiscriminately, you can join the slavers who will reward you for enslaving innocent people. This will give you very evil karma and also I'll never understand people who just kill the games non hostile npc's for no real reason.

Another point to add is that in the original Fallout's, there were casinos. There's enough space in The Capital Wasteland to have included casinos for the hell of it. But for some reason the developers never found the time to put them in the game. 

Its a fun action adventure game, especially with mods such as Classic Fallout Weapons which adds some much needed variety to the weapons in the game.",1549494413,1673302443,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Then many years later I played Fallout 4 and I had a good time with it. Then I thought I would grab it and Fallout New Vegas.

Man was I disappointed. Playing it just feels like something dated.

You can tell a lot of it has aged, from the dialogue structure to the way events play out.

The main story is good enough but on how to resolve it are pretty ....not well thought out? There are some pretty good characters in the game but they are not well fleshed out when I interact with them.

The DLC's are...ok. But I kept feeling like the whole point of them was to see cool areas filled with damage sponges. I didn't necessary feel like I entered memorable areas.

I even modded it with the vanilla patches and had to do a lot of workarounds to get this to work properly on my RTX 3060 with Windows 11 machine. So that also added to my unpleasantness on replaying this game.

I don't regret my time with the game because it has made me think what I like and don't like in these open world RPG type games. But I would not recommend it unless you have the patience to sit through bugs, janky interactions and slightly outdated gameplay mechanics.

Most people, especially nowadays will shy away from it because of the outdated graphics, and everyone who knows Bethesda, knows that their games have their fair share of bugs.

But don't let that keep you from what will certainly be an amazing experience!
The colour scheme used gives it a real creepy, post apocalyptic vibe, it's amazing, like the world is devoid of every good emotion. The open world was like no one at the time, givving you near complete freedom to do everything you want, and I mean EVERYTHING!
take away the radio, and when you're exploring the metros, the ambient sounds and the constant state of alert for possible enemies will keep you on your toes. Don't like that atmosphere? Turn on Galaxy News Radio, the game suddenly feels a lot more calm.

Excelent story, good character creation (though the voices and lines start repeating when you meet so many new NPC's down the line), great community for any doubts and the modding community is simply amazing!

The world is amazing, I love having an adventure in the barren, almost horrifying at times Capital Wasteland scavenging ruins and struggling to survive encounters (during the early game at least), and the fact that most unique weapons and bobbleheads can be found in the wild rather than from doing quests is a great way to make exploring feel fun. 

Although I prefer the New Vegas soundtrack, the soundtrack here, both ambient and radio, does an excellent job thematically, even if Bethesda just followed what Black Isle did using ""I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire"" during the Fallout 1 intro. 

The plot, although not the strongest, replicated a classic Fallout story well enough, although the real fun is in the side quests. Superhuman Gambit, Oasis, Wasteland Survival Guide and Big Trouble in Big Town for example are all really fun, well created quests.

Although the gun-play is kind of weak (no ADS) this doesn't stop it from still being fun. Weapons like the Combat Shotgun, Lincoln's Repeater, the Sniper Rifle and more feel amazing to fire in part due to the sound design and how corpses rag doll and explode in the Gamebryo engine (oh, how I miss you.).

The enemy design is so unique despite how much is carried over from previous entries in the series. Mirelurks fit the 50's monster design so well, and it's a shame that Fallout 4 redesigned the ghouls considering how well made they were in this generation.

There is so much more I could write about here, but I think I've illustrated what I think well enough. I love Fallout 3, and if you haven't played it, give it a chance. Just because it's outclassed by New Vegas doesn't mean Fallout 3 isn't also a great game in of its own right.",1672851180,1672851180,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Since, I am able to in a way use console cheats to enjoy this game a bit more on a level that I had not had a chance to on PlayStation. 

I have enjoyed this game since it first came out and when it added the DLC's. If you like the Fallout franchise, I would recommend buy this. Since, it was the 1st game that came away from how 1 and 2 were made. This also gave us a step into what these games can become when creating sequels for it as well. I will say that with the designs buy Adam Adamowicz, who was a concept artist for this game. His legacy can be seen in this game and as well as Skyrim. I will say that both of those games hold a place in the hearts of those that enjoyed the art of the game itself. I love this game over and over every time I play it. Knowing that his legacy and the love he placed into this game was seen through its play through.

However, seeing as it was the first in the FPS fallouts I will cut it a little slack, but still, play New Vegas instead.

This piss poor excuse for a role playing game will forever be the dried and crusty brown skid mark on the Fallout franchise. The game is too bright and happy, too clean in so many ways and they did almost nothing to respect the classic games which came before it. Bethesda bought the rights to an amazing and iconic franchise, riding the wave of classic CRPG nostalgia sparked by Dragon Age: Origins, and attempted to cash out with little effort or care beyond their marketing campaign.

Gameplay issues such as enemy levels scaling to match the player and being given unique or powerful weapons with too low of a durability rating to make them viable alternatives to your starting gear are a slap in the face to the history of this amazing series. 

By the time the events of Fallout 2 had rolled around, The wasteland was becoming a somewhat progressive place (relatively speaking), with intelligent deathclaws roaming about and Super Mutants like Marcus working together with humans, towards a future of mutual understanding and equality. Both have now been relegated to mindless enemies for you to blow apart in amazing, detailed 3D! Speaking of which, how is it possible that the original Fallout games had more satisfying death animations than this over-budgeted AAA title?

Game of the Year??? Yeah, maybe before Gamer Gate and with every gaming magazine plastered with another ad for whatever mediocre gaming experience that Bethesda was going to squeeze out from betwixt their hairy butt cheeks that quarter. Seriously, and this irks me to no end, the year that Skyrim came out was the year that Dark Souls debuted. Game Informer awarded Skyrim Game of the Year and Dark Souls was relegated to an honorable mention for the Capra Demon. Did any self respecting gamer who spent any length of time on both titles actually come away thinking that Skyrim was the better, more memorable experience? Much of the same can be said for Fallout 3.

I remember asking buddies at the time what they thought of the game and the general consensus was that the game was interesting and fun to explore, but that it was forgettable with a bad ending. Personally, having been a massive fan of both Fallout 1 and 2 and having played Arena, Daggerfall, and Morrowind, I was appalled and genuinely sick at the idea of Bethesda getting their hands on such a huge piece of my childhood and I knew from the beginning what an absolute bore this game was going to turn out to be. I was right. I was completely right. 

So, I suppose the best that can be said for this game is that it definitely delivered on what anyone experienced with Bethesda trash could or would expect and it certainly takes a degree of talent to take the polished gems that were Fallout 1 and 2 and distill them into reeking, steaming piles of Brahmin dung which are somehow more forgettable and boring than any Elder Scrolls game they've shat out before.

1/10

I'd rather be a fluffer at the Corsican Brothers film studio; I'd rather lose an arm wrestling match to Francis in Broken Hills and walk away with my very own souvenir to commemorate the experience; I'd rather wh0re myself out for Jet on the streets of New Reno with deathclaws and Frank Horrigan as my main Johns; I'd rather play almost anything than this disgrace of a game.

Most of my gameplay was similar to my Skyrim gameplay; I sneaked all the time and sniped enemies from afar. If this got up close and personal, my shotgun did the talking. It's quite nice.

The rest everything else depended on skills. Speech to haggle better rewards and persuade people. Lockpicking to gain access to pre- nuclear holocaust containers and doors. Science to hack computers and manipulate turrets to go rogue. Repair to disarm traps and improve weapons and armor. There's all sorts of fun stuff. In addition to all, there's quite a few unique perks that have an interesting effect on your gameplay.

Not much in the way of modding. I did play the game with ""essential"" mods; the kind of mods that improve performance and fix bugs. Despite them, my game did crash a couple of times. But *only* a couple of times total, so I'd say that's pretty darn good from a Bethesda game.

I beat the game in about 30 hours, trying to complete all the quests i came across, however, i barely came across any sidequests, with such uninteresting places i refused to go looking for these sidequests. I beat 1 of the dlcs, Operation Anchorage which was a great and interesting dlc and ultimately the most interesting part of fallout 3. 

Awful gameplay with with boring weapons that have you holding left click for about a minute and a half to kill your enemies. Good luck getting your bullets to hit as the collision is awful so you have your bullets hitting walls you werent aiming at or going straight through the chest of your enemies with no damage. Once wasting all your bullets you then gotta wait a good couple of months to get enough bullets, just for your game to crash. 

Half the map feels very empty with only the corner of the map having anything interesting in it and having quests that make you travel across the grey wasteland. Only redeeming quality of this game is Operation Anchorage and the very last mission, seeing Liberty Prime spew his propaganda while chucking nukes will always be a good watch.

Only play this game if you are a fan of the fallout series

The atmosphere played in pure vanilla is relatively stale, and mods will help breathe some more life back into Fallout 3. Some modifications even combine Fallout 3 and New Vegas to utilize the engine Obsidian used to run New Vegas. It can still be enjoyed with or without mods, but the game's outstanding title has been slowly fading away.

It took Bethesda 10 years just to remove Games for Windows Live (GfWL), just to make it a tad bit more playable. Those guys needs to get their priority's straight. 

Anyways, on to the subject at hand, although graphically dated, this game is my favourite Fallout, for multiple reasons.
For starters, it was the first Fallout game I ever played, which got me into the series of Fallout games in general, so it has the nostalgia effect.
Secondly, the writing and setting, is far superior to Fallout 4 & 76, making it a proper RPG with multiple good / bad dialogue options & positive / negative Karma.
It also provides you with a decent reason to start fighting the ""bad guys"" other than just a single-minded purpose, (Something that is lacking in other 3D Fallout games aside from Fallout: New Vegas) - To provide clean water to the Capital Wasteland.

Fallout 3 boasts a decent sized map, which provides an enjoyable exploration of a unique location, Washington D.C. With many landmarks to find, like the Washington Monument, the Capitol Building, Abraham Lincoln Memorial just to name a few.

Probably the best parts though, are the varying DLC's... Each one is something completely different and very enjoyable
Unfortunately, there's no achievements, any sense of achievement hunting was removed in the update that got rid of GfWL. Hopefully in the future they'll add steam achievements to the game but I doubt it.

Aside from the lack of achievements, the matter of it not being optimised for WIN10 OS resulting in more than a few crashes and the fact that it's graphically dated, this is still an amazing game, worth adding to your library at least.

New Vegas has better dlcs but the ones here were good too, just very short and not really fulfilling like New Vegas's were. The weapons and armor you get from them are probably the best thing about them since the stories are a little basic, with Point Lookout being the exception. The Pitt seemed promising, but again it was way too short!

And like all Bethesda games, the mods are all great. I especially liked the Alton, IL mod that added new quests and a new area twice as big as Point Lookout.

The game would not initially load past the Launcher screen in Windows 10/11 with a decent PC. The following solution worked from MiloTheGamingFox's video ""Fallout 3 GOTY (How to Fix) 1.7.0.4""

1) Windows Search -> type ""Graphics Settings""
2) Under Custom options for apps ->  select the ""Browse"" button
3) Navigate to your Games Location* -> find the executable file ""FalloutLauncherSteam"" and select ""Add""
4) Repeat #2  but select another file -> find the executable file ""Fallout3"" and select ""Add""
5) Still in the Graphics Settings -> click on the newly created ""Fallout 3 Launcher"" icon from the list below the browse button; select ""Options""; select ""High Performance""
6) Still in the Graphics Settings -> click on the newly created ""Fallout3"" icon from the list below the browse button; select ""Options""; select ""High Performance""
7) Start Fallout 3 from Steam like normal -> Success!

*To do all of this, you need to find your Steam games folder. Example: .../Steam/Steamapps/Common/Fallout 3 goty/ to locate the two files in steps #3 and #4 above. Most likely the initial folder for Steam will be on your Drive (like C:/, D:/, etc.) under "".../Program Files (x86)"". If you setup a custom Steam folder location like me, your file path may vary. I hope this helps someone, who can't start this older game on a newer PC...

Gameplay is by far really good with amazing side-quests especially my most favourite one which involves a undetonated Nuke, I won't spoil it for the new players as well as the next generation of players to come. I highly recommend playing it with the Tale Of Two Wastelands mod as it combines Fallout New Vegas and 3 together into one big game which runs off Fallout New Vegas. 

Overall, Its best to play the Game of the year version as it comes with all of the add-ons including Broken Steel which will make the game not end and will continue.

As a friend told me how to load the DLC i replayed the game and played all her DLC and finished it all in 45-50 hours

Fallout 3 - 7.25/10
The base game is fun but it lacks stuff to do and is far to much walking in tunnels and subways witch got very annoying to do

Operation: Anchorage - 10/10 
Really Fun to play and the power armor training was helpful and so was the reward for finishing this.

The Pitt - 9.25/10
It was pretty good and fun kinda short.

Broken Steel - 10/10 
Very short but allows you to play post-credits witch is really fun

Point Lookout - 2/10
This DLC was disappointing and way to short like 25-45 mins short and it only had like 1 main story that was just 3 quests long and you did not get anything good i left point lookout with only the perks it gives you

Bethesda does an incredible job of creating a hyper-immersive world that feels beyond neglected and totally haunted. Feels like real nuclear annihilation. The soundtrack has some truly awesome jazz hits ('Butcher Pete' - Roy Brown) that will stick with you for years after playing. I feel that Bethesda's writing talent really shows in this game - not particularly the main quest - but all the side narratives that you stumble upon randomly are all so fascinating and add so much depth to the world. The gunplay kinda sucks ass, but VATS makes up for it with these theatrical, dramatic and cinematic kills that are beyond satisfying. The gore is cheesy but super fun to watch (Bloody mess perk). FO3 is an unforgettable experience once you get properly immersed. I recommend playing it when you're not in a hurry, and have time to stop and smell the flowers. It's also creepy asf!!!!!!!! I would tag this game as Horror for sure. Play it!!!!! Lots of unsung praises from this classic gem.",1669102447,1669102447,True,1,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

This game *still* will not work on Windows 11, 10, or 8. Steam is selling games that don't work. Seems like a big ""fuck you"" to the customer to me. 

As for the game itself, it has some minor rough edges here and there, but it's still rated above Fallout 4......New Vegas is probably the best so far, but Fallout 3 is a great game. A classic, at this point I suppose you'd say. I could wish the first-person shooter aspects were a bit more clean and smooth, but it's not a game breaker even if you never use VATS mode. I've played and replayed through this big apocalyptic sandbox world I don't know how many times now, it's still fun. The choices you make actually change things!! Not fake ""role-play"" where you get three dialog choices and all get the same end result. You can seduce, smooth talk and bribe your way through problems, you can murder your way through problems, sneak past, or whatever you want to do. 


**The Verdict:  Absolutely worth the buy!....Just not on steam. Get a disc and run it in compatability mode, wait for it to be on GOG where they actually support what they sell, just don't buy a nonworking game from steam, even on sale.

This game spews crap. This game has some of the weakest writing I have ever seen in a major release. The world makes absolutely no sense, both by itself and within the series as a whole. Yeah it's atmospheric and whatnot, but once you question anything about this world, it all falls apart in both logic and consistency. There's a water crisis that no one besides like 5 people care about, there's no food anywhere, none of the major settlements grow anything, and the major factions are all rehashes from the classic games and just appear on the other side of the continent for the most bizzare reasons. I've read before that this game tried way to hard to be a Fallout game that it ended up feeling like poorly written fanfiction, and I have to agree completely.

There is however, moments of greatness. The world is very detailed and you can tell a lot of work went into the overall art style. Exploration is decent but I would say a tad-bit overrated since there's many spots that feel too much the same and the loot variety is lacking. But there's still some nice secrets to find. The random encounter system is also decent but the game relies too heavily on it to show it's world building. Almost nothing in the world changes on your actions even with Broken Steel.   All of these things are nice but overall doesn't change the fact that this game's praise is fueled primarily by fan's rose-tinted nostalgia. 

Although the base game alone is a solid 4/10, the GOTY makes up for it as some of the DLCs are great, most notably The Pitt and Point Lookout. Operation Anchorage is OK but far too linear and underwhelming. Mothership Zeta is beautiful to look at and explore but is by far the crappiest DLC of the bunch. Broken Steel is a must have simply because it fixes 3's garbage ending, somewhat. The ending is absolutely horrid but at least now you can send in your companions to press some buttons. Yippie. 

As a complete package, I'd give Fallout 3 GOTY Edition a 6/10. That's my rating even with rose-tinted glasses. If this wasn't my first Fallout I wouldn't be as kind.",1376334381,1668240178,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

Fallout 3 is a game with many flaws and some good things too.

[h1]The Story:[/h1]
What a lazy one. The biggest problem in the game, first of all, in all main quest seems your father is the game protagonist and you are a minor character in your own story. The story was poorly written with an unbelievable ending, a lot of plotholes, boring, and so much wasted potential, like the first Enclave encounter, speaking of Enclave, they're so weak and pathetic in this game. The secondary quests are good as usual in Bethesda games.
Almost DLCs are boring, The Pitt is the best one.
Broken Steel boring
Operation Anchorage:  ok
Point Lookout: boring af
Mothership Zeta: starts well but becomes boring

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
The best part of the game. A morbid and dark atmosphere, probably the best in the franchise, exploring the wasteland is always good, the caverns, buildings, and of course, the vaults, except for the metro stations, the first time you explore might be good, but after a while, it's just unbearable.

[h1]Bugs/technical issues:[/h1]
You didn't think you'd not suffer with them, did you? It's Bugthesda after all.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]

Playing as of late 2022 on GTX 1080 then RTX 3070 with i7-8700k on a 1080p 144 hz monitor, Windows 11

Game is tied to 60 fps, and frankly I don't feel it's worth fiddling to solve it. Mileage may vary depending on your patience.
Simply set your monitor refresh rate to 60 hz while playing, simple enough in Windows settings.
Game has had horrendous mouse acceleration from day one, thankfully it is easily fixed by editing an .ini
By doing what was necessary for and along with the unofficial community patch fix, I've had only a single crash (loading into Moira's for the first time)
Game doesn't like alt tabbing

Aside from that, fantastic stuff! I'd say for a gamer used to Bethesda jank, it's a very solid entry. Much more like Fallout New Vegas than I remember, and it's not far behind it at all in quality in my opinion. It's definitely worth playing. Alot of very goofy stuff

However, Unlike many games that offer the level of freedom and choice found here, Fallout 3 has an exciting, top-notch main story. It all comes together for a spectacular climax that is just flat out awesome. Rather than spoil the story, I'll simply say that it does not disappoint. What left me most impressed was how many different ways you can progress through the game. Lying, stealing, hacking, fighting; they're all open for you to use to solve problems. If you play your cards right you can even talk your way into, or luck upon, situations that offer massive shortcuts. The system is so flexible that the possible permutations are almost mind boggling. And yet it all ties back together in the end. And there is a true end to this game. Once you finish Fallout 3 and view the ending, you're booted back to the main menu.

Fallout 3 treats modern PC's (modern being anything past the original OS' it was designed for) as the true post apocolyptic wasteland.

The plus side is, we are PC gamer's, meaning we know a Nexus way to download a very helpful Mod from smart people to trick our PC's into believing we in 2008 and quite easily for a full 60+ FPS experience on Windows 11.

My hour count doesn't represent the years I have spent in the Wasteland because I played on consoles and even off disk for PC for a while.

It does what the modern Fallout games has gone and at this point that doesn't really need a review because the style of RPG is either for you or it's not but this game has one key aspect. Picking stuff up not to just add to your inventory but wave it around in the physical world.

There is something rather gratifying with say, grabbing the disembodied head of Mister Burke and waving it around like a medieval guard looking for a pike to stick it on saying to yourself ""Look! Without me you people of Megaton would be atomised!"" That is the sort of ""extra"" freedom I really appreciate.

That and skeletons. Credit where credit is due to being able to walk into houses and see the old skeleton remains of unlucky residents who didn't have a vault for protection. 

I guess that is my summary. Don't keep this game in a vault like the protagonists early years. Go back, dig it out and explore like it was 2008. Your PC will enjoy the trip back in time. It will make it feel young and overpowered again.",1667035599,1667035599,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You make your way there and see that there's a grand reopening for the restaurant and supposedly its under new management. This is exciting! You make your way in and the interior looks entirely different and the place has renamed itself into ""Bethesda"" instead of ""Black Isle"". That's a name that's familiar, they have a pizza place down the road with their famous ""Oblivion"" pizza. You sit down and look at the menu, which there is a menu now, its not just the special of the day anymore. There still is a special, ""Fallout 3"": spaghetti with eyeball meatballs. Sounds familiar enough, you had eyeballs at this place before and they were starting to grow on you. You ask the waiter for the special and they scoff at you and spit on your table.

Its super packed where it wasn't before. You decide to try it, nothing bad can happen surely. Its a bad flavor. The eyeballs exist but they don't have the same seasoning the noodles just aren't doing it for you and you're pretty sure the sauce is made of piss and spit.

Desert? You never ordered desert.

This is when I learned that you should wait for Bethesda to release their ""we fixed our stupid screw-ups that should never have been in the first release"" version.  Whoops!  I meant the ""Game of the Year"" version!  After downloading this game for PC only (console version just invites heart-ache,) you can also download the mods that fix Bethesda's BOSS-LEVEL stupidity.

Edit: Whoops!  I was ranting about this game!  I *loved* Fallout 1 and 2 and was excited to FINALLY experience Fallout 3!  Oh, but wait!  Nexus mods has STUPIDLY betrayed their users and demanded that modders NOT release their good stuff!  Nexus mods and Bethesda are controlled by the most STUPID minds available and are actively destroying anything good about the series!  I refused to play Fallout 76 because of Bethesda's BOSS-LEVEL stupidity.  And hopefully, as of this writing (24/10/2022,) the current administration of the U.S.A. will finish decimating the economy and these clowns will all be out of a job (and deeply in debt.)

I can say one thing is that this game is a blast and has 100 hours content.

I played the GoG version of both Fallout 3:GOTY & Fallout: NV

One thing I would like to say is that this is an inferior release version of GoG.

The cutscenes have stutters, the one scene which awestruck me in fallout 3 was the opening of the Vault gates after setting up. The flash with blurry vision does not happen in steam version. It opens like any other door which made me feel salty as Fuck!!

And I don't know why but when I opened doors it was evening time with brown effects, I do remember clearly that fallout 3 has green tint.

Kinda fizzled out that experience which I had playing the GoG version.

If you want proper patched up version of the game go for GoG. If you know around mods and stuffs please make sure to use some guide for essential mods which fixes lots of bugs in vanilla version. Because a lot are indeed game breaking ones.",1666609568,1666609568,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game:
Story: 4.5/5 Whatever you want it to be. It's great.
Graphics: 3.5/5 Good enough, but it's PS3 so it's not as good as Fallout 4. Also the 3rd person doesn't have sideways and backwards walking animations so it's a bit like Vice City. Is that a bad thing though? Play in 1st person mode rather, or perhaps there's a mod to change it. Also when you aim the gun in fps mode the gun doesn't move to the middle like in Fallout 4 or any FPS shooter game so you still gonna be using the cursor to aim not your sights. Maybe there's a mod?
Audio: 4/5 Dreary, therefore perfect. Gun sounds aren't bad either.
Gameplay: 4/5 Combat is kinda scuffed but there is a lot to do besides. That being said, this game has real bullets like Fallout New Vegas. It's better than Fallout 4's bullet teleport system. You can actually have a shootout. On normal mode the game is rather challenging especially when you lack guns, stats and equipment. You might have to use the baseball bat and VATS for a while.",1665914911,1665914911,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It depends on the system, for me it just required running the system as administrator on Windows Vista but it depends. Also, if you do play this game TURN AUTO SAVE OFF. For whatever reason, saving a game file over a previous save slowly corrupts your game. This also happened to my ps3 version of the game, and when I downloaded the game on a new computer and didn't do that the game stays so smooth. Also, in case you can't tell, it does not save playtime properly. Unless you think I beat the whole game and its DLC in 118 minutes. 

Fallout 3 has recieved a lot of backlash in the past while, I guess as a result of New Vegas blowing up. As a Fallout game it doesn't offer anywhere near the customisation or RPG dialogue the other games do. The thing is though, I don't judge games on if they fill up to expectations. But if you've only played New Vegas, this game will disappoint - play Fallout 2 instead, which for my money IS the best Fallout game.

If however, you're an avid Bethesda fan, this game will probably exceed your expectations. Bethesda doesn't really care about creating your character - you simply are the Lone Wanderer, you can't really change much other than your very black and white morality. The dialogue is extremely cheesy, and not as rich with options as the other ones. The gameplay is pretty standard, not frustrating but not terribly engaging, only aided by the V.A.T.S. Systems. What Bethesda games always strive with is there worldbuilding, their quests, and their atmosphere and Fallout 3 really exceeds.

Some people don't like how grey and muddy the Capital Wasteland is, but I really like how committed Bethesda is to the post apocalypse. Unlike 1,2 and New Vegas which use the post apocalypse more to create a sense of lawlessness, the ruins and buildings reiterate this feeling of sadness, that you're almost part of a graveyard. There's a ton of content that explains all these little details about the apocalypse, and I love the expansion of details about pre-war America, that was only hinted at in the first two games. The music is great, giving that same atmosphere that was in the first two games. And the radio station - there's something about the way the songs are mixed that despite how different they are all establish this feel that's really hard to explain, but I guess it's just this idea that everything you're encountering has disappeared. 

The dialogue also works for me - it's almost like everyone speaks like they're in the 50s, there's this weird uncanny way of both the words they speak and how they speak. I've played Oblivion which I love, and so I will admit this weird dialogue is kind of endearing to me. In a more serious toned game I guess people don't think it works but for me it adds to this world in a way that makes Fallout more unique. I can understand why people want this to be up to the other game's standards, but I appreciate how strange it all sounds. 

The gameplay is, as I said, kinda standard. The VATS system is awesome, but you don't use it that much. There aren't many weapon varieties, and some weapons are pretty useless. That being said, it isn't boring because the game is fairly difficult at points. It's not hard or anything, but resources are thin, much more than other games, which means that you need to be careful about going into fights. Unlike other Bethesda games where you're just fast travelling for 50% of the game I often am going around finding weapons knowing that the next big quest will require a lot, naturally making me explore. This is great open world design that a lot of the best open world games have - giving you good reasons to explore, but not forcing you to explore.

And at the end of the day, what you play the game for is the quests and they deliver. This hands down has some of the best quests in any game, each side quest with its own unique objectives and themes. There are few simple fetch quests, and the ones that are normally require you to go to somewhere you haven't been, and finding the items themselves are often quite easy. To stopping a super hero showdown, to finding a runaway cyborg, to blowing up a city - these are all quests which are completely optional but all up to main story quest quality. 

It's in the moments where you're exploring the world where the game really shines. It's not a good looking game, but something about the colours, the sound, the designs, the world is just sad but in an interesting way. There's a lot of personality to this world which makes you want to discover everything about it. There are few games where you just want to go back and play multiple times of this length to discover more things, and I think because of how well they've designed this world and how interesting everything is, I've gone back to this game multiple times and I don't leave until I've finished. 

It has flaws, as all things do, but none of them bother me in the slightest, and I just love this game so much, it's a masterpiece in my mind. And, it contains five DLCs, all of them substantial, Point Lookout being maybe my favourite DLC of all time.

You've heard this from just about every Fallout fan; Fallout 3 was my first Fallout game, and yes, I cannot deny my bias... I do acknowledge it's flaws, continuity errors, and I understand that many have problems with the main story, how it ""pales in comparison to the previous installments"". I get it... But let's see it for what Fallout 3 is. It's very different, from the take on Fallout itself, its setting, characters, and so on. I also appreciate Inon Zur for trying to recreate the vibe of the Mark Morgan's compositions for Fallout 1 & 2, despite me playing those games later after Fallout 3. I do believe Fallout 3 is an astounding game all things considered and I'll likely be replaying this game many more times than I already have in the six years since I first played it. Please give it a shot if you haven't already.

The modding scene for this game is insane as well. You'll get plenty of hours of fun out of this game, I guarantee you. Even just gameplay mods!

Of course in no way am I saying Fallout 3's story is better, the main quest is good at times and horrible at others. Where Fallout 3 shines is everything around the main story.

 The side content of Fallout 3 truly rivals new vegas's. The Characters you'll meet are just as intriguing and the places you'll go are just as amazing. I think the true problem with Fallout 3 is that so many people say it's worse than new vegas, that it's sort of become fact, if you even dare to compare Fallout 3 to new vegas you'll be shunned by a better part of the community, which i'm worried might scare off new Fallout fans from even trying 3.

Edit: 4 years later I found this fix and it literally solved everything. Thanks for all of the Bethesda team for nothing. Things aren't going to get better with Microsoft, mark my words. Also, I''m not touching the game for a long time, literally.

let me start off by saying I have not played this game at all with MODs compare two to fallout 4 or Fallout New Vegas but from my experience of mod they will make whatever game you don't like likeable and any game you do like fantastic so I'm assuming the modern community since the last update have gotten back to work so if you can't mod due to the last updates just wait until they have finished updating their MODs to the new changes and install them.

Fallout 3 is the first first person shooter in the Fallout game series and is also very old now so do bear with it. it was the first to try anything new with the series sense Fallout 1 and 2 let me start out by the graphics and game design of the area and so on all of them look fantastic if a little bit dark and grey at night and yellow and brown during the day but you'll get used to it so it's fine.

the same goes from the weapons and fighting system you cannot use iron Sights but you can still use scopes there is a few reasons for this but I'm not going to go into them here you can look it up yourself if you interested just know they added another system to make up of it that's called Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (V.A.T.S.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3LSQwnKcGI

I just wrapped up my fourth or fifth playthrough, and I've enjoyed it every time. If you aren't interested in rambling, the TL;DR is that Fallout 3 has a lot of jank, but it's still got lots of good stuff in it if you can look past it.

It might be my pea brain, but I always thought the story was fine. Not great, not bad. I didn't mind many of the more notorious parts either, though [spoiler]the ending still calling you a yellow-belly coward pussy for not offing yourself is exceptionally dumb after the Broken Steel DLC enabled the ability to make logical choices[/spoiler].

Though I still really enjoy the gameplay, it's always been very rough and somewhat demanding to acclimate to. I'm fine with many of the condition-/skill-related things (e.g. lower means worse aim or slower swings), but the skill-indpendent issue of inconsistent fire rate on weapons is agonizing. You will never be sure if the click of a trigger will produce a shot or not, even if it should. The Pip-Boy is similar in that the game is very persnickety about when it'll let you bring it up. You will grow to loathe explosives fast. Now, on the brighter side, V.A.T.S. and how it's executed, allowing strategizing I probably wouldn't have considered otherwise, like crippling/disarming enemies, which becomes vital on higher difficulties. Speaking of which, I did my recent playthrough on Very Hard difficulty, and the early parts of the game were some of the most intense fun I'd ever had in all my runs, scrounging for ammo and [i]any[/i] healing I could find, limping to a doctor I could barely afford, only to go back out and face seemingly insurmountable encounters, only to survive by the skin of my teeth each time. It was exhausting, but incredibly rewarding and satisfying.

There's a lot to explore in the game, even if you ignore most of the subways. I spent dozens of hours mapping and exploring newly discovered locations, before I'd really touched any quests. The quests themselves took me dozens more, then there's the DLC content, which adds a bunch of good stuff. I didn't track it exactly, but I spent approximately 210-220 hours on my most recent game. The last save I made said 199 hours, but I spent a few days going on ""non-canon"" escapades around The Capital Wasteland that weren't tracked.

Skip this segment if you want, it talks about stability/performance, but it's one of the big YMMV elements of Bethesda games. Anyway, from the things I've heard, I may have been lucky to not have too many major stability issues. It did have crashes any time an NPC would warn you not to steal owned things, or if they commented on you kicking/manipulating physics objects. A mod to remove theft-related warnings somehow fixed both issues, despite not removing the other reactions. For the rest of the 200+ hours, there were only about 20 random CTD moments, and the rest of the crashes were almost exclusively from alt-tabbing, which I started countering with a quicksave, so it wasn't a big issue (seemed to happen more often if I'd used the Pip-Boy radio). Things ran fine otherwise, with the exception of Point Lookout, where the frame rate would often drop below 60, regardless of quality settings.

It's become a sort of tradition for me to bookend my reviews with summaries, so I'll repeat that Fallout 3 is definitely worth checking out if you are able to forgive its clunkier parts.",1664858709,1664858927,True,16,1,0.630854606628417969,12,True,False,False

I understand that maybe you are annoyed that the game won't start by itself and you need to apply external solutions but, cute brother, give it a try, you can probably still get benefits from this adventure by latam, sorry I meant the wasteland. The game is from 2008, and although I personally have no qualms about playing games of all levels of graphic quality, it may look a bit old. I'm playing the entire fallout saga. This is the first. Arguably it's fine. The story is not the best but it does get me hooked and continue until the end because it can move you. Characters and varied situations from charismatic to breaking balls. As it is a role-playing game, it will depend on you the reaction you have and your respective decisions. There are many places to discover. Many of them are not that easy to get to, especially in the urban ruins. The external area is very vast. Enemies and creatures of great variety, from mutated fauna through robots and typical groups of criminals to heavily armed organizations and some antagonistic ones. Variety of weapons from pre-war junk to deadly lasers. The gameplay, especially the gunplay is not good. This is something that the developers themselves admitted at the time and served with experience to improve successive products, namely fallout new vegas and 4. Being an RPG, it will depend on the skills that you decide to prioritize the style of play that implement to achieve your goals. Personally, since I like shooters, I played it prioritizing firearms and energy skills and extras that compensate for the ""defects"" of gunplay, that is, the exaggerated dispersion of certain weapons for example. It can happen that you have a thief with an iron who comes to kill you to loot everything at a very short distance and you could miss several shots at close range despite being aimed correctly. Notwithstanding other gameplay, i.e. you could prioritize melee combat and punch 'em down, prioritize stealth by flanking and dishing out critical strikes, prioritize science or lockpick and pick a shortcut or make the path safer or maybe if conditions allow them to prioritize conversation and negotiate diplomatic solutions with which they can be reached because if you have a deathclaw, reaper or a yaoguai bear in front, I don't think they want to listen to you. The special fallout system from the earliest games in the franchise allows for this versatility. It didn't crash a lot for me, perhaps because I was playing it from my PC with modest work resources xd, 4 cores 8 ram. Or maybe it's because he had the blessing of the children of the atom xd.

Im gonna start this review by being honest, this review is aimed for people who didnt have the chance to play fallout 3 yet, as a lot people who probably have played this old game by now, I feel that also that there is a lot of people who got into the series with the latest games and missed the third game, I will to start by saying that you shouldn’t play this game right now, instead wait for the upcoming mod that is remaking this game on fallout 4 is going to be a much more viable and satisfying experience, fallout 3 is a good game and I had fun with it but its not a great game enough to be considered a must-play classic, theres a lot of technical issues and the game has aged a lot, its gameplay feels very rough to play today, even modded, I modded the hell out of this game and I have tolerance for older games and still had a lot of moments where I wanted to rip my hairs out, the biggest issues are the crashes even without mods they are present, its not worth to endure all of that for this game so like I said wait for the mod that is remaking it.

Fallout 3 had a chance to show itself and become a famous game because back then when It released it surely was a unique game to play, today a lot of games have copied its format and being a game from 2008 it shows its age in a lot of way, the gunplay simply sucks even with mods, controls and movement feels stiff and there are a lot of jank in the game, stuff like seeing a part of the map floating in the air, falling through the terrain, continuous crashes when entering a new map, npcs behaving weirdly due to some mistake scripting, repetitive quest design, immersion breaking moments and more. The story here starts pretty interesting, Im not going to deep dive into this game’s plot because its widely known by now but while its start is promising I feel like the more I played the less interesting it has become, the story feels very linear and the player agency sometimes feels lacky, plus the game pretty much became a call of duty of sorts in the final missions, the game also lacks a good antagonist and there isnt many memorable characters in the main quest either to make it stand out, the worldbuilding and lore are all well-done but I felt like the main quest lacked good moments or twists that could capture my attention to make it something that could classify this game into a must play, the story here serviceable with a few good moments and is not something that I would say its great.

When it comes to graphics and such the game is old, there is nothing much to be said about that except that it could have used more colors in its art design, the game’s soundtrack is simply great, sound effects arent that good but I used mods to improve it, gameplay-wise the game has issues with balancing and certain design decisions that I cant swallow, like the annoying karma system which can be abused very badly, combat feels very archaic even by 2008 standards, I modded the game to make the gunplay feel a little better, even adding an aim down sights mod and a sprint button because the character is too slow and the world is too big making traversing through the world a bore, plus mixing rpg with fps is not always a good idea because it can lead into frustrating combat scenarios where a normal, almost naked enemy, feeling like a crappy bullet sponge where a shot in the face with a shotgun is not going to even take half of its life bar away. The quest design can be a bit repetitive but its fun to explore at least, getting on the max level is fast, I managed to hit max level and finish the game alongside 4 of its 5 dlcs around 35 hours, I got pretty strong by the end of the game and there wasnt much incentive left to explore when I had a lot of icons left on the map because the game had nothing of significance to show me anymore, apart of a few interesting sidequest stories at least.

Overall your mileage may vary, it took 35 hours like I said to finish the game and 4 of its dlcs, as for dlcs which come with the GOTY edition, none of them felt like a must-do to me, they are just more content for people who want more from the game, I even skipped one of them (mothership zeta) because I was already getting tired of the game and the dlc didnt look like It was worth doing anyway, the only dlc that I would recommend playing is broken steel because its integrated into the game’s main quest altho its inclusion felt very tacked-on, the post-ending main quests are just forced, lacking any sort of caracterization or villain for the enclave, the enemy faction our protagonist is dealing with most of the game, so overall I would say for you to skip the dlcs if you value your time.

To close this review I am going to repeat what I said early in a tl;dr format, its better to wait for the remade version that is being worked on fallout 4 right now, fallout 3 is a good game that is not worth playing today due to its aged gameplay and technical issues, even with mods it just doenst offer something that can elevate this game into a classic must-play level because you will have a hard time trying to get into it and by the end of the day its just not worth it.",1658931871,1663203447,False,2,1,0.497014343738555908,0,True,False,False

the best way to play is via NV with A Tale of Two Wastelands mod. A recent update means that it no longer needs GFWL which is great but it makes it very hard to mod now.

[*]Items Durability : use it awhile and then, you have to constantly repairing your weapon and armor just enough to keep it at good condition.
[*]Perks : what perks give you in this game is just, + this, and + that and for me it's not good enough.

It's not that its all like just bugs. I mean you literally can't launch it past the menu, that is how bad it is.

Edit: They have fixed it where you can play again. It's still buggy as heck as all bethesda games are (I need to stop buying their games -_- ) but from what i've found is the mods to help fix the bugs still work. Though I'm sure someone more fallout savvy can point you in the direction you need to go, in the guides for this game. Would I recommend it. Yes, if you wanna play and find out the lore yourself. There is alot of it. But I wouldn't recommend if you're ok with just watching lore guides on youtube and what not",1605090872,1661733830,True,0,0,0.485981285572052002,0,True,False,False

While it gets a lot of flak, its a mostly good game.

Vanilla: 
tons of places to explore
tons of quests
Be Jesus or the Antichrist, or the neutral man bob(good luck with that)
The best radio host 
Set off a nuke that was dropped on hiroshima 
fire off an ICBM and hit some random country

DLC:

Operation Anchorage:
Pretty cool dlc with amazing rewards
can be decently hard on high difficulty

The Pitt:
It's basically real life Pittsburgh so very immersive
100 steel ingots the first time around will suck your soul but then you remember everything in subsequent playthroughs

Point Lookout:
Basically real life Maryland so also very immersive
excellent map to explore
cook meth, go on a mad drug trip, then get absolutely ran over by a billion Feral Ghoul Reavers

Mothership Zeta:
Alien Blaster

Overall:
Buy it if you like fallout

I played through Fallout 4 and found myself really enjoying the game for its mechanics and side quest lore. Even if I didn't really enjoy Fallout 4 on ""Fallout"" standards, I felt like it still sometimes resembled what I liked about the Fallout games. I planned to go into Fallout 3 with the same mindset, and I honestly quite liked Fallout 3 to some extent when I was a kid; moreso than I did enjoy Fallout 4. It's a bit unfortunate my thumbs down will spoil how this review will go down, but I promise I won't have only negative things to say about this game. 

I will say this: I quite like the atmosphere of this game at times. It does a relatively decent job in some areas at capturing the original games' desolate, hopeless atmosphere. Areas like [spoiler]Vault 106[/spoiler] really display the depth and foreshadowing that makes me sometimes forget how much I don't generally prefer Bethesda's stories. I think at times too the side quests can be a bit interesting, and there is certainly quite a bit more depth to your decisions and outcomes than Fallout 4 has. It does somewhat resemble a Fallout game in that merit. There was issues with the game having minimal choices in the game regarding the ending, which made people mad. This was addressed with the Broken Steel DLC. Quite nice, but Broken Steel gets major flak for something else I will gloss upon later. 

Unfortunately that's just about the only positive things I really enjoy about this game. The rest of it really shows its age, and not really in a way that a game like Zelda: Ocarina of Time does. Games like Ocarina of Time have so much love and charm to them, that the flaws I can overlook. Fallout 3 is not like this. It's quite devoid of charm aside from its atmosophere and the rare instances of good writing. The intro is not awful persay, but it definitely is extremely tedious after your 2nd or 3rd playthrough. The main quest in general is just really boring. It feels very dry and linear, and not in a good way.  The choices you have all seem pretty bad, and they drastically change the lore and original tropes that factions had. The Brotherhood of Steel went from techno-fascist hermits in the original series, to bullish neoliberals in this game. Just the stereotypical ""good guys"" you see in most games that AAA developers make. It makes no reasonable sense why the Brotherhood would've been retconned this way, and I still don't really understand it. The Enclave are the only faction that was brought over that still seems well rooted in their goals. The Raiders went from a vast band of different subgangs with different goals and problems, to just a universal ""bad guy"". Many enemies in this game have suffered this fate. They don't have much nuance to who they are. It's displayed in full with super mutants. There are only 2 good Super Mutants in this game. Only those two are even remotely intelligent. 

It's not just the lore changes that are poor; the gameplay is pitiful too. Depending on if you have Broken Steel; the gameplay is either  ridiculously easy or annoyingly difficult. In the original; there was very bad difficulty pacing. Quite a few enemies just would die to anything remotely powerful in one/two shots. There were only a few areas in the game that I think were able to be considered difficult, and even at close to max level were not too much of a challenge. With the addition of Broken Steel though; this changes to be even worse than the game just being extremely easy. Broken Steel introduces several enemies once you reach a high enough level. These enemies are extreme bullet sponges that are utterly ridiculous with how much damage they deal. I found myself healing after nearly every fight, and needing to repair armor fast once I ran into these enemies. This is utterly ridiculous game design, and just made a problem even worse. None of the enemies are even really that satisfying to fight. Weapons don't have iron sights, and VATS just feels like a poor compensation for how bad the gunplay is. Even New Vegas fixed a lot of these issues, and I don't mind the gunplay so much on it. This game I just find it frustrating. (I feel necessary to mention I played this on Very easy, and was still having this much trouble late-game. Power armor and all). 

The only real thing I can be thankful for is that this game was successful for its time. It allowed Fallout to achieve a lot more appeal, and gave Bethesda the confidence to let former-Black Isle employees to make their own game out of the scraps of the cancelled Fallout 3 they were planning. It also allowed Fallout 4 to right many of the wrongs  that Fallout 3 made. As I played this more and more, I realized I enjoyed this as a kid because i was not fully aware of what Fallout was, and how much better the writing and gameplay was on those other games. I had more fun not taking the game seriously, which is not really what Fallout is supposed to be. I only did Operation Anchorage so far, and I do think that I will update this at the end to see if those DLC's redeem things in some way, but I am unsure. 

For now; I don't think this game is worth purchasing. Buy Fallout: New Vegas or Fallout 4, and live with the fact that you don't have to experience this game, as it allowed much better games to be made.",1661123407,1661123407,False,0,1,0.493827164173126221,0,True,False,False

So if u are having issues installing and running this game, its probably something particular to your rig, and not Bethesda's fault.

As for rating the game:  It has held up great over the years.  I love hearing Malcolm McDowell and Liam Neeson's voiceovers.  Simply awesome.

https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/17209/

The game is nice, though, if you are not looking particularly for the Capital Wasteland and just want some nice Fallout game, I would rather opt for the New Vegas.
The Capital Wasteland feels much emptier than the Mojave, the world is big, but there isn't really much to do in it. By finishing the main quest you'll have almost two thirds of the map undiscovered. There are not many side quests or activities, and many of which are there are not quite entertaining.
 After the New Vegas it really lacks a hardcore mode, SPECIAL checks in dialogs, better craft system, good economy model (if you didn't cheat in casinos of NV of course), factions, disguise by using faction clothes, interesting small quests and dialog options here and there, and many more. Some of that can be added with mods, but still not everything.

As per DLCs, since I can't evaluate them separately:
1. Operation Anchorage - the Alaska scenery is awesome, and the plot isn't bad, but it feels more like Call of Duty rather than Fallout.
Not sure if I'd like to play it again.
I'm not a big fan of that kind of games, so might do it again only for a Gauss Rifle or the sword.
2. Point Lookout - the location itself is great and the inhabitants are quite interesting, but I was quite disappointed with the main quest. I wish there was something more about the location history and the inhabitants, I wish to learn how they changed into what they are.
The main quest is not that bad itself, but feels like a lost opportunity to me.
3. The Pitt - I liked this one. They've made a great job with the city and the story.
Recommended.
4. Mothership Zeta - is a real fun, especially liked the NPCs stories and collecting the audiologs of kidnapped.
I'd definitely play it again.
5. Broken Steel - well, you've got to have it to go on after the main quest.
Is a bit rushy, but not bad, shows the Enclave main base and the side quests are fine.

In general the only things I found better here comparing to the NV are the start of the game, which is more quick and interesting, minimum crashes and better DLCs.",1659910138,1659910138,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However at the time of writing this review it's not possible to mod this build using FOSE since FOSE is not yet updated with this build of the game.  Could change in the future though as it changed before with games like Fallout 4 and Skyrim Anniversary Edition.

This game is a must have though especially if you play New Vegas and FO4.  I would say the story and lore is a lot better in New Vegas but knowing this was the first fallout game on the creation engine is pretty wild to think about.  I'm having fun just by playing vanilla and I noticed the game runs a lot smoother on Windows 10 now.  I refunded it a few years back because of the Windows Live breaking the game and even when I was able to bypass Windows Live the game ran horribly even with good modern specs.  

So if I were you I'd pick this game up on sale, play the story a little, if you get bored play some of the DLCs, if you're still bored just follow a guide on how to downgrade the game to a previous version in order to mod it.  I'll just wait for FOSE to update or I'll try looking into A Tale Of Two Wastelands which combines both Vegas and 3 into one game, but these days I can't be bothered trying to install that.",1659582512,1659582512,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fallout 1, 2 and New Vegas are all incredibly well made and are examples of what Fallout games should look like. Almost nothing in Fallout 3 makes any sense whatsoever, the enemies, factions and even the currency just don't make sense. The repair system is all wrong, the writing is terrible and the story is utter garbage, just to name a few. 

However, this doesn't make Fallout 3 a 'bad' game, in fact the environment was very well done and some of the side quests were indeed interesting. Unfortunately, Fallout 3 suffers from one final thing, map design. There are a lot of very interesting quests that are well done, you just can't get to them because of their location. One of the best in the game is found on the far east of the map, but the only way to know to go to this seemingly boring town is via a terminal in the far south of the map. See the problem? this quest isn't the only one and there are certainly more that are like this.

No, it was not an ordinary sound like a cat or the wind, but to the sound of an enthusiastic man on the radio. Not just any radio station, mind you! This man was broadcasting from the legendary Galaxy News Radio itself! So, this got me thinking, am I having one of those episodes again where I think I'm still playing a Fallout game even though I'm clearly not? Despite being sure that I was not near my computer, I could not be sure, so I began walking around as if I was in the game. My mother sees me and asks why I'm sneaking around in my own house, and I replied that there were raiders about. However, after thinking about it, I couldn't be sure she wasn't a raider herself. So, I grabbed a pan and wacked her on the head for good measure, since my current playthrough uses melee weapons.

Now that I had escaped my home, I quickly found that I was indeed in the middle of a psychotic episode, yet I still felt as though something was wrong. Then it hit me: My father is missing. It all makes sense now! He left years ago to get some milk and never returned, just like the protagonist's father in the hit Bethesda game, Fallout 3! With this, I knew I wasn't dreaming, and journeyed to find the nearest metro station so I could spend the next 40 hours in there. Why, you ask? Because war... war never changes... also because literally half the game is in the fucking subway. As I traverse the tunnels listening to the extravagant man on the radio while killing countless ghouls, I can feel myself falling away, as though my memories were leaves on an autumn tree. When I finally reach the door to the surface, I am no longer who I was. I am a vault dweller, a former citizen of Vault 101 who is in search of their father James. Will I ever find him? Will I ever be rid of subway tunnels? Will Three Dog finally stop playing the song ""Let's Go Sunning"" by the artist Jack Shaindlin?

I just tried it on my system.  Win 10.  Loaded fine.  Worked okay but I couldn't return after shift/tabbing.  Aside from that it worked as expected.  I loaded the game from the desktop and not steam if that makes a difference.  My current game is unmodded but I had added the script extender since I planned to mod later and I don't know if that makes a diff.  I didn't load with it.
I can't speak for Win 11.  I do have a pretty good machine though it's over 5 years old.  I hope this helps.  Fallout 3 was a pretty decent game.  It's very moddable if you like mods.  The mods have been out for years so they are usually pretty stable and most of the incompatibilities have been found.  Like any Bethesda game, it's got bugs, stability issues and so on.  Also like any of the Bethesda games prior to Fallout 76 it has a great deal of depth, countless side quests, an open world and an interesting story.  My advice is if your tempted to check it out than do so but watch the time when you start.  Steam has a refund option and you have either 1 or 2 hours to play before it expires.  The timer starts when you start the game and I have never had an issue getting a refund if a game really didn't work.
 Added:  Just realized my game time is pretty low.  I own this game on disk and played it for years.  I also own it on steam along with most the other fall out games but haven't really played since I got it.

Some minor gameplay things that bothered me and may bother you too:
--No skipping the intro/tutorial (makes replayability difficult. that is, if there weren't game-crashing bugs, making playability difficult in the first place)
--Movement feels slow for an open world game. Walking is excruciatingly slow
--Shooting over/around objects is difficult because they don't end where they appear to
--Invisible walls are abundant within the map. You'll be climbing over a pile of rubble (as you do), and then you can't go further. You'll have to find a way around. It's immersion-breaking 

Bugs:
--The game crashes sometimes. This is why I stopped playing it initially and how I learned that it's ""not supported on windows 10"". Like, did you really just sell me this game... for windows 10... that might not work... on windows 10?
--If you quick-save while running, you'll keep running in that direction until you press that key again. 
--Alt-tabbing will crash the game, almost like it's not supported on the operating system that I'm using...
--Other minor and open-world bugs that I've noticed, are not nearly as frustrating, (like creatures being in the walls or ground. They show up on my map and I can hear them, but they are pretty certainly not intractable)

Despite these problems, this is still Fallout, which I really enjoy. I'm still trying to power(armor) through it and it does have redeeming qualities, for sure.

This RPG was my 2nd Bethesda game and my first Fallout game, and I very much love it.  I have played it 3 times. The game has a create your own character aspect that truly matters during playtime. You have a karma level that affects the way NPCs react to you, you have a very vast skill tree with extra assets, and you get to pick up pretty much anything in the wasteland that you come across. There is a bartering system. There are tons of side tasks along with the main quest line. Your choices matter and will change the outcome of the game. You can choose your weapon of choice (guns, melee, unarmed) but melee is very wonky. You have companion options as well. If you have played Skyrim or Oblivion, it is very similar. The storyline is immersive and intriguing, as well as all the characters you meet and the DLCs.

That being said, CHECK YOUR COMPUTER FOR SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS BEFORE YOU BUY. Many people have issues starting the game (I haven't, but I have had it crash on me). Bethesda's early games crash so frequently, and that is a huge drawback to this game.

This is for when you launch and it doesn't detect your current graphics card. Mine detected NVIDIA 790, when I had a 2070 Super.

Anyways I played this game 5 times ever since 2010. Though I just started another playthrough to try the DLC. I will only talk about the DLC since everyone who reads this must've played Falllout3 sometime in their life.

[h1]Point Lookout[/h1]

In my opinion, the best DLC for Fallout 3. Taking place southern part of Maryland in a swampy area, you enter an area untouched by the nuclear bombs. As you explore, you befriend a ghoul named Desmond, who is fighting his long-time rival.  You can either help him or help his rival, but of course, there is a plot twist in the end that I will end here. There are new enemies such as swamp folk, tribals, and swamp ghouls. New weapons: Axe, double-barreled shotgun, lever-action rifle. And new characters. The map has more locations than all the other DLCs. The story is actually interesting to me too and I would also say this was the longest DLC in Fallout 3, so that's a plus.

[h1]The Pitt[/h1]

This was good, I liked the overall story and atmosphere of Pittsburgh. Basically, it starts off when you respond to a distress signal from a runaway slave that escaped the raider city of the Pitt or basically Pittsburgh. He tasks you to help him free the slaves and find a cure to help the people of the town. The area of the Pitt is laid out to where there's a steelyard (kind of like the ""playground"" of the DLC), there's an arena, and the downtown area that consists of the slaves and the slavers. And introducing into the enemy field are trogs. Honestly, they're the scariest enemies of the DLC and a bitch to fight if you are doing a VATS-less run. I would also say the ""cure"" at the end, really did change my choices to help each character, which I can appreciate a lot in this DLC.

[h1]Broken Steel[/h1]

Okay, I would say this should've been part of the main game. It's basically the alternative end-game of fallout 3. [spoiler]Basically after you ""die"" from activating the purifier in the end game, you wake up 2 weeks later and are tasked with eliminating the last remaining Enclave.[/spoiler] As this allows you to continue playing the game after the ending too. This DLC also adds three new enemies that are encountered in the main fallout 3 game. Super mutant overlord, albino rad scorpion, and feral ghoul reaver (who is a bitch to fight every time). Also comes with new weapons (tesla cannon like on liberty prime) and a few new pieces of armor. Honestly, this DLC is just for when you want to continue playing after the ending.

[h1]Operation Anchorage[/h1]

Now this DLC is pretty short and its completely skippable. Basically, you get message from Brother hood outcasts, you meet them, they can't get armory open unless you complete simulation of Chinese invasion in Alaska before the bombs dropped. Get Chinese stealth armor, the end. This DLC is completely linear, you need to complete said objective like blow up anti-air turret, raid bunker, then raid final boss building and done. You don't get to use your weapons from the main game, you have to use guns they provide you only in the simulation. All this for stealth armor and gauss rifle? It's your choice if you want to play 2 hours' worth of awkward combat and a useless story for that.

[h1]Mothership Zeta[/h1]

I would definitely skip this DLC if I was you. At first, I thought this would be a favorite, but no it's the worst DLC of the other 4. Super linear story with bullet sponge aliens that are even more a bitch to fight on higher levels for some reason and the characters are just not likable at all. I would bring in at least 100 stimpacks before you start DLC too. I guess what I liked most was the weapons? Even though I never used them ever again after completing said DLC. The combat though is literally all corridor shooting too almost the whole way. It almost felt like the developers wanted a more creepy atmosphere and story for this DLC, but it just fell off. Too bad I thought the Point Lookout was excellent bringing in the foggy swampy dark tone of the atmosphere. Also, kill the samurai companion right away if you want to get his sword and armor as he is useless in combat. Sorry for my rant on this DLC.


I would buy this DLC just for Point Lookout, Broken Steel, and The Pitt only!",1657346567,1657346911,True,27,1,0.728360831737518311,6,True,False,False

Do be warned this game seems to have more technical issues than New Vegas though. the game seems to crash alot and is super buggy and the texture pop in is just awful. this is the only good fallout 3 game bethesda has produced with fallout 4 just being okay and New Vegas which was amazing wasn't developed by bethesda but obsidian which had some of the original fallout developers.
pros: side quests are pretty good and alot of memerable locations.
there is actually choice and consequence but not as much as in New vegas as it mostly extends to side quests but there is a little bit in the main quests.
the expanisons are pretty good the pit and point lookout being the best. Anchorage kind of sucks except  the loot, as its super linear and a bore the get through.  mothership zeta was just ok as the idea on paper seems really cool and fun but it suffers from being too cramped and linear. and finally broken steel is bascilly a continue playing after the game dlc which its mission design quailty is on pair with the main quest of fallout 3 if not worse of being medicore.

the bad
bullet spongy enemies seems more of an issue in this game than new vegas
voice acting while good the game reuses voice actors for multiple characters and they sound almost like a clone. 
technical issues bugs, crashes, texture pop in

When I first played Fallout 3, its atmosphere and open world was a nice, comforting world to escape into. For some people, they already have this from some newer, fancier game. But for me, it's still the one I go back to. I probably haven't tried enough of the newer games yet, so for me, it's still a must-have experience.

A lot of the DLC are just chores, long paths of forced combat and fetching--like a bad FPS. I regret trying them all and recommend not enabling them. They give you busted items, the best in the game--but is that a good thing?

Fallout 3 allows you to either be the hero or villain (or just to be neutral if you so choose). Depending on the route you take your conversations with NPCs and certain clans differ. I've played this game every way possible & would love more people in the Fallout community. My only problem with Fallout 3 is the map seems to void of life, ironic since its set in a post-apocalyptic war scene but I think it needed a little bit more wild life or even clan hangouts to keep you entertained.

But this game is fantastic. After this last play through, I remembered why Bethesda was unmatched at its time. A few things to address when reviewing:

Others seem to be overly-critical of the bleak-colored environment of this game. For me, it is quite suiting. The Wasteland isn't supposed to be some hospitable paradise. You are immersed in the grim reality of the then-modern world; there is no comparable moments to stepping outside of the vault for the first time and letting your eyes adjust to the sun. You can immediately tune into a radio station and try to figure out the world you've been shunned away from for the entirety of your character's youth. 

As many other games are today, Fallout 3 was very ambitious. But Fallout 3 managed to pull it off. The world around you feels so adaptive. The Wasteland is filled with random encounters and interesting environments. With the quests, you are given the choice of how you want to accomplish them and for many, you can alter the outcome. This makes a good RPG, you truly feel you are able to shape your story. The choices can be overwhelming to the point that I feel the need to save and see where the other choices would take me. 

I enjoyed the leveling system; in my opinion it was ahead of its time. Every level, you are awarded a perk, plenty of which are unique and quite interesting and rewarding, as apposed to a simple stat increase. However, at some point you may feel that you are not truly threatened by enemies and that is when the game can finally begin to taper. 

The gun-play is not spectacular but I do enjoy it. I see most people opted for VATS but that doesn't interest me so much. Of course, others may love it, and I see how they could. Usually in games like these, I choose a rogue-like character and prioritize stealth and accommodating skills, but this play-through I chose to be loud and messy, and it was great. 

I could go on and on about Fallout 3, but I will just suggest that for the current sale price of $6 with all DLC included, you give this game a revisit, or even play this game for the first time.

That's shabby work on the part of both Steam and Bethesda.

First place I go to find a solution is Bethesda's tech support site, accessible from the launcher with the big friendly letters TECH SUPPORT.  Arrive there and find the article titled 'What do I do if Fallout 3 is crashing on Steam on Windows 10?'.  How worthless was this help?  Let's count the ways:

1)  Doesn't reflect the current best methodology for fixing the problem.  That can be found pinned on the Discussion page on Steam.
2)  Could easily lead you to thinking that your perfectly decent little gaming machine isn't up to snuff to run a game... from '08.  And the reality is that you're still milking the cow, but you're not taking care of her any longer.
3)  Can't even downvote the worthlessness without creating a user account with Bethesda's website (yeah, I'll get right on that for the opportunity to let others know the poopshow at Bethesda never stops, with a simple downvote that should be available to the unregistered public).

I'm still working on a solution and hoping I'll get there in a day or two.  But this is really bad support for a franchise being promoted right now as part of a Summer event.  Here's a suggestion, Bethesda:  get off your asses and fix the installer so it properly detects the hardware I'm running and adjusts the pre-sets accordingly, auto-implementing the Intel Bypass Package for me.  While you're at it, get off your asses and release an Official patch that does everything the Unofficial patch does that is currently the best recommended fix for a common issue.  I'm really not happy right now with my purchase and I won't be buying any more Bethesda products, on Steam or anywhere, any time soon.  Don't get this as it now is unless you have some levels in tech support and/or are ready for some headaches.

But put all that aside, Fallout 3 is better without mods in my opinion (so apart from cheating to get a few handy perks early or toggle max carrying capacity to get out of a few buildings with a hoard of stuff to sell, my play-style hasn't been affected), it captures everything you want from a post apocalyptic world & delivers it so damn brilliantly Fallout 4 or 76 fail to come even close to how good this game is.

The latest update finally, (FINALLY) stopped the check for Games For Windows Live which ruined the experience for many as time's gone by, myself included & has polished up a lot of performance, visual & environmental bugs from textures to collisions & even the overall loading speed is a lot faster.

The ""classic"" Fallout experience that brought many into it's world is right here & if you can get over the fact that this has to be played as intended (finally Bethesda, took you long enough, 13-14 years too late for many) you're in for hours if not months of endless replayability from one of the greatest RPGs to ever break out into the 3D world.

I've only had to reinstall this once & that was down to trying to downgrade it back to an older patch to enable mods/console commands so no fault from the game itself.

The environment has landmarks that can be used for navigation and the accursed subway tunnels have maps that can assist in navigation. There are unique rewards for exploration and they are usually placed such that they stand out to a degree. The binary morality system is criticized a lot but I think it is implemented alright except for a couple decisions. There are cartoonishly evil options but there are also a good amount of practical evil options or callous options which have the same negative effect.

The gunplay is terrible but VATS allows you to target guns and make enemies drop them in this game, which is missing from some of the later titles. Every skill can be boosted by 10 points and every stat by 1 with the bobbleheads. You can max out nearly every skill in the game by the level cap, which is 30, and you can max out every stat for sure. The biggest problem with repairs is to do your own repairs you need duplicate equipment, which incentivizes using common enemy equipment instead of any of the unique gear you find.

Dungeons can be samey and dull but the loot you can find is very good and the environmental storytelling you expect from bethesda's world design is present here. The story is supposed to have this big narrative arc but most people don't seem to appreciate it; since this includes Broken Steel the game will continue and ruin the narrative arc anyway unless you intentionally fulfill it.

The environment is really the star here. I'd say include an hd texture pack and the unofficial patch to fully appreciate it. The world looks like a shelled-out wasteland, and it's so much more believable and grounded than the later games. There's less immediately interesting stuff, but that makes the special stuff stand out more. It's a good time; there are a lot of hidden variables that affect your choices that the game won't tell you about so if you feel like there are no options available (a common complaint) that is not usually true. Try it out but explore a lot; if you can't get into it just drop it and try New Vegas instead which has better shooting and a more immediately interesting environment.",1656266546,1656266546,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

this is one of the ""special games"", bethesda really put a lot of effort in this title, but lemme tell ya, fallout 3 is not the best fallout... this might seem obvius but bethesda is not well know for making polished and well written titles, and fallout is no exeption to this, i just feel like the story at the end is very rushed and whats your reward at the end of the game a couple of compleatly unoriginal endings slides, no matter what you do, if you have good or bad karma or if youve made good or bad desicions at the end doesnt matter because youll get the same slides.

what else? the story is bad but the gameplay is preatty alright, i aint the smartes but i think that bethesda just put a lot of effort into combat mechanics and not into an actually good story. At least we got a compleatly different and unique combat, this one focuses on just shooting till the enemy is dead, you dont actually get many options to be honest and you dont have many strategies; you of course have stealth but in my opinios is just too slow and the npcs are really dumb, so why sneak behind them and take him down with a silenced weapon when you can just stand in front of him and kill him with a weapon? 
also the guns are not creative and dont have iron sights.

Maybe one of the biggest disapointsments in this game is the enclave, no matter how bad you want to be, you just cannot join the enclave, theyll just shoot you . no matter how bad you are you just cannot join them, the best you cand do is help the president poison the water, but thats all. The enclave in this game is just written to be ""Not joinable"" an dthats truly sad. and dont get me started on how the enclave is just really stupid, the enclave was the goverment on the pre war america and they lost to a bunch of tin cans and a robot; the enclave had a orbital missile sience the start of the game and they never decided to nuke the citadel... why? because its convinient to the story, becuase thats easy content for a dlc.

its just sad that bethesda is taking away the rpg mechanics and, charismatic characters and well written dialoge just to make a game more FPS like.

It didn't even start for me at first. Looked it up and it's a nine year old bug. The community came up with a fix - not Bethesda nor Steam. 

Speaking of bugs - there are bugs everywhere in this game. Characters gliding instead of walking, VATs not doing anything but slowing down time, VATs not exiting, VATs not letting me get a single hit in, random crashes, and nothing loads. Like half this game is walking around a wasteland and then - oh shoot wall right in front of me why didn't that load in before. 

Possibly the most annoying thing about this game is the fact that none of the buttons like to respond in time. So fighting is AWFUL. I'm trying to open my Pipboy to use a stimpak and it takes five seconds, in which I'm already dead. I'm trying to open VATs to get some extra hits in and oh would you look at that? I've killed the guy with my fists and it loads afterwards. Every single time I enter VATs I have to wiggle my mouse to get the hit options to show up. I'm not even exaggerating. 

The actual content is mid. SPOILERS AHEAD. There's not as much here as in FO4, and what is here just isn't very fun in my opinion. There are some okay storylines - such as the cannibals, and Little Lamplight, but even those are lacking in depth, or overshadowed by how annoying the NPCs are. Pretty much every character in this game is a jerk who makes weird decisions, and they're all very annoying. I considered committing genocide several times, and I did not care about them at all. 

The first half of the story is alright. The vault section took a little too long, only for the end of it to be rushed (which seems to be a common theme here). But that was forgivable imo. After that, you have a sense of urgency to find your father. That's good. You have a settlement right outside the vault, so that you can really start playing this game - that's also good. But every character wants something huge in return for a few words of ""yeah your dad went that way idk good luck kid lmao"". That tradeoff of going out and fighting some difficult enemies for 30+ irl minutes, for a few words, from every character, is extremely unsatisfying, and makes me hate those characters and this game. 

The second half of the story feels rushed and sucks butt. Long story short, your dad dies abruptly, from these guys you've heard about once, with no build up at all. And then you take the fight to them alongside the BOS, who have a deus ex machina robot. Awful. The writing in this game took me back to middle school, when I read Wattpad fanfictions. Some of which I vividly remember having a more coherent build-up and story. 

And, I'm not quite sure how to articulate this, but the combat does not feel like combat at all. It feels like pushing a few buttons and it does something sometimes. Also, leveling up does not give me a discernible difference in gameplay. And the level up popup can be very annoying mid-combat. The beginning was kind of fun, but overall I did not have enough fun playing this to recommend it. I have no interest in even finishing this game all the way, let alone re-playing it.

22370,117379902,76561198302055728,0,5,863,0,863,1654477261,"I first played Fallout: New Vegas a few months ago. It quickly became my favourite game of all time and it is now my most played game on steam. I then played Fallout 1 and 2, which were both some of the best games I have ever played. Then I decided to play Fallout 3. I bought the Game of the Year Edition. I regret that now. 

Frankly, Fallout 3 is utter shit. Here is why.

[h1]1) Choices: [/h1]

The game presents you with many ""choices"" that are really just clear cut black and white dichotomies. They aren't interesting at all. For instance, the first settlement most players meet is Megaton, a town built around a live nuclear bomb with a religion around it. There are 2 opposing quests to do with the bomb. In one, you defuse it and make sure the town never gets blown up. In another, you blow up the town. There is nothing interesting or thought provoking about that choice. Either kill a bunch of innocent people or save them. Ironically, the game does such a poor job of making you care about anything that's happening that the choice doesn't really seem that meaningful. That's why I blew up the town in my playthrough. I legitimately did not care about the town or anyone in it. In New Vegas, the first mission and Ghost Town Gunfight really humanise Goodsprings. Doc Mitchell helping you and Sunny Smiles teaching you how to survive make you care about the town and its fate. This makes the choice of whether or not to help the town out so much more meaningful. As well as that, the game doesn't just say ""oooooh bad karma naughty boy"" if you don't help Goodsprings out. It also kills off Chet and Doc Mitchell, 2 characters who are really useful throughout the playthrough. Fallout 3 punishes morally bad choices by just saying that you're a bad person. I never felt like there were any repercussions for destroying Megaton. Not once did I say, ""I wish I hadn't blown it up"". The game is filled with these moments where you make choices but they feel like they barely matter. [spoiler]When you make the decision to sacrifice yourself at the end, it doesn't matter if you have Broken Steel installed because you just wake up from this apparently super deadly thing.[/spoiler]

TL;DR: The choices are black and white and very boring and you never feel like your choices ever have any consequences.

[h1]2) The Enclave[/h1]

I'm a big fan of the Enclave. I just think they're really cool and interesting. However, I hate how they're handled in Fallout 3. [spoiler] My main issue is that you can do Eden's bidding while also having to oppose him and the Enclave. Your conversation with Eden has 3 or 4 options if I remember correctly and only 1 agrees with him. Then you get the vial of FEV and you go to the Brotherhood. You cannot lie about the Enclave's intentions to take Project Purity. The only way you can help the Enclave in that conversation is by saying that you don't have the vial. You cannot publicly help the Enclave. In New Vegas, you can help any of the factions publicly to the anger of all the others. Fallout 3 forces you onto a set path against the Enclave. Then there's Autumn who doesn't want the FEV being in the water but also wants to take Project Purity anyway even though the Enclave only wanted it to kill off the mutants. It honestly doesn't make any sense. And you can make him straight up just leave with a few sentences, just like how you can get Eden to kill himself with a single sentence. 

AND THEN YOU CAN PUT THE FEV VIAL INTO PROJECT PURITY ANYWAY. AND EDEN WILL NEVER SEE IT. WITH BROKEN STEEL, YOU JUST WAKE UP TO FIND THAT EDEN AND ALL THE OTHER ENCLAVE BASES NEARBY WERE DESTROYED. What is the point in inserting the vial if the Enclave dies anyway? The Enclave sees themselves and only themselves as pure, true humans, which is why they want to kill all the mutants. They want to repopulate the wasteland with ""real"" humans-themselves. There is no point to inserting the vial if they are going to be destroyed anyway. And the only reason they were destroyed is because you weren't allowed to go against the Brotherhood and directly help the Enclave. Then, in Broken Steel, you have to fight more of the Enclave and help the Brotherhood take over their main base. EVEN IF YOU TRIED TO HELP THE ENCLAVE BY INSERTING THE VIAL. You are forced to go against them. But at the end you can chose to bomb the Brotherhood, which is pretty much the only thing you can do against the Brotherhood. But to do that, you have to kill a fuck ton of Enclave soldiers. [/spoiler]

TL;DR: Again, you don't have a choice. You have to do what the game wants you to do and you are occasionally given a choice that is completely defeated by the stuff the game forces you to do. The game likes to pretend that the Enclave are another joinable faction, but really, it forces you to go against them no matter what.

[h1]3) Boredom[/h1]

Fallout 3 is just really boring. Nothing was too hard or too easy. It felt like drifting in a world without challenge or really anything too interesting. By the end of my playthrough, I had visited barely any settlements because I didn't feel compelled to explore. Nothing seemed to really matter. I played Operation Anchorage only to find a linear shooter. I played Broken Steel only to find a linear shooter. I then started Mothership Zeta and then found another linear shooter and I stopped playing because I was just too bored. I'm not sure about the experiences of others but I personally found it really boring.

[h1]Summary[/h1]

Just get Fallout: New Vegas. Honestly. It is the best game I have ever played and it is definitely far better than Fallout 3.",1655850465,1655850465,False,1,0,0.474452555179595947,0,True,False,False
