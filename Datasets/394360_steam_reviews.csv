Well, now is your chance to put your money where your mouth is!

Just like Hitler, you'll have a bunch of assholes working for you that don't do shit!
Just like Hitler, this war will make you want to do copious amounts of drugs!
Just like Hitler, you'll want to shoot yourself in the head by the end because no matter how much you prepare, no matter how advanced you get, no matter how much political power you have... one little mistake will lead to a crushing defeat.

Let me explain this game in a different way...
Build up your excitement.
Get overwhelmed by the learning curve.
Have a couple seizures as you watch the night and day sequence flash by over and over again.
Lose your fucking mind over all the tiny numbers and symbols and shapes that all move around at the speed of light, only to vaguely see through the numerical chaos that you are slowly losing ground to a bunch of Bolsheviks.
Realize you've spent more than two hours trying to understand this crap rendering it too late for a refund.
Spend another two hours trying to understand the damn shitty tutorial.
Spend another hour watching a YouTube video of some overly enthusiastic assclown explain how to play the game.
Try it all again and spend hours building up infrastructure, armies, navies, airforces, defenses, tanks, factories, naval yards, radios, to have it all fall to some shitty little country with cavalry units!!!!
WTF!?!?!

Let me explain this game yet another way...
Not worth it.
Remove from Wishlist.
Uninstall. 
Never look back.

The buildup before the war is fun if you enjoy setting up your forces and managing the construction/research aspect, but once the war starts the engines deficiencies become apparent and no amount of modding can fix it. Factions remain completely useless and if anything a hindrance. Been asking for years a better faction command system to allow for a SHAEF-type of unified command structure to make a combined/joint force with the player in command. Instead one the war start be prepared for you 'allies' just doing whatever they want and acting is if you were just another neutral and spamming random areas with their divisions.

Honestly the only reason to play this game is because of the mod community since PDX keeps pumping out underdeveloped features in DLC packs that cost way too much, and often include things that the wonderful mod community has already done but better.

But I recognize that the game has its issues, especially relating to the toxicity and radical political ideas in the community, stupidity of the AI, the large number of bugs and glitches, and an insufficient balance between complexity or simplicity depending on the game mechanic. There will be another quick recap at the end too by the way.

Hearts of Iron IV is a grand strategy game focused around the devastating global conflict colloquially referred to as World War 2. The game features a very detailed and well thought out game based on the history of the time period, but also leaves room for modifications of history, perhaps to the advantage of the country of your choosing. The game features many things, among which it has modding support.

The modding community is fantastic, and although the capabilities provided by the developers to create mods aren't particularly spectacular, modders can do very cool things with such limitations regardless. The mods the community has made can be anything ranging from simple patches for bugs, fixes or clarification of a tooltip or other feature that the developers overlooked, adding a new cool idea to the game, or outright transforming the game into something totally different. Total overhaul mods are amazing, some already exist to bring players back to World War 1 in the Great War mod, or into the modern age with a mod like Millennium Dawn.

The content already provided in-game is fantastic, some admittedly being a bit outlandish, but that's to be expected of a historical sandbox simulator. The number of opportunities for alternative history is crazy, and more options keep arising as the developers release more DLCs (as of now the next DLC ""Trials of Allegiance"" is due to release soon). The major countries already have diverse content and alternative history options, but many minor nations that played a key role in World War 2 also have paths too (but not all minor nations; South America lacks content entirely. though Trials of Allegiance will fix that soon).

Also, something not mentioned much with Hearts of Iron, but I absolutely LOVE the art, the focus icons, the technologies, the loading screens, and UI, it's all so good. Not to mention the 3D models of soldiers, trucks, artillery, planes, ships, etc. I've gotta give credit where it's due to the developers who made such a beautiful looking game.

As of now, Hearts of Iron IV is easily one of the best grand strategy games focused on World War 2 that money can buy currently. Admittedly this is a bit of a double edged sword, because the game is not perfect (which I'll get into soon) and as such is clearly not at its best. It's in fact one of the only World War 2 grand strategy games, making it really the only choice; that's not great. Now, I feel it important to talk about because I find personally that there are some issues with Hearts of Iron IV

For starters, let's talk about the overall community (outside of modding for the most part). It's a mess. Simply put, if you aren't a particularly competitive individual, there's not much fun to be had in multiplayer. The toxicity to be found in the Hearts of Iron IV community is appalling, let alone the very radical political ideas you'll hear (either ironically or unironically). If you want an experience with Hearts of Iron IV that isn't super toxic, I would avoid the community in many cases (sometimes it can be quite nice; especially with people you know, but be careful otherwise).

The game itself isn't too bad, at least not compared to the community. However there is some shortcomings, particularly around the areas of the stupidity of the AI, the number of weird bugs and glitches, and the lag. Oh god the lag. Late game is rough for lower end to middle end PCs, because the game is weirdly unoptimized for dealing with the massive spam of equipment, divisions, and really anything by AI (including nukes after some time). AI is pretty stupid; not much to elaborate on there. There's lots of weird bugs to be had with all of the alternative history paths the game offers, sometimes the developers overlook something an accidentally leave a loophole to be abused.

Depending on who you ask, Hearts of Iron IV might be either too complex or too simple, and personally I think both could be true to an extent. It's true that Hearts of Iron IV did not even release with a espionage system in place; a very important factor in World War 2, instead the developers would release a paid DLC to add that feature into the game. Hearts of Iron IV faces massive simplification in certain areas from its predecessor: Hearts of Iron III, notably the simplification of the weather system. Some have argued Hearts of Iron IV is too complex, I mean, look at the naval systems, it's a huge meme in the community to not know how the navy works despite thousands of hours.

Both sentiments are right to an extent, certain things about the game have been simplified far too much, and other systems are far too complicated to be fully understood by even long time players sometimes. A balance needs to be struck, or otherwise giving players the options to a more simplified or complex system for most systems could be ideal (even if that increases the development time, I'd say it would be worthwhile). The same could be applied to modding, it would be nice to have far more powerful modding capabilities, but I understand why one might want a custom language dedicated to modding the game. Perhaps a choice could be made to accept both forms, I don't know how it would work but it would be nice to have such.

There's a lot more to be said about this game, both good and bad, but I feel that this review is long enough as is, and I've yapped enough as is. As stated earlier in my TL:DR, Hearts of Iron IV is one of the best games out there, which offers a wonderful modding community, great alternate history options, and beautiful art, yet has some problems including stupid AI, plenty of bugs and glitches, poor optimization, and hasn't struck the best balance between complexity and simplicity. Overall I enjoy the game and would recommend you try it out if you're willing to pay a bunch of money for DLC and the base game that's actively improving over time; if not, I totally understand.",1652754991,1708572284,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

I don't comment on games often, and I know my amount of hours may not convince you but I promise it's worth it. One thing I will say, as a negative, is that the DLC policy can be...sketch, in that you have to pay for about $20 at least for most of the important DLC. However, during sales that paradox does often you can get them in packs for a decent price overall. Sucks to have to wait for them, but is what it is. Another is that, as is common for most paradox games, the multiplayer while very much alive. has problems with disconnects often. Its not impossible to play, but expect at least one desync per MP game. Although you can simply reload a save, which is autosaves often. I believe you can even change how many times it does and when. Gameplay-wise I would advise you watch videos of it on youtube to see if its your type of game. I can say I love the game to death, but that means jack to you. Anyway, 10/10 game I'd def say try it.

In terms of gameplay and accessibility, I honestly think this is the worst paradox game. Which is a shame because aside from that, this game is quite amazing especially with mods.

Most paradox games you can figure out where you are going wrong, why you failed this one time around, or learning a new mechanic through your failures. Not HOI4 though. Do not expect to win even a single war following the online guides, tutorials, and meta builds for armies and supply. 

I honestly strongly recommend not even buying this game even if you think you can learn through other players online. The community for this game in my experience has been straight up toxic and full of keyboard warrior douchebags who instead of helping you online will instead only frustrate you more than however many hours you have just sunk into a playthrough just to lose immediately.

The dev team also seems to just make more mechanics every update. While this improves the experience for regular players, it just completely resets the task of figuring out how to play for players like me who are still trying to figure out how tf to play.",1708463650,1708463650,False,3,0,0.523809552192687988,3,True,False,False

I have played this game for over 3,500 hours. I love playing this game. I don't regret the money I have spent on it. I will continue playing this game well into the future.
With all of this in mind, I would absolutely NOT recommend you buy this game (or more specifically any of its DLC) unless you are at least 90% certain you will love it. It takes at least a thousand hours to learn the game. It costs over a hundred dollars to get the full game experience from heavily overpriced DLC, most of which aren't good enough to justify not just going without. It's riddled with old bugs that have gone unpatched and will likely remain for quite some time. Official paid content is regularly outranked by community-created workshop content.
Do not get me wrong, I do not at all wish to discourage someone who may genuinely be interested in this genre, this is a fantastic game if you want to play it. HOWEVER, if you have even the slightest doubt or are unwilling to invest the time required to learn the game and make the cost worth it, I would not recommend purchasing this game.

This is not (necessarily) a critique of the game, this is meant to be my advice for people looking to buy the game.

TL;DR:
Wait until it goes on sale before buying, and only if you really want to play it. Feel free to use community content if you don't want to play with DLC.",1657001755,1708459421,False,0,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

Pros:
It is a very addicting, very fun strategy game that involves the map changing colors. 
One of the biggest modded communities next to Gmod and Black Ops III. 
Plenty of content to sink your teeth into (with many more on the way)
Relatively healthy community

Cons:
It is a massive learning curve. You will need to invest time and energy into playing, watching, researching and asking questions about this game. I recommend iSorrowsProductions and r/hoi4 for content
Long game (4+ hours a run)
It becomes very slow in late game hoi4, past 1945 the game gets bogged down by the AI and all its useless units.


Overall: I think this game is for anyone looking for something fresh to learn and has a passion for history",1708407345,1708407345,True,1,0,0.51327437162399292,1,True,False,False

To put it bluntly, this game is about as challenging as tying your shoelaces, and it requires about as much skill as making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that recommending this game to anyone with an education level beyond the second grade is an insult to their intelligence.

Let's start with the so-called ""difficulty"" of Hearts of Iron IV. From the moment you boot up the game, it's painfully apparent that the AI is about as threatening as a newborn kitten. Whether you're playing as a major power like Germany or a minnow like Luxembourg, you'll quickly find that the AI opponents are about as strategic as a goldfish swimming in circles. They lack any semblance of tactical nuance, making the game feel more like a glorified game of whack-a-mole than a true test of skill.

And don't even get me started on the learning curve‚Äîor lack thereof. Unlike other grand strategy games that reward careful planning and strategic foresight, Hearts of Iron IV practically holds your hand every step of the way. The user interface is so dumbed down that even a toddler could navigate it with ease, and the mechanics are about as deep as a puddle after a light rain. There's none of the depth or complexity that you'd expect from a game in this genre, leaving you feeling more like you're playing a game of Risk than commanding a nation during one of the most tumultuous periods in human history.

But perhaps the most egregious sin of Hearts of Iron IV is its utter lack of consequence. Whether you're conquering Europe as Hitler or fending off the Axis powers as Churchill, the outcomes feel about as impactful as a butterfly flapping its wings halfway across the world. There's no sense of weight or consequence to your actions, making it impossible to become truly invested in the outcome of your campaign. It's like playing a game of chess where every piece is made of marshmallow‚Äîsure, it might be fun for a little while, but it ultimately leaves you feeling empty and unfulfilled.

In conclusion, Hearts of Iron IV is a game that's about as challenging as breathing and about as fulfilling as eating a stale cracker. Its lack of depth, challenge, and consequence make it a poor choice for anyone looking for a true grand strategy experience. Unless you're a second grader‚Äîor perhaps someone with the intellectual curiosity of a second grader‚ÄîI'd recommend giving this one a hard pass. There are far better games out there that actually require you to use your brain.",1708385390,1708385390,False,2,3,0.411949694156646729,2,True,False,False

Non-historical mode is just madness, it just doesn't make any sense.

The DLCs are expensive and bring game essential features that are just pay walled. So basically buying the game is buying a trial version.

The modding community is a big reason to have this game. Many enthusiastic nice developers out there, on their free time making some amazing experiences. Yet the overall community is mostly toxic, cringe and many of them are extremists, which is quite interesting and fun.

It is quite clear that game developers don't care. Updates are few and far between, very little content and always introducing new bugs.

Now let's say hypothetically you wanted to play a mod with a friend. You would need to make sure you both subscribe to the same mod on workshop, usually few days or week earlier because some times it doesn't get downloaded. You need to check for updates, because your friend might have a newer version. Verify your game files as you might have some missing file or corrupt file for some reason. Maybe the mod file wasn't downloaded the file is empty or the pointer to the file in the documents folder is broken. Some times, even when you have checked everything, it just still doesn't work, check out Victoria 3 for that, can't play 2 or more mods in multiplayer. And then make sure you both play the same version as in not nakama, because nakama introduces more problems like Network Address Translation, and some times it doesn't but the normal version does. So some people can't join eachother, or maybe just the other.
If you are setting up a new mod, it usually takes another 2 hours before you get into the game. And usually 30 minutes to 2 hours until the game desyncs or crashes.

Paradox is just the definition of a shit poster but as a Publisher and Development company, as literally all of their modern titles are like this.

In my opinion it is very important to watch a youtube tutorial about basics before starting the first game. That said, game has its complexity covered with tooltips.

What I (and very few others) have found frustrating and kind of stubbornly stupid is that in this complex game we do not have an option in options to disable mouse panning. UI buttons are naturally at screen borders and any overshoot of cursor pans the camera away from what you are working on. Should be a simple thing to code that OPTION in. Was literally about to give up playing for this, but then I found a free cursor locking software ""Lock Cursor Tools"" and run it in background.

Also strange is that there is no key re-bind options. Can live with that tho...

A very public complain is that the game has many small, but interesting DLC:s, which cost 20‚Ç¨ each. So basically you buy the base game as a demo/stripped trial version and for the whole game you will end up paying over 100‚Ç¨.

Lead any nation through World War 2, forge alliances, wage epic land and air battles, and rewrite history. While initially daunting, the core gameplay loop of managing industry, research, and warfare is surprisingly accessible. But the depth is undeniable. Customize divisions, plan intricate offensives, and navigate a complex web of diplomacy. Each playthrough feels unique, offering endless replayability. Sure, the learning curve is steep, and some DLC feels essential, but for WW2 buffs and strategy aficionados, Hearts of Iron 4 is a masterpiece.

I subscribed to HOI4 in January 2022. Since then, I have been paying $6.55 CAD every lunar month.

Recently, Steam/Paradox increased the price of my subscription to $10.99 CAD.

I argued against the legality of such a price increase. To no avail.

Since both the platform and the producer of the game gave me the cold shoulder, I decided to cancel my HOI4 subscription.

Easier said than done. Why? Easy. Because the In Store Manage my Subscriptions button is not working.

I tried everything. Nothing works.

I contacted Steam. Again, they gave me the cold shoulder.

I am putting Steam on notice that I will be seeking legal redress if this abhorrent behaviour continues.

In any case, I removed my VISA information from the account and am letting Steam know that they must cancel my HOI4 subscription or face the legal consequences.",1707868230,1707868230,False,1,1,0.502824842929840088,0,True,False,False

Game is a unique experience in every sense of the word.

Long version:
- Get the game.

- You may agree with the game direction or not, but I challenge you to find a game as complex and interesting as this one.  In the meanwhile, this is as good as it gets if WW2 is your thing.

- As a personal anecdote, a few months back I got mad at the people at Paradox and Steam for censoring me a comment about enjoying HOI IV on weed and the moderator who f*** up never shown his/her face after that mess, but I gotta grant the forums and the game itself are not entirely related (business model).  Went to the Paradox website, opened a ticket and then it hit me how the gaming industry totally lost touch with their customers.   Whoever took my ticket (Andy I think was the last one), was very nice and understanding, yet, issue was never resolved and I did get censored without a mature explanation from anybody.  Steam is final on their decisions even so that means not giving a simple mature answer to their customers.  75% of PC market gives you that right, I suppose.  We're nothing.  Millions is the key, dollars and players.  Nothing really matters anymore for those who come from the classical golden eras of PC gaming where developers and people behind the distribution actually cared.

- Even so, as a personal desire, I'd love to see Paradox take care better care of their community, with a good start at having some serious, real moderation at the game's Steam forums.   *A lot* of caustic people there (including moderators) and it's sad to see how fast topics derail and go absolutely offtopic in a jiffy, yet you get punished for being merry and friendly.  You'll see/experiment lots of personal attacks, xenophobism (if live outside the ""first world"", be warned when participating), racism and wildly offtopic comments fill a forum that could be genuinely a place to gather information rather than pick a fight. 

- Get all the DLC (I'd skip the sabaton soundtracks, just a personal opinion), every DLC is worth it and game is not expensive really. There's a lot of work put in there and you can tell, even so in the little details; game graphics are out of this world and give HOI IV it's very unique style and feeling.  Soundtrack selection is wild, with speeches and music from all sides and kinds in a playlist that feels endlessly awesome.  

- If you get bored or want to expand the experience, the mods for the game are very well done, with a lot of effort and care put into.  Give yourself a treat, install a cheatmod and rule the world like you really meant to rewrite the history of the world.

If you're someone who wants to play a game with exciting and fun fast paced content this game is absolutely not for you. Hoi4 in my opinion is a slow boring and tedious game that will often make you frustrated and uninterested. The slow pace of the game makes it a snails walk to beat every single goal in the game, and it takes 30 minutes into the game to have anything really happen. If the game were cheaper I would still be recommending it, but 40 dollars is completely outrageous. I'm a person who wants to feel like their money is well spent, and when I played this game I was immediately dissapointed. Hoi4 is also very unbeginner-friendly, making me have to look up how to do something as simple as move soldiers to other areas in the middle of battle. 

In conclusion, if you are and old man or some person who has trouble keeping up the pace with other games then this is a perfect game for you. If you are someone who likes games that are fast paced, non-complex, and simple in & out then this game is absolutely not for you.

a good german commander would not lose ww2
the Allied forces, courageous and bold
In the heart of Europe, amidst the strife,
They forged a path to end the Nazi life.
With thunderous roars, the engines did scream,
As Stukas descended, a nightmare, a dream.
Their bombs fell like rain, upon the land,
Bringing destruction, with an iron hand.
But amidst the chaos, the Allies stood tall,
Their resolve unbroken, they answered the call.
Through fields of fire, they marched as one,
A force unstoppable, until the battle was won.
Propaganda's whispers, a weapon of might,
Turning the tide, in the heat of the fight.
For hearts and minds, they waged their war,
Spreading the truth, from shore to shore.
And as the smoke cleared, and victory was won,
The Stukas lay silent, their evil undone.
The Allies emerged, triumphant and free,
A testament to courage, for all eternity.",1660847010,1707537419,True,2,0,0.343434363603591919,0,True,False,False

Hearts of iron 4 is a good if not a great game with mods, the mods add so much to the game.
if it's on sale and you like Grand strategy games Buy it i recommend it absolutely a easy 7.5/10 with no mods a 9/10 with mods

A thing to note, i play the game with mods only, so i can't speak much on the base game.
In my opinion Hearts of iron is a mod it game.

The main reason my review is a negative is the dlcs.
I'll keep it brief.
1: their pricey for what they have in them.
2: They have updated/new and balanced focus trees for countries that are in base game (Wouldn't be as big of a problem if they were all in 1 or 2 dlcs or just updates to the game)
3: Most of the dlcs add a new small game mechanic, examples man the guns adds ship designer no step back adds tank designer By blood alone adds planes designer and arms against tyranny adds a market that you can sell you're customised tanks planes and other equipment you see the problem? all of these should be in one dlc with another thing here or there for $10 to $20

And i guess that's my biggest problem, a lot of the small mechanics and small changes the dlcs have, should all be in 2 to 3 dlcs for $20 to $25 or just updates to the game.

Edit
One more thing the dlcs the add models for planes and tanks and the Other dlcs the have models for infantry for some countries should be free or all in one dlc for $5 Maximum, $3 realistically.

Having dlcs that have or add models to a game is no different to micro transactions.

To Paradox
You need to fix your dlcs

stop making so many dlcs that have little in them and cost too much, make big dlcs that have lots in them for $15 to $20.

stop making dlcs that make countries that are already in the game playable

Paradox is making normal updates that a game gets and holds onto them and puts them in a DLC with a random thing here or there and charges you $20+ and says ""Here's a overpriced clearly ripped content and some community suggested changes, and balancing to the specific countries that are in is dlc, and yes it makes them stronger then the other counties that aren't in the dlc, so if you want your specific country to be updated buy this other dlc for $20+ and 
it also has clearly ripped content community suggested changes, and balancing.""

And one last thing The dlcs that update certain countries make those countries stronger and funner compared to the countries that have no dlc or have a older dlc.

I have been on a HOI4 bender lately, pure degen and I think all the game time is altering my brain. So like now when I see friends or relatives I see them not as people, I mean I do, but I also more see them as Puppets. If they complain about something my head is like 'decrease autonomy level' and I quickly improve their infrastructure. Moreover whenever I get paid, my head makes the division deployment sound. The change seems deep. Indeed if I see someone I don't like I think 'justify wargoal' and I am adding the term 'micromanage' to many sentences.

Edit: okay, if you spend hundreds of hours in the game then the price can be somewhat justified. But I still do not agree with the monetisation practises.

Nevertheless, I leave each time greatly disappointed that issues that have been present from the beginning have not only not been fixed but have been exacerbated with each update. The AI, which already struggled from the game's inception, is now bogged down with dozens more features that it cannot manage effectively. Coherent strategic decision-making is absent, as is any semblance of threat assessment.

There is only so much enjoyment I can get out of a game where the AI makes repeated and obviously suicidal naval invasions, sends units unescorted halfway around the world to be sniped by convoy raiders for no clear purpose, and NEVER builds a single capital ship to threaten my fleet. This is besides the fact that the naval system manages to be both micro-intensive and too abstract, feeling clunky and nonintuitive even when compared to older titles like HoI3. The plethora of different stats and components do not clearly map on to how the units handle on the game map, and all of these efforts fail to make the essence of the game's naval combat anything other than smashing two rocks together until one of them breaks.

The frontline system has always been and continues to be miserably frustrating. While ostensibly a way to reduce micromanagement, you simply end up constantly redrawing the lines or babysitting units to make sure they do not leave gaps or otherwise behave in ways you do not want. I think that most players of grand strategy games would prefer to simply control their units themselves. While this is an option in-game, by exerting manual control and not using the frontline system, you cannot avail yourself of the important Planning Bonus mechanic that is vital for launching powerful offensives. What makes this even worse is the huge division inflation that takes place towards the middle and late game. Even minor powers will produce massive armies of nearly one hundred divisions, which makes everything a slog and puts a huge drain on older CPUs. The manpower and mobilization systems are incapable of dealing with this, as there are few if any real economic consequences to putting a massive mobilized army in the field once you have the industrial capacity to do so, which is as easy as spamming out enough early-game factories that the game becomes relatively trivial. Economic power and growth is horrendously modeled and entirely fungible.

Overall, the achilles heel of this game is its insistence on making the experience multiplayer-friendly by automatic away much of the intuitive, granular control that is a defining feature of the Grand Strategy genre. The strength of paradox's older, single-player geared titles was the real-time system that allowed the player to vary between speeding through parts of the game while slowing or pausing it to take a more detailed look at events on the ground or plan next moves. ""Multiplayer-friendliness"" takes away from this experience by orienting the mechanics towards an RTS style, or more accurately a hybrid of Grand Strategy and RTS that can't really decide what it want to do. Unfortunately, I have not bought any of the recent Paradox titles and I do not intend to buy another one unless and until they decide to go back to their Grand Strategy roots.",1707265642,1707265642,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù countries.

The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.

 If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later.

 We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can‚Äôt predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution.

One of the game's strengths is its complexity. The game offers a detailed and intricate set of mechanics, with players managing everything from military strategy and production to diplomacy and politics. The game also offers a wide range of customization options, allowing players to tailor their nation's strategy and ideology to their liking.

The graphics in Hearts of Iron IV are decent, with detailed character models and environments that capture the atmosphere of World War II. The sound design is also well done, with realistic sound effects and music that add to the immersion of the gameplay.

However, the game can be quite overwhelming at first, with a steep learning curve and a lot of information to take in. The game also suffers from some balance issues, with certain nations being more powerful than others.

Overall, Hearts of Iron IV is a highly complex and engaging grand strategy game that offers a unique and immersive experience of World War II. While the game's complexity and learning curve may be a turn-off for some players, those who enjoy in-depth strategy games and the historical setting of World War II will likely find this game to be a rewarding and challenging experience.",1683409806,1707080891,True,0,1,0.459770113229751587,0,True,False,False

Hearts of Iron IV is an epic [u]strategy[/u] game for those who loves [u]historic[/u] and[u] strategic [/u]games...
If u are interested with "" [u]WW2 [/u]"", "" [u]Cold War [/u]"" etc. u must buy this game, a lot of mods u can access freely in the workshop, and u can play different dates with mods even [u]Middle Age[/u]...Workshop mods makes HOI4 epic even u dont buy DLCs u will have a lot of fun trust me I bet my everything to it.

[h1]II-INTRODUCING[/h1]
[list]
  [*]I think ""[u]art[/u]"" part of the game is quietly good, It makes u fell like u are living WW2. Great songs really great...

  [*]Game is too hard when u start first, u should watch guide videos and multiplayer rp videos.
When i watched these type of videos i started learning HOI4 more deeply. Do not give up its hard but u will be satisfied.

  [*]If u want a [u]master advice[/u] I must say start with [u]minor[/u] countries first and when u feel that u understand game basicaly, go try [u]majors[/u] It will make u learn quickly. I have started with major and f**k*d up many times and just lost time. .d

  [*]Only bad part of the game is optimization I think. There are drops waiting u if u have a fart pc.

  [*]I prefer u to buy the game and many dlcs, DLCs are making game very good. 

  [*]In any case it will be worth to buy.

The game is complex, this is one of the more difficult paradox game to learn, but it is super worth it. As you play the game there is loads of DLC to keep the game fresh. The game may be old but it is truly one of the best or the best grand strategy games ever. You are able to do so many things and you can easily sink too many hours onto it. 
A couple downsides are that it took me about 25ish hrs to get the basics of the ropes of the game fully down and lots of youtube tutorials. Also get the game on sale, the bace game and the DLC adds up quickly and you can save tons of money by only getting things on sale and it goes on sale enough to make it easy to wait.",1618342477,1706858284,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Have you ever wondered what it is like to clap cheeks and ravage the vast marshes of mother Russia? Or play a game that literally no body will complement you on for having thousands of hours in? Well I have just the game for you! Get yourself this game and you will get a taste of how Hitler felt when papa Stalin and Uncle Sam gave him a PP slap in the 1940's. With this fully immersive map game you can not only commit war crimes, but you can get away with it! Hell bring a friend! Geneva? Never heard of that. So come on down and either get your PP slapped or do some PP slapping while frothing at the mouth at 3:27am because Operation Sea Lion is finally happening and the British navy is in Oceania because you have no navy! 

For the low low price of your soul and well over a hundred dollars you can have every DLC known to man AND an addiction not even your wife can give you. This game will give you the new car feeling for your first couple hours as you try to figure out what the fuck you just bought and what battle planning is. 

Want a funny story? No? too bad, I bought this game when i was too young, got addicted, nearly failed a few classes in school because I would play in class. It got to the point that my teacher begun playing it too because he hates communism. 

This game is the most addictive thing ever. You can make a damn bear your president as Poland, or cause Hitler to kill himself in his bunker before the prehistoric war starts. So what are you waiting for private Potato? Get this game today!",1706816686,1706816984,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Thankfully, i gave it another chance and realised how its game mechanics actually work to make a great game.
The devs really made a great game with a lot of potential.
But like other HOI games, only few nations are actually fun and unique.
There is only way to have a national focus tree not on few nations, but most of the nations. There is a way to have unique leaders and events for almost any entity existing on the map and those that might emergy.

I got the game only a week after release. It's to this day continuing to still get major updates and DLC content added, and the community keeps you engaged with countless amounts of alternative history scenarios like The New Order, or The Kaiserreich. UI wise HOI4 was a massive upgrade over the spreadsheet that was HOI3, making it much more easy and accessible to players to get started. 

You manage everything, from how your country is ran politically, to managing the logistics for your army, and the generals that are in charge to command it. All whitest fighting around the entire world around you. With having the choice of going Democratic, Fascist, or Communist. 

HOI4 is a game that is completely unpredictable, you can have Communist Mexico invading the USA, USSR collapsing in 1940, or even the Ottoman empire being reformed. Every country gets a unique focus tree. 

Legit HOI4 has been one of the best teachers of geography for me, obviously since you are playing on a world map you start to remember where countries, cities. states. where everything is. 

It does have it's faults though. First the AI has been improved since release but sometime's its very janky and unproductive, and half of the time has a mind of it's own on terms of what it want's to do. It would had been a much better idea to have a way for the player to be in control of a lot of how the AI acts, and performs (for example having a more aggressive AI or an less aggressive one) 

The base game itself could use with more playable scenarios would be interesting, such as having a default cold war, or even World War 1 scenario. But it mostly seems paradox are concerned with the current. 

It never seems as well Paradox where concerned for setting up anything that was realistic to how WW2 turned out which isn't a problem, but would be nice if historical focuses actually intended to make it historical.  

Multiplayer doesn't at all feel intuitive to me to play, and always constantly has lagging issues slowing down the game, along with cheaters attempting to ruin it. 

The front line system still feels fairly outdated, and in need of a revamp, along with the retreat line. 
 
Trying to manage your Navy can be a massive hurdle that you hardly half the time spend effort on, since you are primarily  focused on the army and air force. 

The DLC as well is not at any at all reasonable prices, some DLC adds hardly any content into the game (mod's do more then the DLC half the time)",1703623924,1706596639,True,2,0,0.519704461097717285,1,True,False,False

Got 400 more hours out of the base game, and just threw 100 hours into the Old World Blues Mod (Fallout) via Workshop. Tons of fun, and as this game ages the mods and the base game only continue to improve. I shall continue my conquest nerds. 

Edit* - 800 hours
Over 800 hours now, and they finally added something that makes this game so much more realistic I think I'm finally truly happy here. Logistics Management is now a thing. Between Railroads, Supply Hubs, Roads, Trains, and Trucks, the single most difficult thing to effectively manage in wartime is finally here. The ability to have what you need, always, and the ability to take that away from another Country, Sh*t just got real.

I've put in over 500 hours at the time of this review. 
This game has changed a lot, and sees many new improvements, and rebalances as it gets older.
Tons of fun, lots of replayability, and it's a solid challenge. Worth it.

Very well made game, very complicated and i love it.

But they need to fix about Game Features:
- The Hotjoin in multiplayer feature took a long load duration and must wait until the new player joined complete the loading time to resume.
- Can't report toxic players that ruined multiplayer atmosphere.
- Need DLCs to add some Economic and Diplomatic features.
- May add Auto-Join (Host no need approve if someone want to join Multiplayer room) or Need Approval (Host can accept or reject other people to join first) feature to join multiplayer mode if the Hotjoin Loading time already disabled in the future.
- Expanding the timeline from WW2 to Present Day condition would be great for this game.

Abgeordnete, M√§nner und Frauen des Deutschen Reichstages!

Schwere Sorgen lasten seit Jahren auf unserem Volk.

Nach einer Zeit stolzer Erhebung, reichen Bl√ºhens und Gedeihens auf allen Gebieten unseres Lebens sind ‚Äì wie so oft in der Vergangenheit ‚Äì wieder einmal Not und Armut bei uns eingekehrt.

Trotz Flei√ü und Arbeitswillen, trotz Tatkraft, einem reichen Wissen und bestem Wollen suchen Millionen Deutsche heute vergebens das t√§gliche Brot. Die Wirtschaft ver√∂det, die Finanzen sind zerr√ºttet, Millionen ohne Arbeit.

Die Welt kennt nur das √§u√üere Scheinbild unserer St√§dte, den Jammer und das Elend sieht sie nicht.

Seit zwei Jahrtausenden wird unser Volk von diesem wechselvollen Geschick begleitet. Immer wieder folgt dem Emporstieg der Verfall.

Die Ursachen waren immer die gleichen. Der Deutsche, in sich selbst zerfallen, uneinig im Geist, zersplittert in seinem Wollen und damit ohnm√§chtig in der Tat, wird kraftlos in der Behauptung des eigenen Lebens. Er tr√§umt vom Recht in den Sternen und verliert den Boden auf der Erde.

Je mehr aber Volk und Reich zerbrechen und damit der Schutz und Schirm des nationalen Lebens schw√§cher wird, um so mehr versuchte man zu allen Zeiten, die Not zu Tugend zu erheben. Die Theorie der individuellen Werte unserer St√§mme unterdr√ºckt die Erkenntnis von der Notwendigkeit eines gemeinsamen Willens. Am Ende blieb den deutschen Menschen dann immer nur der Weg nach innen offen. Als Volk der S√§nger, Dichter und Denker tr√§umt es dann von einer Welt, in der die anderen lebten, und erst, wenn die Not und das Elend es unmenschlich schlugen, erwuchs vielleicht aus der Kunst die Sehnsucht nach einer neuen Erhebung, nach einem neuen Reich und damit nach einem neuen Leben.

Als GlossarBismarck dem kulturellen Streben der deutschen Nation die staatspolitische Einigung folgen lie√ü, schien damit f√ºr immer eine lange Zeit des Haderns und des Krieges der deutschen St√§mme untereinander beendet zu sein.

Getreu der Kaiserproklamation nahm unser Volk teil an der Mehrung der G√ºter des Friedens, der Kultur und der menschlichen Gesittung. Es hat das Gef√ºhl seiner Kraft nie gel√∂st von der tief empfundenen Verantwortung f√ºr das Gemeinschaftsleben der europ√§ischen Nationen.",1706382472,1706382472,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Real review:
This game is a modern history nerd's wet dream. It has extensive modding capabilities. Every game can be wildly different. Most of the countries with playable content are superbly thought out! However, my major complaint with this game is how it is almost required by default to own most of the dlcs. As they give access to almost necessary features. They are almost necessary because it is possible to achieve a fun time without the features. It just makes core aspects of the game harder to achieve. Remember how I said most of the countries with content are good, there are exceptions to this. Over time the idea for content for this game has changed quite a lot. This has negatively affected older dlc. Newer dlc have more complex, fleshed out, and generally more intuitive thought given to each nation. While older ones lack such detail. For example, compare Italy to Japan. Italy has several different paths it can take. And in those paths there are more decisions and choices that one can make. This allows a Italian game to be quite different from one another. Now Japan has a older focus tree. While it is not the worst out of the bunch it still pales in comparison to others. The paths, while unique, lack more of the freedom Italy has with it's choices. This can make a Japanese game feel more repetitive and railroaded. This isn't bad if you want to purely go with historically accurate games, But even then, you can still miss out on greater options and choices that Italy can achieve. 

So in short the game is great you should 100% give it a go if you love history, grand strategy, or heavily modifiable games. There are a few detractors but if you are willing to pay to fix them then I think it's worth it (I mean I gotta justify my 2000+ hours somehow). And you can get this game with it's dlcs on sale for good deals.

My point is that I've played a LOT of games over the years.  I have to be careful about when I play Civilization because of how addictive it is.  Yes, I'm one of those people.  

Out of all the computer games I've given large parts of my life to, Hearts of Iron IV is the most addictive by far.  Sit down to play for an hour, look up and four hours have passed.  I suppose for some folks the game won't be appealing, but wow does it have me hooked.  My son (19) is the same way.  Just so much STUFF in it.  You've got to get all the DLC mind you, otherwise you're missing out a LOT.  Some folks gripe about DLC.  If that is a hill you need to die on, play something else.  Me, the money spent on HOI 4 is money extraordinarily well spent.  I'm list right now as playing for 481 hours.  I got the game about 30 days ago, and probably half of those hours is me sitting with the game paused while I'm doing something else.  That stated, that is still 240 hours in 30 days.  There are only 720 hours in 30 days folks!  So yeah, the game is amazing.

This game is like any other paradox game and will kill you with DLC purchases. I believe one they finish this game with full DLC you'll pay roughly $200-$300. Personally I'm fine with it. You the reader are probably less inclined to spend this money. The upside to the DLCs is your paying this money over large periods of time with a few quality of life updates that come at no cost. Paradox isn't doing this to screw you over. They just realize in order to create a great game like this one it costs money and this is the best way to go about it. If you don't enjoy spending money but are still on the fence the modding community is great and you can still have hundreds of hours of game play without the DLC through the mods. I just would not recommend this game to the typical steam players who want a finished game with a one time purchase.

Update: Its now 2024. Returning to my greatest critique, the cost of DLC is roughly $145 and they go on sale pretty frequently. I over estimated by $100ish dollars, but I think this only proves my point as its still a costly game over its life time. That said $60 base + DLC = $205 for a game that's been out for 6 years is only like $30ish a year and thats if you don't do the subscription service or just buy the DLC on sale.

Elysian points out only idiot would buy unit DLC would cause it to rise to possibly $200. There's absolutely 100 ways to skin this cat and figure out how to get the entire game for less... That said, I still standby the idea that the game is great and with mods you can basically just get the game for $60 and enjoy free content without needing to give paradox your money. This game is the ultimate buyer beware as if you don't know about this ahead of time the game can feel pricey and undercooked.",1516521760,1706113809,False,4,0,0.511111140251159668,3,True,False,False

Played Hearts of Iron III for hundreds of hours, amazed at the uniqueness of being able to play [i] any [/i] country in the world, a concept I had not encountered in any other game. Pre-ordered hoi4, watched the release stream, and started downloading it the second the game was available.

Hearts of Iron 4 is a grand strategy game where you control a nation during World War 2, focused primarily on the military side of things. You are no one in particular - think of yourself as the ""spirit"" of the nation. But most often you are the government in some form.

You will assume the role of operational command, giving orders to your armies either manually on a division-by-division basis, or by using the battle plan system to give orders to your generals, who will carry them out independently. Often it is a good idea to mix the two. You will also need to command your navies and give your air squadrons their missions.

You will assume the role of a national leader, assigning advisors and generals, dealing with crises, managing diplomatic relations, making executive decisions, and (in the case of the United States) managing your legislature.

You will assume the role of economic and production manager. You will need to plan out your industrial expansion and then assign your military factories to each piece of equipment or category of equipment your army will need. There is one feature here I find particularly interesting. Besides prioritizing specific pieces of equipment depending on what kind of army fits your needs, you will be faced with a decision of efficiency vs capability. Let's say you are producing Panzer IVs. Fantastic. Later with new technology maybe you design something equivalent to a Panther. You cannot simply change from making Panzer IVs to Panthers overnight. Your production efficiency will drop significantly while your factories retool and your workers relearn their jobs. While your newest tank might be much better than the old model, perhaps your Panzer divisions on the gates of Moscow cannot afford the ~6 months to a year drop in production right now. I'm sure your crews would appreciate the additional firepower, but any tank is better than no tank.

There is much I have not covered, such as espionage, managing partisans, changing your government either peacefully or through a civil war, sending ""volunteers"" to wars while you yourself are at peace, research and design, etc. Suffice to say that if my little aside about production wasn't terribly boring to you, I am either a great writer or (much more likely) this might just be the game for you.

That being said, this is a Paradox Interactive game. This means a steep learning curve, particularly if you are new to this company's games. You will look at the wiki. You will look at YouTube tutorials. You will have 1082 hours in the game and still not fully understand everything in this game (looking at you, naval, air and tank designers). That being said, if you can get past the first 10-20 hours there is a lot of depth here to be found here. You can play as any country in the world. Every playthrough is different. After 1000 hours I still play this and find new things to do and new ways to have fun. If you like strategy or history and have some free time, I highly recommend getting into this game. Think of the learning stage as an investment. You can learn most of what you need to know in a test run of Germany just screwing around, looking at menus, and trying things without worrying about strategy.

Even when you have played every country that interests you using every strategy that interests you accomplishing every goal that interests you, the world of modding beckons. You can visit a hypothetical world where the German Empire won the First World War (Kaiserreich). You can forge a state in the wastelands of the fallout universe (Old World Blues). There are also many mods that simply visit different time periods, such as the modern day and the Cold War (Millennium Dawn and Iron Curtain). Not only do these offer full overhauls of the settings, but will often include vast amounts of entirely new gameplay mechanics and heavily modified existing ones. It's like an entirely new game. There are dozens of mods that have a similar scale and quality to the 4 I just listed.

Of course, If I am to give a genuine review of Hoi4, I need to address Paradox's...[i] unpopular [/i] DLC policies. They tend to release a new DLC anywhere from $10-20 every time they do a significant update which locks some of the update's features behind it. The base game of HOI4 is fun, but not in any way the ""full"" experience. The DLCs add quite a bit, especially at this point when there are so many. One way to get around this is to play with a friend that owns all the DLC and have them host the game, which gives the content to everyone in the lobby, but this is not a possibility for everyone. I suggest playing the base game and deciding if you like the game enough to fork out the money. Few in the community like this system, but the fact that most people buy them anyways is kind of a testament to the quality of the game, at least compared to others in the genre.

The expansion pass is an option if you want to do a test run of all the DLC or if you think you will only play the game for a month or two, since buying all the DLC, even at like half price on sale, is quite expensive at this point.

But anyways this is getting a bit long. I highly recommend picking this up on a sale if you are willing to put in the time and like this kind of thing.",1653005770,1705974678,True,5,0,0.580297291278839111,0,True,False,False

If we talk only about the game without DLC, it's really bad. The game feels empty and will likely keep you entertained for a maximum of 150 hours (30 hours to figure it out).

With mods, you can immerse yourself not only in WWII, but also play for modern countries, play out a scenario if Hitler conquered the whole world or the USSR won the Cold War, and that‚Äôs really cool.

S√§kkij√§rven Polkka [[Full Version]]

On kauniina muistona Karjalan maa
Mutta viel√§kin sy√∂mmest√§ soinnahtaa
Kun soittajan sormista kuulla saa
S√§kkij√§rven polkkaa
Se polkka taas menneit√§ mieleen tuo
Ja se outoa kaipuuta rintaan luo
Hei, soittaja, haitarin soida suo
S√§kkij√§rven polkkaa
Nuoren ja vanhan se tanssiin vie
Ei sille polkalle vertaa lie
Sen kanssa on vaikka mierontie
S√§kkij√§rven polkkaa
Siin√§ on liplatus laineitten
Siin√§ on huojunta honkien
Karjala soi - kaikki tiet√§√§ sen
S√§kkij√§rven polkkaa
Tule, tule tytt√∂, nyt kanssani tanssiin
Kun polkka niin herk√§sti helk√§ht√§√§
Hoi hepo surkoon ja hammasta purkoon
Kun sill√§ on ihmeesti suurempi p√§√§
Tule, tule, tytt√∂, nyt kanssani tanssiin
Nii meill√§ on riemu ja suvinen s√§√§
S√§kkij√§rvi se meilt√§ on pois
Mutta j√§i toki sent√§√§n polkka
Kun rakkaimmat rannat on j√§√§neet taa
Niin vieraissa kulkija lohdun saa
Kun kuuntelee soittoa kaihoisaa
S√§kkij√§rven polkkaa
Se polkka on vain, mutta sellainen
Ett√§ tielle se johtavi muistojen
On sointuna Karjalan kaunoisen
S√§kkij√§rven polkka
Nuoren ja vanhan se tanssiin vie
Ei sille polkalle vertaa lie
Sen kanssa on vaikka mierontie
S√§kkij√§rven polkkaa
Siin√§ on liplatus laineitten
Siin√§ on huojunta honkien

2,618 hours - Its okay

3,169.5 hours - After 16 attempts at the achievement ""Hardly Anything Sevres"", and possibly 20-30 hours wasted, I am broken. I did everything right, I followed the guide step by step, but it wasn't enough. After playing Hearts of Iron 4 for almost 132 days, I find my self reflecting. What could I have done or achieved during that time instead of wasting it on countless ruined campaigns, a couple of digital achievement in my steam library? I could've learned a new skill instead, like the guitar. I could've sought new friends and seen new places, but no, instead I played Hearts of Iron 4. I will remember the good campaigns, like defeating the Axis as America, or invading the British Isles as Germany. Even the non-historical games, like reforming the Central Powers and rewriting history. But for now, I say goodbye to you, Hearts of Iron 4.

The core game is alright for a playthrough or two, but it's lacking a certain je ne sais quoi. Here's how I suggest playing the game:

1. Buy the game. Do not buy any DLC; [b]get the monthly subscription for $5 and immediately cancel it[/b]. This will get you a whole month with all the DLC for $5.

2. Try the base game once on historical mode with a country of your choice. A small one is nice to learn the ropes, I think.

3. Once you've done that, go install Kaiserreich and play that instead. It has so much more development effort put into its storytelling and gameplay than the base game that it effectively turns HOI4 into a mere tutorial mode for Kaiserreich.",1705792446,1705792446,True,1,0,0.515151500701904297,0,True,False,False

The frontline system has only gotten more intuitive as more updates have been released, and the level of organization you can give to operations across a region are very realistic and more refined compared to other Paradox that aren't as warfare focused (EUIV, Vic 2/3). Being able to control a single unit, their entire composition, to running vast armies on a global scale is a feature that almost no other game has replicated. That being said, it is almost solely a game based on warfare. Only the ideology of your country really matters, and you are very limited to what you can do in terms of building up your state in preparation for war. I also found the construction mechanics to be pretty bare-bones and restrictive, almost the entire production/research features are reliant on stacking modifiers (Bigger number = more benefits).

Despite this, the mod community is very active and have created a multitude of mods from alternate history to the modern day, so replay value is almost endless and is enough to recommend the game on its own. I have really only played the base game twice, trying out the major countries and a few minor countries (although they are very grueling/and sometimes impossible to play). Overall, HOI4 is probably the most accessible and detailed game that combines a warfare simulator with the scale of grand strategy, so any fans in that department will feel right at home.",1477024120,1705783624,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Nevertheless, i managed to spend 200 out of my 300 hours in this game without a single one aside from 'historical portraits' and the one for Poland. Overall, the dlcs aren't really a necessity in the end, and even the somewhat bare-bones base game is perfectly fine for an average experience. You don't have to succumb to capitalism to enjoy yourself, no matter what people on Reddit think. I've had tons of fun over the last few months grinding front-lines and killing millions of enemy troops, which was time that I definitely consider to have been worth the money. My suggestion would be to get this game on sale, as it can be like $15 in the right situations, and you will NOT regret it. 
      Also, it might seem a bit difficult at first, but that feeling wears off once you watch some good tutorials and get the hang of things. I still have practically no idea what I'm doing; and that's fine. Also, if one of your friends has the dlcs, you can enjoy them for free in multiplayer; while simultaneously asserting your superiority over them with paratrooper cheese as Italy.

2700+ hours. Where did all that time go?

I'd be lying if I said all those hours accumulated solely from the vanilla and DLC that Paradox has to offer. I think Hearts of Iron 4 has a lot to offer, with some of the best combat and most complex systems out there to offer, but without the enormous modding community, I'd probably have dropped this game at 500 hours. Seriously, who wants to play germany for the 40th time in a row on a world conquest save?
This is the one gripe that I have for the game's lack of re-playability. That, and the 70-day focuses. Waiting upwards of 10 real life minutes to finish one is worse than wiping my ass with sawdust and a jar of marmalade. Now, some of the more hardcore fans of the genre might argue that there's plenty to do with all of the nations in the game, but ultimately what separates each country from one another isn't the differing economies, militaries, or tech-trees (all countries share the same re-skinned tech), but the pre-ordained focus trees, which, at best, still only offer you a choice between one of four ideologies: Nazi, dirty commie, ""wholesom"" democratic, and boring neutral. No joke, but I'm fairly sure a ""neutral/authoritarian"" run in HOI4 is the cure to all types of insomnia.
This is why I enjoy the mods that this game is compatible with. Mods on the steam workshop alone offer such a variety of different playstyles, scenarios, and revamps, its like a whole bunch of DLC waiting to be picked. With mods, you can break that lack of re-playability with different types of tech-trees, different ways to manage your economy, and even different and alien ways of managing your military, and in the sense of vanilla HOI4, paradox would do themselves good to pay attention to what their community is making. I'd have dropped this game a long while back if it weren't for the few mod-makers who slave away producing quality content.
Oh, by the way: the ""my little pony"" mod, no matter how ""good"" it is, can go kill itself for all I care. I don't care about how much effort someone put into it, anyone over the age of 12 who watches this show has some major psychological issues, and needs to check themselves into the nearest ward stat for immediate euthanasia. ""Oh, see? see? The OP of this review wants people to DIE because of their beliefs!!!11!"" No, I'm just kink shaming.

From the military technology to the political landscape, Hearts of Iron IV captures every single detail that leads to and takes place during both WWI and WWII. The level of historical detail in the game is excellent, providing an immersive experience for players navigating through an intricate global conflict.

The game has a large number of countries to choose from that have various national focuses and strategic considerations. Whether you are leading the almighty Soviet Union, the German Reich, or some small nation seeking to alter history‚Äôs path, you will find interesting things with each play through because of the many countries available for play.

Hearts of Iron IV gameplay is intricate yet rewarding. It demands attention to military, economic, and political matters, where players have to manage resources, plan offensives strategically, and engage in diplomatic manoeuvres. Detailed control over military operations comes into play due to the intricate planning system for battles: assigning divisions and coordinating air support.

This aspect has been key in keeping interest in the game high as it continues to be developed further by its modding community. There is a wide range of player-created mods supported by Hearts of Iron IV, including alternative scenarios in history up to total conversions.",1705676159,1705676301,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

There's like an endless amount of different tactics you can use that keep the game fresh even after having played it for as long as I have. Mods also help a lot with replay-ability. Specifically The Road to 56 is SO good, it basically just takes all of the default things and makes them better and more in depth. Kaiserreich is a close second for me, if you like alternate history. I don't have any of the DLC but I've heard they are good, just expensive. I wouldn't really recommend buying the DLC unless it goes on a pretty good sale.

-It's very complicated, but after you understand how it works, you'll start playing it a lot more.
-There is an issue with the price of this game and its dlc-s. Make sure you know what you want to buy, don't just buy the DLC for bulgaria and never play it. If you can't afford it, there are plenty of mods out there.
-Immersive. If you really enjoy it, you'll forget you've been playing for hours.

The game is a very good strategy that has huge potential. Even tho it might be quite pricy its worth it.
Game has a lto of mechanics and mods that can change game from WW2 to WW1, Modern and many more.
Even if you dont have dlc's you can still have a decent experience, but the dlc's are well worth it.

I spectated the AI and realized they're not smart. The AI doesn't change it's behavior on harder difficulties. You're just given handicaps to limit your abilities. The AI does NOT build new railroads or supply caches, they don't upgrade railroads, they don't increase supply truck usage for an army group. I watched as Germany had -120 steal but refused to upgrade the infrastructure where steal was present or any other resource. I know the AI does build infrastructure sometimes, but Germany was worried about building more military factories, which it didn't need. 

I'm pretty tired of lazy devs making garbage Ai and then just handicapping the player. Maybe get better at your job and make better AI for a more compelling game. ]

Other than this complaint, I think the game is just fine. Just know that once you understand the game, you will always beat the AI with ease, even at the hardest difficulty.

I still like the game and will still play it, but knowing the AI is brain dead makes me not like it as much. It's not a challenge at all.",1672315983,1705459308,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The key innovations that HOI4 offer in its genre as opposed to its siblings revolve around industrialization of the war machine and the 'frontline' planning system that ostensibly lets you set and forget military frontlines that will then carry out a series of plans that you set for them before hitting execute.

The industrial system is good and I really enjoy the ability to customize units and divisions. This part of the game should be expanded into other paradox titles, and is pretty much the only reason I keep coming back to this game.

The frontline system doesn't work at all and is in all cases worse than simply using the fallback line to specifically say 'stand here, don't move'. Frontlines will split and reassign troops if they encounter impassable terrain or borders of non-hostile nations, resulting in situations where your very simple frontline suddenly has reassigned 2/3 of your troops to a friendly border and the remaining troops are now split between two new frontlines, neither of which inherited the advance orders from the original. 

This is further complicated by the ui for using the frontline system, which took me about 100 hours to get enough of a grasp on that I could make multiple sections of a frontline part of the same offensive. The rest of the UI is just exceptionally bad, even for clausewitz games like this one. 

Diplomacy doesn't exist. It pretends to, but it doesn't. There is no political maneuvering possible like in EU, as the game will bend over backwards to ensure that you are always dragged into amalgamated wars by joining or leaving factions and calling faction members through guarantees. For example, in a recent game I fabricated a claim on afghanistan. China, who was a friendly trade partner of me and hostile to afghanistan, guaranteed them. When I attacked, they joined the war, immediately asked the USA (who they were previously embargoing) to join their faction, were accepted, and then called the USA and the rest of that faction to war against me, which then also called the French faction (with whom I was previously hostile) as my allies against the USA and China and Afghanistan.

Did I mention it crashes to desktop every few hours and hard locks the pc occasionally? Play EUIV instead.

Hoi4 (Hearts Of Iron 4) uses features in war such as supply, logistics, and casualties to a greater extent than most war games. The only item that is crazily misused is the civilian casualties. You could Detonate the entirety of France with nuclear bombs and they would face 0 casualties. However, it is a very unimportant mechanic and most of the time that bug is to your advantage.

Next, DLCS, Hoi4 currently has 9 DLCs. Together for Victory, Death of Dishonor, Waking the Tiger, Man the Guns, La Resistance, Battle for The Bosphorus, No Step Back, By Blood Alone, and Arms Against Tyranny. In the first couple of weeks, you are better off without these DLCs as they are just more stress. The later on you go, the more you find the game boring and unplayable without the 9 DLCs as things varying from Focus trees for minor nations, to Tank, Plane, and Ship Designer, to content online, to just game mechanics in general. I reccomend ALL DLCs to players. 

You are simply missing out without them. But, I think they are only worth their price on sale or discount which Paradox (The developers) tend to discount in major Steam males. (More info can be found about them online.) While all DLCs are a MUST HAVE, I personally don't think they are worth the $20 each. Also Disclaimer: The Ultimate Bundle doesn't include By Blood Alone and Arms Against Tyranny. 

Another option is to get the ultimate bundle subscription which is $4.99 a month which is a GREAT deal considering that the Ultimate Bundle is $170.

Lastly, Hoi4 is a pretty heavy game and it will heat up your laptop without a doubt. As a laptop user, the experience is pretty annoying dealing with the heat and exhaust it gives you but it is not hard to get use to.

All in all, Hoi4 is a great game (And really complicated!) and I highly recommend it to all players.",1705389699,1705389699,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game has reached a state of such over-complexity, you have to play for a hundred hours just to understand THE BASICS, at which point, all future learning is about fine-tuning the million-and-one little features that have (overall) have minimal impact on game play.

While Paradox still develops new features and content, the development is extremely questionable, and focuses much more on the ""Role play"" part of their community... So the newer the content, the more convoluted and overall pointless it is the game play, and health of the game‚Äôs engine. (The supply system overhaul did a hell of a number on that optimization‚Ä¶ now wonder they had to slow the game by 50%... it‚Äôs the only way the AI can keep up anymore.)

And since Paradox, by admission, DOESN'T EVEN PLAY-TEST the game beyond the search for game-breaking bugs, game health and balancing falls entirely on the modders to make it even playable, for the long playtime it was designed for. (At least without being teeth-grindingly annoying and sluggish against horrendously annoying AI.)

They‚Äôve made strides on improving UI, but outside of that, ‚ÄúQuality of Life‚Äù is a term that is apparently lost on the Paradox Developers‚Ä¶ As they‚Äôre more focused on giving do-nothing nations their own content (most of which you will not use) to push for DLC sales, rather than FIXING and improving what they have, in ALL Categories.

Paradox claims to listen to the community feedback, but I don‚Äôt think anyone has actually seen them follow through on those claims (except for a very small number of fanatically obsessed Role Players who do nothing but put this game a on a pedestal in the Paradox Forums‚Ä¶) so what hope I once had about further development for the game has evaporated. Especially when it comes to the growing Multiplayer community of the game‚Ä¶

AND they‚Äôre now pushing a subscription service to sell their failing content‚Ä¶ I think that says all it‚Äôs need to about where this game is heading‚Ä¶ the dumpster‚Ä¶

If you can get it for sale, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend anything less than 50% off. As for the DLC, pirate it. It‚Äôs not worth what Paradox charges anymore. (Hence why they have to sell a subscription to get people to buy it.)",1637878909,1705356795,False,3,0,0.501741349697113037,0,True,False,False

I find myself at the end of over 20 campaigns looking at a black monitor thinking, ""why would anyone spend money, then time on this game?"".  

Pros: 
-decent macro/micro manager.
-fun history game.

Cons:
-combat system 
-unit building (the whole system makes no sense, how can i add a logistics company and it lowers my cohesion?)
-logistics
-Air
-Sea

I really like the concept of the game, and I know a lot of other people really enjoy this. I did not.
Edit: after reviewing positive comments and negative. I have realized that some games can be dog water trash and still fun. i guess at the end of the day if you are happy with the amount of time you waste on the next bowl of water that is what is important.

(second edit): i highly reccomend (HIGHLY) you dont play this game. i seldom find games of this genre to be so.... yeah, i dont even have words for this. a word to the devs, ""eat my shorts you posers""

The game can be a little challenging at first but with a little research and time you can learn the games core mechanics in no problem. Command your armies, naval fleets, and air force on all fronts. organize your logistics, industries, and infrastructure to support your war effort. follow real events as they happen or alter history completely as in hoi4 the player is almost fully involved in the entire world.

Hoi4 offers decent replay value on its own as you can choose any nation you want to play as each with its own differences in ideologies, equipment, geography, and benefits. Some are better off than others as you'll struggle depending on what nation you'll chose. In my opinion most of the replay value comes from the DLC and mods. 
The DLC's are pretty controversial as many of the games mechanics are locked behind them. Many of the DLC mechanics players argue should be included in the base game but you can get by without them.
The games modding community is pretty big so there are plenty of mods that can add hundreds of hours of gameplay to the experience and is the reason I have almost 500 hours of gameplay and no achievements as of writing this. Some mods do more than tweak the just gameplay. There are mods that change the game in unique ways or entirely while keeping the core mechanics. mods include base game overhauls, different time periods, alternate history, or even different franchise such as old world blues which has the game take place in the fallout universe. the possibilities are endless.

Overall I'll break the game down into three scores
Base game is a 6/10
Base game with dlc 8/10
modded 10/10

After almost 500 hours I've grown bored of the game. Its different for everyone as some players have over 1000 hours. At the end of the day I recommend the game especially if you like Strategy games and military history.

The internal documentation is basically non-existend. So you have to rely on guides and youtube tutorials.
Only after copying unit templates and designs you are able to play at all. Of cause those guides tend to disagree because there is no documentation.
So it is up to some spreadsheet bros to figure out what certain things actually do. This info will be relevant up to the next mayor patch.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

The base game feels so barebones and after a while, it just stops getting fun. A few mods can somewhat help, but ultimately DLC content seems almost required to enjoy this game more.

Strategic Command WW2 is far different but much better than this game. Hoi4 looks beautiful and has fantastic music (the presentation overall is a 10/10 for me)--but that's about all it offers imo.

Edit: The far too heavy reliance on national focuses is really what kills this game.

Edit 2: Nah it's good actually

Edit 3: Nah it sucks actually. The thing that makes this game really replayable are mods like Old World Blues and Kaiserreich Redux.

[h1] SOUNDTRACK [/h1]

The soundtrack of this game, is not that special, like, at all. It isn't bad to the point you'll mute the game, but it isn't good to the point you'll notice it or listen to the soundtrack outside of the game. However, that's just my personal preference. 


[h1] DIFFICULTY [/h1]
One thing, I like about this game, is that it's only difficult depending on you. Even on the easiest difficulty, and the buffs you can give  to yourself through custom settings, you can still lose, if you make mistakes. That's a good thing, because it means even on easy mode you can't just click on a country for example, invade it, and succeed. You have to put in the effort to coordinate attacks. So if you lose, it never feels like the game was unfair. Rather, it was your own fault. 

[h1] CUSTOMIZATION [/h1]
The game is highly customizable. Even without mods and DLC, you can find yourself playing this games for hours without realizing it. The amount of alternative history routes you could take, is endless. For example in play-through that lasted 10 hours (without me even realizing it), I made an alternative history of causing a Communist revolution in the U.S. converting both Mexico and Canada into Communist states by staging coups, and of course declaring a war on Britain. Further escalating the war even after Hitler and The German Reich collapsed. The play-through was genuinely fun, and I wish to play one where I make the Soviet Union into a democracy, America into a Fascist state, and so many other routes I would like to take. 

[h1]GAMEPLAY [/h1]

The gameplay is fun and enticing. Really, there's everything for everyone, If you wanna run a shadow empire with your own beliefs by staging coops, or look at domestic issues, construct and build a country, invade the country you have a hatred for (I hate Switzerland), simply help out your favorite country in a war because you are too much of a coward to play as them and fend off an invasion, so you just make yourself a re-enforcement (like I did). There is a little bit of something for everyone in this game, you could probably do a play-through without ever directly getting involved in any wars, or be at the prime center of every war and conflict. You could start your own British empire, you could make Communism/Democracy/Fascism spread by staging coops, or you could be a coward and do nothing interesting. 

[h1] TUTORIAL [/h1]

Now, after all these praises, why do I recommend against it? Well, it's because of the tutorial, or lack there of. If you are a complete newbie, and only heard about this game through friends (like I had), and got it. Chances are, you wouldn't know what to do, especially if you are new to this genre of games like I was. If you wanna learn how to play this game; you'll have to either A.) read the wiki, or B.) watch a [b] 6 part [/b] video on YouTube to understand the basics. Now, I was willing to watch the tutorials to give the game a chance, but it doesn't mean everyone will/should. If your game has such an awful tutorial to the point there could be a whole genre of videos of people on YouTube being the tutorial for you; chances are your game isn't worth buying if it isn't friendly to newbies at all. My friend who got me into buying the game had to learn it from a friend. To me, you should be able to pick up a game, play the tutorial, and the rest is up to you to have fun; not for you spend 183 minutes watching a 6 part tutorial, and hope you manage to get the hang of it. People play video games to kill the time, there is a difference between time killing and time wasting. It's tedious that I have to look up a video on YouTube like for example, how to drop a nuke, because the game didn't bother to have a proper tutorial, and only directed me to a wiki. I have never seen a game where there could be an entire genre on YouTube just to teach you how to the bare basics of the game. The basics, the game doesn't even tell you the basics. What do these alerts mean and how do I fix them? Welp, time to Google, or go on YouTube for the 70,000th time. I mean, a game should at least be able to tell you the basics, but it doesn't even do that. 




[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]]
If you are willing to watch the necessary tutorials on YouTube, or read the Wiki, then this game is fun, and probably one of the best games you could play if you're into this genre of games. However, the fact the tutorial is basically non-existent and you need to rely on the game's community to learn it, just rubs me the wrong way. If you're willing to buy it and again, watch/read external tutorials, I suggest buying it on sale, otherwise you might feel you got ripped off for paying nearly 20 dollars and not even knowing how to play the game properly. Overall; a good game, but the tutorial sucks too much for me to forgive it, and it's a huge issue; it's not new-comer friendly at all.

i have 300 something hours in this game and from what i have experienced is interesting 

this game is a stellar game with a huge backing but is very hard to get started alone, plus to enjoy the game you have to own the dlc which cost a fortune, but when you do start t find people and get some of the DLCs you really can enjoy this game and if you ever find yourself becoming bored just remember there is a crazy amount of mods and reworks for you to try!

Learn by tutorials and watch lot's of ""how to play"" videos on YouTube. Works well on multiplay/coop play historical and alternative history. You can play the 'big'/historical countries or dive into any other country on the map.

There are lots of options in the game to work on your Army, Navy and Airforce, but keep your economy at peak level. You can change military designs, divisions, research new equipment and focus yourself on lots of strategical (country) goals. You can micro manage everything up to the battleplans en compositions of your forces. The game is extremely extensive and very daunting for new players when they start to dabble into these types of games. If you are fan of strategic games such as Civilization or Europa Universalis than this game is right for you! For all new players to the genre: keep on trying, make mistakes, learn and you will eventually get the hang of it.

Expansions: Buy only those expansions when you are planning those countries involved into the expansion. Don't buy them full prices as the amount of content is too few to buy them other than on the 50% (or more) off the price.

1. Together for victory       - Canada, Australia, New Zealand, The Raj (India), and South Africa
2. Death or Dishonor        - Hungary,Romania, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia.
3. Waking the Tiger          - Chinese Republic, Communist China
4. Man the Guns              - The Netherlands, United Kingdom, Mexico and USA
5. La R√©sistance              - France, Vichy France, Republican/Nationalist Spain, Portugal
6. Battle of the Bosporus - Turkey, Greece and Bulgaria
7. No Step Back               - Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Soviet Union/Russia (Tank designer)
8. By Blood Alone            - Ethiopia, Switserland and (new) Italy (Plane designer)
9 Arms Against Tyranny  - Sweden, Norway and Denmark (Military Industrial Organizations and International Markets)

Overall: 90/100 (good)
-------------------------------------
Learning curve: 3/10 (very steep)
Addicting: 10/10 (extremely good)
Graphics: 7/10 (fair)
Bugs/playability: 9/10 (very good)
Multiplay/Coop: 9/10 (very good)
Price: 8*/10 (good)

*Base game

But... The expansions will add a lot to the game and even when it gets more complex, it is quite fulfilling to do all the micromanaging you want.

Great place to start:

It's complicated for no reasons.

So many little steps you have to think about that make even the simpliest tasks to a mind blowing problem. 
Wish this game was a BIT more playerfriendly. But every update makes it worse (espionage, trains, .... ) 
Yes i understand maybe hardcore strategy fans love it for it's complexity. But for me after work, i do not want to work again.

Currently you have to play it for weeks to understand and at least once every month again to don't forget how to do shit.

 If you have a job / stuff to do - forget it.

Mix this with Graviteam Tactics and it would become almost impossible to make a better World War Two game. Seriously someone do that and put it on a relatively okay engine with a half competent AI. You'll harvest the entire supply of money from every WW2 nerd on Earth.

Mechanics:
The mechanics like stability and war support, and the sheer amount of variables involved, can make the game overwhelming for new players. Once you become more seasoned at the game, it becomes easier to manage and even simple, as with most other games. Be aware if you are thinking of purchasing or have recently purchased the game: it's going to suck learning them. Research is fairly straightforward, but the technologies for designers can be complicated, especially in the late game. Focuses trees are variable, from fun to boring.

DLC:
The thing I tend to despise about this game is the absolute need for DLCs that add little on their own. Each DLC tends to add a new mechanic or two, a handful of focus trees for the region of interest, and some new music. 

AI:
The AI is absolutely braindead, simply put. They do things that make zero sense and only harm themselves. That is all I have to say.

Combat:
This is what distinguishes this game from other WWII strategy games. The combat system is in-depth and a dream for players who want to control every facet of their gameplay experience. You manage your army, navy, and air force in full, including the manufacture of equipment, planes, and ships. You have to ensure that your divisions are supplied, your frontline is stable, your airforce and navy aren't vulnerable, your logistics situation is handled, and more. Few HOI4 players will point to any reason other than the combat system as to the main reason they bought the game. [/i]",1563272096,1704480366,True,20,1,0.718902885913848877,0,True,False,False

I wanted to get into the Old World Blues mod for it really badly. 
But let me tell you, this game has 100 hour tutorials on the basics for a reason.

I played the tutorial long enough to figure out how to make my troops attack a province because prior to that my troops must have just been sprinting headlong into machinegun fire and at first contact going ""Well im not going out there, its dangerous!"" Because you have to tell your army that you're at war and where the frontlines are for not just you but the enemy as well. 

I finally got around to going to war in the mod only for my troops to just not care and not listen to my orders even when I hit one of the like 5 different ways to ""force"" your troops to attack.

There is so much to this game you could have an entire college class on this subject and it wouldnt cover all of it. In fact you should have a second college class going over the philosophy on why anyone would waste their time playing this game for 100+ hours just to learn the basics anyway.

If there was a mod that simplified the gameplay mechanics by making the frontlines for enemy and allied territory just happen instead of me needing to reach out to congess on the matter first or making troop assignments easier or really just cutting out like 70% of the games ridiculously cluttered and out of place UI, anything of the sort that would be amazing. I guess what I'm asking for is a mod that turns this game closer to something resembling Civ 6 which I know I'll catch flak for and people will say ""just play Civ 6 then!"" but Civ 6 has goofy ass graphics and no Fallout themed mod that I know of so theres that.

Thats enough of my rant.

To sum it all up in general from my point of view: I expected the game to be more polished and functional at this point after so many additions and expansions. The AI is a mess and hopefully HoI5 will implement some sort of totally reworked neural network AI so that the AI can be trained and learn from its mistakes.
As a multiplayer game this might be another beast, if you're into that sort of thing. For me, HoI has never been about multiplayer, but rather an extension of the study of history and making it come alive and all those ""what if?""-scenarios and trying them out. Multiplayer is not really suited for that type of play.
To be able to do that you need a competent AI that works in an intelligent manner, but without being predictable. The other big problem is that the AI can easily be ""cheesed"" and the game soon starts feeling just like a game of Solitaire or Poker, albeit a rather complex one at that.
After having frustrated myself with the idiotic AI in a few campaigns I wanted to see if the AI really is always that bad. So, I let the game run and I just observed what the AI was doing. Every single game runs into the same problems where the AI makes huge amounts of small units and is unable to do anything meaningful for long periods of time. The game starts stalling and units go back and forth without much general coordination and ""vision"".
I watched Germany stack tens of panzer divisions in Alaska together with Japan trying to go through the Rocky Mountains, where a few Mountaineer units held it without any problems. During Barbarossa Germany starts sending units east through the quite undefended Soviet lands in the south as long spearheads without any backup. I guess they are trying to get to the other front in China. During this the main frontlines practically stood still as units suicided one after another again and again in attacks that never had any chance of success. Generally there seems to be a lack of grand strategy in this game about grand strategy.
These just a couple of general observations from several simulated runs 1936-1950.

For me, personally, I also wish that the developers would add the possibility to streamline the micro management more. Give the option to micro all aspects, but if you're into grand strategy, do you really want to decide exactly what type of radio there is on the tank..? Just give me the grand strategy and the possibility to go and micro manage - if I want.
These two approaches are implemented successfully in many different types of games and applications, so why not here?

The overall presentation is nice, but suffers from the general problem of not being that logical and you just have to learn how stuff works. Intuition isn't really a thing here and I wish Paradox would overhaul some design aspects and bring it to the 21st century. I know, strategy game buffs love to have stuff in a certain way, but it is absolutely not impossible to design better ways of doing old stuff. The National Focus and Research technology trees are two examples where the general idea is good, but the implementation is just horrible. For a HoI4 veteran this is no problem, but why on earth do you design it to be as confusing and overly complicated, when it can be done in a much, much more understandable way..?
I guess the game suffers from the ""I love my child even if he's a monster""-syndrome.

Awesome music. Graphics so-so. Don't like the cartoonish style in a historical setting.

That being said, that doesn't make this a good game.  There are numerous bugs that just ruin immersion and game play experience. A few of these are front line orders which you need to micro manage to work properly because if you try and use a field marshal to do it it will reshuffle each army every time you take a tile, which leaves you with all of the land that you took open for grabs by the ai because now they're undefended.  If you are losing a tile, you could have 6 divisions on the frontline right next to it watching thinking ""damn thats crazy."" Not to mention AI being able to bug its way to get advantages that you, the player, are not allowed to do. They can invade your land from neutral countries and push from a tile that you are attacking.  Half the time after naval invading they just get invisible units and you're forced to relaunch the game to be able to see them.  The only real challenge from this game after you play enough is the AI constantly naval invading which you need to keep units ready in your homeland, becoming more annoying than anything. 

TLDR: Its a game you'll play a lot, but hate the entire time. Go play League of Legends for the same experience for free",1703194979,1704246983,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

VERY HARD. This game is complicated to learn, and will kick you to the curb until you either learn it's over demanding mechanics (Imagine Cities Skylines but more micromanaging), or you rage quit. Do not waste time on the tutorial either. It tosses you into the fray as Italy. Tutorial fails to teach you how to effectively do anything. You press buttons and it tells you what it does, but it DOES NOT tell you how to USE the features every menu has. You must manage resources, trade, politics, manage the military of your nation (Which is subdivided by Army, Navy, and Air Force), and also plan how to avoid wars. War is a nightmare for new players because you will not understand how it works. The enemy will either be aggressive (They attack you), or defensive (They wait for you to attack them). This is a complete nightmare if you happen to be fighting an aggressive target such as Germany. Another thing: If you join an alliance, the opposing alliance is going to shaft you unless you are prepared. If you join the Axis planning to just get help conquering a minor nation like Greece, the entire world will turn on you. In my rather pointless tutorial playthrough, I managed to: Lose to Ethiopia, try and failed to be pacifist, caused civil war in Yugoslavia for shits and giggles, join the Axis, fail to protect Albania from Greece, wage war in Greece (Which Germany ""Helped"" in by attacking a tiny island), and then send an army Bulgaria gave me to take Stalingrad. Time for the pros and cons.

Pros:
There are alternate history paths to look at that will make the game interesting.
Cause civil war in enemy countries by raising party popularity and then starting a coup (Which take time).
You can pick literally ANY country on Earth to play.
Watching the maps change can be fun if you are rooting for the winning side.
In depth tech trees, national focuses, and research trees.
Historical focus that can teach you about WWII if you stay on the historical paths.
Forge alliances or join one.
Active modding community.


Cons:
VERY STEEP learning curve.
Micromanaging gets annoying.
All the resources you need to watch.
Games take a long time (I mean a full day if you are dedicated).
Tutorial completely fails to help new players understand how to play.
DLC is needed for some features.
DLC is overpriced.
Game is WAY overpriced! ($40! I could have gotten a much better game for that price!)

My verdict:
6/10. Miserably challenging game that will drive you mad. You might have fun if you are a grand strategy player, but you will hate life itself if you are hoping for a quick match against the ever more prepared ai. Game has redeeming qualities when you cause the downfall of an enemy through a coup. If you buy this game, don't be a sore loser because this game will win every time if you let it. Go in open minded and fully willing to let the game teach you at it's own mercy (Which can be months, or even years). Stay calm and willing to be defeated, because you will lose a LOT before you win even just one war. Don't waste money getting this thing full price. Wait for a steep sale to pick it up. Finally, consider if you really want this one. Are there games or programs you are more excited for? Consider getting that before this.

I still definitely recommend this game for anyone who likes mass RTS or micromanagement but I primarily recommend playing multiplayer as singleplayer may typically end up becoming a late-game lag-fest with 1 year taking roughly 30 minutes to finish and battles typically becoming so decisive that you know in advance if you will beat the entire enemy nation/alliance or lose.

The multiple DLCs for the game expands, or adds, focus trees to the game for countries, that lets you explore historical and alternative paths for countries, while also adding game-play elements which are anywhere from slightly changing the you you play the game, to letting you do things that would be either impossible or very hard to do without the DLCs.
If you get tired of the possibilities of the base game, or the WW2 scenario, then try out the multiple community made mods, that range from exploring the WW2 scenario with more realism, to exploring different parts of human history, to exploring alternative history scenarios, to even venturing into different game/movie/series universes, and more!

Nestled in the quiet corners of their home, where bookshelves met with memories, Robert often found himself lost in the grand strategies of ""Hearts of Iron IV."" The intricate dance of nations, the ebb and flow of history, and the pivotal decisions that shaped destinies were elements that enthralled him. But it wasn‚Äôt just the game; it was a connection to a past that he yearned to share with his son, Ethan.

Ethan, a spirited young man with a penchant for contemporary games and technology, often marveled at his father's tales of bygone eras and historical narratives. He listened intently as Robert recounted stories of the World War II era, where alliances were tested, and nations stood on the precipice of change. Yet, amidst those tales, Robert sensed a longing‚Äîa desire to experience those moments together, not just through words but through gameplay.

One evening, with a glimmer of hope in his eyes, Robert approached Ethan. ""Son,"" he began, choosing his words carefully, ""Would you like to experience the intricacies of World War II with me? There's a game called 'Hearts of Iron IV' that I think you might enjoy."" Ethan, intrigued by the passion in his father's voice, nodded eagerly. ""Let's give it a try,"" he replied with a smile.

As the screen flickered to life, Robert and Ethan embarked on a journey through history, navigating the complexities of diplomacy, warfare, and strategy. Robert guided Ethan through the nuances of the game‚Äîthe delicate balance of power, the importance of alliances, and the consequences of decisions made in the heat of the moment. Together, they orchestrated campaigns, negotiated treaties, and experienced the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.

With each passing day, Robert and Ethan forged a bond strengthened by shared experiences and mutual respect. Through ""Hearts of Iron IV,"" they explored not just the strategies of war but the intricacies of life itself‚Äîlearning, growing, and connecting on a level that transcended generations.

In the warmth of their home, surrounded by history books and digital landscapes, Robert and Ethan discovered the timeless beauty of shared passions. And as the echoes of World War II resonated through their gameplay, the legacy of a father's wisdom and a son's curiosity intertwined, creating a narrative that would be cherished for generations to come.

Absolutely hate the way nations can break into civil war while your at war, and then get a sudo peace deal. Its BS you can be halfway though invading Poland and then they just split and now your at peace with half the country you were invading. civil wars need to keep both parties in the existing war. If one side would like a separate peace fine. But stop ruining all my saves and every border with impossible to manage civil wars. A civil war doesn't stop a invasion. Russia and Poland are terrible about this now. You cannot have fun playing Germany if you want to push east. Civil wars will randomly ruin every run. you'll have to justify at least twice each country just to take the breakaways. it makes no fucking sense civil wars shouldn't act as unbalanced peace deals. 

TLDR if your being invaded. just civil war, congrats paradox has decided the invasions over, your sovereignty is respected. you won, big oversight that ruins alot of runs",1703919274,1703919274,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It can keep you going for hours and hours in the base game, especially if you are a history buff or strategy fan. The game provides a recreation of the Second World War, the biggest conflict in history. The game really can make you feel like you a general/leader during the war. 

But that isn't the only thing worth noting, the game has an active modding community brought on by the many tools the game provides. This has spawned countless mods, making it probably one of the most active workshops on steam. When you inevitably get bored of the base game, the modding community provides several new ways to play the game, getting you back for more. 

One of the drawbacks to HOI4 is the amount of money that needs to be spent in order to purchase all the important DLCS. The full experience is rather pricey.

It is riddled with balances that completely throw off the historical fact that everything was stacked against the Axis, the AI often makes moronic military decisions that even a child would know to avoid and some focus trees for major nations are ancient and in dire need of reworking.

Where this game succeeds however is in its modability. Mods saved this game for me, as the vast number of options and different playthroughs that can be achieved is mindboggling. Despite my initial criticisms, vanilla HOI4 isn't unplayable, there is fun to be had, but it is often frustrating. If you're expecting a realistic WW2 out the box, that isn't to be found here. If you want a sandbox that can be tailored to everything from a ludicrously complicated war simulator to an insane alternate history madhouse, then this is probably the game for you.

Mechanics: 
The mechanics like stability and war support, and the sheer amount of variables involved, can make the game overwhelming for new players. Once you become more seasoned at the game, it becomes easier to manage and even simple, as with most other games. Be aware if you are thinking of purchasing or have recently purchased the game: it's going to suck learning them. Research is fairly straightforward, but the technologies for designers can be complicated, especially in the late game. Focuses trees are variable, from fun to boring.

DLC:
The thing I tend to despise about this game is the absolute need for DLCs that add little on their own. Each DLC tends to add a new mechanic or two, a handful of focus trees for the region of interest, and some new music. The game is barebones and almost unplayable without certain ones, and it's extremely discouraging to have to spend a hundred or more dollars until the game is playable.

AI:
The AI is absolutely braindead, simply put. They do things that make zero sense and only harm themselves. That is all I have to say.

Combat:
This is what distinguishes this game from other WWII strategy games. The combat system is in-depth and a dream for players who want to control every facet of their gameplay experience. You manage your army, navy, and air force in full, including the manufacture of equipment, planes, and ships. You have to ensure that your divisions are supplied, your frontline is stable, your airforce and navy aren't vulnerable, your logistics situation is handled, and more. Few HOI4 players will point to any reason other than the combat system as to the main reason they bought the game.

Disclaimer: this is my only experience with Hoi4, do not use any advice given for PvP. 

As a general theme in two player co-op: since, without your interference, the axis usually wins already, I recommend only aiding them if you plan to fight them later on. 

USA + Britain aka ""decadence"": Start in 1939 and join the Allies. Special rules: only the most expensive and decadent things are allowed (tanks including AA/spg variants, mechanized infantry, strat/tac bombers, battlecruisers, battleships, nukes and rocket silos). Only exception is infantry equipment for your mechanized units and trucks for supplies (since your decadent ass has motorized supply on max by default obviously).  Disband/destroy what does not fit the category above. We ended up losing Britain against the axis fleet, so we kept our starting cruisers as a comprimise. Especially the beginning will be tough, since mechanized infantry has to be researched first. Pulling off naval invasions without infantry is also challenging. Also finding a place to nuke without having fighters for air superiority is a fun little challenge.

Sweden + Finland aka ""Schneegammler (Snow Loafers)"": Finland¬¥s new focus tree makes this especially fun. Remenber Finland cannot change ideology (as far as I know of). Either form a large scandinavian alliance or Sweden goes for the Kalmar Union. After fighting the winter war for some time, take on the axis in mid to late game. Either share the soviet territory with the axis first or fight them alongside with the Soviets. Making the Soviets ironically somewhat of an ally to you, since you already weakend them in the winter war and you will likely feel sorry for them. 

Soviet Union + communist India: fight both the axis and allies. Lots of options to occupy minor nations along the way.

facist Iran + fascist Turkey: tried an early war against the soviets but did not get very far until the axis arrived. No hope fighting them after the peace, but maybe you will fare better! An alternative would be to fight the allies and form the Ottoman Emire. 

France + Czechoslovakia (small entente): defence focused game. Czechoslovakia can core much of eastern Europe later on. Fight the soviets later on if you want to stick around until the late game.

fascist Britain + Japan: mostly did that one to challenge the US navy early on. Japan had an easy time invading since most of the US fleet focused on the Atlantic. 

Poland + neutral Japan: Fun option for an early war against the Soviets. Give up Danzig to buy time and prepare for a tough fight against mid/late-game axis. 

Manchukuo + Communist China: really love the Manchukuo independence focus tree. Enjoy gobbling up nationalist China and the remaining warlords while everyone is fighting Japan at the same time. 

Fascist Peru + fascist Brasil aka ""South American Union/SAU"": unify central and south America. Peru is one of the nations that can form Gran Colombia. The allies were surprisingly passive during our conquests. Both Mexico and the US posed a fun challenge. 

Germany + fascist France aka ""Kohle und Stahl"": Easy combo for a world-domination run. Well suited for inexperienced players.

Jugoslavia + Czechoslovakia aka ""no one saved us, no one saved us. No one saved us, no one's gonna save us now"". One of our all time favourites. Taking Austria early on is an option to shorten the frontline with Germany somewhat. Good luck!

Italy + Romania aka ""Two wings, one eagle"": rush into France and Britain if you can. Use the new focus tree and the industry you¬¥ve conquered to show Germany who is the hegemon of Europe. Dont forget to sponsor your buddy Romania. 

Poland + Austria-Hungary aka ""The Neutrals"": Try to survive an early war against Germany. 

Communist South Africa + minor nation: we went with releasing and playing Egypt, but middle eastern minors work too and are generally stronger. Focus is on Anti-Colonialist crusade and creating lots of new nations. Take on axis once the allied territories in Africa are taken. Expand into Asia and Australia if you are bored since expanding into Europe will be tough.

Hearts of Iron IV is one of the best, if not the best, strategy war games I have played. There are multiple countries to play as, numerous scenarios to scope out, and hundreds of amazing mods that help make the game feel more updated and entertaining. It seems to me that even though I may play the same eras over and over again, it still never truly feels boring, as every time there is something new I want to do. You can even annex Germany as New Zealand if you want too! Beginners to the game may feel a bit swamped with learning how to play the game at first, but once you get going and work out the controls and mechanics, it feels more rewarding. Usually, depending on what mods you install, your computer shouldn't have a hard time running the game, and bugs tend to be more on the less frequent side. The music within HOI4 is also exemplary. As mentioned before, there are many mods out there for HOI4, and some I'd recommend are: Kaiserredux, Pax Britannica, The New Order, and Millennium Dawn.

 In the Soviet Union, summer 1943 
Tanks line up in thousands, as far the eye can see 
Ready for the onslaught, ready for the fight 
Waiting for the axis, to march into the trap
 
 Mines are placed in darkness In the cover of the night 
Waiting to be triggered 
When the time is right 
Imminent invasion 
Imminent attack 
Once the battle started 
There's no turning back 

 The end of the Third Reich draws near 
It's time has come to an end 
The end of an era is here 
It's time to attack

 Into the motherland the German army march! 
Comrades, stand side by side, to stop the Nazi charge 
Panzers on Russian soil, a thunder in the east. 
One million men at war, the Soviet wrath unleashed 

 Fields of Prochorovka where heat of battle burned 
Suffered heavy losses, the tide of war was turned 
Driving back the Germans, fighting on 4 fronts 
Hunt them out of Russia, out of Soviet land 
Reinforce the frontline, force the axis to retreat 
Send in all the reserves, securing their defeat 
Soldiers of the Union broke the Citadel 
Ruins of an army axis rest in hell 

 The end of the Third Reich draws near 
Its time has come to an end 
The end of an era is here 
It's time to attack 
Into the Motherland the German Army march! 
Comrades, stand side by side, to stop the Nazi charge 
Panzers on Russian soil a thunder in the east. 
One million men at war, The Soviet wrath unleashed 

 Oh, Mother Russia, union of lands 
Will of the people, strong in command 
Oh, Mother Russia, union of lands 
Once more victorious, the Red Army stands 

 The end of the Third Reich draws near
Its time has come to an end 
The end of an era is here 
It's time to attack 

 Into the Motherland the German Army march! 
Comrades, stand side by side, to stop the Nazi charge 
Panzers on Russian soil, a thunder in the east.

Now the mods are amazing.  If they were to team up with the makers of the Old World Blues mod and make that the MAIN game they would be hitting it out of the park.  You can play almost any faction in that and have an enjoyable time from start to finish.   If you get this game, download that mod first and ignore the base game.  Also the Pony mod...

It took me a very long time to organize my thoughts on HOI4 and whether or not it's something I recommend playing but ultimately I believe that it's flaws already outweigh it's virtues and that it's moving continuously in a poor direction albeit at a glacial developmental pace. I think the biggest problem with it is that HOI4's greatest potential is as an alternate history roleplaying game and story generator but that it generally forgoes achieving that in favor of pleasing an obsessed cadre of sweatlords who endlessly cry out for increased difficulty and granularity so as to increase the need to metagame and to grant more tools to metagame with. Worse yet they do so primarily to serve a multiplayer mode for a game which frankly isn't really built to be a good PVP game and where the AI certainly isn't prepared to survive a coordinated co-op assault made upon it by multiple competent players let alone expert ones.

There are quality alternate history and total conversion mods for the game that are ultimately closer experiences to what HOI4 would be in a more optimal state of pursuing the real strengths of the concept and the core mechanics but I'm reluctant to recommend a game based purely on it's mods. The reason for that is that Paradox could just up and decide any day to cut mod support or shut down the workshop page, likewise any given mod dev team could just socially implode over discord drama or casually lose interest at any time and stop making updates to keep their mod functioning as Paradox continues to perpetually monkey with the base game.

The most fun way to play HOI4 is to run just enough mostly historical games to get a good grip on the systems and then try your luck at new playthroughs as any of the given major powers with all of the rest of the nations in the world set to random focuses so that you actually have to truly play the game intelligently instead of exploiting your prescient real world knowledge of history. Oh and you're also going to want to nearly always play as Fascist or Communist regimes because by mechanical necessity democratic gubberments are entirely reactive and usually don't get to have any fun until the early 1940s in a game that starts in 1936.

Do I regret buying HOI4? No, but I would regret it if I hadn't scooped in and most of the DLC up during massive sales, something that will probably be less of an option for new players going forward given Paradox's movement toward a subscription model. I also have to wonder how many tiresome mechanical sandbaggings like the current abysmal supply system will continue to be implemented going forward in yet more attempts at wrangling the ever meta optimized and explosive aggression of the sweatlord population who continue to unfailingly purchase low-content twenty dollar DLCs day one year in and year out even after having dumped tens of thousands of hours into the game each.

Take this review as a minority report from a guy who is autistic enough to have enjoyed learning to play HOI4 but who isn't enough of a turbo-autist to turn it into the kind of anal retentive lifestyle it's target audience and biggest fans make it into.

If HOI4 does still interest you though I would suggest doing what's always the wisest with every paradox game, wait until that day in the future when they finally abandon the thing and put together a complete edition of it sold at a single semi-reasonable price.",1657842988,1703359267,False,0,0,0.492001950740814209,0,True,False,False

Infact you're almost certainly better off not having AI allies in their current state, as they will actively seek to expand wars they're winning, before you can win the first war.

Given also the serious issues with front line mechanics as you advance/retreat where some army groups will exspand over entire frontlines randomly covering the area's also covered by other armies, spreading themselves far too thing and leaving your entire front open to encirclements, breakthroughs and capitulations.

Hearts of Iron IV offers a highly satisfying experience for fans of strategy games with its historical detail, deep strategy and expansive gameplay. The high learning curve and performance issues may affect some players, but overall it offers rich content and strategic depth. Its fidelity to historical detail and the freedom to move between different countries draws me into the game. However, the steep learning curve at the beginning and some technical issues can hinder the fluency of the game a bit. Still, I think it's a must-try for anyone who loves war strategy and historical scenarios!

* notice that they have no roads or infrastructure set up
* notice the size of their army and how much they are training.
* Delete their entire military
* Save the game.
* load back into your no name country and declare war on them
* Notice how that their military magically and instantly springs from the earth itself with all the equipment to support it.

There's just so much to say. Half-Life 2 is, simply put, the best single-player shooter ever released for the PC. It does so many things right in so many ways that it might be possible to write a thesis on the topic of Half-Life 2 compared to other single player shooters. What Valve has created is simply a masterpiece -- a work of art in the genre. Not only does it engage the mind with mysterious happenings, vagaries, and mostly intelligent dialogue, but also captures the senses with a superb visual style made possible by brilliant technology. And once the initial shock of it all wears off and it becomes possible to peel back the polished layers of sight and sound, there is an excellent shooter here. Half-Life 2 doesn't do anything particularly new; it doesn't really innovate in many ways. But what it does is set a new height for all other designers of first-person shooters to reach. It still isn't exactly perfect, but it's about as close as I've seen in my tenure here.
Before I really get into the review, you should know the background of how this game was reviewed. Valve did not want to send out copies of their game (for fairly obvious reasons) before it was released to the public. In order to play the game, I, and several of my colleagues throughout the industry, took a trip up to Seattle to visit Valve in order to have some private time with the title. I was given a little room to myself where I could close the door, turn off the lights, click my little red slippers, and pretend that I was sitting at home. It worked for the most part, largely because I was so engrossed with the game that when I came out of my trance I often had to take a moment to get my bearings. Obviously, Valve was happy to bring me into a controlled environment for ideal playing conditions.

The system that I played the game on had these specs:
ASUS P4C800-E dlx motherboard
Intel P4 3.2GHz CPU
2.0GB DDR400 dual-channel RAM
Radeon 9800PRO 128MB video
Creative Audigy 2 ZS sound
Western Digital 160GB SATA HD
Obviously, since we were only allowed to play the game at Valve, this is the only system that we've had the chance to play with. That said, at 1280 resolution, the game ran flawlessly, even in the most extreme environments with tons of geometry and lots of objects moving around, both with and without AI. The Source engine is an impressive piece of software from the outside looking in. There's a large chance my brain would melt like Velveeta in a microwave should someone try to explain its inner workings.

What's particularly impressive about the game running so well is that it does so without compromising any part of gameplay or design. Environments are complex, colorful, and highly detailed; AI is certainly impressive in that NPCs work as teams, flank, react to sound and movement, and then engage with lifelike aggression. But like I said, we're going to have to wait and see what the game runs like on a more standard system after it's released. Therefore, you can look for an additional supplement to this review about how the game runs on lower-end systems after we've had the chance to check.

The other problem with reviewing the game up at Valve is the simple fact that we couldn't test out Steam and how well the product registration system necessary to playing Half-Life 2works. I'm not exceedingly happy about the forced registration even if it is understandable in today's climate of highly pirated games, though I can't say I believe this will stop ultra-determined hackers from cracking the game regardless.

Still, no matter what you think of Valve's business policies, Half-Life 2 is a ""must buy"" game. If you're a fan of the series, that was already obvious. Heck, if you're a PC gamer chances are you're going to get it at some point anyway. But if you're new or skeptical of the genre and want to see a prime example of the power and excitement of a first-person shooter, this is it. And it begins with the continuation of a story.

Wake Up and Smell the Ashes...

Last time we left Gordon Freeman, the unlikely scientist-hero from the first Half-Life, he was traveling. Yes, just traveling. The mystery was where he was traveling to and why all of the incidents at Black Mesa had happened (not to mention why the game was rife with so many horrific jumping puzzles towards the end). Half-Life 2 begins with Gordon arriving via train with the G-Man teasing his mind with sickly whispers of warning. The last stop of the arriving train is City 17, a bastion of the alien Combine forces, yet another mystery themselves.

For the rest of the story, you'll have to play the game yourself. I'm absolutely dedicated to getting through this review with your chance at an untarnished gaming experience intact. That means no spoilers. Suffice to say, there are lots of twists to curl your brain along the way, some a bit more predictable than others, but all welcome and interesting.

While the writing and plot points will act as fly paper to your attention, the real winner here is the way the story is presented. Through the eyes of Gordon Freeman, you'll experience roughly 17-20 hours of consciousness which tests your senses and captures your mind. The simplicity and style with which this story is presented are perhaps the most graceful maneuvers of the many that Valve has carried out. From the moment you take your first steps off of that train and into the station at City 17, you'll begin to be tutored in the ways of this bizarre eastern European city. Public service announcements, private conversations, and the actions of characters around you, whether part of the Combine or simply waylaid citizens, create a stifling and threatening feeling that City 17 has become some sort of elaborate prison preaching the chance for freedom and opportunity without choice or desire.

While I was ultimately left a little bit frustrated by the open-endedness, the journey to get to the end of the story was assuredly interesting and opened up the doors to many more possibilities. It's easy to start speculating about this or that, just don't let it drive you nuts. The deeper you get, the darker and more intriguing it becomes until you get to the end... which you'll have to see for yourself.",1702737426,1702737426,False,1,1,0.496021240949630737,2,True,False,False

Paradox games are insanely expensive over time. Just look at the current DLC price total, $204. This is par for the course with paradox. Now for that you get a living, breathing game. This game is pushing ten years old and consistently remains on the daily top 100 played games. The DLC‚Äôs for the most part are well put together (after a few weeks of bug fixes) and not required. Many of the complaints about HOI4 are due to the DLC practice, if that bothers you stay away. For me it‚Äôs the price to pay for a game to receive this type of long-term love. Price per an hour of play time is the metric I use and HOI4 is a solid game for me.

Now for game play. The vanilla game is very good but where the game truly shines is with the workshop. I haven‚Äôt played a pure vanilla game in years. There are far too many outstanding mods out there. Because this is an investment, take some time to look through the workshop. To say this game has replay value doesn‚Äôt quite do it justice. After monkey stomping German/Russia and restoring PAX Britannia for a few days, I moved over to stopping Mordor from invading middle earth. Again, an insane amount of replay ability beyond just WWII. For WWII it is unmatched, as should be expected. You can read anyone of a hundred reviews to get your head around that. On a final note, almost anything you don‚Äôt like has been or can be removed or modified with either console command or mods.

I'd recommend watching youtube videos on hoi4, whether its informational or just entertaining, it'll end up making your experience more fun. If you don't have DLC (buy the subscription!!!), just play mods it'll still be fun, I recommend kaisereich and kaiseredux greatly (it's how I got into the game). It definitely helps to have historical knowledge/generally be interested in history to play this game, its a ww2 simulator afterall.

Bought this game soon after it was released and initially had a good time. Was thinking of getting back into it when I saw some DLCs on sale. However, the game is incredibly time-consuming. Every new DLC feels like starting over in terms of learning. There are lots of guides, but it's hard to tell if they're current or relevant to the DLCs you have.

The biggest issue is the long-term impact of early decisions. Make a mistake in research or your tank template early on, and it can ruin your entire game. 

If you're not willing to invest a huge amount of time or resort to cheating, this game might not be worth it

When I tried to get a refund, I found out I had already spent too many hours just trying to learn from guides and YouTube videos, which, as it turns out, were outdated.

Hearts of Iron IV, the game that became my unexpected salvation after a tumultuous hiatus from gaming. Two years ago, I was in a dark place, serving time for a series of regrettable decisions that involved catalytic converters and a battle with addiction. Fast forward to the present, and here I am, back in the gaming world, specifically with Hearts of Iron IV, marking a significant chapter in my life's turnaround.

This World War II grand strategy game has been more than just a source of entertainment; it's been a catalyst for personal redemption. The intricate details of war planning, diplomatic maneuvering, and the sheer complexity of global conflict in Hearts of Iron IV served as a mental escape and a welcomed challenge that demanded my focus and strategic thinking.

As I navigated the intricate political landscapes, engaged in intense battles, and reshaped the course of history within the game, I found a renewed sense of purpose and accomplishment. Hearts of Iron IV became a symbol of my commitment to a better path, replacing destructive habits with a constructive and intellectually stimulating pursuit.

The game's ability to immerse players in the intricacies of wartime decision-making provided a therapeutic outlet, allowing me to channel my energies into a world where consequences were virtual and choices were strategic rather than destructive. It's not just a game for me; it's a personal testament to the power of turning one's life around.

So, here's to Hearts of Iron IV for being more than just a game ‚Äì it's been a companion on my journey to redemption, reminding me that even after a tumultuous past, there's always a chance to rewrite the future. Onward to victory, both in-game and in life!

I have 600 hours, yet I have no idea how the navy works (neither does anyone else). So, the game is hard to learn and hard to master, but at the same time, it's a really fun experience. I wouldn't have as many hours as I do without mods. Shoutout to Kaiserreich, Great War Redux, TWR, and many more. On the other hand, the game is made by Paradox, and it's really just a barebones structure without any DLCs.

This game is objectively a hot pile of garbage bugs that should embarrass any self respecting dev.

The ""very positive"" reviews are clearly paid for or classic paradox circle jerkers.

I do realize that I'm the idiot for paying nearly 100$ for some buggy garbage where I can barely get through the tutorial. I've already sent a support ticket patiently and respectfully listing a dozen problems that make the game unplayable. Even talked with nothing but complete respect because we all know how Paradox devs have complained about their ""fanbase"" being incredibly toxic lol But they gave some non-response telling me to contact the devs myself on the dead forum lol What kind of gaming company basically forces their players to fix the game for them lol Forum and wiki are absolute useless trash as well.

Devs should never act surprised when people pirate games when they KNOW they released literally unplayable garbage.

500h across 3 paradox games. I sincerely hope these devs know how stupid it feels to waste dozens of those hours looking up the most inane yet game breaking bug instead of actually playing the game, spend almost 2 hours concocting a respectful ticket only to get ignored. For their own good, they need to learn to act and sympathize like actual human beings.",1701707897,1701709250,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

[b] Personal opinion and introduction [/b]

As a history and military enthusiast, as well as a gamer, this game is in my eyes a masterpiece.
The amount of detail when it comes to a country's history, politics, culture, etc., is astonishing. The game gives you control over a nation's politics, economy, industry, foreign relations, navy, air force, army, intelligence agency, and more. -Which introduces a major point in this review; it's complexity.

[b] Complexity [/b]

The game is super complex compared to many other games. This is something I personally like, as I can learn something new even after a thousand hours of play time. The fact that you don't know every aspect of the game, doesn't make the game unplayable. Though, I acknowledge that many players don't like the game because of the massive learning curve. I do believe it all comes down to your mind set, and that you shouldn't expect to be great in the beginning. This is not like an fps where you know the controls from before starting the game.

Despite the game obviously focusing on the major nations of the early to mid 20th century, even small nations get something unique. As a soldier myself, at the time of writing this review, with my immense patriotism for my country, I enjoy the small details in my homeland, even though it's a minor country.

[b] Community and Modding [/b]

The HOI4 community is a large community mixed with a lot of different people. Despite some people claiming the HOI4 community is toxic, I know this isn't the case for most of it. I myself, don't really take part in many discussions on for example the hoi4 subreddit, but I do enjoy the memes and posts that are posted there. It's worth mentioning that the game features a multiplayer mode, which is fun if you have friends.
[url=reddit.com/r/hoi4] HOI4 subreddit [/url]

The countless mods people create for this game, makes it so much better. You never run out of content. If you are looking to become a modder yourself, this game is perfect. I have modded a little bit for it myself, and I can tell you it's actually quite simple.

[b] Performance [/b]

This game is poorly optimized, and CPU heavy. You basically don't need a grapichs card, as it's mainly your CPU that does the work. You see, the game doesn't really have advanced reflections or realistic graphics. (Duh, it looks like a board game.) Though, the CPU has a lot more work to do, as every nations units, stats, planes, battles, and more needs to be calculated accurately. This game is not for ""weak"" computers, unless you plan on not playing through the late game, or installing a performance boosting mod.

[b] Conclusion [/b]

This is one of my favourite games, and I can't recommend it more.
If you enjoy grand scale strategy games, are interested in history, and like games that are not fast paced, this is the game for you.",1639238517,1701523924,True,0,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

Hearts of Iron IV, affectionately known as HOI4, stands as a testament to Paradox's mastery in grand strategy gaming. This World War II simulation is a brilliant blend of historical accuracy and strategic depth that captivates from the first click. What sets HOI4 apart is not just its robust gameplay mechanics and meticulous attention to historical detail, but the vibrant modding community that breathes new life into the experience.
The modding scene for HOI4 is nothing short of extraordinary. From total conversion mods that transport players to alternative historical scenarios to intricately detailed overhauls, the creativity of the modders knows no bounds. This community-driven content ensures that every playthrough can be a unique and fresh experience, extending the game's longevity far beyond its initial release.
Yet, the true brilliance of HOI4 shines when you gather friends for a multiplayer session. The collaborative aspect of planning and executing military strategies adds a layer of excitement that single-player experiences often lack. Whether coordinating intricate battle plans or facing off against each other in epic clashes, the multiplayer dynamics elevate HOI4 to a whole new level of enjoyment. Nothing better than kicking the homies asses!
The game's interface is user-friendly, making it accessible for both seasoned strategy veterans and newcomers alike (despite the claims of some of my friends. It‚Äôs really easy to learn compared to other strategy games). The attention to detail in historical events, coupled with the strategic decision-making required, creates an immersive experience that feels both challenging and rewarding but sometimes frustrating considering that bots suck.
In summary, HOI4 is a strategic masterpiece that not only captures the essence of World War II but also provides a dynamic platform for player creativity through its robust modding community. The multiplayer experience adds a social dimension that makes every session great for hanging out with friends, shooting shit, and watching your empire fall apart due to nukes. Paradox has not only delivered a stellar historical strategy game but also fostered a community-driven environment that ensures HOI4 remains a staple in the genre for years to come and I am very grateful for that. Buy the game please, it‚Äôs great!

This so-called ""game"" has single-handedly ruined my life, turned me into a shell of my former self, and obliterated any semblance of productivity that I once had.

It all started innocently enough. A friend recommended Hearts of Iron IV, promising an immersive World War II strategy experience. Little did I know that this game would become a vortex, sucking away every ounce of free time I ever had. Forget about socializing, forget about responsibilities ‚Äì Hearts of Iron IV demands your undivided attention.

At first, it seemed harmless. I'd sit down to play for just an hour or so, thinking I could conquer a few countries and call it a day. Oh, how naive I was! Hours turned into days, days turned into weeks, and before I knew it, I was knee-deep in a virtual war, completely detached from reality.

The graphics are so captivating, the sound effects so realistic that you find yourself lost in the chaos of battle. I can't tell you how many times I've screamed at my computer screen, blaming the AI for my failures. It's not me, it's them! But deep down, I know the truth ‚Äì Hearts of Iron IV has turned me into a warmonger, a dictator with a god complex, manipulating the fate of nations from the comfort of my gaming chair.

And don't even get me started on the steep learning curve. I thought I was a strategic genius, but Hearts of Iron IV humbled me faster than you can say ""D-Day."" The intricacies of production lines, resource management, and battle plans are enough to make your head spin. I've spent more time watching tutorial videos than I have on any other form of education in my life.

But the worst part? The community. I've fallen into the dark abyss of forums and Reddit, discussing optimal division templates and arguing about historical accuracy. It's a black hole of opinions, and I can't escape. My real-life friends have become mere shadows, replaced by online comrades who understand the importance of encirclement and the terror of the dreaded supply lines.

So here I am, a mere husk of the person I used to be, haunted by the echoes of air raid sirens and the incessant clicking of division placement. If you value your sanity, stay away from Hearts of Iron IV. It's not a game; it's a life-consuming vortex that will drag you into the depths of historical warfare, never to return.

Absurdamente viciante, divertido e uma verdadeira aula de hist√≥ria para os amantes da Segunda Guerra Mundial. Quem procura uma experi√™ncia na qual pode mergulhar em aspectos detalhados da estrat√©gia de guerra certamente se divertir√° muito com HOI4. O jogador toma grandes decis√µes para o pa√≠s, pesquisa cada componente tecnol√≥gico para suas for√ßas armadas, lida com a produ√ß√£o de todos os aspectos b√©licos da na√ß√£o, constru√ß√£o de infraestrutura, log√≠stica e, claro, a estrat√©gia de campo, onde comanda ex√©rcitos e divis√µes para garantir a sobreviv√™ncia do pa√≠s na guerra mais destrutiva da hist√≥ria.

Al√©m de sua estrutura complexa e da quantidade absurda de conte√∫do, HOI4 oferece uma ""replayabilidade"" imensa, j√° que √© poss√≠vel escolher qualquer pa√≠s e explorar diversas estrat√©gias durante o conflito, cerca de 3 a 4 caminhos distintos, dependendo da na√ß√£o.

Quanto √† jogabilidade, √© importante destacar: √© um jogo desafiador. Qualquer um pode come√ßar a jogar sem muitas dificuldades, mas dominar todos os aspectos da estrat√©gia do pa√≠s demanda tempo. S√£o in√∫meros status, modificadores, detalhes e outros aspectos da forma de jogar com cada pa√≠s que exigem alguma leitura, √†s vezes at√© alguns tutoriais online para se aprofundar. No entanto, isso n√£o impede que os amantes de estrat√©gia e da Segunda Guerra Mundial se divirtam muito, mesmo que a estrat√©gia n√£o funcione completamente.

Uma breve an√°lise das expans√µes tamb√©m √© relevante para os jogadores que desejam entender o que elas representam antes de considerar a compra. Todas as DLCs s√£o interessantes, agregando novos aspectos que fazem muita diferen√ßa na jogabilidade. Para quem aprecia detalhes, vale a pena adquiri-las aos poucos, pois muitas das mec√¢nicas s√£o dif√≠ceis de acompanhar simultaneamente.

Caso esteja buscando come√ßar com um bom jogo, sugiro:

Vers√£o Base
Together for Victory (√°rvores de decis√µes para toda a Commonwealth e melhorias para combate e lend lease)
Death and Dishonor (√°rvores de decis√µes para os pa√≠ses do Eixo)
Waking the Tiger (√°rvores de decis√µes para a China e in√∫meras pequenas mec√¢nicas que melhoram o combate, √≠cones e combate a√©reo, al√©m da nova √°rvore de decis√µes para Alemanha e Jap√£o, aprimorando o jogo significativamente)
Opcionais:

Man the Guns (melhorou a jogabilidade naval, aspectos diplom√°ticos e envio de for√ßas expedicion√°rias, oferecendo uma √°rvore decente para Inglaterra e Estados Unidos)
La R√©sistance (√°rvores de decis√µes para Fran√ßa, Espanha e Portugal, e o sistema de espionagem; bom, mas limitado)
Battle for the Bosphorus (√°rvores de foco para Bulg√°ria, Gr√©cia e Turquia; limitado, mas a Gr√©cia vale a pena)
No Step Back (√°rvores de foco para Pol√¥nia, pa√≠ses b√°lticos e Uni√£o Sovi√©tica, revitalizando o jogo com um sistema log√≠stico mais realista e complicado, al√©m de melhorar o sistema de constru√ß√£o de tanques; altamente recomendado)
By Blood Alone (√°rvores de foco para It√°lia, Su√≠√ßa e Eti√≥pia, com um novo sistema de tratados de paz e melhor constru√ß√£o de avi√µes; √≥timo para a It√°lia, mas com pouca quantidade de conte√∫do)
Arms Against Tyranny (√°rvores para os pa√≠ses escandinavos, novos sistemas internos e mercado internacional de armamentos; opcional e uma das menos robustas).
Em geral, as expans√µes da Paradox sofrem do mesmo problema, em que o valor cobrado muitas vezes sugere a compra de um novo jogo, mas s√£o apenas DLCs. Vale a pena para os amantes do jogo, mas √© uma considera√ß√£o relevante para o cliente.

Concluindo, recomendo Hearts of Iron 4. O jogo √© excelente, muito bem feito. Bugs s√£o raros. Os desenvolvedores s√£o verdadeiramente apaixonados pelo que fazem, e se eu tivesse que escolher um jogo para ter pelo resto da vida, essa seria minha escolha, sem d√∫vidas, devido √† quantidade de conte√∫do.",1701281996,1701281996,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This should be especially true when considering the Politics of  America, or the allies in general. The Only exception being as they Russians were prepared to take massive casualties.So I don't know if the Invasion w/o end is a design flaw for the single player version and overlooked as many play multiplayer, or id it was an international design in order to balance the game. 
 But in  Particular the number of Divisions that are able to be off loaded, in a single region, it s just ridiculous, to see 30 Divines off load on one beachIf you need a reference as to what is even remotely realistic, try looking at the actual D-Day landing,

-It should be noted that this review was written during the 2017 controversy in which Paradox  attempted to standerise their DLC prices by raising them across all  international regions. Although they later backed down I still disagree with their DLC policies. I love their games, but untill they make some real change in their business practices I can not in good conscious give this game a possitive recommendation, however I have updated my review for 2018 which you will find at the bottem of this page.

ORIGINAL REVIEW
-I AM GOING ON A FULL PARADOX STRIKE!!!! Their DLC across all of their grand stategy games has always been crazy but now it is just out of control. Death or Dishonor is a ""Country Pack""!!! Please!!! What does Death or Dishonor do that Mods have not already!?!?!?!? Like the German offensive into the USSR they may have been destroying our wallets and winning thus far...BUT NO MORE!!!! The winter has come for Paradox and it is time for us as fans to push back!!!!

-Do not get me wrong! I love this game and I adore Paradox as a game developer and that is exactaly why I am being so tough on them. This will destroy them in the end. It is time for us as fans to remeber that we control the market and we have the power to stop this! It is better to stop this now rather than later. RISE UP PARADOX FANS!!!! RISE UP AND SAVE YOUR GAMES!!!

-But really though I am addicted to this game and can not stop playing so does it even matter?

2018 UPDATE
-I suppose it is unfair that I have not given this game a rating like I have in all my other reviews. Furthermore I have not actually reviewed the game, rather, I have written a rather passionate rant against Paradox that when looked at a year later may seem rather odd and nonsensical. As I stated in my 'edit note', my original review was written at a rather tense time that not everyone in the HOI4 community might be aware of. So put into its proper context my original review might begin to make more sense, however I have still failed to give a proper review and express my feelings on the game itself. I will now attempt to correct this.

-The actual gave itself is great. It is more accessible than most grand strategy games and the modding community is one of the best on all of the Steam Workshop. The modding community insures that you will practically never grow bored, even after hundreds of hours. The game itself I would give a 8/10. It has some issues with AI and an overall lack of content, HOWEVER, if you factor in the many amazing mods you will have access to this game easily becomes a 10/10! 

-So yeah, 10/10 would mod again!",1497643989,1701030163,False,42,3,0.66284024715423584,0,True,False,False

Edit: I have spent too much time on this game and I love it. DLC's offer fresh alternate history play-throughs and fun opportunities in multiplayer. That being said the Plane/Tank/Ship designer is still confusing. The addition of Military Industrial Organizations and International Market in the ""Arms against Tyranny"" DLC allows minor nations to be a part of the world war even if they are not actively fighting. ""La R√©sistance"" made covert interactions between nations a lot more interesting and gamifying, rather than clicking a button a causing a coup for no reason.

The performance is awful, with regular drops to 30 and oftentimes 15fps (!). The engine is struggling, something fierce. Not only is this unacceptable, but it is unplayable because of how bad that feels. No one should be expected to put up with this for hours on end. Past a certain point in the game, it's all slowdowns and stutters, and slowdowns and stutters. All the while, my CPU is never solicitated above 60%, and my GPU never goes above 50%. The game is technically [i]atrocious[/i], and definitely feels like it. It is begging you to drag it behind the barn and put it out of its misery. At least that is how it feels.

Other than that, I just don't find this game very fun, and it is downright boring at time. And I care not to go into details, because it doesn't deserve that I put the time and energy into that. So many things feel arbitrary and just ""there"" for the sake of being there. Who designed this stuff? Why does an air wing have to be 100 planes of any kind? Why does a focus takes 70 days to research? I mean, why not 65, 75, 80? So many things are like that. Whatever. One thing I liked was [i]the idea[/i] of the focus tree system though, but on the other hand, can we really associate such a system with the concept of strategy? Maybe, maybe not. I guess it is possible, but in the case of HoIIV, I feel like this system is also dragged down by all the badly executed aspects of the game.

Finally, the game is sold incomplete, and the DLCs are numerous and way overpriced (that's the Paradox game ""trope"", sure, but in the case of HoIIV I find this to be even more true than usual, and therefore worth stating as another element that's making this impossible to recommend). Which is shameless, especially given the state of the base game (not only its technical state, but yes, [i]especially[/i] its technical state as well).

The music is great. As is often the case with Paradox games. I don't know anything about Andreas Waldetoft, except that his soundtracks are superb, and of such high quality that indeed years ago I had to look up who actually was making that stuff. And sure enough, it's often the same composer. Top tier soundtrack, as always.",1700951822,1700992316,False,6,1,0.517503976821899414,0,True,False,False
