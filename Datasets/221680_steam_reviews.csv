Ubisoft decided to pull the game whilst shifting the blame over on expiring licenses, rather than renewing and/or patching out the conflicting tracks. 

Rocksmith+ became the new focus. An inferior subscription based service designed to milk the consumer, rather than providing you with an excellent piece of software. 
$14.99/month, $39.99/3-months or $99.99 for a full year (Real Tone Cable not included btw) is NOT worth the money. You're ''paying for a service'' that is still vulnerable to licensing disagreements, and what happens when people stop paying for this ''service''? I've still got my copy of RS2014, do you think you'll still have access to rocksmith+ at the end of it's support?

They removed denuvo, but they got too lazy to show it. With denuvo, Rocksmith2014.exe is 64.37 MiB. Now, however, Rocksmith2014.exe is 11.08 MiB now. Meaning no more denuvo. There are also some... lets say sailors that have found that the game no longer contains denuvo's usual antics causing so many of its usual problems. 



As for the gameplay, I feel that they started in the right direction, but they kept ruining it along the way. Added denuvo, remove purchasable songs, essentially block off the community, ADD DENUVO, and kept anything custom as far away as they could. I know some denuvo suckers will probably scream something like ""DENUVO CAUSES NO ISSUES"" but my guy, even if thats true, it caused issues in THIS game.

ANYWAYS, it now runs better on my machine, Windows 10 is happier with the game, and there is far less input lag now.



It basically started like guitar hero, but with a real guitar. Great! Then fought the community, using denuvo (I promise Ill stop mentioning it now), but now they kind of are just giving up on this game which actually makes it great now. Like NOW is the time to buy it. You can MOD it. You have been able to for a little while now I guess, but they have finally just let it go fully, so now its in OUR hands, now theirs. We can ""own this game"" rather than ""get used to not owning your own game"" as ubisoft puts it. Which means this game is definitely late to the party, but it is really fun.

I have been doing the in game lessons for about two weeks. The time not spent in the lessons was just me playing star chords (incorrectly holding the guitar and not using picking technique) and that was a bad idea. Even though I know the chords based on fretting, I do not know how to strum them properly (again didn't know picking technique), so I lost some learning time there, but, I guess I know the chords now. I have mastered Sustains 101, Slides 101, and I am still on Bends 101 trying to master the practice track before moving on to the next lesson. I definitely recommend the lessons, its better than any private lesson I have had, plus, it's a video game so you are going for score, thus incising me to practice more. Plus it feels so gratifying to 100% a lesson! Also, I still practice the practice tracks by memory using the techniques I learned in between doing the current lesson's practice track if I am getting frustrated at it, which can happen. Overall, this game is amazing for those who want to learn guitar and already loves video games. Only downside, you need a real-tone-cable, which can be difficult to find (in fact I may buy a spare of Ebay or something); luckily I was gifted one when I was younger with the game. Didn't show much interest in it when I was gifted the guitar at (17 ish, I am now 32, something lit a fire under my butt to learn, so I am doing it now) because private lessons sucked to be honest; didn't have motivation to practice. I needed a new hobby, and this was it. I want to shred one day and I think if I keep at it with this game, I will be there in no time. For those who are learning....DON'T GIVE UP! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK! YOU GOT THIS! It will be frustrating at first, I know, but, stick with it and you will feel overjoyed when you nail that riff, or song.",1707663193,1707663193,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Great to plug real instruments in to A game! and the mini games are very cool as each of em improve specific technique (1 for each game). Great idea for Beginners and fun loving musicians alike! 
BUT WHERE IS OUR JOY NOW STOLEN AND RESOLD THATS WHERE!
This may not be the easiest way to improve for beginners though, unless you tab out the riffs and practice them in your own space also! In wich case get ready to rock out with your chords out!! defiantly a nice challenge!!
Game requires a ROCKSMITH USB CABLE ADAPTOR!! Though may work if you have advanced input (not tryd it yet!) This is actually because all (or most) instruments where created with older but still better tech than digi, this means a conversion lag if you plug it straight in, reduced by adaptor!

There is a bit of a learning curve for those who never picked up a guitar before. But like anything else practice, practice, practice. If you do just that I don’t see why anybody wouldn’t get better in time. Rocksmith makes it easy to learn at your own speed. This game will teach you how to play guitar and bass if you want it to. For those who already know how to play it will sharpen your skills and hey it’s way better than Guitar Hero (It's not pretend). 

This Remastered Edition Update fixed tons of bugs.
The game even seems to run better, more smooth, it's noticeable. (On my PC away)
They added a couple more ways to use your instruments other than the ""Real Tone Cable"".
A person can an acoustic guitar with a microphone. (I think we have always been able to do this using the Real Tone Cable but now there's an option for it in the menu)    
Unfortunately the Motor Revving Sound after each score attack game is Still Played. (it would be nice to be able to shut that off.

(This game rewards you with noticeable sings of improvement and the best feeling of accomplishment;)

Great tool for learning beginner to intermediate level guitar/bass skills. Endless fun when you utilize the massive library of DLC, though learning to play your favorite songs has limitations when it comes to evolving to the next level of your playing.

Excellent program for beginners and rusty guitar/bass players. Plenty of songs to choose from, plenty of activities to help improve stuff like finger dexterity and muscle memory, and plenty of options to create your own custom tone.

I highly recommend setting up a free account on CustomsForge, which will allow you access to the largest online library of custom Rocksmith DLC's. This will be the only way you can continue to add songs to your collection once Rocksmith is removed from sale on 23rd October.

If your budget allows, I recommend grabbing all the Exercise Packs, and the Time Saver packs if you want instant access to in-game unlockables.

Lastly, YOU DO NOT NEED THE OFFICIAL RealTone CABLE. There are third party alternatives available, as well as other connection methods. Take a few minutes to research these options online to see which one will work best for you. There's a bunch of information across various forums and social media platforms.

With recent news of Ubisoft delisting this game and all DLC, I can no longer in good conscience recommend this game.
I've tried the Subscription based Rocksmith+ and Rocksmith 2014 is a far superior product by a good margin.
It's behaviour like this from companies that encourage piracy. 
I fully encourage anyone interested in using this software to sail the high seas. 




This game has the world's most complicated controller...

Seems like a pretty good learning tool for those beginning guitar. A month ago I had never touched a guitar and now I'm playing basic chords! (kind of). Kind of plays like those old Guitar Hero games but with a real guitar.
The ""Guitarcade"" games are pretty fun but not really useful for learning apart from maybe the duck hunting and star chords games.
I wouldn't rely on this as a sole learning tool as it doesn't really teach music theory stuff. Also if you look at tabs later on you'll find they're upside down compared to the rocksmith ""Note Highway"". 
justinguitar.com has a really good free tutorial on youtube. 

I would mention that Ubisoft are launching a ""Rocksmith+"" subscription to replace this in the near future. I would be wary of Ubisoft pulling support/DLC at some point. Ubisoft have a bad track record with pulling DLC.",1661067043,1697247271,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

WAS is the keyword in that sentence.
Ubisoft has suddenly released an update coincidentally right as they release Rocksmith+ that has broken this game to the point that it wouldn't even launch. They did not give any notice that they even made an update. The same is true of all other Rocksmith titles except, of course, their new Rocksmith+.
When I buy a game I expect it to work but when Ubisoft makes a game they expect it to convince you to buy the next one.
Imagine if you bought monopoly and everytime Hasbro released another stupid spin off version they came to your house and stole your current copy. Would that make sense to you? You got your version of monopoly and you want to play that version, you don't need another version, if you want another version then you can get another version but that should be YOUR CHOICE.
Ubisoft has taken the choice from you. Buy new games or have no games.

UPDATE Oct. 9 2023: It has been over a year and thanks to these scummy devs that had the dignity to try and say ""We're working on it"" this game has not received an update that has fixed the issue.
Though they DID bother to update the steam page to include the tags ""Multiplayer"" and ""Addictive"".
It should come as no surprise that Ubisoft is a scummy company, but here is more evidence in case you wanted it. Waiting for the day Ubisoft proves us wrong (it will never happen).

Oh, and apparently to make sure that you don't play this one and only play their new crappy way over monetized crappy version that is ""Rocksmith+"" they're delisting this from steam. Great.",1663785661,1696893339,False,7,0,0.571258306503295898,0,True,False,False

Rocksmith 2014 is, without a doubt, the best learning tool for guitar for people who are brand new to it. I had wanted to wait until I hit 100 hours into the game but with it delisting in a month I wanted to get this out now.

I'll be listing the Pros, Cons, and my own personal background of why I am recommending this game.

[h2] Background [/h2]
I'm a drummer / percussionist, and for the last 15 years I'd been wanting, trying to get into guitar. However, every time I'd try, something just would not click. Or rather, the [i]way[/i] to learn just never gelled with me. Before Rocksmith, your best bet was either self-learning, getting lessons, or (pre-youtube) getting an instruction book or video. None of these things ever helped me. I'd even gotten the very first Rocksmith for PC, but either my PC at the time or Rocksmith or both, just didn't work out, so I shelved trying again. I truly thought I was just never gonna learn, especially considering I didn't start when I was very young. Fast forward to now, and even though I'm still in the infancy of my playing ability, I'm vastly better than I thought I ever could be.

[h2] Pros [/h2]

[list]
    [*]Guitar Hero / Rockband-style notes
    [*]Ability to slow down sections and play only certain sections over and over.
    [*]Many in-game guides to help with playing.
    [*]Training songs for Guitar and Bass for absolute beginners with multiple levels.
    [*]Lots and lots of DLC from every genre.
    [*]Custom DLC (CDLC) (Go buy Cherub Rock now!)
[/list] 

What can I say other than this game takes all of those things I listed above separately and combines them into one complete guitar learning experience. The easy and intuitive style that is similar to Guitar Hero and Rockband makes the notes easy to follow, and the ability to pick certain sections and slow them down or repeat them is exactly what you need to really nail sections. Repetition is how I learn, and this is really the best way to do it. There's also tons of guides that help you based on how you did in a song. Miss a certain section? The game recommends going over that section again. Missing a certain chord? It'll show you how to do that chord. Have a technique you're struggling with? It'll show you an exercise on how to do that. There's also tons of little minigames that help with technique that I'm not super interested in to be honest, but still are a fun way to learn if that's your thing!

[h2] CDLC [/h2]

CDLC gets its own section under Pros because very literally it is a gigantic reason to get this game. Lets be real here, it's one thing to play the same 50 or so songs on Rocksmith, but what about your favorites? The ones from obscure artists, or independent artists? Or what about songs that only have Bass in them or just Guitar? Ones Ubisoft would never even think to go after. Ubisoft can get as many licenses from big artists as they want, but they can't get them all. CDLC is the lifeblood of this game and it has been for well over a decade. I got into it at very literally the 11th hour of the games life, and it has helped my journey tremendously. My only hope with Ubisoft sunsetting Rocksmith 2014 is that someone in the community makes a Clone Hero-version of Rocksmith and takes the community forward, because Rocksmith+ ain't it chief.

[h2] Cons [/h2]

[list]
    [*]Hit detection can be hit or miss.
    [*]Some official charts are not accurate.
    [*]Missing a wide array of different tunings.
    [*]Delisting of official DLC and inability to acquire old DLC.
[/list] 

For what it did, Rocksmith was pretty revolutionary. But it's not without its faults either.

Hit detection for the game can vary widely. There are some chords that Rocksmith just absolutely will not register. Also, you can tune your guitar perfectly, but sometimes on the lowest parts of the fretboard it will just assume you aren't hitting the right note even if you are. Thankfully this doesn't seem like it affects all songs, but it is still annoying.

The other thing is, and I'm only including it as a Con because it is a future-proof problem. There's no support for guitars outside of 6-string guitars and 4 string basses. Granted, I don't have a 7 string guitar, but even in 2013-2014, 7 string guitars and 5 string basses weren't a unicorn. There should have been some kind of support added later on for them in the 10 years the game was out. This is the same for tunings as well, there's a range of tunings that just aren't there.

My biggest gripe with the game is with the official DLC. First and foremost, you cannot get any old DLC that has been delisted. You especially cannot get any of the old DLC from Rocksmith 1 (even through peg-legged ports), which means about 76 songs are just in limbo forever. As a metal-listening person, not having ""Redneck"" or ""Beast and the Harlot"" or even ""Hangar 18"" is kind of ludicrous.
The other thing is with the charting of the songs is not all of the songs you can pay for are charted correctly. I've heard others in the reviews complain about some songs, but one I personally witnessed was ""Tears Don't Fall"" by Bullet for My Valentine. The intro is very wrong. Thankfully, I was adept enough to figure out how it should be played and just ignored this, but it's annoying that you can pay real money for supposedly officially recognized DLC and it be wrong. In a world where youtube exists, you can literally go watch them play it live or in a sitdown play through and then chart it correctly.

[h2] Verdict [/h2]

Overall, Rocksmith 2014 is unlike any tool I've ever used to learn guitar. It has some big shortcomings, but when and where it shines, that being you wanting to learn guitar and giving you a reason to continue playing, are untouchable. If you think you can't learn guitar, trust me you can, give this a try.",1695403163,1695403163,True,65,0,0.831229805946350098,0,True,False,False

I am finally approaching the 60 hour mark of practicing with my guitar. I have put in 48 hours into the game and probably another 12 hours practicing chords and some youtube strumming etc. 

I love this game. I bought an electric Epiphone to start with the game, and then about a week ago I bought another Epiphone acustic/Electric (for when I get better and want to play at the campfire etc)...I really really love the acustic...sounds so much nicer.

The one thing that has made this game better for me is downloading a huge number of songs. I still only play on easy, but I find that Score Attack is what I am looking for as it reminds me of the guitar hero style that I enjoy. I find the game ramps up too quickly if i just keep playing the song over and over, so a good variety will keep you learning new tricks without getting bored.

So the big question is ""Can I play the guitar after 60 hours?"" like the game said I would...

Hell no...

BUT it sure is a fun journey. At 42 years of age I have discovered a new passion...who really thought you could play guitar in 60 hours anyway? LOL

I can now pick better, and move up and down the neck with much more precision and accuracy. Chords are still hard, but it's all a good challenge. Hang in there folks and this game can and will help you learn to play.

EDIT:
Aug 3 2020

What a year? HOLY CRAP. Anyway I have managed to keep my goal of 1 hour of practice a day and today I have 580 hrs in the game and it has been 580 days since I started playing. I wanted to update you on where I stand after these hours. 

I am now working my way through the songs on medium and have unlocked 484 songs on medium (Score attack) and my overall mastery in the game is around 40%.

I have set myself the goal of beating 1000 songs on medium (No strikes) and Then I will buy myself a new $1000 guitar. Wish me luck!

Edit:
Oct 19 2020

I went ahead and bought my $1000 PRS SE 245 ahead of schedule...I haven't been disappointed! I LOVE this guitar so rich sounding. I have now beat 687 songs on medium and I am at 758 hours practiced. I passed the Epihone on to my son along with a copy of the game...maybe he'll start playing too?

Edit
June 7 2021 1059 Hrs played
Still can't play guitar... (let's be realistic folks it's probably going to take this amount again)
I have now beat 
1150 songs on Easy
949 on Medium
140 on Hard

My overall accuracy is 83.3 %
my overall mastery is 42.68 
I should also say I never practice a song more the 5 times in a row and then move on and come back to it in a couple months...I am playing as many songs as I can and keeping daily stats for over 1000 days now. I have maintained my pace and continue to practice 1 hr every day!

I have mastered 5 songs.

Edit
Aug 19, 2022
I have maintained my schedule of 1 hr a day and I now sit at 1451 hours in the game. My original goal was to play 1 hour a day for 5 years. This is Aug of year 4 (I have 16 more months to go)

I still can't play guitar.

This year I have been focusing on playing the rhythm for all of the songs (as well as lead)...i find strumming hard and the game doesn't really show you how to get a good rhythm. I have now accumulated the following stats:

1337 songs beat on easy (Score attack)
1148 on medium
289 on Hard

My overall accuracy is 84.61 %
My overall Mastery is 48.32% ( I have dozens of songs where my mastery is 90%+)

Edit 
Sep 18 2023

I have 67 days to go to meet my 5 year goal. I am about 2 months ahead of schedule
I am now at 86.58% accuracy
I am at 50.94% Mastery 
I have beaten 1334 songs on Easy
I have beaten 1194 songs on Medium 
I have beaten 391 songs on Hard

I don't think it's possible to fully learn the instrument with it alone, but it sure is great help. When you learn songs with it, the whole process is musical, you always play the song with increasing difficulty as you progress, which is more fun than first memorizing fingerings and then trying to play them in time. Arcade games are also quite fun way to spend time with your instrument.

If you are looking to become a guitar player, one that knows music theory, scale forms and how they connect, all the technique in the world, this game is good a practice tool to incorporate into your practice schedule. It by no means will make you a real guitar player. Think of it how a football player goes to the gym to get stronger, it doesn't make them a better player directly, but it makes them stronger and able to develop their skills more. That's what this software is, a gym program for guitar players, considering the amount of songs available you can get really skilled, but it won't teach you guitar, it will teach you songs. Don't get me wrong it is a lot of fun, but it turned into more of a crutch than a tool when I started to put hours and hours a day into it. Instead of learning how the song is formed, what notes are played, how the riffs connect, etc. you end up just playing based on finger placement, which isn't how you should learn if you really want to excel.

After years of bad habits I have to admit that ""going back to school"" is hard. i've not played for 6 months at least due to comittments, my fingers are everywhere and of course I got not callouses yet on the tips. However what both love and ""hate"" ( playfully ) is that as you just start getting comfortable with a track the program detects this and starts throwing in a couple more notes here and there to throw you right off, it's all stop, loop that part and then restart.

As a metal head of many years I love the inclusion of some free tracks like Iron Maiden, Slayer and Karawan. I'm having a great, if very frustrating, time learning to play again. Tons of basic lessons and practice slots. I can imagine I'll be spending quite a bit of money buying some of the collections like Iron Maiden, Foo Fighters, Slayer and Metallica!

What i think you should do if u buy Rocksmith? If you are trying to learn the a song, first buy the one you are searching for or buy ""Cheerub Rock - Smashing Pumpkinks"" to get access to the CDLC and download it from internet. After you have selected your favorite song you MUST turn the difficulty all the way up, and most probably turn down the speed at which it progresses. If you are struggling with learning the song because you have to pause every single time, then first go and search the tabs for the song on the internet and learn it that way, then try and play it on Rocksmith, because you will most probably will have to fix the tempo at which you are playing and also to get master the timing.

At least that's what I've been doing and it has worked a bit, I still can't play a full song because I need to pick faster but I'm working on it. Overall i could say i know around 90%- For whom the bell tolls , 90%- Seek and Destroy. I still need to refine my technique to sound crystal clear.",1693286511,1693286511,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, you should consider buying it after a few weeks or months of practice. Why? I believe you need to acquire certain skills like hitting the right strings and especially learning alternate and downpicking, at least at the beginner level. Otherwise, it can become a total mess. You can learn some techniques such as hammer-ons, pull-offs, and even tapping in the game. So, keep that in mind if you're a complete beginner.

About the Real Tone Cable, I didn't buy it. Instead, I use my Behringer UCG102 Guitar Link, and it works fine with low latency. If you want to use your own audio card, you should install the ""No Cable Launcher"" and some ASIO drivers.

The main feature of this game is ""learn a song"". The game offers a menu of songs with different tunings. When you select a song you like, you'll notice that each string is represented by its own color. You need to learn this system well if you want to play the songs accurately. An advantage is that each song has its own guitar tone, which can change during the track without requiring any action from your side.

Regarding the Tone Designer, which is the second main feature of the game, you can choose an authentic tone or create your own using amps, cabinets, pedals, and racks. You can save your own tone and assign it to buttons 2, 3, and 4 for use in a song.

As for Custom DLC (CDLC):

    After purchasing the game, you need to buy the DLC ""The Smashing Pumpkins - Cherub Rock.""
    After that, install the RS2014 MOD INSTALLER from this link: https ://drive.google.com/file/d/1aD6Yb0XYl1a8tWOKmyGV_VPtoAhwvkNt/view (space after https).
  You can now download any song from Ignition Custom Forge and paste it into the main DLC folder.

Well, say no more. Rocksmith doesn't teach you how to become a virtuoso like Yngwie Malmsteen, but it can help you learn the basics. You can learn basic chords, play along to songs despite missing most of the notes, learn how notes change along the fret board, and practice on your own. There's tons of amps to choose from songs. My absolute favorite song is Cherub Rock by the Smashing Pumpkins. Every time I listen to that song, I'm just blown away by the creativity.

You can use Rocksmith as a guitar amp while you search online for tabs for whatever song you want to learn. Just make sure your PC can handle more processes than just the game, or use your phone.  Remember to have fun!

I decided to purchase Rocksmith out of curiosity to see what the hype was back in the day and today. I bought the Cherrub rock pack and it opened a new gateway of Custom songs! This has brought new life in playing guitar for me and is a great way of expanding my guitars vocabulary. Although at the time of typing this ive only playing around 4 hours, I have learnt so much with songs I wouldnt normally play (im mainly a metal guitarist) I cant wait to expand my guitar playing with different genres of music and hope to become more of an multi genre artist then just set my hopes on Metal music.

A couple of downsides to owning Rocksmith is there not having a built in pitch shift tuner so having to keep tuning your guitar up or down (causes string ware over time) there are ways around it if you have the right gear, luckily for me I use a line 6 helix which has a built in drop tuner.
Also when you first buy the game it lacks songs (why I bought the cherrub rock pack and installed CDLC)

Rocksmith also has the capabilities of teaching you new techniques if you're a beginner and would Highly recommend it if your wanting to start playing guitar or are like me; sitting on fence in what to do with music and burnt out from being in a band and not learning nothing new.

Rocksmith is most certainly addictive and for the price £25.99 + £2.69 (for Cherrub rocks dlc to install custom dlc songs) is not bad when you compare to programmes like Guitar pro which cost around £60.

It seems like Ubisoft has recently managed to make the game literally unplayable for a lot of gamers, when it was perfectly playable before, probably something to do with stopping official support and/or classic Games As A Service shenanigans related to Rocksmith+ or something like that.

Even after trying workarounds suggested by the community (and even by Ubisoft representatives, like using a specific beta-version), which involve locally changing stuff in files, which a consumer should absolutely not have to do, I cannot get the game to work again.

This game has helped elevate me and my playing from terrible to slightly less awful. Its some of the most fun that you can have on guitar, but you really do need cdlc for it to feel like a complete experience. 

The game at its core is a very easy system to read tabs and play along with songs with somewhat similar sounding tones to the original. When you are learning a song you will only have to hit a few notes, but as you get better you will eventually have to play more notes of the song.  This is great, however the relativley small selection of songs (55 with 10 unlock able) makes it stale quickly. While you can buy more songs at 5 for $12, you can also download custom charts for songs, as long as there it was not licensed by ubisoft. I personally have like 300 songs, and never feel like my selection is lackluster. 

Within ""learn a song"" there is a feature called the ""riff repeater"". The Riff repeater allows you to select a portion of the song and practice it until you fully learn it. You can slow down the riff or decrease its difficulty and practice it and then increase it later. This is particularly useful for learning tricky riffs or solos. For example i learned the fear of the dark, enter sandman, paradise city, solo all through the riff repeater. 

The Game itself has many features beyond learning songs. You have the guitarcade where you can play minigames or compete against other people in real songs for a leader board score (im 5th in the world for run to the hills by iron maiden in master). 

There is a tone designer where you can customize the way you sound and assign hotkeys to the sound. There are so many things you can do to customize your sound, with hundreds of amps, pedals, cabinets, and racks. The more you play the more you will come to appreciate this feature.

Session mode is where you can practice improvising with a responsive band. You select a couple of instruments, and a scale and either learn and get comfortable with the scale, or shred some solos if you know what you are doing. There are again hundreds of instruments, and rocksmith has preset bands and tone available if you are too lazy to customize your own band and sound. You are able to control how often key and scale changes occur, the tempo, the key, the tempo skew. Session mode is great. 

Finally there are the lessons which are fine, but are not really a replacement for actual guitar lessons, more of a supplement. They are rather shallow and while they do offer practice tracks for the skills learned they don't really follow a curriculum that enforces really learning the guitar, more so individual techniques. 

Overall Rocksmith 2014 is a great game with very many features that appeals to beginners and experienced players alike. 10/10 would recommend.

However, if you're colorblind, you're in for some troubles. The colorblind mode of this game is pretty bare-bone, as you can't choose a specific type of colorblindness or change colors individually.

True, it has lessons that introduces most of the techniques you'll come across in the songs and other basics, a very restrictive jamming module called Session Mode, and technique games. You get a lot but it's not a complete guitar course at all. Even learning songs is complicated by a very fussy and particular note recognition system, so you may wind up repeating sections of song ad nauseum and never nail them. And Rocksmith will gleefully let you know that it didn't like what played but rarely offers any insight as to why. On the other hand, there's a lot to like about the game including the colorful 3D streaming tab and the note recognition feature despite it drawbacks. The things I like least about the game are: 1) It's being phased out in favor a new subscription version called Rocksmith+; 2) The developers could have made many improvements to the game in terms of functionality and interface but chose to focus on DLC instead so the software is basically the 2014 version of the game with no improvements; 3) You can't create your own tab within the game, not even simple exercises, nor can you edit the tab you purchased if you don't like something about it; and 4) It supports only stereo output, there is no support for other speaker setups, like 5.1 or 7.1. Taking some of the sting out, there are some free third party add ins, lots of user generated CDLC, and so on.

Whilst talent and a good ear for music can definitely make you a better musician, the most important thing I've found in developing your playing is motivation. Motivation is what keeps you going, what makes you practice where others don't, what makes you NOT quit when things go hard.
I hear a lot of people say ""I will never be able to play guitar, I don't have the talent"" and give up.
Jimi Hendrickx and the people who gave up were at some point equal guitar players, but Jimi kept playing where those other guys gave up. 
You continue through either willpower or motivation (the latter being by far the easier)

I can credit this game primarily for helping me self-learn the guitar. I always loved the Guitar Hero/Rock Band games, so when I learned about Rocksmith I just had to try out the real deal. The game functions very well as both a game and a learning tool.

-Modes-
Learn A Song is the main mode of Rocksmith 2014. You pick a song, and you work on learning it until you can play it. Definitely the mode you'll play the most, but there are various other modes as well.

Session Mode is a pretty fun mode where you set some options, set a backing band, and then you jam along with what you picked. Not much to it, just fun improv stuff. I'd recommended avoiding this mode until you're decent enough to handle playing without a clear goal. It can be kinda confusing if you don't know what to do.

Nonstop Play is really great. It's pretty much just Learn A Song but nonstop, and you can set some nice options too.

Lessons is a great mode for beginners/intermediate players, but stops being useful once you're past that point. It just helps teach you certain concepts and techniques with nice helpful videos and tests you on a sample song.

Guitarcade is a neat idea, but very iffy. Guitarcade is basically arcade games that you play using your instrument. There's a good amount of games included, some better than others, but most of them tend to have detection issues and can be somewhat frustrating, especially for newer players.

-Official Music-
Rocksmith 2014 Edition has a very good setlist IMO. It has a nice mix of different kinds of music, and everybody is bound to find at least a few songs they like. Most of the songs library is in the DLC of course. The DLC songs for both Rocksmith games are really great, with a wide variety of different artists and genres. Rocksmith 2014 is also compatible with the DLC for Rocksmith (2012) and you can import the base game songs from the first game as well, which you should do as the first game has a great setlist of songs. The only downside of Rocksmith's DLC model is that the licensing for the DLC songs are starting to expire, meaning some songs can no longer be purchased. In this case, I'd recommend acquiring them by other means, unless Ubisoft renews the licenses, though this is unlikely to happen.

-Modding-
One of the best parts of Rocksmith 2014 on PC in particular, is the fairly impressive modding scene the games community has created. Once you've modded your game, you can use custom songs, adjust some of the UI, add extra tunings, add limited extended range support, add support for ASIO audio interfaces, speed up the games loading time, and more.

Overall, Rocksmith 2014 Edition is a great game. $30 may be steep depending on how much you like the included songs, especially considering you need to buy the Real Tone Cable separate. That is, unless you mod the game and use an ASIO audio interface instead. With the very lackluster subscription-based sequel to this game, Rocksmith+, Rocksmith 2014 Edition still proves to be the best game in the Rocksmith series for both value, and song availability. The game does have some issues, and the occasional crash when using mods. Unfortunately Ubisoft has also moved on from 2014 Edition to work fully on Rocksmith+. Rocksmith is a series I would like to see get a community created game such as the community made Guitar Hero clone game, Clone Hero. Despite these issues, Rocksmith 2014 Edition remains a game that is entirely worth it if it can help make learning guitar or bass easier for you. 9/10",1686373977,1686373977,True,39,0,0.781858623027801514,0,True,False,False

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. Loaded into the game world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

As an avid guitarist and bassist with a deep love for music, Rocksmith 2014 has truly revolutionized my musical journey. With over 286 hours invested in the past year alone, I can confidently say that this game deserves every single star in the galaxy!

Rocksmith 2014 caters perfectly to players like me who primarily focus on lead guitar and bass guitar, while also providing ample opportunities to explore rhythm playing. It offers an unparalleled learning experience, seamlessly blending the world of gaming with real instrument mastery. The game's ability to transform any song into an interactive learning tool is nothing short of magical.

The extensive song library available in Rocksmith 2014 is a treasure trove for musicians of all levels. Whether you're into classic rock, heavy metal, blues, or even contemporary hits, you'll find something that resonates with your musical tastes. The game's continuous DLC updates ensure that the selection remains fresh and exciting, providing an endless stream of new tracks to explore.

One of the standout features of Rocksmith 2014 is the innovative note detection system. It's remarkably accurate, capturing even the subtlest nuances of my playing. This attention to detail has tremendously enhanced my skills and allowed me to develop a more precise and dynamic playing style. The instant feedback provided after each session is invaluable, helping me identify areas for improvement and encouraging me to strive for perfection.

The game's dynamic difficulty system is a stroke of genius. It tailors the gameplay to match your skill level, gradually introducing new techniques and challenging sections as you progress. This adaptive approach ensures a comfortable learning curve, preventing frustration while constantly pushing you to improve. I can attest that the sense of accomplishment when nailing a previously challenging riff or solo is incredibly rewarding!

Rocksmith 2014's multiplayer mode takes the excitement to a whole new level. Whether you're jamming with friends locally or connecting online with fellow musicians, the multiplayer component adds a social aspect that truly enhances the overall experience. Collaborating, competing, and sharing the joy of music with others has been an absolute blast!

Lastly, I must commend the developers for their continuous support and engagement with the Rocksmith community. Their dedication to listening to player feedback and implementing improvements and updates is commendable. It's evident that they have a genuine passion for music education and creating a space where aspiring musicians can thrive.

In conclusion, Rocksmith 2014 is a melodic masterpiece that has transformed the way I approach guitar and bass playing. With its vast song library, accurate note detection, dynamic difficulty system, and engaging multiplayer, it offers an unparalleled learning experience. If you're a guitarist or bassist looking to sharpen your skills, Rocksmith 2014 is an absolute must-have.

Rocksmith Remastered is a game that proves that the power of music never fades, and neither does the joy of rocking out with a guitar in your hands. With its innovative approach to music education and the ability to use it alongside a soundboard, this game remains a relevant and enjoyable experience in this day and age.

Let's start with the core concept of Rocksmith Remastered: learning to play the guitar. This game continues to excel in providing an engaging and interactive platform for beginners and experienced guitarists alike. The comprehensive tutorial and practice modes guide you through the basics and gradually ramp up the difficulty, ensuring a smooth learning curve. Whether you're picking up a guitar for the first time or honing your shredding skills, Rocksmith Remastered has you covered.

The song library in Rocksmith Remastered is an impressive compilation of rock classics, contemporary hits, and a wide range of genres in between. With hundreds of songs to choose from, there's something for everyone. Each song is meticulously transcribed and synchronized with on-screen prompts, allowing you to play along in real time. It's like being a part of a virtual band, and the satisfaction of nailing those riffs and solos is immensely rewarding.

What sets Rocksmith Remastered apart from other music games is its integration with a soundboard. With the right equipment, you can connect your guitar to the game and utilize a soundboard to amplify and customize your sound. This opens up a whole new world of creativity and experimentation. Want to add some distortion or play with funky effects? The choice is yours. It's like having your own personal guitar rig at your fingertips.

The visual presentation in Rocksmith Remastered is clean and functional. The on-screen interface provides clear feedback on timing, technique, and accuracy, helping you improve your playing skills. However, it must be said that the overall visual aesthetic could use a bit of a facelift. While it gets the job done, a more modern and visually captivating design would have been a welcome enhancement.

One aspect that holds Rocksmith Remastered back from reaching greater heights is its limited multiplayer options. While it does offer local multiplayer, the absence of online multiplayer is a missed opportunity. The ability to jam with friends across the globe would have added an exciting dimension to the game and prolonged its longevity. However, the solo experience is still highly enjoyable, and the game's main focus remains on honing your personal guitar skills.

In this day and age, Rocksmith Remastered still holds its own as a valuable tool for guitarists of all levels. It provides an immersive and interactive learning experience that is both fun and educational. The ability to use it with a soundboard amplifies the creative potential and allows players to truly make the guitar their own.

In conclusion, Rocksmith Remastered is a game that continues to shine as a valid and enjoyable experience. Its innovative approach to music education, vast song library, and integration with a soundboard make it a worthwhile investment for any aspiring guitarist. While it could benefit from a visual update and expanded multiplayer options, it remains a solid choice for those looking to rock out and refine their guitar skills. With a rating of 7.6 out of 10, Rocksmith Remastered strikes the right chords and keeps the music alive.

The game's approach to teaching bass is both fun and effective. In just a few hours of playing, I have already learned a lot and was able to play a full song on the first day!

The game also includes a wide variety of songs, ranging from classic rock to modern hits, so there's something for everyone. By purchasing the song ""Cherub Rock"" as a DLC, you can access a huge library of custom songs created by the Rocksmith community. This is a great feature for those who want to expand their song library beyond what's included in the game.

The process of adding custom songs is straightforward, and there are plenty of resources available online to help you get started. It's a fantastic way to keep the game fresh and challenging, and there's always something new to learn.

Overall, I continue to be impressed with Rocksmith 2014 as a learning tool for bass players. The addition of custom songs only makes it even better, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their bass skills in a fun and engaging way.

I tried it on a Linux PC and didn't like the audio delay, so picked up a BigShot AB-Y pedal. Promptly blew out an old low-end practice amp, so got a slightly nicer one and put together a pedal board for early 60's guitar instrumentals and surf (delay, reverb, tremolo for surf, and overdrive for the occasional Link Wray). It's a lot of fun to play the game. No delay at all when using an AB-Y pedal and an amp. You can pick your own sound when using your own pedals.

90 Hour Edit (2-26-23): One of my lifelong dreams has been able to play guitar. I have taken lessons, but the lessons I took were from a musician who didn't want, or like to play the type of music I wanted to play. I didn't care at the time about learning technically, I just wanted to play. Well, as I approach 100 hours - I can thank Rocksmith for helping me achieve a dream. Not only has it gotten me to a point where I can play a guitar somewhat adequately when picking it up, it has also encouraged me to continue my learning by learning technical guitar and not just what I wanted to play. In short, it has made me a better musician, and helped me broaden my musical knowledge. I am at 90 hours, and I am no where near by means a ""good"" guitar player, but it has spurred me to continue playing to the point where I am no longer a schlub. 
The only problem I have now is that I have a list of guitars that I want... and my wife doesn't necessarily love that. If this has been on your radar, and you're like me - a person that's always wanted to rock out - get this game. I know there are other options out there now, but if you like guitar hero, or rockband, this will feel right at home. It's what I wanted back when guitar hero was popular. 
Rock on!

This is a huge game changer for me though as it actually teaches me how to play songs the way they are supposed to be played in a way that feels like a natural progression, starting out with single notes or more rhythm based and then pushes you into real chords and techniques that the guitarist uses in the song. 

It also has dynamic difficulty so if you're doing well, it makes it more challenging and if you're not doing so great, it drops it down so you can keep up.

Absolutely fantastic tool that is not just for those who have already got the basics down, but for those who have never picked up a guitar. There are lessons that show you what to do, then get you doing it too.

I no longer recommend this game.

Don't waste your time on this simulation.

- The accuracy of reading guitar bends is absolute rubbish. It should have levels of correct and incorrect the way the timing of a note works. As in, Early, Ok, Perfect, Late, Miss.
Without this the game demands session guitarist levels of accuracy from people trying to *learn* the instrument.

I don't know why I keep trying to learn guitar thru this game, I wish Rock Band from EA would make a big comeback in this music education space and knock Ubisoft the hell out over how far off the game reads your playing.

Now that I got the straight to the point of the way, this is the explanation part, for context to me, I am not the brightest or guitar god, I have built my PC, but that does not make me into a tech wizard, I am average, or what the kids call a filthy casual, just like you I went into the Rocksmith series hopping to learn how to play the guitar, improve my skills to the point where I can play along to my favorite songs without having to look up the TAB's, I played the first Rocksmith and even played Bandfuse: Rock Legends, both great, and inspired me to keep on playing, this was awesome, but the games were only good for practicing not actually learning.

Rocksmith (the original) was more like a game, it created challenges in the form of venues in which were only possible to be taken after you have achieve performing well on a set list of songs, each song that had to be performed before the venue had a minimum percentage that had to be met, surpassing the minimum performance or just meeting it would increase the expected percentage for the next chapter, level, or venue (honestly forgot what Ubisoft called each stage), this would encourage players to keep on playing in order to see where else the player would be performing, as well as discover some unlockables that were hidden by completing each venue.

Although I saw this as a positive way to reinforce the player to keep moving, a lot of hard core guitar players, people who definitely did not need this software complained, wondering why where there hidden things in the game, why do players have to unlock something in a game, as if... This is partially a game 

:O

Next those same people would be amazed that normal people wish to learn to play, but feel like there should be a much more interesting or a much more engaging way to learn that did not have them paying hundreds of dollars to hire a teacher, a person who most likely will get frustrated with the students, but that is impossible, clearly this was never suppose to be a game, and a learning tool too placed      
             
                      ON
                                
                                 CONSOLES...

Hmm... it's almost like the Canadian team were probably aiming at normal consumers who wanted to learn, either ways, bad word of mouth, countless YouTube guitar teachers, guitar heads convinced a lot of people that Rocksmith (original) was nothing more then a gimmick, so the first game was a bit of a failure, friends of mine interested in learning were discouraged, and now we have so many great music... Huh... It's like maybe we need to encourage the normal consumer base to listen to something and try new things in some shape or form in order to aid music to actually become something better.

Bandfuse, same issue as Rocksmith (original), but actually geared towards the hard core guitar heads, or least the beginner group, it wasn't bad, it really was more advance then Rocksmith, but with no clear direction of where to start, or how to start, this was not for the casual, or the through beginner, Bandfuse was a beast of its own making, it was basically what Rocksmith 2014 will become, just with a TAB music score sheet, and timing being set as a focus, plus it was more accurate then Rocksmith (both the original & 2014), the notes were detected on point, just that this game took in to account of your timing, so if you missed the timing of your notes, half points or no points, also this game did not give me issues regardless of the guitar I used, it was pretty much a learning tool and not a game at all.

The main focus though should be on this game, ROCKSMITH  2014 ( I am going to refer to it as R14 from now on). R14 is not a game, it's a tool, which is not bad, except that it misses the point that it is not a game and still has a lot of gaming elements, I mean what is the point of getting rid of Rocksmith if R14 still has a lot of gaming elements present, you still have this emphasis on unlocking things, not music related, which makes it worse then before, then there's the mini games, why? I thought the guitar heads did not want something that felt game like, R14 confuses me, in the one hand it truly wishes to be a tool, in the other hand, you can tell Ubisoft team really wanted to make this into a fun experience where people played, but were learning as they played, which is what Rocksmith was trying to do, but the guitar heads disliked, why not just make Rocksmith, fix the issues with lag, audio output issues, and still keep the requirement to perform better to unlock new songs, sounds and mini games, Rocksmith did this so well, R14 is just Bandfuse, just with less actual guitar tools and more game like tools.

Now the clown-show!

This game is filled with bugs, issues, latency, lack of innovation, etc... In a lot of cases this game will at time not open up, even if you have opened the game all day one day, the next day, it may not work, or how about the literal lag that you can see randomly, or the audio just stops working, all of this and more, this game is not worth anything above $9.99 with all DLC included, because some songs may not even or ever work, it took a year for the Jackson five songs to work, a year, and I downloaded R14 on to another friends PC with my friend so he can try the game out, it doesn't matter the hardware, this game is random when it works, and even if it did, all you are going to do is play your favorite song, get annoyed that even when you hit the right note the game still does not register the note, this is because the in game tuner is set to a frequency of 435, I know, because I had to test this out using several tuners, and tuner setting, even worse, the tuner's frequency changes each time you download the game, but it is always a couple cents off from 440.

I wished that the Ubisoft team stuck to their guns and just made an improved Rocksmith, imagine how awesome it would be to have the next Guitar Hero just be common people playing the real guitar, Guitar Hero changed a lot of people's taste in music, and for the better too, but when it went away, people just started to listen to synthesized crap, and now AI music is soon to be on the rise, music is going to die, but not because of bad untalented musicians, instead by synthetic production lines, this game is proof of what is wrong with music today.

Thank you all for reading my horrible essay, hope you are all doing well, I am not turning on comments, just because if you disagree, just disagree, there's no need to start a war over one idiots opinion ( I called my self an idiot), have fun and love life.",1633391820,1682228582,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Again, two thumbs down for the DRM cable (and before some entitled @55hole ""corrects"" me that the DRM cable ""is an accessory"", I'd suggest he/she learns his/her own language, plus one more hint in a dead language — google ""conditio sine qua non"" and then open a dictionary to understand the meaning of the word ""accessory"") and the servers (servers in a single player band simulator game, give me a f°kken break).

Thumbs down for the incredibly massive money sink that the DLCs are (I don't remember spending more money on any other game, including DCS World; I bought both the original and the remaster for my PS3, plus some DLCs, because neither the main games, nor the DLCs are transferable between platforms (but the disc import tools are mandatory, if you want the songs/DLCs from the original on the remaster, regardless of the platform); it's a literal cash burner).

Thumbs down for the already disappearing DLCs (this will happen in the subscription-based RS+ too, don't be a smart@55, please).

Two thumbs up for everything else — this ""game"" really kicks @55. One great addition (compared to the original) is the session mode (I'd call it a band simulator), which is dope if you're tired of all the songs & DLCs or you just want to improvise. I'd compare RS2014 to an interactive encyclopedia (which, erm, doesn't have a chapter about proper musical notation; the majority of guitarists live without it (and hate music theory in general) for decades anyway). Yeah, if I had to create an interactive encyclopedia, that's what I'd do (without the DRM and the temporary licensing $#1+ of course). You're pretty much guaranteed to learn something new (e.g. a new scale, a new chord, a new exercise, a new song that you didn't like listening to, but enjoy playing along with, etc.), even if you played your instrument for a decade already.If you're a musician wannabe and find guitars sexy, then, please, do yourself a favour, don't waste your time, get a loan from a friend/parent/hell, even a frickin' bank, and (after buying your instrument) buy this before it gets buried in the digital graveyard (i.e. removed from Steam/PlayStation Store).

there are two things that i’m really passionate about: music and videogames. so for me, rocksmith is the best thing that happened since the invention of pizza.

i started playing bass about 15 years ago and got pretty decent at it by learning from friends, bandmates and youtube tutorials. Then i wanted to evolve musically and also write some riffs for the band i played in during university, so i finally picked up the guitar about 6 or 7 years ago to learn some basics and maybe a handful of songs. Eventually, i started to make progress the same way i did with the bass: By learning from friends and bandmates and teaching myself through experimentation and youtube tutorials. But the progress i made was very slow until finally i felt that it was stagnating.
Then, in that fatefull summer of 2019 i discovered rocksmith during a steam sale, tried it, got addicted. And in the one and a half years or so since i first played rocksmith, i made tenfold progress on guitar than during the 5 years before and by today I acquired a level of skill on the guitar that I never thought I could potentially realize. All thanks to this game.

it has everything a beginner needs. it does not just throw a couple of songs at you and says „here you go buddy“, but it really starts at the bottom like teaching you how to tune your guitar properly and stuff like that. Then, there is lessons and tutorial videos for basically every common guitar technique.
The coolest part by far are the original songs from all your favourite artists that you can learn. Rocksmith has rhythm guitar, lead guitar and bass tracks for every included song and even the lyrics are shown too. The songs included in the base game are very diverse and you’ll find big names in there like elvis presley, the who, queen, outkast, foo fighters, deftones, oasis, green day and bush as well as some less known but nevertheless very good indie and underground artists. There are tons of other songs that you can download as dlc, too. 
The gameplay is basically copied from guitar hero, just with real f***in guitars this time. Also, the difficulty and speed are completely scalable. You can even experiment with different sound effects like distortion, flanger, wah-wahs etc. and jam along with some freely configurable basic drum and percussion computers. Last but not least, the game has some really fun retro arcade modes that turn your guitar into a controller to reach the ultimate highscore.

Literally the sole complaint is, that a couple of the songs, especially some of the dlc are somewhat broken. No matter how flawless you play, rocksmith just won’t register the correct chords here or there. It can be a bit frustrating when you desperately want to reach the 100% in a song but the game does not let you. It seems that this problem occurs mostly with songs with very low tunings and/or a lot of powerchords. For example, Seether's Song ""Remedy"" is a very easy song to play on rhythm guitar, but i really struggled to get it over the 90% mark, since it's in Drop C and just four powerchords over and over again and the game seems to freak out over those very low powerchords, depending on your strumming: if you play the powerchords alternating between up- and downstrokes, everything is perfectly fine, but if you play it only downstroking (which rhythmically feels more comfortable and natural in this song imo), the game does not register every other chord or so. This carries over to some of the arcade games, where the game has severe problems with detecting at least some of the strings sometimes (in my case the high e-string). It seems that this problem is highly individual though, and its occurrence may depend on your guitar, sound hardware and general audio setup.
Another very minor thing is, that the virtual band that you can set up in session mode can't be set to play faster than 150 bpm. Considering that the game has some songs and dlc that are way faster than that, it doesn't make much sense to me.
Finally be aware, that in addition to the actual game you either need a decent microphone or the Rocksmith Cable (the input cable made by Ubisoft specifically for this game), which currently sales for about 30 Euro, so that may be a bit of a bummer. From my experience though, the Cable also works with several other music tools as well. Personally I also use it to record, mix and produce some of my own guitar and bass stuff with MAGIX Samplitude Music Studio, which provided some extra value of the cable. 

In the end, if you want to learn guitar and/or bass, this is the perfect way to go. Rocksmith is fun, motivating, easy to use and it‘s dirt cheap as well (however, the dlc songs and the mentioned Rocksmith Cable are a bit pricy for the most part). the only reasons why it’s not getting the 8/8 are it's occasional detection problem mentioned above on one hand, and the simple fact that it is more of a learning tool than an actual video game on the other.
just be aware, if you start playing rocksmith, you‘ll probably never put down the guitar ever again.

After spending many hours going through all of the various settings, installing, uninstalling, reinstalling, and uninstalling again various supposed ""fixes"" and additional drivers, tweaking every single setting in the ini files, adjusting all of the settings in-game, and testing out all of the suggested remedies and many more no one listed, this game simply DOES NOT FUNCTION.

Did you manage to fix the SEVERE audio garbling? Good for you, now the input latency is an entire SECOND. Did you fix the input latency? Well now you have the audio garbling again. Was the audio fine last time you ran the game 4 minutes ago and you literally did not even touch your computer in that time? Too bad, when you run the app again the audio is garbled all over again and unplayable.

And around and around and around and around it goes for this attempt at a game. I'm not going to call it a game right now, I might not even call it software since it fails at meeting the basic needs of modern software. And by modern I mean this century.

There were TWO basic requirements that Ubisoft needed to actually succeed in getting right here for this to actually function as software: basic audio functionality and something resembling responsive input. THEY FAILED MISERABLY AT BOTH. I don't know if Ubisoft could have screwed this up more if they even tried, and I'm not unconvinced that someone there wasn't. That is how badly this game fails at simply being functional software.

I could go on about the laborious and unskippable menus, weird menu selection mechanics, and the basic clunkiness of the actual game's design and how it represents strings and chords (all terrible in case you were wondering), but even those complaints would make for a lofty improvement to the list of complaints to be had about this failed exercise.

Every single time you think you've run out of reasons to loathe Ubisoft, up comes a new reason floating to the top of the bowl.

As an instructor, I still think you should have someone more experienced than you work you through your practice sessions, because the game can be a little too forgiving than it needs to be to help a new player develop good habits.

PROS:
-The idea it's great and it's pretty well done...it´s guitar hero with real instruments!
-The game have many great songs from various styles...but!! 90% of the game library till this day it´s on the DLC format so you have to pay to make the game really great, despite this...the songs are great and the transcriptions are pretty pretty accurate.
-As a learning tool it´s where this game really stands out...if you are an amateur guitar player...or if you want to star and learn...this is a good and fun way to do it.
-It have more game modes than i expected.
-The sound of the guitar it´s good and sorta mimics  the songs and it´s fun...obviously as a musician and with the technology and good vst plugins that we have today(it´s a 2014 game after all and this kind of technology moves fast)is way far from that, but it´s fun how the guitar sounds kinda in the style of every song.
-In general, a good game ...a brilliant idea that makes me want a new, improved, better Rocksmith or any games that improves this formula of guitar hero with the real stuff...it´s great and fun...and helpful for many starting players or soon to be...guitar players.

CONS:
-If you have a music game with i don´t know around 1000 songs and only like 70 are free, it seems like a lot of purchases and money to spend to give the game a proper use of his library.
-This is one of the worst cons, i had the game on ps4 but i buy it on steam too...because the community had make hundreds and hundreds of songs for you to download...and i was having a lot of fun with this(of course not every song on that list it´s well done in sound or in the transcryption of the notes of the actual song but still many many free great songs )But of course this is Ubisoft we are talking about and in one of the latest updates if you had any of this songs downloaded the game won´t work anymore..of course there´s a fix because the community it´s great...but anyway...f**k you Ubisoft.
-The other shitty thing is...as a musician and not only pros, avergae and even amateurs too most of us have audio monitors(Like Akg or presonus etc) not speakers and audio interfaces(like M-audio or focusrite)and the game in all these years never in any update fix the huge problem that is not support asio drivers and so fails and have a lot of problems to work with monitors and audio interfaces...and as the point above this one...the community has some fixes to this, but many are not that easy to do, others have some latency issues...anyway thanks to the community it can be fixed...but Ubisoft makes updates to keep you from playing free stuff, makes tons of dlc for you to buy but...in all this years never made an update that fix these issues.

OVERALL:
A good game and a great idea, that is fun and helpful if you are starting or are a casual guitar player but with some huges cons that in pc made me uninstall the game after many times finding fixes and tutorials for downloades free songs or to make the game work with my current audio set up and as some kind of more advanced guitar player in my case i preferto play along with spotify or backing tracks, play songs by ear and use my pedals or neural Vst that are way better...again not because the game is bad or because i´m steve vai or tim henson...only because Ubisoft made the game a pain in the ass to work properly.
I know it´s a long ass review but hope that someone find this helpful at the moment of making a decision.",1677545945,1677545945,True,49,1,0.801767528057098389,0,True,False,False

However, I like it because I have no motivation and no discipline, and it gamifies playing. It gives you songs to play, goals to reach, and literal games to play. That was worth the $30+$3+Realtone cable to me. Session mode and Tone designer are great features too, and can provide this games entire worth. I'm pretty on the fence about giving this a thumbs up but if you know what you are getting, it's ok.

I already could play at a decent level, and Rocksmith is definitely not going to help me get better. The problem is that on Rocksmith you are gated heavily by how fast you can sight read their notation, and I find it hard to memorize songs in their notation. If I want to learn a song, or get better at guitar, tabs/sheet music are dramatically better tools. I can play much harder things if I don't have to sight read, which means I'm not really getting better while playing Rocksmith.

Get CDLC. CDLC is broken on the latest patch because Ubisoft wants to force you to buy their new subscription program, but you can play on a compatibility patch if you look up how.",1677541506,1677541506,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To use an audio interface, you select the Microphone Mode in-game and plug into your mic input, as opposed to the instrument/line channel. However, regardless of the fact you are using an electric guitar, Rocksmith will behave as if you are actually using a mic to record you playing an acoustic. Which means you won't hear your guitar ""amplified"" in-game, even though it's being detected.

Now, the Rocksmith community is full of generous and talented folks who provided a way to experience the game as intended, even if you use an interface. But if you have a Behringer interface like me, whether or not you get everything working probably is a coin toss. The legacy (old) drivers needed for our interfaces can cause a number of issues, including; lower audio quality, increased white noise, and/or having no audio at all. I tried every possible fix both recommended to me and that I came up with on my own, but ultimately gave up. 

There's mixed information out there about whether or not you can use any 1/4"" to USB cable or if you need a Real Tone Cable. I didn't want risk it, but I also didn't want to spend $40 CAD on a cable that only works 50% of the time. And THAT is why I'm giving this game a thumbs down. 

People had home studios when this game was being developed. People were using USB audio interfaces; they were common place. You should not have to seek out a third-party solution for something that should've been integrated into the game by the developers. They could have made setting up hassle-free, and made the game accessible to all. But yet again, it looks like we have a case of a studio being greedy.

I was so excited to play Rocksmith, but it looks like I will have to go back to traditional lessons (which I find unfulfilling) or try to carve my own path (which is daunting).

The game is playable again, but maaany if not most songs have been delisted, so there's not a whole lot to play any longer unless you complement with custom DLC.


This is the third version of Rocksmith that I've purchased and played. I previously played the original Rocksmith, as well as the 2014 version, on Playstation. Total playtime probably clocks in at a thousand hours. I have tried all features but I almost exclusively use the ""Non-stop play"" mode for fun and jamming along with songs.

Mini-games are a waste of time. Master mode did not help me learn songs by heart. Session mode goes completely wild, unless you play just the one riff over and over. Riff repeater with variable playback speed is great for learning individual riffs and solos. Song library is huge, with a lot of something from most genres, and there are additional songs available with mods.

Recommended for intermediate hobby guitarists who want a convenient collection of songs and tablature in one software, and complete beginners who need basic direction and a more diverse song library (compared to the same old ""beginner"" songs) with dynamic, accessible tablature.",1642597846,1676910122,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Man, from barely learning how to strum a chord and barely holding a pick correctly back in 2015 to recording a song and playing in bars around town with jam bands in 2019. This game is a gem and one of the best learning programs I've ever used. This program really came in clutch when I needed to review solos and songs for school.

After owning the game on xbox for some time, I learned of a certain smashing pumpkins song (wink wink) and bought it for pc. It has helped me tremendously because I could play along to songs that were wayyyy above my level at the time but I just turned down the difficulty to I could still enjoy them. For reference, when I first started a year ago Stone by AIC was the hardest song I could play, now I can play nearly anything including things like Morrigan, Master of Puppets, State of Slow Decay, Black Flame, all note for note with little difficulty. I owe most of it to Rocksmith. Im hearing alot about how people cant get it to run or its too laggy but I really havent had any of these problems. Getting CDLC to work took some time but thats not Rocksmiths fault. Im running it on a f'in laptop with windows 10 and it never lags. I never even close the game unless its to add a new song I just discovered. Just make sure that if you close the laptop and then open it again you have to unplug the cable and put it back in for it to work. I usually use a Hellraiser with double humbuckers and it works great but I also use a $200 fender starcaster with trash pickups and the game still has no problems picking it up. In fact, I have yet to find a guitar that the game didnt work well with. I dont even have to reconfigure it when switching guitars either, it just works. Now Im not affiliated with Rocksmith or Ubisoft in any way (I got beef with ubisoft anyway) and Im still praising the game like this.

I spent years trying to teach myself chords, scales, and various songs. But it was a slow and restrictive process that produced little to no result.

Rocksmith instantly made me engrossed in the process with it's guided instruction, the freeform session mode, and the Guitarcade? Absolutely brilliant! Suddenly I'm playing guitar for hours on end, pushing myself to go further, and sleeping 1 or 2 hours less than usual because it's always in the front of my mind and ""I know if I throw myself at that one song a couple more times I can probably break 70%!!!"" Unreal! 

I basically started at square one with this game and roughly 500 hours later I'm closer to the music than I've ever been before. Now my ear is better trained musically, my overall concentration and dexterity has improved, and it's given me a newfound love and appreciation for music.

It's meant to be incredibly forgiving to beginners and will definitely build bad habits at the cost of being accessible. It's great at being a fun way to learn, but it is NOT a replacement for dedicated practice or learning from a teacher. If you're looking to get into guitar then it should suffice for the very basics, but once you're past 1/2 to a full year of progress, it's pretty much just for fun.

I'm posting this because I saw some other comments saying otherwise, and it's highly misleading to say this is the only thing you'll need to play music.  The game covers a LOT of technical things, and if you're a bedroom player, that's great to learn what those techniques are; but without someone else who knows what they're doing really listening or teaching you things, you'll end up using improper posture, or having a really bad tone because the game doesn't actually review how you sound.  The game is also VERY loose with its rhythm.  In terms of making progress, it's actually better to just record yourself and hear how you sound.

For reference, I've been playing music for 4 years, picked up guitar, bass, drums, and saxophone and gigged with a bunch of bands.  I LOVE this game, it's a lot of fun, but it only goes so far, and I found those limitations very quickly.",1676403847,1676403847,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Thinking that it was dumbed down and not really teaching you anything.  This game is so much more than that.  Playing along with some of my favorite songs with backing tracks and gradually building the finger positions, is a great way to practice and learn new songs.  Being able to buy individual songs as I learn them keeps me focused without overwhelming me.  The practice tools and song breakdowns are also amazing to work on just the parts you are struggling with, without playing the whole song each time.  This is exactly what I needed, I'm excited to play guitar again.    

My only complaint is that the cables that come with the game are poorly made and break over time.  If you purchase it from steam there is no cable at all.  There is no more official way to get these cables so you have to buy them from ebay or amazon or find an old copy of the game at a yard sale and hope that cable is still good.   This seems silly to me.  The solution most people use is a hack that allows you to play with a microphone, which works when it wants to.  But even more frustrating, after the recent launch of a new version of Rocksmith online, they put out an update that breaks this version of the game if you are using the hack.  So you have to put a special code into steam to get the older version back.  This all seems like a company not supporting an older product to force you to their new product.  I don't think anyone is interested in the new product.  I have what I want, I don't need online features.  I've bought the songs I want over time.  Instead of trying to force me to something new, start making cables again, or unlock the software so you can use a microphone like the hack allows.  There are improvements to be made and old happy customers who are now unable to use what they paid for.  

That all being said, the game is fun and a good way to learn guitar, but expect to have to fuss with it a lot to make it work for you.  Also, expect to purchase some way to connect your guitar to the computer.

[strike]Acoustic Guitar Owners ***Don't buy it!!***

Well, this is a pretty big disaster for me. I saw this game on youtube and I said to myself ""Nice game it sucks not to have an electric guitar to play it"". Then I saw an official video about playing this game with an acoustic guitar. I have an acoustic guitar so just bought it. 

After that I used my headphones microphone at the calibration scene. Game said volume is too low. That was fine, it was not a professional recording thing at all. So I bought a microphone to calibrate it, I tried to calibrate maybe a hundred times. The bar is in the middle at start, game says ""make some noise"" it goes to top and calibrates, then game says ""mute the strings"" I f***** mute the strings and guess what bar won't go down under the middle!! It just stucks there. Some might say it's because the background voices. No it's not!! I closed the window, and my room's door, I mean we're in July for god's sake!!! That bar still stucks at there, or not even raises when game says make some noise.

So playing this game with an acoustic guitar is impossible, just a big LIE and destroyed my nerves. Thanks Ubisoft for taking my money for a guitar simulation which I couldn't even play a note at it...

Edit: All my gameplay time is actually struggling to calibrate so I have no words... [/strike]",1533123233,1673020373,True,0,0,0.415777981281280518,4,True,False,False

Even for the intermediate player (which I promise you is not me), I would make the claim that it serves a great way to learn a song, assuming you have purchased either the song you want to learn or Cherub Rock. Honestly, some of the best value in this game isn't the essentially game-ified tabs that is ""Learn a Song"" but the Guitarcade to work on scales and learn chords in a more engaging way than 45 minutes of the Spider Exercise.

Now, the bad: 1) You need the Realtone cable, so get ready to drop an additional $25-30 bucks for an old cable that honestly isn't the best quality. You [i]CAN[/i] use a microphone for the audio input for like an acoustic guitar, but you [i]COULD[/i] also eat handfuls of pennies, but I wouldn't recommend.
2) Note registration has ALWAYS been an issue. You'll just have to work with it the best you can.
3) The song packs are expensive. Like, almost prohibitively if you are on a budget or just want a big variety of songs to mess around with. The best DLC 100% worth the money is the Cherub Rock pack. Buy it.
4) The game is 9 years old at this point and Rocksmith+ is out, so it is quite a bit outdated, but still functional in my opinion.

Does this game teach you guitar? No. It teaches you guitar techniques and skills, and provides much more feedback than just learning from YouTube and random tab sites, but you are still missing big chunks foundational music theory and it can never provide the same feedback a teacher would. Does this game work at getting your skills honed in a fun way though? Absolutely. Even at just an hour or so a day for a few months, I am seeing and feeling MASSIVE improvement, especially when I supplement what the game provides with just videos on tips for things like barre chords or boring exercises (looking at you Spider exercise) to just try and work on between songs.

TL;DR: it's cool. i like it. not as good as a class, but better than just watching vids online. it's fun. if you buy it, get the Cherub Rock pack and thank all of us in the reviews later.",1672701895,1672701895,True,3,0,0.532918155193328857,0,True,False,False

You have lots of fun tracks to play with but you should also concentrate on the games because they work on your technique and theyre fun . I play half an hour games and half an hour songs. theres also the studio mode that lets you play with a band. veterans will enjoy it. newbies will learn scales from it.

Now comes the BUT. I think I got to a certain level or barrier, that rocksmith cant advance beyond that level. so now I should look for other resources to continue and improve(teacher or online), and maybe it should be like that. the lessons in this game are lacking and demand too much of you too quickly in the excercises.
 
Second BUT is that UBI soft is abandoning  the game because of the new Rocksmith+.

This game has absolutely earned this review though. It's worth noting I have no affiliation with the game, makers, or anything like that. I'm nobody whose only incentive here is to help people make a choice I'm happy that I made.

One of the things I asked before I started and got mixed answers about is this: ""Can you really learn to play guitar on Rocksmith alone?"" Yes, absolutely, yes you can. I wanted to learn to play guitar since I was a kid and I simply could not do the lessons route. Fast forward to decades later and I found Rocksmith and thought ""why the **** not?"" I've never purchased anything in my life which has given more to me than Rocksmith has. I had just gotten divorced and was depressed, lonely, and had a lot of time on my hands so I decided to pull the trigger, buy and electric guitar and give it a shot.

If you're starting from scratch like I did, don't expect to be playing all of the songs you love instantly. It's going to take more time for some and less for others but only you can decide that. It is a grind like anything that you want to get good at. You may find it tough for a while. Not being able to make simple string changes. Not finding the strings, being slow to react, one note at a time, etc. At first it can seem like you're getting nowhere but that's not the case. Your brain is going to be learning even if you feel frustrated. Things you'll think at first that your fingers cannot do, you'll be doing in no time. I'm an obsessive one whether it's sports or in this case guitar. I honestly can do things already that I thought I could never learn or would take me 5 years. I'm hitting some solos now without even seeing the notes, just from instinct. It surprises me absolutely every day. Just don't give up. Eventually the grind will turn into a feeling I can't describe. It's not ""practice"" to me anymore. It's not work at all. I try now to get as many hours a day as possible, however possible. It's the most fun thing I can think of doing.

There are skill games that I have no doubt are useful now that I've played more. When I started they didn't mean much too me. Being 100% honest, I think I have less than 30 minutes total in those skill games, lessons, and everything other than playing songs. That's just me. You don't NEED them to learn, or, at least, I didn't need them but some may find great benefit there.

The standard DLC is also a little sad depending on your type of music you want to play. I'll simply leave this at that. I found, the more songs I want to listen to, the more I want to play them. That is what I needed in order to learn guitar. I managed and most of you can as well.

I started playing Rocksmith in October of 2021. I got something like 4 days in before my PC died and I had to wait until December 15th or so for my new one. When I got my new PC it was on, that day I was on a mission that has only gotten more intense by the day. They say it takes 10,000 hours to master something and I need to do it no more than 7 years. As of December 2022, I have 857 hours in Rocksmith and 511 hours playing songs in learn a song. I think I'm also on a 165 day streak of playing every single day. I also practice anywhere from 2 to 5 hours, every single day. In less than one year I've gotten to the point where I put the settings on override to max difficulty right from the start. Every song I touch now starts at 100%. I've so far gotten 41 Perfect Scores on varied songs from hard rock to metal to pop to 80's and everything in between.  There are still plenty of songs I don't own and some that I do but can't play. Most songs I can get 80% + on my very first try. 

On a regular basis at this point, I'll start playing something and all of the sudden I'm just hitting notes without a second thought that I notably could not hit yesterday and last week I couldn't even understand what hand shapes were going on. Then, like a lightning strike, I just get it all of the sudden. Songs that were so fast I just messily tried to emulate a month ago have almost like magic, slowed because my brain and my hands have sped up and now I can do it. It's absolutely wild. It frustrates and frustrates and then *BANG* it's just happening like you'd been doing it all along. Last week you may be missing every transition and now you nail every last one. It's truly amazing what you can do with something like this when you really put the work into it.

In one year I went from a guy messily desecrating a guitar to somebody that if you watched me play 80% of the songs I play, you would mistake me for somebody who is ""good"" and has played for years. This game has handed me a dream. I've done a lot and experienced a lot in my life but nothing compares to the feeling of being able to pick up an electric guitar and fly. 

If you are willing to put in the work, this ""game"" / learning tool will take you where you want to go. If you can't learn to play guitar using Rocksmith, it's a fault in you, not Rocksmith. I doubted it as well but I've never been more thankful that I said ""**** it, why not?""  I could not be more sincere. What this game has given to me is worth FAR MORE than the cost of the game or the now 3 guitars and 1 bass guitar that I own because of it. 

This is a game because it's fun but it's also misleading to call it that because it's a very, very good learning tool. If I would ever recommend a game to anybody, it's this one without a doubt.",1672268619,1672616306,True,87,1,0.879839539527893066,1,True,False,False

and even though official support for this game has been suspended it constantly is being updated with new jams to learn with CDLC on Custom Forge(albeit with varying quality)

I'd heard some criticism of this before I started playing, but given it was relatively cheap and something that I'd been meaning to try for a while (learning guitar, aided) I figured I'd give it a shot. I will say that while I don't think it's a substitute for a good teacher and professional lessons, it's a darn-sight easier to justify to your wallet. 

The game itself, if you can call it that, is comfortably split into some mini-games, some lessons which are on the fundamentals-to-advanced techniques, and the actual songs themselves. There's a good back catalogue (more on this later) in which you're bound to find something that suits your taste. I myself have about 10 songs which I intend to learn, maybe three of which I actually have so far, and can play comfortably. 

When you play through a song, it gradually becomes more complex (depending on your settings) and teaches you how to ultimately get 'the sound' of the song, after a few rounds of simplified versions. If you have the USB adaptor for this, then the song still sounds ""right"" as the software fills in the blanks for you when playing the simplified versions.

On the whole, I can recommend Rocksmith, with the following caveats:

# Songs get removed
Because of licensing agreements (I assume) songs periodically get purged from the catalogue available, ultimately this will make Rocksmith dead-in-the-water, so it's worth bearing this in mind. This is a sad truth of the music industry, and unfortunately it doesn't give this type of ""game"" a long shelf-life. 

# Requires hardware
You need a guitar... obviously, though this shouldn't be a deal-breaker if you... intend to learn the guitar? You can also get by without the ""Realtone"" cable, though it's obviously the preferred way to play Rocksmith, and offers some benefits over a ""passthrough"" setup.

# You still need to practice
This should really go without saying, but you still need to actually put the hours in to get good at guitar. I have family members who have been playing guitar for decades, and they still stuff up occasionally, so you've got to commit, and enjoy it, even if you suck for a while (I still suck.)

Linux notes.

If you're playing on Windows, I'm so sorry; the following section might be useful to Linux players. If it goes over your head, I also apologise for that.

* There's minimal latency when using Pipewire's Pulseaudio shim. I found some guides saying that the latency was too high with Pulse, but it seems like the Pipewire shim might be fine, because I've not noticed any serious delay. 

* I've set Wine/Proton to use ALSA and dedicated the Realtone cable to the game. Again, when using Pipewire, this is an artificial ALSA as it's a shim controlled by Pipewire, but don't let that put you off, the game seems to detect it fine and I've had no issues. 

* I've also tried a setup through a small Scarlett Solo, and while this works quite well, it did require a bit more setup and dedicating an input as the ""microphone"" as far as Rocksmith was concerned, this means that: A. You get a more real-world reflection of your playing (and mistakes) but B. You miss out on some of the additional detection features that seem to come with the Realtone cable, both setups work, but both come with their shortcomings as far as I'm concerned.

* Helvum and similar Pipewire routing software can help you to get the optimal setup, if you want, you can route the game's audio to headphones, your guitar to headphones & surround sound, and other forms of input (say midi files) to the surround sound too, artificially creating your own stage setup.

* Tests done on Fedora, personal preference, YMMV.",1672315164,1672315164,True,1,0,0.50354611873626709,0,True,False,False

Maybe I'm an odd duck here so maybe this will help others like me.

I never wanted to play guitar.  Ever.  I knew people who played as a kid and was sort of ""meh"".  Didn't care one bit.  Then I picked up Guitar Hero and my mind started to shift.  There was something about the feel of being up there  on stage I never knew I craved.  I was strumming a bar and pushing buttons with my left hand so, sure, it's not exactly playing guitar, but I must be working the same muscles and getting the timing down right?  So I ran out and bought a guitar and I picked at it for maybe 5 hours total.  Tab, and the idea of playing over the recording of the band just didn't work for me, and no, Guitar Hero did not prepare me at all for a real guitar.

Sometime later I heard about Rocksmith and thought I'd give it a try.  I wasn't hooked immediately, especially the pre-2014 version, but once it got it's hooks in, I was had!

I've recently thought (especially since Rocksmith+ is a steaming pile so far) ""would I still play guitar without Rocksmith"".  I guess the answer is yes, but not nearly as much.  Rocksmith is exactly what I need.  I didn't want theory, I wanted to learn the motions of guitar, the fingerings, the strumming.  I am not the type to learn 1000 different chords and scales by heart when I can't make my fingers play them.  I need to feel I'm making music and that's exactly what Rocksmith provides. 

It starts you off slow.  I remember hunting for the 3rd fret after the 5th fret.  How was I ever going to be able to change frets fast?  And string switching?  No way!  But, as it turns out.  Just playing along with a few songs and I'm MUCH better now.  I can tell the improvement, and, well, it's kinda awesome!  I'm sure my strumming technique is crappy.  Rocksmith doesn't do much to help with that honestly, and maybe I'm a little sloppier than I should be, but I can play songs I never dreamed I could play.   Not to mention, I learned that a lot of songs I had no interest in turned out to be the most fun to play, and some of my favorites to listen to aren't really that fun to play at all.

I spent hours on Train's ""Drops of Jupiter"" learning to switch strings on the B, G, and D strings, Of course the Black Key's ""Next Girl"" was the first song I got to 100% mastery, that was a rush!  Hey, I can actually play a real song all the way through on guitar!  I wonder what bass is like?   Did I mention I bought a bass?  Yeah, thank's to Rocksmith I now own 5 guitars and 2 basses.   On second thought, maybe don't buy Rocksmith, unless you can afford a new expensive hobby!

So yeah, this almost 50 year old who never cared about guitar before is hooked.  And you know what?  Now I'm actually interested in the theory and the scales and all, because I know enough now to care.  I'm ready for traditional lessons.  I know the basic major chords, minor chords, and power chords and can switch between them quickly and efficiently.  I can mute strings I'm not supposed to hear while playing chords so I can strum a little ""sloppy"".  I'm a guitar player.  Not a great one, maybe not even a good one, but one.  I'll never be one of those ""man, I wish I had learned theory earlier"" types, because I know if I had, I would never have gotten as far as I have.  I'm happy with my guitar journey and I owe it all to Rocksmith.  So yeah, maybe the tuner isn't that great and maybe it might miss a chord here or there, or give you credit for one you should have missed, but I don't care.

I should say, one of my favorite guitar YouTubers, The-Art-of-Guitar had an episode that really hit home with me (especially because the ""fake"" name he used was my name!).  He said he had a student who told him about Rocksmith so he asked the student to play a song and he just looked at him.  He'd been playing Rocksmith, but hadn't learned a song!  I'm kind of the same way.  You do tend to depend on the screen to tell you what to do.  I guess that's a problem, but not really for me.  If you want to memorize a song, do it!  I just like to bounce around and play what's fun.  I'm not getting on stage any time soon.  If I was, I could certainly memorize the song.  It's not that Rocksmith somehow prevents you, quite the opposite, there's a ""Mastery mode"" or something like that which will take the notes away if you get on a streak.

So yeah, for a guitar teacher, maybe Rocksmith is a nightmare.  Maybe it's doing everything wrong.  I can't tell you.  Again, all I can say is I would not be playing guitar right now if it weren't for Rocksmith, and I'll evangelize it to anyone who cares to listen (or can't get away fast enough!).

And here's a tip.  When you feel like you're getting something out of Rocksmith, get a splitter and run your guitar thorough an amp and to your PC.  It will really help you to identify poor technique.  I mean, sure you can turn up the guitar and turn down the band in Rocksmith, but I find this a little easier to separate, and this way I can still crank up the PC sound while my amp is just a little louder.  When I first did it, I heard a lot of noise that I needed to clean up in my playing.  Rocksmith was OK with it, but it sounded bad and I learned to clean it up by muting strings that shouldn't be ringing out.

Good luck.  I hope this review helps someone who might be on the fence about Rocksmith.  I've noticed some of the DLC has been getting pulled, I guess licenses are expiring, but if you have any interest in guitar, get this one over Rocksmith+.  That one wasn't ready a year ago in open beta, and it's not ready now either.  I'm rooting for it though, maybe it'll round into form eventually.",1672286312,1672286312,True,7,0,0.581749081611633301,0,True,False,False

Rocksmith+ does have an nice new updated UI and some training but outside of that it's absolute trash, it's has what has to be the worst music selection I've ever seen in any music game, I'm not even sure how it can have Rock in the title for that project as the majority of the music isn't even Rock let alone anything you've probably ever heard of or would ever want to learn to play on a guitar or bass to.

If this review isn't enough just Google some reviews on Rocksmith+ or read up on Reddit about it, it's pretty damn disgraceful. But here are a few points.

- Requires a subscription (for what I don't know, they haven't updated the library in over a year).
- None of the music that exists here for Rocksmith exists in Rocksmith+, none zero nothing.
- You wont be able to get into the modding scene with Rocksmith+ like you can here with Rocksmith 2014 which will open up just about every song you ever would want to play.

Anyways the point is grab this game while it's still available don't try and wait for sales as there wont be any as they are taking it down soon and all the music for it and replacing it Rocksmith+ trash that hasn't seen any updates in over a year or has anything of value for it's cost.",1671818639,1671818639,True,24,1,0.74213641881942749,0,True,False,False

Setup:
If you have the Real Tone cable, the setup is pretty much plug and play. Just plug it into your computer, then your guitar/bass, load up Rocksmith, and you're good to go. Most people recommend getting an Audio Interface (myself included), but it's definitely not needed. For those who do have an Audio Interface, it's going to take a bit more work to get it up and running, but nothing extremely difficult or annoying. Took me 5 minutes to get everything working with my Focusrite.

Gameplay:
The gameplay is pretty straightforward. It's basically just moving tablature (Similar to Ultimate-Guitar's moving tablature if that's even still a thing on there) with the official track playing in the background. It starts you off slow, with single notes for you to hit. The difficulty increases the better and better you get at the song, but you can adjust the difficulty by pressing Spacebar and cranking it up to 100. The Guitar-Cade is pretty cool since it teaches you all the scales you need to know through those mini-games, increasing the speed as you get better and better just like the songs in the ""Learn a Song"" section. For those who are looking to just noodle on the guitar, there is a jam section which lets you create your own jam band. There are many instruments to choose from, as well as allowing you to set it at a specific key, and style/genre, but it is limited to 3 instruments (not including your own). While it's a decent feature, I prefer (and recommend) noodling to jam tracks on YouTube. Overall, I'm very happy with the game, and it has definitely upped my playing a lot since purchasing it. 

Tips/Suggestions:

 • Don't solely rely on Rocksmith to teach you everything. If you're struggling with a song, look up the tabs on Ultimate-Guitar, a tutorial on YouTube, or a cover to see how it's played. There have been multiple times where I was struggling to learn a certain riff or solo, only to find out that the way I was trying to play it made it so much harder that it actually was. Rocksmith is a moving tablature game. Not a teacher. 

 • This one is optional, but I HIGHLY recommend going to a local shop and getting your guitar/bass Set-Up. They do a few things during a setup, but the most important parts they'll do is adjust the neck, and raise or lower the string height (The Action), as well as clean up your guitar (getting rid of all the gunk that's on your fretboard along with revitalizing the wood). I could go into so much detail as to why getting a proper Set-Up is beneficial, but TL;DR: Your guitar will look very clean, your strings won't go sharp or flat the higher you play on the fretboard (Which is very important. Especially with Rocksmith's note detection), and your instrument will be MUCH easier to play. In my honest opinion, it is definitely worth the money. 

 • As cliche and basic as this is going to sound, do NOT give up. I never in a million years would've thought that I'd be able to solo on ANYTHING....but with enough patience, practice, and consistency, I ended up going from a Rhythm Guitarist, Lead Guitarist, AND even a bassist to some degree.

I see others saying that you should know how to play to begin with this. That is absolutely not true. If you REALLY get into Rocksmith it does follow a course that will take you from the basics of finding the correct strings and how to hold a pick, to more advanced of learning cords. Don't try to jump right in and learn a song, Visit the Lessons, play the mini games and do the suggested tasks. These are the REAL tools of Rocksmith! That's where the teaching lies. The Learn A Songs are just the gravy on top.

With so many more hours on the clock later, I can tell you that it's still far better than whatever ""subscription"" model is coming for the future of Rocksmith.

Or at least it used to be, to and extent. With the release of Rocksmith+, Ubisoft has been intentionally breaking more and more parts of an already broken ""game"". Just getting the sound to work can take an hour, and even then it might not work, and once you finally get it to work there's no guarantee that it'll actually register that your bass or guitar is connected with their own specific Real Tone Cable.

It may say I've played for 11 hours at the time of writing this review, but in reality over half that has been spent starting and restarting (which is also insanely slow because it's built for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 loading times) and trying to get the output or input to work, or tuning the strings 5 times during a single song because it claims to be in tune and then misses half the notes.

First bought it on Xbox back in the day and spent hundreds on DLC. Bought it on PC after my friend showed me of a site where you can download custom DLC tabbed out by fellow fans and musicians. It was great because you can play guitar or bass, multiplayer support, and even have a microphone plugged in.

This custom DLC was great, it became the BEST part of the game and community driven. Some songs were done better than others but it gave people the opportunity to learn songs from their favorite artists that weren't on regular DLC. This worked for YEARS! 

Then Ubisoft decided they were not going to make a new Rocksmith in the same format that people loved and instead make a Rocksmith plus. It is a modest $20 CAD a month for less than 400 songs, no multiplayer support, and a terrible interface. I subscribed and unsubscribed within 10 minutes.

If you are regular with it, and leave it with the master difficulty (where it hides the notes) it can really be a good teacher. If you're like me and leave the notes on, I can generally pick up a song by sight-reading (like never before) but I struggle to remember it outside of the game.

While what they have here is nearly perfect. I would only hope for more scale exercises, to help memorize the scales. And some fretboard note training. Highly recommend investing in some equipment to split between the PC and your amp. They have exercise DLC, which I initially found to be helpful learning the game, but there just aren't everyday warmup options.

This can be finicky on PC. My old PC had issues for awhile, got them resolved through config tweaks and driver updates. Then it worked for a long time.

However, there are so many lessons and tutorials on youtube, you'd be better off starting there.
Learning new songs and techniques is very repetitive and I think it's easier and more efficient learning from tabs.
Rocksmith 'learn a song' has too much happening on the screen and appears way more complicated, confusing and hard to comprehend than it should be.
Some people probably like that, but IMO rocksmith is more focused on being guitar hero than making a game that can teach you songs quickly.

Rocksmith was unreliable and very outdated when I bought it early 2022, and it gets completely broken with the latest update (apparently) if you have costom DLCs. Updating with the latest CDLC enabler along with a reinstall fixed it for me. But the fact that ubisoft actively try to stop you from modding is number 89 on my list of reasons why ubisoft sucks.
If it wasn't for modding and custom songs, rocksmith would have been dead long ago.

Note detection has always been unreliable as well and at this point I can't think of a compelling reason to use rocksmith.

Buy this ASAP and all the DLC you like before Ubisoft intentionally bricks it and takes it off the market like the original Rocksmit, you can no longer get that.

So if you were ever interested in playing guitar... this is the game.... don't bother with Rocksmith+, it is not fun, it's not ready and they're is no content on there that would make it fun, remember it's a game not a guitar course... If I wanted that I'd pay an instructor and be bored.
I really do hope at some point they do have acceptable content and make it fun again, otherwise it's like taking a guitar course... very boring and no longer a game... they also took out all the games that helped you with muscle memory, the duck games and everything else were fun... there's nothing.
So get Rocksmith 2014 while it remains available and get the content while you can... DLC is rapidly being deleted from the steam, the original rockmisth is no longer available and it has some awesome songs that I love.

I still play for several hours every week, but it's not so much of a game for me as it is a tool to continue learning new songs and techniques to play them. I feel Rocksmith (RS) is a very real learning tool unlike Guitar Hero and the like. Sure, there are many other fun games out there to play, but other than simulators, when are you actually learning a real skill? I've put a lot of time into Rocksmith and at least I can say it's helped strengthen a skill I can walk away with.

As far as a review of the past 2000+ hours, I've loved almost every minute of it. I already knew how to read guitar tablature, so that made things much easier to transition into Rocksmith. The early learning curve was still somewhat slow, but now that my skills and experience have improved, I can't imagine a day that I won't be able to play it. I certainly can't imagine being forced to use Rocksmith+ as a replacement. The Customsforge user created DLCs are what really made the game special and the lack of it in Rocksmith+ was I think its death knell. 

I'd like to share a dissenting view from the common opinion that Ubisoft is trying to ruin the Rocksmith 2014 experience to push their Rocksmith+ subscription service. I myself, was livid when Rocksmith 2014 suddenly started crashing and immediately assumed Ubisoft had done something evil. Instead, Ubisoft had realized the problem and had a fix in only 8 hours. Not that they HAD to provide a fix, but they did anyways. You see, all the third-party RSMods and RS-ASIO dlls that allow them to work on RS depend on the RS software structure not changing. If it ever does, due to a software update for example, both RSMods and RS-ASIO need to be updated to work again with the new RS software changes. It's not really the job of Ubisoft to make sure those third-party software continue to work after RS updates, yet they understood there would be a problem and provided a solution through a beta update channel. Now I have a list of things that upset me about Ubisoft for another review, but what happened on Sept 2022 with their updates was not evil. They wanted a way to provide updates about disappearing DLCs so that we would have a chance to buy them before they disappear forever.  I can't tell you how much it hurt to know I would not be able to buy some DLCs when they were removed, so I would have welcomed the warnings and the updates they require. Sure, they'll probably push some other messaging we don't want to hear, but you can easily block Internet access to RS with Windows Firewall and never see them again. They may yet do something evil and find a way to break RS and if that happens I may update this review. I know I've tried taking precautions so that I can play this far into the future. 

Some last advice I would give is to make sure you have a decent sound system on your computer. I use the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 and it sounds great. Also I would recommend to learn how to split the guitar signal and send one to the game (physical splitter or RS-ASIO) and also send another to run your own guitar amp(s) and effect(s) for a real guitar sound. I overdid it by using an Axe FX which can send the guitar signal to RS via it's USB connection, but the guitar sound simulations are soo much better. Of course, you have to choose which amp and cabinet and effects to use on the Axe FX, but that's something we need to learn eventually as musicians anyways. It can also be done with a more inexpensive solution too. I used to use a Line 6 POD HD500X with a Lehle P-Split to accomplish the same before I got the Axe FX. The RS cable is fine though and if that's all I had I would still play just as much. Finally, I would recommend not getting stuck on any one song for too long. Find another, easier song to play. When that gets boring, try another song. There's more songs on Customsforge that I want to play than I'll ever get to. I have 3000+ songs I hope to play and even if I play 5 new songs every week, it would take me over a decade to get through them all. And every week there's new songs to play on Customsforge, so it's never ending fun until something comes out that is actually better than Rocksmith 2014 or it becomes broken or unsupported.

I think that's all. If you buy it, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Cheers!",1665111749,1665111749,True,22,0,0.742717921733856201,0,True,False,False

-While the mechanics is easily the best in the market the price of the game and songs is really an issue(mostly the DLCs because the base price is cheaper than any other learing tool for sure). 

-A problem with the game is the dependency of the real tone cable which let's be honest sucks ass, I personally use an Audio interface which I think is the best choice all around (RSASIO). Now that I mentioned DLCs and RSASIO is time to talk about the thing that everyone uses customs songs...Recently with the release on RS+ the whole thing became a mess due to the changes done to dll (If i'm not mistaken) but now a days it's fixed thanks to the modding community. Customs are the best way to play this game if you don't have money for the DLCs which I do mostly and when I really want a song I buy it on discount. 

-As someone who has been studying music since 2015 and It's now trying to get the Instrumentalist title at university I can say that this game is an excellent tool, Not as a learning tool don't confuse it. While the mechanics while help you improve fast in many areas if you are like me an experienced player who wants a good reason to learn songs and also keep studying RS is perfect, but for someone that wants to learn for the first time or it's just starting... it's going to be hard let me tell you that. No way you are learning that fast in 60 days. 

- The guitar arcade is an excellent feature and I wished it was kept in RS+ you learn a lot without noticing that's something that RS excells at. Session mode is fun, Tuner is okish and creating a tune set up is a great feature to play around and do new stuff with.

All around RS2014 is amazing and I will pick up before Ubisoft kills it off by forcing you to buy RS+( Don't be fucking braindead Ubisoft no one liked RS+ it's a broken mess and there's no point on it existing when 2014 exists just make a 2022 updated version and be done with it).

Another Episode of Ubisoft and its absolute greed coupled with a big fat f*ck you to anyone who paid for this game.
They've intentionally broken the game with an update in order to FORCE you to pay for their ad ridden subscription version.

Ubisoft, take your greed and strangle your self with it.

Below was my original review before these f*ckwits decided to screw us over


I was a complete Novice and i seriously mean NOVICE, I had never touched a guitar before in my life. I have however always wanted to learn the Guitar, but in my local area, prices for tutors are absolutely ridiculous, plus the queue to get even on a list. I found this game/programme, Bought a guitar and the cable and took the drive in to learning how to play. 
I am NOT going to lie, it was super frustrating at first, i not only had to learn everything there is to learn with guitar, such as Chords, harmonics, fret position, Numbers and locations, which string to plug and try not to hit everything around it, Tuning.. etc etc. oh and not to mention learning which colour in RockSmith denotes which string to hit, plus the various symbols... It was a hard road to travel in the beginning, full of blood sweat and tears, But at the time of writing this review i have 64 hours of pure guitar practice (I've not practised anything other than on this game) and i'm now Nailing up to 70% of track on 100% speed and still increasing. to think i was close to giving up at the very beginning. I'm so glad i stuck with it. 
I look forward to seeing how much more i can progress with guitar. 
if you're looking to learn guitar, this is the programme for you, just don't let frustration kill your enthusiasm.",1606397520,1663769144,False,0,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Original, now tainted review below.
...........................................................

After playing this on consoles I picked it up on Steam for one reason.

The Guitarcade.

RS'14, as much as it wants you to believe it, is not a teacher, is not a replacement for a teacher, and will never be a teacher, while it's Lessons can be informative to the freshest of beginners the examples given in the lessons (placement of notes, what strings to play said note) can be very damaging to someone forming ""new habits"".

What it is to me is a practice tool, if you have the basics of holding your guitar, fretting a few notes, or even a few chords, then Rocksmith 2014 is a great tool to help refine and poilish those a bit more, in an environment you are %100 comfortable in (IE; your own home!).

Want to get the hang of shifting along the board? Fire up the Duck shooting minigame for 10-20 minutes a day.
Want to speed up your Tremolo? Jump into the Hurdles event!
Want to polish up your chords a little? Storm the castle and kill zombies, or fly through space blasting ships into oblivion!
Bends? Temple of Bends will get you practicing your half-step and whole-step bends on a way you can see!
Wanna run some Scales? Scale Racer has you covered there as you weave through traffic in an addictive way to remember scale patterns!

It's not all rosey however!

While this software can be a very, very useful tool, it gives no insight into ""Music"".

There is absolutely no theory to learn from here, if you want to know what makes a chord, a chord... Rocksmith isn't gonna help you there.

Want to learn notation? there's none to be had here which I think is this softwares biggest crime.

This is for someone who owns/has owned a Guitar for a while, and is comfortable enough to use it, for the absolute beginner there are some pretty big pitfalls and chances to develop bad/hurtful habits if using RS and RS alone as a teaching aid.

My biggest gripe is it's community, the UBI forums are filled by 3-5 people farming post counts, being down right rude, and giving bad/lazy information to people asking for it.

This is a community of Gamers who own Guitars, not Guitarists who play Games.

The DLC can be a touchy subject.

Be it via pricing differences between platforms/Regions being seemingly random. to DLC plain out not showing.

You will be also advertised original Rocksmith DLC inside the in-game store, (As it IS compatible with RS'14) yet Steam will not let you access it without owning the first game, this is apparently being looked at, but don't hold your breath it seems as they are focused only on the new consoles and their own store problems, The other formats don't even seem to be on the radar anymore.

While I do recommend this product entirely, I do not recommend it as a Teaching aide, I recommend it as a Practice aide and urge anyone wanting it to check out reviews and videos from Users before running out to buy a new Guitar.",1425170983,1663298182,False,0,0,0.460947513580322266,0,True,False,False

Ill say this ahead of time to save everyone time. Rocksmith+CDLC is an amazing game. Its fun for learning some songs or just messing around on the guitar/bass.

I've enjoyed over one thousand hours of play time with this Rocksmith 2014, but I REFUSE to EVER buy Rocksmith + as long as it is a ""monthly pay to play"" game, Also note, many of the songs are NOT even available for Rocksmith +. 

(Will players have to REPURCHASE the same songs that they purchased on Rocksmith 2014 in order to play them? Will we get refunded for DLC content if Rocksmith 2014 is pulled from Steam?)

Since the latest update, it has crashed the game and players now have to revert to a previous version of Rocksmith 2014 in order to enjoy the content that has been around for YEARS.

I was generally excited to have a new evolution of Rocksmith come out, and maybe have online play with your friends, (big innovation and wishes on my part, I know) but there is nothing new here and is only inferior to what already exists.

I will be watching closely to see if Ubisoft corrects this, but until any corrective action is announced, STAY AWAY FROM ROCKSMITH +

He also got some CDLC as well. 
The game is a 6 year old remaster for crying out loud!

I literally recommended this game yesterday. 
I was looking forward to RS+ like everyone else. 
UBI Soft Ghosted the community when we told them this ain't it and what was wrong (accessibility improvements, note highway readability , de-saturated and hard to read notes, uninspired unlockables, lacking in song progression feedback) RS+ took many steps back (Removing Multiplayer, quantity over quality song selection, guitar practice mini games) in making you feel like a Rocksmith. 

Rocksmith 2014 was a perfect combination with only 1 flaw, Being made by a company that cant put their coke bottle glasses on and realize that the only reason RS+ was worth making was because of the good will they had from RS and RS 2014 with as they quoted 5 million copies sold and all they had to do to keep the ball rolling was not fuck up the good will they had. 

As of 9/11/2022, they subsequently shit the bed by making a watered down subscription heavy marketing-less corpse of a product in RS+ and Patched RS 2014 which breaks CDLC. 
RS+ isn't even on steam so the whole need to do this was just push people to RS+ because they had little to no budget to do so any other way. to then also go hey why not fix a non issue while they were at it on RS2014 was a slap in the face, we all know why you did it and to the Dev or PO person who put the justincaseweneedit option to give us some time to figure it out.

I thank you because, you knew this was shit there's no way you didn't know this was shit. 
I'm sure all the dev's knew this was going to be a bad deal and the people up top shut down any one at the bottom who gave a shit.

CDLC didn't even allow you to buy songs charted by UBIsoft. They made sure to keep themselves separate. think about that.

The first Rocksmith was a little better in overall terms of presentation but there's some great improvements here too, and there's actually some great song selections as well.

That being said, of course Ubisoft made it nigh impossible to play without having to log in to your Uplay account, and the Uplay system (now just called Ubisoft account apparently) is absolutely fucked beyond any usability - even a single, regular logon using a wrong passeord via the site results in getting blocked for an unknown time for ""multiple login attempts"". No timer, no option to email to confirm it's actually me trying to log in, nothing.
Aside from that, changing the settings like resolution changes more often make the game unresponsive and/or crash, having me play it in 720 like a fucking chump since it's impossible to alter this setting. Oddly enough it also starts lagging more whilst playing - it's snappy at the first song - which is also something the first Rocksmith did well.

My advice - stay away from this Ubisoft garbage fire and get the first game. Let's hope someone makes a similar type of game because this ain't it chief.

If you are looking for a game to help casually play songs along with, or learn simpler, easier songs you could learn on your own, this is a great program for that. It is not the best learning platform, at least in my opinion. I'm a self taught guitarist (classically trained in other instruments) and I didn't find this great for learning many new things, but it was a huge part of my ability to lay back and just enjoy playing the guitar.

Have a guitar or bass lying around? able to get the rocksmith cable somehow? buy this!

Pros (and possiblly cons):
If you are dedicated, you may end up spending lots of $$$ on DLC's, equipment, joining a band, and get good enough to perform on a real stage, I have first hand knowledge.

Cons:
I miss some of the progressive steps getting better venues and stuff in the original rocksmith, 2014 is much better techically, but less of a ""game"" with rewards, like the first Rocksmith.


They are still producing weekly DLC's after years of the initial release, some of you may not find your absolute favourite band, but the team are extremely dedicated to do anything in their powers to get the most wanted songs in the library.

Edit after release of rocksmith+ sept 2022 : 

Please, please buy rocksmith 2014 instead of rocksmith+ unless;
1. you love to try out 5000+ unknown latino songs no one really have heard of, and a couple of Alice Cooper songs you probably never heard of. 
2. you want to throw your instrument through the window like a rockstar in frustration instead of wanting to master it like a pro

Currently, as of september 2022, 1800 hours playtime,  rocksmith 2014 is the most fun game to learn bass and guitar, with good game mechanics, and access to truly a huge library of superb songs! recommended from an bass apprentice that probably have not beeen able to release 4 singles and a good quality music video withouth rocksmith 2014.

I'm officially done with Ubisoft because of this. This was a great gateway to learning guitar and even the CDLC made it possible to learn songs that aren't even apart of the + library.

you can combine this with free courses online(you can start free with Justin or the guitarist of Avenged Sevenfold) or a  teacher (seek a teacher do you like, study with someone you don't like or doesn't put love for music in the teaching its dangerous for you)...

Know lots of chords but there are even more I don't know. I've never been in a proper band, but I've played with a few. I've long been aware of techniques that I don't know and bad habits that I have when I play. I used to play every single day for at least 15 minutes and with each passing year, I pick up my guitar less and less. In short, I'm a very average guitarist. 

This game is genuinely excellent and also genuinely difficult. I'm finding it very fun to play, even in the beginning for each song when what I play is extremely simple. On the other hand, the closer I get to playing the actual rift the fast I get completely lost. One of the first songs I played in game was Knights of Cydonia - a song I already knew how to play and am competent at. Following the onscreen guide is very challenging for me. However, I can already feel myself improving. I think if I stick with this game, there will come a time, just like Guitar Hero, when I can ""read"" complicated music in-game. Getting there will take deliberate practice and patience.

Browsing by song does not work at all, wont let me scroll or select any song. On top of that in the ""Song Packs"" section of the store it only lists a very small fraction of the content available. You can buy the DLC off of the steam page and I haven't tried to do that yet, so it might not be that big of a deal. Getting to browse/ preview the song in game is much more convenient then having the exit the game and non-the-less it's defiantly bugged out in game for me.

The challenge pays off with time and persistence and the software will inform you of your progress in the form of stats and achievements.

In my humble opinion, Rocksmith is a better learning tool than a metronome in that you get to play along with the other elements of each band or artist in the studio track. Your contribution, as you progress, is the completion and polished sound of the track as you know it from the album or the radio you first heard it on. 

This is not to discount traditional music theory or quality in-person guitar or bass guitar lessons, not to mention professional instrument set-ups. This fills a different void that musicians might not know that they have. Think of it as a sort of karaoke of instruments.

I was far from a newbie when I came to Rocksmith in 2019, so can't necessarily comment too much on the experience of learning from it as a beginner, but it was an absolute godsend during the Covid lockdowns.

I'd recommend buying this version rather than the upcoming Rocksmith+, as I'd rather own this game outright and all the dlc I' ve bought rather than the monthly subscription where you lose access to all your songs nce you stop paying (I believe that's how it's going to work).  There's also a tonne of free CDLC available (plenty of which is brilliant and right on the money re: arrangements and tones, some is just good/ok and a little bit is right off, but hey, it's free and user generated and a great way to tune your ear and chops when you disagree with the arrangement)

I disagree with the game's claim that Rocksmith will teach you how to play guitar. I progressed much more quickly with help from a guitar instructor. I wish I had found a good guitar instructor five years earlier than I did and then found Rocksmith six months after that. For me Rocksmith is an excellent practice tool for learning & playing songs and some of the guitarcade games are good for drilling certain things into muscle memory (String Skip Saloon really helped my playing get cleaner). I use Rocksmith for some practice but also practice outside of the game.

There are some drawbacks. If the following are not deal-breakers then I'd say this game is for you.
- Probably won't teach you how to play guitar without outside help from an instructor or skilled friends.
- The Real Tone Cable costs more than the game where I live.
- You can probably use your audio interface instead of the Real Tone Cable if you have one but be prepared to do some tinkering.

If you've decided to go ahead with Rocksmith make sure to do the following to maximise note detection in the game and minimise frustration:
- Set up your guitar if it hasn't been done already. If the intonation is off then when you play strings at higher frets the notes are slightly sharp or flat and the game won't detect it properly and you'll get frustrated because you are actually playing the song as you should be.
- Check volume and tone knobs on your guitar. Volume should be high and tone should be clean.
- Run the configuration from the tools. I find I have to do this more than expected, almost every play session.
- Tune.

It gameifies the whole process of learning songs up to the most precise level. It's pretty neat how it grades your preformences objectively so you can always measure even very gradual progress in an encouraging way. It's quite a bit like it's spiritual antedendents, Guitar Hero and similiarly styled rhythm games. Rocksmith does a pretty impressive job of incorporating a real audio signal to interperet the basic nuances of playing guitar.
I could give a couple comments, not even gripes about the main game, but side features:
1) The little technique builder mini-games are absolute wastes of space. Whatever small amount of time of energy the developers put into them was way way too much. Skip. Just skip.
2) The jam-a-long thing could be better. It actually sounds and works pretty well for what it does and using the broad parameters and instrumentation options given. But way not customized chord progressions or assignable song sections? It seems like they've already done the difficult part, those would be seemingly easy additions that would go a huge way for user experience.
) I have mixed feelings about the DLC songs. I love that they have made a whole bunch more songs, and I appretiate the fact that it takes a certain cost in licesening, transcription, programming for each song so the have to make it back, but I've bought as ton of these. So I guess it's working as planned. Keep them coming. (I'm sure no more are coming, since it's 2022)",1655061278,1655061278,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Rocksmith takes out all the 'administrative' tasks in learning and allows you to just play guitar at your own pace.
Also works surprisingly well honestly, picks up tones quite accurately but with enough leeway so even a beginner can still have some fun without transforming into jimi hendrix first lol

I found it to be frustrating (as learning an instrument always is) but to be rewarding much faster than any other typical guitar method. I started with the dynamic difficulty on, playing one note at a time in songs, which was a great introduction because starting off trying to play a song on a new instrument that isn't a nursery rhyme will be incredibly daunting at first.

Early experience: Playing a guitar was completely foreign to me, but I was able to pick up on reading flashing notes on a game highway from my experience with Guitar Hero. The game starts you off with 25+ songs to play , so you have a good variety to develop you're playing method, plus you have the option to purchase thousands of additional songs within the game to add to your collection. I started playing through these songs, using the in-game lessons (which were incredibly frustrating but good for getting to know what bends, hammer-ons , pull-offs , etc look like being played on a guitar), and delved into the arcade style games (A fun way to practice an individual method, such as string skipping, chords, scales, slides etc.) The bend tutorial in particular was my most frustrating experience; I pent 4 hours trying to get the bends down, gave up, and the next day, it was effortless for me. After a month I began sight reading requests for viewers on my Twitch stream, still using a modified dynamic difficulty. I found out about Customs Forge , which contains thousands more songs to play custom created by other players of the game, that were not available in the main game, which was really amazing. 

Mid Experience: I really enjoyed the emulated bass function using the guitar; it really helped me get the feel of whether I wanted to play bass, and I ended up getting a bass for myself (well my fiance at the time generously bought it for me). I stopped using dynamic difficulty after about a month, but I used the Riff Repeater function within the game to repeat individual phrases of songs, and slow them down to play them perfectly and learn them. For some phrases I wasn't quite sure about, I did reference Youtube to see how it was played. Not only have I been able to learn to play guitar and bass decently, but I also found an amazing Rocksmith community on Twitch thanks to this game, and I found the current love of my life.

Current Experience (2022) - I still stream and play requests now and again, and I have noticed that it has become way more fluent for me to sight read, and actually play notes that sound good. I still reference Youtube on certain methods like tap , or slap, but overall the game is really the only thing that has kept me so engaged in playing guitar so long. I am now engaged to the love of my life thanks to Twitch and Rocksmith 2014, and am just waiting to get married to him in the U.S. I feel way more confident in my playing, and have been learning to play Carry On My Wayward Son by kansas, which is still really tricky for me , but after several hours I am getting it. I highly recommend this game for beginners , or anyone that has trouble sticking to playing guitar without a game.

HELPFUL TIPS:
1) GO TO CUSTOMSFORGE - Access songs not normally available in the game for FREE!
2) Spend atleast 15 minutes a day just to keep a habit
3) Real Tone Cable is available on Amazon for roughly $20 , this is what connects your guitar to the game
4) Consider Inverted Strings setting EARLY ON if you find it easier to read TAB style
5) When using Riff Repeater DISABLE the rewind animation , this will save precious seconds of your time!

TLDR: Make sure you read the tips above! This is a very helpful tool for learning guitar, and keeping you engaged with guitar! I have been playing for 3 years and this game is definitely the reason I have been able to keep playing that long, and be confident playing guitar and bass. It's helpful and a ton of fun!

It may not be the most accurate thing as far as reading when you've correctly hit notes. 
But I will say this. I've still learned songs. As well as have a lot of fun doing it.
I've gone from barely being able to play X-Kid by Green Day.
I can 'comfortably' play The Trooper by Iron Maiden. I still have difficulties with certain songs that require more back and forth from string to string as well as chords. If I keep at it and keep challenging myself at appropriate levels. I can see myself picking this up and enjoying it for the rest of my life. 

On a side note I have looked up bassist lesson videos as well. Bryan Beller(Ghost Player for Dethklok's Murderface) has some very useful tips for hard and quick strumming. 

Hopefully this review inspires some folks to pick up the game and try it out. If music is a big part of your life then I highly suggest it. You'll gain a new viewpoint and have more respect for the legends.

Update: Now able to play Avenged Sevenfold songs comfortably.

A few things regarding my experience:
I have played 6 string and bass guitars for 15+ years, I play this game primarily to learn new songs on bass. I find that the bass parts seem to fit the design of the game better than the guitar parts, but maybe that's just me.

Works fine without the realtone cable. Needed no drivers or mods to get my M-Audio M-track Duo audio interface to work with the game straight away. However, this was using the ""microphone"" as the input and you don't get to hear your guitar through the game. To circumvent this, I installed ""RS ASIO"" drivers mod from github. Was not very difficult to do, and I could then select the realtone cable method and my guitar works perfectly with sound output through the game and I can use the Rocksmith effects.

But I gave it a punt because it looked fun and sounded ok.

It's more than ok. Don't get me wrong, it's not perfect, but I went from not playing a note to feeling like I'm getting there pretty fast. It's not the 90 days or whatever that they claim, it took me 2... 3... 4... times that long to get to the point I can play something through recognisably (mostly).
It might have taken longer than they claimed. A lot longer. The thing is though, I had fun doing it.
Sure there were times I felt like I sucked and was never gonna get better but a bit of practice goes a long way (and I really don't practice anywhere near as much as I should so ymmv) and as long as I kept going back and trying again I made progress.

So on to what to expect: It'll take you from plinking away one note at a time (or less if that's your speed) to playing stuff you never thought you could.
But maybe that's overdramatic since there's some pretty vital theory they overlook so unless you're just naturally gifted and can ""feel"" the music without that then there's going to be something missing from the learning. Look out for Rocksmith 2 coming soon(TM).
That said, if you're learning it anyway this will be a great practice tool come to think of it, you lot should totally get it.
So what else.. There are ""Arcade"" games that act as generic practice sessions for things like ""hitting strings consistently"", ""Playing chords and changing between them quickly"", ""doing some slides/bends/etc"", ""playing notes from different scales"" and so on.
They're... ok. They're mildly diverting but I never liked them, they throw you too quickly into a ""Game Over"" screen for my liking whilst songs never fail you.

Gods this is a horrible ramble, sorry to everyone who made it this far.

So anyway, where was I? Ah yes... So it has ""AI assisted progression"" or something like that. Just means it'll adapt to you, and it does, pretty well in fact although it does seem to have ""break points"" where it'll go from ""you're nailing this!"" to ""what the hell, my fingers aren't doing what I tell them"" in about 5 seconds.
The good news is that after a bit it goes back again but generally take that to mean ""you should slow down and practice this bit""

The only bad thing is that there's so much DLC and let's be honest, it's the DLC stuff we want to play most of the time. You can at least get a 40% discount in the sales though but I guess in this respect it's no worse than The Sims.

TL; DR: Good game, lacks theory, can play even if you've never touched a guitar before, DLC costs $$$ but wait for sales, RealTone cable is annoying but Reddit exists.

The initial song list can seem a bit lack luster for the type of music I like playing, so if you are in the same boat, wait for DLC to go on sale and buy some song packs that you like.

I also use an audio interface and the nocable software so I can play through my Behringer UMC204HD. There is a step-by-step guide online to use the audio interface so you do not have to buy a rocksmith cable. If you are using an audio interface that allows you to hear your guitar feedback through your headphones/speakers/etc. I strongly suggest turning down the guitar volume in the games settings.

Is it a learning tool? eh , if you do other things in it besides playing songs. I've only done the learning songs part , and I've done the nonstop play part. Thats it. What it excels in is getting you over the rough hurdle of the painful fingers , building calluses and playing the same scales over and over. Its fun , with custom DLC , its even more fun. I've got over 500 songs in my song list. What I feel I have made progress on in the last couple years is cleaner notes , cleaner transitions from note to note, fret awareness , and i am now doing passages that even 4 months ago I thought were very very rough , with relative ease. I make mistake a lot still , but i got over 90 percent on the majority of all the songs i play. I put in about 1 to 2 hours a night , every night , maybe one day or two off a week. I try to pick up 10 to 15 songs a week now. I see a small jump in my performance about once a month. This game is designed to make playing music fun. If I sat down and played a certain passage over and over and broke songs down into pieces , I could progress much quicker but I just play , start to finish. If you mix in other alternative learning tools like Yousician or Fenders online courses or Scotts bass lessons , you can improve much faster and have more knowledge of music from a theory perspective but if you wanna play and have fun doing it , this is the tool. I use 5 different basses , Sterling ray 34 , fender player plus active , ibanez 800 Multiscale , Ibanez 300 series gio , and a ibanez btb 5 string 805. I use a katana 210 bass amp , Ampeq 100 watt , and fender rumble 100. I run a mono splitter to the amp and the usb tone cable to the PC. I jack the splitter into the bass. I run Edifier desktop speakers in a 2.1 design with a sub. I turn the volumn in the game of the bass to nothing , and i crank up my bass amp and i crank up the desktop speakers and I jam.

This doesn't make it perfect by any means, unfortunately. There are issues with the PC and Console versions of this program that make it difficult to work with at first. 
Pros: This program can actually teach you how to play guitar/bass. The community who understand how to set up this program are incredible and will help you as long as you are kind to them. 
There are over 1,500 pieces of DLC, the majority are songs and song packs at decent enough prices*. 
The program has a lot of useful video tutorials with great information for first time guitarists and bassists. 
*Try to look for content when it's on sale because it's very worthwhile at the discounted prices.*
Cons: Note recognition isn't the same across all guitars. I would recommend passive or active humbucker pickups in your guitar of choice over single coil pickups. 
It's difficult for first time users to sight read, the whole basis of the program to begin with. Think of this program as using interactive tabulature instead of a game. 
The Guitarcade is a pain to work with when Note Recognition needs work. Since the games include scale and chord exercises, techniques such as string skipping and dynamic picking, and various other exercises, it can become very frustrating when the program does not pick up the input as accurately as it wants to.

This sucks but it is what it is. Thanks YouTube for answering my questions about this! If you have the same questions about recording and streaming RS, search it up on the internet and you'll find your answers there. (;

Pros:
• Very educational, especially by learning songs
• Guitar Hero, but with a *real* guitar
• Many, many songs (more on RS+, but idk about that tbh)
• You can even learn to play the instrument, like shifting, slides etc.

Cons:
• A lot of the DLC is paid, but a lot of it is great!
• Not *every* known song is available, sorry Nirvana, or even Linkin Park fans... You'll have to wait until RS+ comes
• A lot, if not, all songs are censored, with Longview having one s word or two uncensored, and vice versa.

for starters you cant just automaticly play. you need a specific cable that in my experience is fragile and its not just any old guitar to usb cable. its specific.i believe i paid $40 for the cable alone when i first got the game
What this game is in my opinion is a different version of guitar hero or rockband. What the advertisements and all seem to suggest is that it can teach to you play the guitar or bass by just playing songs. of course you can learn to play some but at the same time it takes more then just playing ""smoke on the water"" over and over to learn the instrument.
was it fun? absolutely!
if you mod it its even more fun!

If you are having issues with missed notes, try picking continuously when tuning rather than letting the notes ring out.

The adaptive difficulty system is genius, because it prevents the game from becoming too difficult too quickly. If you're having trouble with a song, the game won't increase the difficulty until you get it. The riff repeater is a great practice tool since you can activate it at any point during the song. There's also no pass/fail system like in other rhythm games; you won't get kicked out of a song if you can't play the solo yet. The lessons in the game are okay. They're enough to get you started, but they can move a little quickly (not explain the technique enough before going ""Okay, you try it!"").

Firstly if you have an audio interface you want https://github.com/mdias/rs_asio rather than messing around with getting a proprietary cable. There's a list of tested interfaces on the page.

Secondly by default the UI seems to have the strings mirrored. The lowest pitch string being at the top, as it is when holding the guitar. While this may sound reasonable to someone whose completely new to the instrument it means it is upside down compared to ""tab"" notation so I recommend finding the setting to flip that to match tab notation as if you already read tabs it is a brain f**k and if you don't you're going to make it harder for yourself to read tabs.

I'd also recommend turning on ""master"" mode and then using spacebar to open up the tool to slow things down rather than use the adaptive difficulty.

STEP 1
Before you launch the game, download RS2014-Mod-Installer
Run the app - Click to use mods - RS_ASIO Settings Tab - On the right under Config, Check the options: Use WASAPI Output, Use WASAPI Input, Use ASIO
It should save the settings on its own.

Next, run the game.

STEP 2
In the Main Menu, go to Tools - Options - Audio Settings - Audio Exclusivity: OFF
Note: When you turn this option off, a message will popup on game startup saying it can cause inconsistencies. Just hit Enter.

STEP 3
To get rid of the crackling/popping audio, go to Steam\steamapps\common\Rocksmith2014
Double-click Rocksmith.ini
Set this option as seen: Win32UltraLowLatencyMode=1
Save/Close

FINAL STEP
In the game menu,
Path/Input - Make sure input is on MICROPHONE - then below that, Available Inputs - Click 'Real Tone Cable' (Mine Shows 2. The bottom one works for me.)
Note: I have to change the Path/Input to Microphone EVERY time I open the game - but it works.
You should be able to hear your guitar input at the main menu now.

I hope this helps someone out there! Sorry if it does not.
But i tried EVERY workaround I could find online, and none of them did the trick. I was about to pull my hair out.

Also, I tried the option with plugging my guitar into an audio interface (before i bought my realtone cable) and it was super distorted to the point where the game couldn't calibrate, and I couldn't tune the guitar to save my life. It also sounded horrible during gameplay.

Again, I really hope this helps someone. This is an amazing game once everything works properly.

Great tool for absolute beginners in case of guiding and exploring the neck.  It does _not_ replace a teacher showing proper arm/hand/shoulder/back placement. I suggest using it in combination - otherwise later on you might have to unlearn some bad habits.

Nice learning cruch and motivational piece for intermediate of those kind of players struggling to get to the next level. Lots of genres with different inherent techniques

Pros:
For all seasoned and (technically) well equipped guitar players...this is just a jam session with tonally close sounds to the originals*.

You can actually find tabs for all of this online if you care. 

If you want to have a band playing with you, use this.

I never thought I'd be so committed to learning bass, but yet here I am.

Rocksmith on its own is a great experience, and on this platform isn't too expensive to get a long, worthwhile experience. 

However, Rocksmith can also be a valuable tool. Whether that be learning songs or actually learning to play an instrument. It has the ability, it's just up the user to find it. I never took a lesson once while teaching myself. I now find myself wanting to learn with an instructor and maybe performing in the future.

Having been involved in music for well over a majority of my life now, picking up a new instrument is always a breathe of fresh air. When words can't do it, music can speak volumes on how a person is feeling, and I've been missing that for a long time.

If you have some old guitar that's picking up dust, and have the time to put aside to learn something new, go for it. And if you do make the delve, look into the modding community to get even more time out of Rocksmith.

If you are a bit of a guitar player however and have an audio interface, this might really be the most fun, creative and encouraging piece of software that you can get and should not miss

Got it to work nicely with my existing audio interface without any silly additional cable. It definatly works great, but there are two main gripes:

I definatly do not reccomend it as your first or only way to learn guitar. It doesn't reward or encourage very important things like speeding the song down. It does however detect poor technique as correct in songs, and the tuner is way too imprecise. Trying to learn the instrument istelf this way from scratch i feel would only ecnourage poor technique and lead to loads of frustration - Especially with the marketing specifically saying that this is the easy way to learn guitar. It is not. In reality the easiest way is the way everybody does it, by having someone to show you stuff and learning the theory behind it really well and really slowing things down. Everything in this game seems to highly encourage you to not do those things, but instead only encourages you with high scores and flashy visuals when you play songs, and those at 100% speed. I don't get it, that must have to be the worst way to learn stuff. Theory stuff is there, but with real boring videos - youtube offers some better quality and more fun teachers for beginners. I can guarantee that i would have gotten frustrated quickly and quit guitar alltogether after believing that even ""the easy way"" doesn't work for me. 

The other thing is ending the software. Just have a normal quit button somewhere FFS....  

This is not a reson to not get the game, but it is extremly annoying, every time - you always have to go through all the menus and logos to quit, ALT+F4ing just freezes my audio drivers so there isn't even a way around it

With that out of the way, i have to say i am quite amazed how much this software offers for players. Not only songs but extremly fun games that encourage to play. The way of learning songs is fun, and makes sense for some songs. I personally usually put the Difficulty to 100% and the Speed way down to learn a song - and then speed up gradually. The software does give you easy to access tools to go any approach you feel works for you, wich is fantastic! There are definatly quite a few songs already i never would have learned if it wasn't for Rocksmith.

All in all it's a pretty great game.  If you want to learn guitar it's a nice stepping stone, I had been playing for 12 years before picking this up.  I use it mainly to learn new songs and play along with a backing track since currently I don't have an amp.  If you get this you'll notice you need to spend an arm and a leg getting all the DLC.  Luckily there are other means getting the songs you want (sales) also CDLC where users have created custom tracks to play along with songs not included in the game.

To play the game it will say you need a real tone cable but forget that.  I have an audio interface set up and you can too with an easy to follow guide online.  The guitar lessons are alright but are better as there are practice tracks that go with them.  What makes this game great is the ability to slowly progress at a song until you're comfortable playing the entire thing with the way it was written.

The riff repeater is great to learn the harder and faster sections by reducing the speed, with a setting to increase the speed gradually if you hit all the notes.

The lessons are basic but good for beginners. The arcade games are a tad repetitive, though the practice of the techniques can really help you improve your skills. Session mode is nice for some improv sessions, albeit there's not really that many options to play different things.

Of course, most of the content are on DLCs, so it can get expensive to get all the songs you want. I recommend wait for sales, as those happen from time to time.

PROS
helps you learn the fret placement
teaches you the basics of notes
good old music(not like to days stool thats on the radio)
has an amp room (you set up the and so forth and just play on)
helps you get a girlfriend later on in life
teaches you how to play the guitar on YOUR time not a teachers time

CONS
TRUE TONE CABLE NEEDED!!!!!!!!!!
A GUITAR (dah)
some of the guitarcade games or f-ing hard, or i suck. . .
Limited list of stock songs
steep learning curve if you have never held a guitar before

Neutral
theres no recording function for the amp ""room"", or one that i have found
decent graphics
the lessons are hard to find if you dont know that they are actuly the ""Test your skill"" section

A cable straight from the microphone input on the computer to the guitar, tried line in, headphone jack on clean amplifier, USB out on clean amp, a microphone into the computers mic jack, and a mic into line in, multiple guitars, multiple amps and pedals with headphone jacks, and a myriad of volume adjustments because maybe it's clipping.

The game recognizes that there's a level to the input, but no matter what the tuner that it forces you to use will say ""loosen your string!"" from E down to string is hanging off of the guitar from being so loose. On top of that, playing in disconnect mode the audio from the game itself is choppy and every 5 seconds goes blank for a second. It also instructed that Blitzkrieg Bob is a 2 note song.

1. If you alt-tab out, you can't get back in without restarting the application.
2. It takes up the full screen but doesn't offer an option for me to quit the game (unless it was off screen for some reason), requiring that I alt-tab and quit the application.
3. The game ignores your system volume except for mute. Basically, it decides your volume and it plays at that volume regardless of whether your Windows volume is at 100% or 2%. It only shuts up when you bring the Windows volume down to 0%.
4. Calibration is a pain, you have to turn the gain up high enough to basically max out the signal without clipping, and then mute your strings for the low bound. After a few tries I got this to work, but I couldn't keep my strings muted because it was ""too quiet"" according to the game. Great, so the zero point for the signal can't be near zero?
5. Tuning. This is actually the point at which I requested a refund from Steam. I have several electronic tuners laying around, plus a couple of phone apps for the purpose. My guitar is in tune. But when it asked me to tune my low E string first, it said it was WAY off (the meter said ""+999"" and I needed to get it down to ""0""). Just to see what it would do I started loosening the string until it was down in the C range and it STILL said it was tuned way too high. So I got out my tuner, retuned the low E, and tried again. +999. I alt-tabbed out and quit from the taskbar since there was no option to quit the game, and requested my refund.

After several months of fighting with this software, I finally was able to get it working on my system. I will leave my original review up so that folks can see the issues that I was having.  Turns out that in my case RS did not like two different graphics cards.  I am happy to say however that it works flawlessly now, and with a few tweaks such as RSAsio, I am having no issues whatsoever.


Original Revew
I unfortunately, cannot in good conscience recommend this product.  Yes it is (at the time of writing) over 6 years old and for software that makes it virtually a dinosaur.  The issues that I have had with Rocksmith revolve around non-stop refusal to run on my computer system no matter what I try.  The screen goes white and then crashes back to the desktop.

Technical support has thus far been unable to help me in solving the issues nor has countless hours of forum surfing managed to alleviate the problem.  I can get it to run on my girlfriend's computer but my audio interface is attached to my PC not hers.  I don't see the point in  A) spending $30 for a cable when I have superior equipment, and B) having to constantly having to move that equipment around so that I can use her system when I have a better system to use.  

It's unfortunate too.  I want to be able to use the program not only for myself as a learning tool but to be able to teach my daughter guitar as well.  Perhaps there is some magical fix out there that I have yet to run across so I will provide my system specs and maybe there is someone that knows more about it than I do that can get this program to work because I would like nothing better than to be able to use it.  What little time I have been able to spend with it, I have enjoyed.

(Having a PC powerful enough to run the game and having a guitar etc) If you are first learning to play I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME. 

I was self taught, only having taken 1 course in High School for a semester of beginner guitar and the game does a good job at teaching you the basics and even intermediate to advanced techniques. Even seasoned players could find it useful. 

The game is also humbling. I will readily admit to picking up bad habits during my years of playing and the game helps in how to be a better player and make it easier on the hands (Through different styles of picking/alternate chords and even finger placement and how most people typically play the chords)

Though I only play around a few times a month (Unless I have time for more) I can 100% say the game has increased my skill level in sight reading and playing more efficiently. Master Mode is useful as well for when you nail a song and are learning to play it without the use of Rocksmith (It makes the notes disappear while playing to help with memorization but this can be turned off in settings) 

I would consider myself primarily a rhythm guitarist and my main reasoning for buying the game was to learn how to play better and ""cleaner"" but also go outside my comfort zone and learn some lead as well. The game also makes it way more fun to learn ""popular"" songs with relative ease compared to having to pay for or look up a tab for a song. 

Another feature I love is Riff Repeater. It allows you to really breakdown a song and slow it down, increase the level of difficulty (Adding more or less notes) and practice sections of songs that you are having trouble with. You can also add custom songs created by people in the Rocksmith community as well as through the Steam Store (There is usually always a sale) and some custom songs created by the community also allow the use of Riff Repeater which opens the doors to songs you want to learn that might not be available with the DLC in the Steam Store. 


All in all, this is a great game to play no matter the reason. It's good for beginners and advanced players alike and you certainly won't become a worse player by adding this game to a players arsenal of tools to help become a better player.

The first 10 hours of playing rocksmith was getting the game to work somewhat correctly. I didn't wan't to buy a cable that only served one purpose and has reported bad quality.

Ubisoft connect:
What more needs to be said? Except that this time it's especially annoying because the servers aren't available. But it's skippable and the game is playable. The only limit I found was some scores and progress in Arcade mode not being saved.

Tuning:
One of the things that kept me from playing rocksmith was the tuning. It kept from going from +999 to -999 and somewhere around +/-255. That's where a lot of the time went figuring out how to play. In the end I got it to work, but it's amazing still how +20 get's easily accepted. The best way to tune in order to play is just get trough the tuner or skip it when that's possible. Then pause the game and tune using the mini tuner. That way you can finetune closer to what rocksmith thinks is correct. Now I have readings that are mostly the same as my other tuners. 

Connecting audio:
There's a few things you need to know concerning audio. If you decide to buy an audio interface or another quality solution to connect the game... well, Rocksmith won't recognize it because it needs a lower quality. I believe it was 16 or 32 bit and 32KHz. Well, my interface couldn't go that low. So I had to use virtual cables in order to lower the quality. After that the device was recognized by rocksmith. Tuner issues persisted. VB-Audio offers a dll which adds two devices. Then you forward the high quality signal to the virtual speakers by selecting ""listen to this device on virtual device"". Then the virtual mic/recording device can listen to the default playback device or whatever you need. Make sure the virtual mic is at a quality level rocksmith can deal with.

Configuring the ini file:
This in the end fixed my tuning: Win32UltraLowLatencyMode = 0 (instead of default 1)
I believe I did some latency tricks in there as well. 

Gameplay:
Yay, the game works. But it's AI changing the difficulty is evil. If you play easy levels okayish, the game will increase difficulty. And to such an extent that the fun can be sucked out of practicing a song. (As a total beginner at least). Also, what you need to play sometimes doesn't make sense. It feels like a race game where the corners are being done for you, but sometimes not.

In order to deal with this, you can select a difficulty and play on a lower speed. But the ""learn a song"" feature is a tad annoying. Just configure what you want to play manually.

The arcade games:
They gave me blisters. It's nice to do something else with the guitar that having the feeling you're practicing. I'd have bought them on their own. It's a shame progress isn't being saved without ubisoft connect. 

Accuracy:
Sometimes, rocksmith just get's it wrong. It will either not recognize a note played. Even when you don't have sound clipping and input is flawless. But to be honest that's to be expected with sound input. Especially when playing rapidly. 

Rocksmith as a teacher?
Nah, definitly not. There are plenty of video's on how to play out there. It's not worth it to buy the game just for that. But... The arcade games are a bit like fun drilling exercises. And they can definitely be used to improve skills. But there are better alternatives out there that give you the video's and the practice that goes along with it in an interactive way.

Overall:
It's enjoyable, but if I knew what a hassle it would be, I'd have bought a different game/learning app. Maybe I'd have waited for Rocksmith+. I definitely wouldn't recommend it to non tech people on a tight budget. If you like a challenge in getting something to work, this might be a fun project with a nice reward if you get it working.",1641802355,1641802355,False,2,1,0.518248140811920166,0,True,False,False

[b] In Depth [/b]

Me:
Hey there,

 I've been playing guitar for more than 15 years (teaching/ playing in a professional capacity for multiple years) so I certainly didn't pick this game up for learning new songs but rather as a convenient, decent-sounding and headphone friendly amp simulation.

Practise - Learn A Song:
I'd like to give my point of view about Rocksmith as a teaching tool: Personally, I don't use it to acquire new material since I feel the ""phrase chunks"" are too large to repeat and appropriately practise difficult aspects of songs such arpeggios following a bend. (You always have to endure the bend in half speed only to get 1 practise repetition of the arpeggio, in which feels like I'm wasting my time) 
      Furthermore, I recommend you turn on ""master mode"" and never set the difficulty below 100% as people on my stream complained that they had to ""re-learn the song once they jumped up in difficulty. I totally agree with that. Reducing the difficulty makes the song easier to play along, but ultimately your aim should be to play the song and not the 50% version of it. My advice here is to pick easy songs and always play on max difficulty. 
       Lastly, I strongly recommend you rely on your ears and - more importantly - be honest to yourself. The recognition is flawed and does not recognize certain mistakes. You don't get yelled at for playing during rests. For example, you could 100% every sophisticated strumming pattern by just shredding the string like a madman. So if you truly want to learn and improve you need to force yourself to be honest. On the opposite side, the recognition is sometimes questionable and especially once go below B tuning (7String) the game struggles to recognize the notes. Luckily, we should all have our ears, which we hopefully have learned to use to listen for mistakes! :) 
Of course, if you're contemplating buying this for your child, I'd highly recommend doing so. Especially younger learners need a boost in motivation and dropping the difficulty is an easy shortcut to that sweet dopamine and maybe he or she will stick with it. 

Arcade Mode: 
I don't use it ever. There's a certain sound that's supposed to give you feedback on how you did on certain phrases and it's very annoying. Especially in faster songs with lots of 16th notes it can drown out the song.

Jam/Session Mode:
Nice idea and people tell me they spend most of their game time in there. Personally, I don't like the dynamic volume thing, but I certainly am in the minority here. 

Make a sound/Sound designer:
Never really used it much either. 3 slots for sounds to acess quickly seems a bit low, but I usually have them set to override Lead, Rhythm and a Jazz lead and that's sufficient for me. 

Games:
Cute ideas. I didn't play them for too long, but I can see how average skilled players can find some creative ways to practise the more ""out there"" scales.

Chord Book/ Guides:
Again, not really an area of my interest, especially since the internet is full of stuff like that. From what I've seen it is usable though. 

Modding
If you're like me, you search the internet for mods for this game prior to buying it. I'd like to say that I happened to find a reddit page that claims this game is not moddable. Me, my Shiba-Inu fretboard, green background and my library of 1000+ songs are inclined to disagree. This game has a friendly and active modding community. I assume I'm not allowed to post the link to the mod pages here so in a pinch just dm me. 

Conclusion
If you're indecisive about this game I hope I could address your specific worries in my review. Keep in mind that the internet is full of free tutorials and step by step guides. So if you're contemplating picking up guitar I highly advise you to do so. If you're looking for a learning tool I'd also recommend Rocksmith as an alternative to nothing at all but keep in mind that you're missing out on learning ""industry"" standards such as learning by ear, reading sheet music/tabs and having to memorize an entire song without the coloured lines being there to save you. 

If you decide on getting it, I strongly urge you to mod this game. For every song that is in the base game or that can be bought as a dlc, there is 400 fanmade songs for you to play around with.",1640030494,1640030494,True,84,0,0.885245144367218018,6,True,False,False

This absolutely isn't a replacement for a good teacher, more of a supplemental tool that should've been marketed towards late beginner and above guitarists. When a guitarist that has been playing for many years sees something like this that's marketed towards beginners, they'll usually write it off without realizing that it includes an extremely wide range of songs with many different skill levels in mind. It should've been marketed towards experienced players as a quick way to see a different perspective on songs; a more engaging alternative to sheet music, tabs, or learning by ear; and a great way to introduce yourself to a wider variety of songs you may not have previously considered learning.

That all said, late beginners and intermediate should still remember to practice licks and scales to a metronome to keep solid timing (above intermediate probably already knows that), along with practice with backing tracks to get used to playing along with others. The biggest flaw with ""session mode"" is it stops if you aren't playing. I get what they were going for, but this encourages people to not take rests, have good phrasing, and listen to what the band is playing first (which is a good thing to do when practicing so you can practice thinking before playing).

I tried out Rocksmith, plugged in my guitar through my audio-interface, selected that as a mic and played one song a few times to get the feel of it. Shut it down, jump on discord with some friends only to find that my other microphone (AT2020 USB+) doesn't work anymore. It's right there on the device list and all, but no program is able to use it. Audacity gives an ""error code -9999 unanticipated host error"". No program recognizes ANY of my microphones anymore. I tried disabling the exclusivity settings, edited the rocksmith.ini file as recommended by some troubleshooting threads. Rebooted multiple times. Nothing.

I have no such issues with the guitar but as soon as i plug my Bass in, the tuning feature will just spaz out hard. Like plucking a string any lower than a D on the 4th string will say its at -999 on the meter and will j ump up and down all around the meter when trying to tune it any lower than drop D. it's quite odd.

But as for gameplay and learning, It's actually really good at that, If you play a song enough and do it well enough you can sometimes look away and still play the notes just fine and you can feel yourself really learning and perfecting how to play the guitar/bass.

A pretty fun and interactive way to learn the guitar. About 16 hours at the time of review, and thanks to the mini-games, adaptive difficulty and riff repeater feature, I can seriously admit that I've learned to master more songs during this time than I've ever learned with months of IRL study. I use the official tone cable and my only complaint is that its tune detection can sometimes be off, giving me a perfect score when I plucked the wrong note at times.

Yes it will be on sale for the winter and summer sales ,  I regret every season I didn't purchase.  I would be so much farther along in my lessons by now.  The $30 I saved, is nothing compared to the comprehension of music that I could have absorbed by now...

Disclaimer:  I am 'musically challenged'.  I am just being introduced to most of these concepts for the first time.
That being said - this program is NOT just 'I wann learn a Nirvana song...'  This program teaches you basic music theory, session jamming, structured lessons, a chord reference, and some really top-notch games.

Session mode is incredible- an AI band that plays with you in tons of styles and instruments.  Better than GarageBand by far.

The games are REALLY impressive.  Not just rote tools for muscle memory.  Each game is extracted from a classic genre, and really brings a great flavor to the practice you need.

As you progress, the game gifts you with more songs, virtual tones, virtual equipment, the list is almost endless.  Additionally, the community is excellent - there is an official live stream STILL on every Thursday.  Plus additional songs come out all the time.

If you have ANY interest in learning guitar - BUY THIS NOW.

Years later, I still had the cable to plug in through a usb port, so I picked this up.

If you're already pretty familiar with the guitar, just treat Rocksmith like a hardcore Guitar Hero and you'll have fun.

Will it make you a guitar legend? no, obviously not but what it WILL do is teach you the fundamentals and even some more advanced techniques. What I think is the most interesting thing it does is it has a collection of mini games that are actually really good guitar exercises like scales, string skipping, tremelo picking, etc.. I think the way the game teaches you songs is also VERY well done. The songs are broken up into many different sections and will start out with just the most fundamental notes of that section. Each section will individually get more complex or more simplified, depending on how well you do. i think it's a great way to go about learning a song.

The only thing I will say is that if you're in the higher levels of intermediate like me or even higher on the skill tree, this game isn't going to teach you all that much. Because of the technical limitations of the game, it can't really keep up with any fast shredding or sweep picking which means the game will often say you played a section perfectly when you actually hit several wrong and/or dead notes.",1637563196,1637563196,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- logging in to Uplay is impossible because it doesn't accept all characters it accepts on the web UI
- connecting to Uplay servers is not possible due to servers being unavailable
- cannot get past tuning. Guitar is already tuned but the game's tuner doesn't agree. No way to skip.
- cannot access any game mode without tuning apparently

So that's my first ten minutes of Rocksmith. Utterly broken up to the extent that I was short of asking for a refund. I gave the game a thumbsdown at first because I cannot recommend what cannot be played.

After I got a USB to Guitar (Behringer, not the Real Tone) cable, I was finally able to play the game. I did enjoy the first few lessons but then got stuck at bendings. While far from an expert guitar player, I am pretty sure my bendings aint that bad as the game tells me they are. Even on slow speed the game will mark the bendings as erroneous. Kinda frustrating. 

I then tried learning a song and kinda enjoyed it. I am not convinced of the way the game wants to me learn the songs though. For instance, I would never play the Seven Nation Army riff on just the A string. It can be played much more easily and compact on the A end E string instead. Fortunately, the game does accept me playing it that way, so that's just a minor complaint.

What I really like is the Technique games. Really enjoying that part of the game. Definitely a thumbs up here because it's adding fun to what is otherwise a rote excercise to build dexterity and muscle memory.

What I don't like is the constant retuning. This is a software issue. I am not talking about switch from Standard to Drop D or similar things. The tuner will ask you to retune your guitar very frequently even if the other song is in the same tuning.

Another issue I am facing is that the Behringer cable apparently will not result in the game playing the audio from my guitar. I definitely picks it up but it doesnt output any sound for it. Not sure if this is my sound settings but my expectation would be for the game to just handle that.

So while my initial experience with the game was terribad and it still has some issues, I actually want to recommend it now. The concept is worthwhile and I intend to invest more time into it.",1636447408,1637402508,True,0,0,0.479145079851150513,0,True,False,False

First off, for whatever reason Rocksmith does not recognize my mic, a Blue Yeti X, which is apparently a known issue. So I had to figure out a work around which involved passing the input through Voicemeeter, which worked.

Now as for how actually [i] using [/i] the mic . . . it's very hit and miss. Calibration goes fine, tuning works without a hitch, then I go to play through the lessons and sometimes the practice tracks just don't pick up the note I'm playing. And the Guitarcade minigames are even worse to the point they're unplayable. And it's not the mic picking up sound from speakers or anything -- I've played on mute and encountered the same issues.

But even if the mic did work properly, I still don't think I could recommend Rocksmith, at least for beginners like me. While it seems to have some good content in the lessons, I don't think it is presented in a beginner-friendly order. Difficulty fluctuates a lot, and skills that are less useful to getting started are presented before skills that are more necessary. I really can't make sense of the ordering of the lessons, and the seemingly random difficulty of the practice tracks definitely doesn't help.

As for actually playing the songs, I honestly can't say much. I haven't yet. I thought Rocksmith would be a good place to start learning the guitar, but man is it confusing to learn from zero from. I don't have the skills yet to play actual songs, but I'm sure that like the practice tracks on the lessons, it'd be hit and miss with the mic as well.

Would this game be worth it using the Real Tone cable? Maybe, if you already have the basics down. But if you're looking for something to start your guitar learning journey, honestly YouTube is probably better.",1637351686,1637351686,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With Rocksmith, I can play along with a song I've never heard before. It starts out with only a few notes, leaving most notes out. As one plays and gets familiar with the song, new notes are introduced.

To make the game better PC there are mods that Ubisoft tolerate but they are sometimes buggy.
You can play the game with a dollarstore 1/4 adapter to 3.5mm (plug it into LINE-IN [Blue]) and there's a mod to help for that.
The game will often change your Windows audio settings, make your other apps go mute and your microphone go mute in other apps; to correct that: leave exclusivity only to the input of your instrument and remove it for all your other devices.

Aside from that the game is great ! 
Since it's old the price is excellent and graphics are fine for the age. For that type of game, who needs fancy graphics anyway ?

With the base game there is a large library of popular songs to choose from and we can buy even more for around 4$Can  per song.
For learning new techniques and theory I'd recommend Yousician but for practice Rocksmith is the best.
Its goal is not really to make you learn a song by heart, even though you can, but to make you faster on the fretboard.
You could also check out the new Rocksmith+, it is more expensive but they added many handy tools.

I highly recommend this game, it's fun and addictive!

This game is a phenomenally good tool for learning guitar, although it can't teach you absolutely everything about guitar (even some basic stuff I'll get into in a bit) I will say that this game goes above and beyond to make learning guitar easy and effective and into a game like environment that helps some people focus.

this is not a game this is a tool I want to get that across, this is for learning guitar, although there are some games included I wont say they fit the definition really, they are also a tool to help you learn scales and chords respectively, you might say ""well Doom is for helping you learn the keyboard"" but the keyboard is not an instrument it's a device used for. . . .wait. . . .

This game will teach you an incredible amount of things for just a game, it will teach you scales, whether that's through session mode or a mini game that is actually quite fun and engaging to play, this game can really easily teach you songs, much better than reading a tab book and playing the song in the background I think, you can repeat certain phrases or sections, slow them down, decrease the amount of notes, it's all a way of helping you learn it in an easier way, it will teach you how to bend properly through tutorials and even again those mini games I mentioned before, it's not cheating like some people say, although I will say that the claim you can learn guitar in 60 days is absolute shit, there is so much to guitar that even high level musicians that have been playing for years don't know everything, there is so much more to music as well.

this game fails in a few aspects of guitar you should be wary off before going into this game, as I think it can be harmful to assume this game will teach you everything.
- It doesn't teach you how to find tone
most of the game revolves around teaching you songs, scales and chords but there is no aspect of the game that really teaches you to find your own, unique sound, there is tone designer but there really is not a tutorial on what things do there and it really does not simulate the sometimes baffling amount of choices there can be in real life.
- it doesn't teach you how to play with a real band live
I think this game does not give you the real experience of playing with a live band, a lot of things can change in a live scenario and sometimes things that you can't see coming, reading band mates and keeping a constant flow is vital if you want to play music beyond Rocksmith and into the live world, especially when starting out, there is session mode but again I really don't think it goes over necessary steps.
- it doesn't really teach you how to play with pedals.
There isn't really a mode where switching guitar pedals around for certain moments in a song is ever really found, and it's a bit harder than you would think, especially in a live setting under pressure.
- some songs arn't charted properly
I think this needs mentioning here that some songs wont teach you the best way to play a song or have charted other instruments on lead guitar parts like keyboard, vocals and such which is not good when you want to just learn the guitar parts, remember it's not a competition, guitar has it's parts as well as other instruments (I know how could I say such a thing?)
- I don't think it teaches you crescendo properly
there is aspects in music that require you to play loud and soft and normal, but it isn't as binary as this game makes it out to be sometimes, there is so much more around the concept than just ""play normal"" or ""play loud""

there are many more I probably havn't mentioned but those are some of the most important for me to point out, I'm not saying this game is bad, hell no this game is amazing, but I'm just letting you know if these are things you want to learn and absolutely nothing more then this probably isn't the game for you.

at least it ain't a subscription based game where you haft to pay a monthly fee just for the songs you want to play and can just pay a one time purchase cost hehe. . . .",1598617169,1636626952,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One is the session mode where you can practice jamming with a virtual band which is as good or better than youtube backing tracks and helps teach scales. it also has a pretty fun DSP engine where you can use different effects pedals, amps, and cabinets. If I find songs I'm really trying to learn I may download some as well, but really it's not much different than just looking up a tab and playing along. 

It was probably worth the ~$10 I paid for it on sale but I don't think I would have been happy had I paid full price.

Despite having next to no expectations, to say I'm let down by this trashfire is an understatement.

The game has the asinine requirement that it will only use an audio device that plays at 1 Channel, 16 bit, 48000 Hz. This might have been fine on something like Windows 7, when the game was originally made, but it was never updated for Windows 10, where this setting is built into the hardware. Most headphones, audio interfaces, and computer sound boards are built for specific bitrates and frequencies that can't be changed, meaning you either have the right hardware to play or you don't get sound. In a music game. Where sound is literally the point.

Once I cobbled together an awful system of an old desktop speaker that had blown out a decade ago that happened to play at the right frequency, I couldn't even play the game due to the AWFUL in-game interface. Legitimately, despite picking the ""I know nothing about guitar"" option (even though I do know enough to play a few basic songs) I was still confused as shit by the actual notation system. I think it's trying to say what frets I need to play, but the run board showing the actual timing is impossible to read, and the colored strings at the bottom only serve to confuse me when nothing reads as I ""play.""

Add in that you either have to make the mistake of buying their overpriced first party hardware cable and still get a full second delay between playing and the game recognizing it, the game just doesn't operate at it's base function. I kept reading about a workaround with minimal delay where if you have a USB Audio Interface you can plug a 1/4 inch jack into, then you can operate the guitar under the microphone setting. Well, the only description I got for this workaround involves downloading 4 different programs, 1 of them off of a malware site, at which point it no longer seemed like the 70% sale was worth the 70% of my brain cells I used up bashing my head into the wall.

This isn't a game: It's a brain aneurysm packed with a neat little bow on top. Unless you're using Windows 7 and already have all of the equipment, don't waste your time or money on it, even on sale.",1636446655,1636446655,False,5,0,0.481172502040863037,0,True,False,False

An electric acoustic that my wife bought for me. I went ahead and started learning basic simple chords (A, Am, E, Em, G, D, Dm, C and so forth) and off I went. Fast forward 6 months and I could change chords pretty good, fingers felt good and strong, it didn't hurt to play anymore. And I could play exactly zero songs. Learning from tabs and youtube videos wasn't working for me at all and I just stopped playing. I ""hit a wall"" as some people say and the guitar went into it's case for years.

This process repeated itself a few times as the months and years went by and it always ended the same way. Guitar back in its case in the crawl space. I bought an electric guitar (Fender Stratocaster Squier) and it was the same thing. Chug Chug Chug, I could play the first 30 seconds of a bunch of Metallica songs and was never able to sit down and learn a song front to back. Fast forward to February of 2020 and I figured ""If i owned a really nice guitar I'm sure i'd dedicate myself to finally stick with it"". So I purchased a Jackson King V KVT Pro in Snow White with a Boss Katana MKII 100w amp, a noise gate and a Revv G4 distortion pedal. While I admit I did a lot better, learning a couple songs I could play through along with the music, eventually I stopped again.

I had heard about Rocksmith years earlier when it had first released but some of the first reviews that came out weren't great and I just didn't pay attention to it.  I had played the **** out of guitar hero and could play almost all the songs across all of them on expert with the exception of some of the truly ridiculous ones (I'm looking at you Dragonforce). Then it dawned on me...I asked myself ""how could I possibly not like Rocksmith? It's pretty much guitar hero with a real guitar...""

So I bought it. Ordered the RealTone cable. I can't explain how much this game has helped me not only enjoy the guitar more than I ever thought possible, but I've improved more in the last 20 hours of playing than i have in 20 years of playing and trying to teach myself through youtube and online tab websites.  If you're like me and really like playing along with the music while you learn, I think you should try it. The game literally adapts to your skill level with each play through of a song. There's over 1500 DLC songs you can purchase, yes they can get expensive if you start loading up your cart but when you consider how much private lessons cost, I think its worth it. 

I'm not saying there is no value in private lessons from an experienced teacher, of course that's not the case. I don't have time for lessons as my schedule is quite busy and unpredictable. Bottom line is you can only get better at a musical instrument if it's in your hands and you're having fun and seeing progress. Rocksmith has checked all those boxes for me and although I know my review is a bit premature I can see myself sinking some serious time into this game.

I can't speak from an absolute beginners perspective but I think there's great value here no matter what skill level you are. For people like me who are maybe just past the beginner stage trying to push through to intermediate you have nothing to lose. If you liked guitar hero and wanted to play like that on a real instrument it's a no brainer.

Just as a better gauge, here's a few things I could already do before trying Rocksmith: Palm mute, hammer ons, pull offs, power chords (basic 2 and 3 string), slides, pretty good at keeping rhythm.

And stuff I still suck at: knowing where i am on the fret board without looking down, bends (atrocious, absolutely terrible), bar chords, learning by ear, tuning without assistance, fast chord changes, solos. I know nothing about scales, modes, theory or keys lol. 

TLDR: If you already own an electric guitar or bass guitar and a PC or console that supports this game, I 10/10 recommend giving this a try.",1636446126,1636446126,True,47,0,0.801690101623535156,0,True,False,False

If you want to dive deeper in and learn more, JustinGuitar's site and content is the place to be! Rocksmith helps you get started and makes learning the fundamentals fun, though it's hard to get quality feedback from the game's system to measure your progress. Percentages are good, though they don't mean much in terms of clean playing and highlighting incorrect technique, something the software does struggle with here and there.

I'd say 90% of my time playing Rocksmith has been using the Tone Designer simply as an amp and pedal board. It's much cheaper than investing in physical gear and there's no need to download or learn any additional software and plugins. Of course, Rocksmith is limited, though if you experiment with Tone Designer there's loads of options to play with - On top of that, if you check out CustomsForge, there's loads of custom tracks which people have created tones for, so you can use those. For instance, the Paul Gilbert track 'Straight To The Telephone Pole' is on there, which I downloaded just to use the tone, not to learn the song.

If you're considering getting this to practice and learn guitar, there's a variety of ways to use the software and it's pretty simple once you've set it up according to your rig. Grab your axe and practice!",1635778825,1635778825,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'd never picked played a guitar before getting this (Guitar Hero doesn't count, right?). I upgraded to PC as the Xbox only supports the Ubisoft cable which isn't great. I recommend searching for a good quality cable.
I don't use the auto level up & never have as I found it off putting. Each song is broken into sections & you can manually alter the difficulty of each section. I find a setting just above my skill level so there's always room for improvement. When I get close to mastering it I slightly increase difficulty.
I was in my 40's when I started, thanks to a combination of 4 decades of playing videogames & me getting older there are chords my fingers cannot manage. This means I'll never 100% many songs, this is my failing & not the games.

In spite of this I now own about 30 DLC songs on Xbox & about 10 here on PC. I am able to play many of those well enough for friends to instantly recognise what I'm playing. 
I have my mastery of many of those songs anywhere between 60% - 90%.
I have achieved 100% on one single song, Numb by Linkin Park. Lead & Rhythm use the same note structure & chords so I have 100% for both styles of guitar. Considering my personal limitations I'd say that's a glowing endorsement for Rocksmith.

After getting everything I needed to play Rocksmith, and then giving it my fullest and honest try I have actually come to learnt so much in the past 10 hours I've played. I gotten so much more confident as a musician , and most surprising of all I learnt how the f*ck to read tabs and understand wtf I am doing.

If you really want to learn guitar, but doubt that you even can ever learn how to play then don't any more. This game offers so many smooth ways to get the lessons to be successful for you to reach you're goals.

I didn't go in knowing nothing so I can't say anything from a new guitarist standpoint. What I can say is it got me playing, which every teacher I've had really pushed for me to play more than anything. I'm learning the neck like I never have before, continually building strength and coordination, with new techniques developing as I understand the fret board better. There are some good learning tools that explain a lot for new guitarist, but again I can't say how good they are for someone going in with nothing. I also never played bass before this game, I used that as a stepping stone to build strength and learn with less strings. My good buddy that used to teach guitar and works at a guitar shop now recommends this to people looking for lessons after seeing my progress in a year.

Some key features for us:
- Solo and Multiplayer
- song selection covers broad genres (will be buying loads of DLC in the future)
- review practice any time
- start to finish techniques walkthroughs
- accommodations for beginners all the way to professional level
- endless options for practicing tough parts and progressions
- automatic leveling up that is actually decent
- an arcade
- hell, for the price of a real-tone cable you turn your computer and sound system into an amp

I sold my bass about 20 years ago and bought a new acoustic and electric over the past year. I'd been getting steadily better through YouTube 'lessons' and bass tabs online, but I thought I would make the jump into Rocksmith 2014 since the highly anticipated Rocksmith+ version had been delayed. AND, I can't really justify Yousician's monthly fees for music that is cut rate and hokey seconds of the real music.
To my surprise, when the competitive nature of the game hit me, I couldn't help but engage. It's literally supercharging my desire to learn. And my YouTubing lessons have actually helped in teaching me ways to efficiently use my fretting hand and move from note to note faster. Stretching my fingers between 4-6 fret spans really helps in some of the songs.
The largest benefit to Rocksmith 2014 is the ability to 'feel' where you are on the fretboard without looking. Keeping your eyes on the coming frets and moving your fingers to them without effort is hard to teach and more difficult to learn without constant diligence on the players part. It too easy to look at your hands when you really want to.
If the new Rocksmith+ release is anywhere near as good as this one is at 7 years old  (and I expect it will be better), I will purchase it on the first day of release. 
I'm a huge Smashing Pumpkins fan, so the fact that you can buy a large number of their songs to learn was the extra push I needed to jump into the fray. Learning to play ""Cherub Rock"" at nearly the max level is amazing. And it's not the hardest song out there. Muse's ""Hysteria"" is included with the game. That's one that Davie504 put at #10 on his ""Top 10 HARDEST Bass Lines"" YouTube video. I have not attempted that one yet. I need faster fingers. 
If you're at all interested in this game/learning tool, get it. You will not be disappointed. And if you're debating between this and Yousician, and you love playing along with REAL music, Rocksmith 2014 is the choice.",1633986747,1633986747,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are some pretty annoying detection issues. For instance I sometimes miss notes when I know I'm playing them correctly, and other times I'll totally fuck up but the game doesn't count it as a miss. I don't really blame it on the game since, guitars/basses aren't meant to be used as controllers. But it's a bit frustrating at times.

1. Calibrate your guitar correctly. This will save you a lot of headaches with note recognition. Look for guides online and tinker with the settings to get optimal audio.
2. Once you get high mastery on a song with visible notes, give it a try in master mode. In the end it is better to learn songs without guides, otherwise one may become good at Rocksmith but mediocre in real life.

I did the 60 day challenge of playing Rocksmith at least 1 hour per day (although sometimes it was more then that because the game is so addicting).
My everyday schedule was 15-20 min of playing mini games (Guitarcade), then spend 10-15 min on in-game lessons and after that play Learn A Song mode for the rest of the time left.
My top 5l of Guitarcade games I used everyday:
1. Castle Chordead - great for learning chords with its progression system
2. Scale Racer - best game for learning how to do scales (without boring exercises you would normally do)
3. Scale Warriors - interesting as something different to Scale Racer as it has level progression (ended up beating it after getting a bit bored of scale racer, then went back)
4. Star Chords - good for practicing what you've learnt in the first game
5. String Skip Saloon - best game to play first in order to get used to string switching. First week or 2 I played only this game.
After 3 months I can now play easy / lower medium songs on both guitar and bass with 90+% accuracy. Also learned how to play a couple of my favorite songs without the game through an amp.

The songs that are available are actually some of the same I tried to learn back in the day and its been fun seeing how close or far from the ""official"" way of playing I've been.

The exercises are nice reminders when you are struggling with technique and the selection of tones is pretty decent. I don't care much for the jam feature because it is playing with bots which doesn't feel very alive or inspiring.

All in all I would recommend this game for those interested in learning to play and those already playing. I don't know how much fun a high level professional player would have with this but as an intermediate musician/player I enjoy myself. My friends have even tuned in when I'm playing to just enjoy the music, said its like having a concert without having to leave their houses.

I'm fucking stoked for the next version/new game to be released. I think Rocksmith+ is gonna be everything we love about this with a modern interface and less IO lag. Anyway I'm only 50-ish hours in and have no desire to quit. Plus its nice to just jam out for a bit to lift your mood. Sometimes I play for 10 mins other times for hours on end.

I have no idea how ubisoft can come up with such an amazing idea put paired it with a software experience that makes it feel like a hot piece of garbage. launching this game comes with a chance that it will just freeze and not be able to be shut down unless you restart your PC. you cant change what audio channel it choses to go through so if you have any other speakers plugged into your computer its probably going to go to whichever you dont want it to go. and if you unplug those sources after the game is launched it just crashes.

other than that good game

Do you want to learn guitar but never had the motivation to do it? This is the tool for you. My only regret is not getting this sooner, it certainly makes the early hurdles of learning a lot easier and you can do it in your home on your own time.

1.  Learn the board (memorize the fret board Easter Bunnies Get Drunk At Easter).
2.  Spider technique (find on youtube) for building finger and hand dexterity
3.  Tremolo and hammer ons (this is simple exercises 5 mins each every day) to build up speed and precision
4.  In the game itself challenge arcade is a fun way to build up stamina and learn new skills
5.  Play songs you really enjoy to keep your interest high but also challenge yourself with songs that maybe you don't particularly like but are interesting to play
6.  Have fun with it!!  If you are board with scales or learning technique at least get into the game and just have fun until you want to learn more (you will progress much, much faster if you do simple exercises 5-20mins every day or maybe even as far as you can push yourself, Dave Gruhl when in university was practicing 8hrs a day and came late to the guitar).  
7.  Get your kids involved.  Start them early.

I like this game / tool it has alot of content for $40 I don't think enough base songs are there to keep me interested I spent another $40 on getting some songs I really wanted, in particular Judas Priest song pack and Another Thing Coming as they are my favourite band.  Some notables are missing mainly Metallica but you can find them in CDLC though they aren't dynamic songs so no way to really learn them as they are defaulted to the highest difficulty.  Good luck with that (you can slow down the songs in Rift Repeated so at least that works).  Overall a nice package, worth the money but has some missing DLC that I think the game could benefit from out of the gate.  There is a lot of content there, and if you augment with practicing skills OUTSIDE of the game/tool environment you will quickly see gains.  And you will enjoy the game/tool more and more.  

Hope this helps people.  Youtube has many good videos as well, you can run Rocksmith in the background if you don't have an amp and put headphones on or earbuds you're neighbours won't even hear you if you are self-conscious or shy about that.  I tested this in my own apartment.  No one knows I have a guitar.  Maybe one day they will.  :-)

I went from knowing the basics of how to hold a guitar and play single notes to being able to play riffs in some of my favorite songs and play the whole bass line to some songs I like. YMMV.

I found the variety of training tools to be a great way to balance learning time so it didn't feel like a chore.
Have a particular skill you need to hone? Try the Guitarcade for things like string or fret selection or slides. Need a more detailed walkthrough? Try the lessons. When you're ready for practice with covering songs, Learn a Song takes you through from the basics of rhythm to the full note sequence for each song, at your pace. Feel like you want to just jam and play around with the sounds of your guitar? Try sessions, where a virtual band will back you up to help you hold a rhythm and sound more full.

It's been a blast so far. I expect to sink many, many more hours into this practice.

Only con: Getting it to work with certain audio configurations was a pain, and I did need the Realtone cable to get it to recognize the notes on my bass cleanly. Exclusive Mode may lead to higher sound quality, but it also killed the audio all together on my MS Surface Pro 7, so I had to turn it off in the hardware control panels per output device in order to hear the game at all.",1627365372,1627365372,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rocksmith is extremely beginner friendly and can be easily adjusted for the more adept player. Songs are played like Guitar Hero and start with notes that typically either fall on the beat or are emphasized. As the player successfully plays a phrase a few times,  it adds more notes, increasing difficulty in a dynamic way that adapts each part of the song to your current level.

Details: The game itself runs pretty well actually, and can run on potato computers. The concept behind RS2014 is solid. I use the cable, and frankly have no interest in an audio interface, and the cable works great. I do wish it was braided, I think that's really my only complaint about it. The game is easy to learn to play, but hard to master the instrument, obviously. With RS+ coming out sometime, it will definitely be a test to see if this game ends up beating that one. If you are considering purchasing this game, absolutely go for it (on sale) or just wait for RS+. But probably hold off on buying any DLC if you want to try out RS+ and see which you like better. CDLC for this game is hit or miss, bad news fellow Bassists - our charts can be pretty bad, and the tones even worse (farting tones, insane distortion, or just applying lead guitar tone to bass) but still worth trying out.

Starting out on a cheap Les Paul and not owning an amp, I used this consistently instead of an amp, playing easy songs like ""Drops of Jupiter"" or my favourite Muse songs. At the start I was absolutely awful, fret memorisation wasn't great, picking was not coordinated. 

After about 10-15 hours I slowly got better, to the point where it wasn't frustrating to play anymore.

I kept playing until around 50 or 60 hours consistently almost every day. You could play for a couple hours and it was literally like playing Guitar Hero, except at the end of your session, your fingers stung, and you were playing a real guitar the entire time. Always improving.

At the 90 hour mark I started getting into a real amp, and searching out online lessons on Youtube, which really rocketed my knowledge up, there I learned things like music theory, minor and major scales, pentatonic scales throughout the entire fretboard. This is where Rocksmith can't propel you like it does in the early stages.

After that, I come back once every couple of days just to play some songs, jam to backing tracks, and support my growth (mostly fretboard memorization, timing, etc.) and for pure entertainment value.

Buy this if you want to get yourself interested in learning guitar and like Guitar Hero!

In general, I found this to be a good tool for encouraging players to practice their instruments and for learning songs with a couple of caveats. I am a classical and jazz upright bass player who picked this game up to try and learn some music on the electric bass and even dabbled in the guitar portion so I was not a complete music novice going in, but was new to the instruments. Here are some of the things that i found would be helpful to keep in mind before purchasing this product as a complete beginner to either the guitar or bass.

1. You will need a quality instrument. I found that, while you do not really need the most expensive guitar or bass in the store, I had a lot of trouble getting the software to work with 'starter' instruments. I had an old Squier Jazz bass that, while it sounded good enough through an amp, just didn't work well with the software. When I plugged in my Schecter Diamond Series; however, there was no problem. Same thing with a guitar. I first tried a Spencer beginner's guitar and was extremely frustrated trying to get it to work. I borrowed a PRS SE from a friend and it worked great as soon as I plugged it in.
2. At least for the bass, the recommended fingering were maybe not the greatest. I cannot speak for guitar as I am still very much a beginner on that instrument, but at multiple points while playing a bass line I would see what fingers the game was recommending and there were certainly better ways to play the lines. The insistence on using the ring finger when most bassists would use the pinky, especially at the lower end of the fret board was a big indicator that maybe there was a better way. Using the ring finger when you can use the pinky finger for whole steps at the low end in certain passages can lead to muscle strain for no reason and is for me a dead giveaway that the person making the fingerings was more familiar with guitar techniques.
3. Learn the basics first. Even just one or two hours of one on one lessons with a guitar or bass player will do a much better job of making sure you are playing in a way that will not cause you to become frustrated or even strain your muscles. While the game does have videos and lessons in addition to the songs, for me, especially when picking up the guitar for the first time, it felt like it was not nearly enough instruction. For example, I was frustrated with the chord shapes in the very first song I attempted to play on guitar. It told me where my fingers should go, but I could not get each note to ring clearly no matter how hard I worked at it. One 30 min lesson later with a local guitar player and it answered many questions that I had and made the whole game much more enjoyable.
4. In Game Purchases. The basic games comes with a lot of music. You will want more. At $3 USD a song the amount of money you can spend on this game adds up really, really quickly if you are not careful. Don't forget that, although this does have a microphone feature, you will want to purchase the USB patch cable for best results and it is not cheap either. Other reviewers have mentioned that the cable does not last long. I have had mine for 3 or so years now and have had no issues but your experience may vary.

With all that said I do recommend this game. Sometimes playing with a group is just better and it made me want to practice in a way that playing by myself just does not. The audio quality is good enough, though headphones or a good speaker setup is definitely recommended. I would like more in game options to adjust the balance with the sound and not just in relation to my playing but I am getting really picky now. Overall I would view this game as a good way to learn and practice new songs but not necessarily something to use in place of private lessons as a complete beginner.",1624074118,1624074118,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While it isn't the most polished in places, it is a great tool for getting yourself to practice more regularly and get used to playing in general.

I had played a lot of Guitar Hero through my high school years and had a beginner's guitar that I never really played to any real competency when I decided to try this game out. I purchased a real tone cable online, and from the get go was moving to parts of the fretboard I had never bothered to really mess with previously. There's a wide variety of songs with the base game, plus a multitude of DLC that looks more costly than it is. 

You are prompted to use Uplay, the game does hijack your microphone unless you opt for the cable only in the ini file, and no borderless fullscreen is a bit of a drag, but as a whole this game is great for someone like me who stops when they miss one note while practicing alone. Having the track to play along side that can be paused or slowed if you need it, but also full speed so that you don't get stuck in a rut feels invaluable for a beginner. 

It is a lovingly crafted piece of software that I am thankful for existing, just don't expect it to be all you will ever need.

Once comfortable this game is fantastic for improving technique and learning various songs. Though it takes some work to be able to play songs without needing the notes on screen. I have been playing on a strat with single coils and the cable does give some nasty feedback sometimes, humbuckers are better for RS. Tones can vary in quality. 

I'd recommend checking out the CDLC, hundreds of custom made songs of various qualities and a good way to learn songs that are not in the game.

I'm a little disappointed that some of the official DLC cuts off parts of some songs.

Sometimes you can't hear yourself and sometimes you can't hear the music. This is issue is ironically less frequent on non official DLC. You can change the mix, but changing for every song is a nuisance.

2. Note detection

It's far from perfect and notoriously bad on palm muted and ghost notes. It's also bad at detecting rhythm. 

A few other things:
- Lessons are boring
- Your starting menu tone is bad. And you can set other tones on the ""stick"", however i can't see why you can't change it permanently.
- Session mode lacks guidance.
- Why say ""Capo required""? or ""Custom tuning""? Why it does not state the real tuning and recommend a capo?
-Uplay is a bad joke, i don't see why they choose to lock content behind it.

""Learn a song"" mode, for whatever reason, does not provide options to sort songs in rhythm guitar path mode based on number of chords used in the song list, so you can't progress through the song list starting with the songs with the least number of chords up to the songs with the most number of chords, and it appears that sorting songs by difficulty in rhythm path mode prioritizing things like tempo over number of chords. Plus, there is no option to look ahead at what chords are used in a song on something like a ""chords in this song"" list or anything like that, there is only a general chord book that can be accessed from the pause menu. You have to wait for ""Rocksmith reccomends"" to show you chords in the songs ... if the algorithm randomly chooses to preview them that is. ""Rocksmith recomends"" will often suggest playing the technique game ""Starchords"" as a way to practice chords, however, there is no way to set which chords you want to practice when you play that, nor is there any feature to allow you to choose to practice chords used in only the song you're focusing on learning at the time. The lack of these features frankly boggles my mind. What also boggles my mind in regard to the two technique games meant for practicing chords, ""Starchords"" and ""Castle of Chordead"" is that these games will display frets and strings where chords are located, but will not show a proper finger placement for those chords, while advising you to play with proper finger placement for the sake of accurate sound that the realtone cable can pick up. Instead, you have to encounter the chords in the ""Learn a song"" mode to see a reminder of where each of your fingers should be on the fret board. What all this means is that, ultimately, your best option for learning and practicing chords used in a specific song and only that song is to just stick to the riff repeater ... which, honestly, is disappointing,",1622833058,1622833058,True,11,0,0.621719539165496826,0,True,False,False

the guitar is a really hard instrument to code into making a game around because of how percussive it can be and just the amount of different sounds it can make. ubisoft did a pretty good job despite how broken the game can be at times.

Never played a full song or even really learned anything about the notes. Been almost 15yrs since I picked up a bass but my BIL had one laying around so I thought why not. Not only have I played an entire song already (~8hrs in currently) but I have also learned more about the notes and the instrument than I ever did before. Not a substitute for instruction but I dont know of a better way to practice. 10/10 would recommend :D,1620920187,1620920187,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First off, the game gives wrong impressions about guitar. I won't claim there's better ways to learn guitar, but as a starting point it builds bad habits fast. For example, posture is something the game doesn't teach in depth, and when I got lessons later in life I found out the way I held the guitar was really bad for both my fretting hand and picking hand. That's one example, and I can think of other negative influences it can have on playing. The game gives you positive feedback for hitting the right pitches, which is fair since it'd be hard to judge your playing any other way. But it means that a lot of techniques are easier avoided than attempted. Muting may be in the game, yet you'll be more likely to hit the note without muting if your playing isn't clean enough. And if you were to try to do it anyway to improve your playing, there is still not enough to go off of to know if you're doing it proper. Rocksmith needs to go more in depth, not just a practice track to learn each technique. Instead do something that really explains and shows exactly how your hands should look and how it should sound.

I don't say that because it would make the game better, but because it is what the game claims to be: the fastest way to learn guitar. Obviously it's just a way to market the game, however I think it will hinder a lot of beginners if they don't also learn alongside a teacher or other source for help. Outside of songs the game doesn't teach much at all. They have guitarcade, and missions to guide you what to do next. Like session mode, which will show you scales to mess around in. The problem with all of it is I feel it doesn't really help you understand how it fits in with creating music, it mostly just tries to tell you what to do.

My biggest problem though is all the issues running the game. On xbox it was fine, but as far as PC goes I've played across two computers and a gaming laptop and it has had huge problems on all 3. Lots of crashing mainly. Rocksmith needs full control of my audio too, once I played it I can't go into voice calls without restarting. And it lowers my normal microphone input to 17% every time I play for no reason. Plus now that I have a 2nd monitor it no longer will work fullscreen mode, no matter the resolution or which monitor is set as the primary one. I have no idea how this game is so broken, the times I have needed external help to fix an issue is too many.

At the end of the day I like playing Rocksmith an awful lot, though I think that's just because I like playing guitar. Besides the songs I think what the game offers is subpar, and the songs are creations by other artists. If you know how to play guitar or are getting help with it, then this game is excellent to play in your free time (besides the bugginess), but Rocksmith itself isn't much more than a form of tabs to play to, all the other features are underdeveloped.",1620885151,1620885151,False,2,0,0.496212124824523926,0,True,False,False

Compared to book / cd / dvd / youtube/ app lessons, which I have all tried, this is the most fun I've ever had playing guitar. There is a wide variety of paths you can take, and with the session mode and song learning it is hard to get bored.

The gamification of guitar playing is really effective. I especially like the flexibility of the Riff Repeater. Slow it down, simplify it, repeat until  you can get the riff just right - then advance to the next iteration of difficulty for that riff.

Rocksmith is defiantly worthwhile but to get a full education you need to supplement it with some real life in person lessons.  You need the instruction from a real person to get actual real-life experience.  There is nothing like playing your guitar alongside your instructor really making music for the first time. That being said Rocksmith will motivate you to practice and put in the time, which is arguably more important.  In person lessons are a continuing cost and only last a short while, you can play this game for hours-on-end, day-after-day for the one-time cost of the purchase of Rocksmith, which is dirt cheap if you really think about it.  That being said I have never bought this much DLC for any game ever before, but to be fair that is all by choice and unnecessary.
	The first thing that Rocksmith has helped me with is to feel more comfortable with the guitar.  Before playing Rocksmith and getting some time in I always felt very uncomfortable holding a guitar, because to me, even a “cheap” guitar can be quite expensive and they are somewhat fragile, they are easily dented, dinged and scratched.  I feel much more comfortable now and my guitar is still in like new condition.  Knock on wood.
	Rocksmith also provides a structure for learning.  It has videos and exercises built into the game to help you with the simple start questions that you have.  How do I put on a guitar strap?  How do I tune my guitar?  How do I change strings?  These are all things that I would have wasted time learning with my guitar teacher, which would have been a waste of money.  Rocksmith was able to put me on a fast track with my guitar teacher in many ways, these just being a fer examples. 
	In short if you already own a solid body electric or can beg, barrow, or steal one and you want to learn how to play, you should defiantly buy Rocksmith.  (Yes, you really do need a solid body guitar in my opinion!  I tried some others, hollow body, acoustic, etc. and Rocksmith could not pick the notes as easily.  I am not saying that it can’t be done, it was just very challenging for me.)",1618794396,1618794396,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Update: Can only speak from what I've been able to test. 
This game will only recognize USB interfaces, if you're using a TB3 device like UA Arrow, the game will never recognize it. Also despite endless troubleshooting, it shuts down on startup. Overall an irritating buggy mess. I hope that there will be an updated version in the near future, or at the very least update it to be supported on Windows 10.

Definitely recommend for any starting guitar player- DO NOT SKIP THE TUTORIALS IF YOU ARE STARTING. They really help out.

If you run into any issues:

Low Memory Pop-up:
turn off Rainmeter before starting it up

Slow Distorted Audio:
Go into wherever your rocksmith files are stored
Open ""Rocksmith.ini"" with Notepad
Find ""Win32UltraLowLatencyMode=1""
change that 1 to 0 then save

Two major issues here: I can tell me guitar is definitely out of tune when it says I'm perfectly tuned. The other issue is that my sound input lags. Most people may no notice it at first, but when I play a note it lags behind for a millisecond or so, resulting in my notes always showing up late. It's definitely not me. I can hear the note playing, but the game doesn't register the note until a split second afterwards, meaning I have to play the note early to succeed, which messes up my timing on songs I actually know. Also, the base song list kinda sucks. Lots of good songs available to purchase but they're kinda expensive for a song you can only listen to while playing it in the game.

I had zero minutes of experience with the Bass, in fact finding out about this game is what led me to buy a Bass Guitar. After 13 or so hours, I am playing Behind Blue Eyes by The Who at 100% difficulty, hitting roughly 75% of the notes. Not bad for a 13 hour beginner, but my fingers are f*cking SORE.

Pros:
- Very good way to learn Bass, even if you have zero experience.
- Lessons give you a great roadmap to learn techniques and progress as a player
- Riff repeater allows you to repeatedly practice sections of each song, including slowing the tempo to train muscle memory or scaling the difficulty to include/exclude flair or accent notes.
- There's mini-games where you dont have to play actual music to practice technique, but I haven't explored it much.
- Lots of songs available, some included others as DLC.
- You don't have to buy an amp to play, just use your headphones or speakers on your PC.
- You don't have to buy a tuner, either. The game has a built in tuner. You still might want one, but its not necessary to get you up and running.
- With the RealTone cable its basically plug-and-play

Cons:
- This game is NOT $30. You have to buy a RealTone cable for $25-35 online, you have to buy an Electric Bass guitar if you dont already have one (~$200 for a basic Bass), and you probably want some other accessories like a guitar strap ($20), some picks ($5), some string grease (trust me, its worth $10), and a guitar stand ($25+ or you can 3D print one). Thats over $300 if you don't have an instrument.
- If you don't buy the RealTone cable, you still need either a microphone or a standard cable, and I can't say if those methods are nearly as good. Probably best to buy the damn cable if you are interested in the game.
- Limited song selection without buying DLC songs, which are fairly steep; $3 per song or ~$12 for a pack of 6.
- No Led Zeppelin, no Pink Floyd, no Journey. Quite a few groups do not release their Masters or allow licensing for video games.

End of the day, you have to know what you're going to get. I put about $300 into this on day one, because I had no instrument. I got myself a few songs I knew I would like, and got myself the accessories I needed. Its a very expensive barrier to entry, but once you pull the trigger you wont regret it. If you put in the time, you make progress, you're still playing an instrument so its all about practice. I see myself playing this consistently, and I hope to get good enough at Bass that I feel comfortable bringing it up to other people.",1618201405,1618201489,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The reason I want to give it a bad rep is because it checks your online connection to play, and you have to create a UPlay account with a third party to play. That's completely stupid, and unnecessary, and makes me hate the devs.

However, the game itself is amazing in most ways. It's incredibly fun, and you really do learn to play guitar. I had basically no understanding of guitar at all, and I'm gradually picking it up. My wife has played guitar for years, and she's quite good, and she loves this game too.

There are instructional videos that help you understand all the different guitar techniques needed to actually play the songs. The prompts for the notes/chords make a lot of sense. The whole system works far better than I thought it would (I was expected bugs, or not being able to pick up notes, or something else that would stop it from actually working). This really is Guitar Hero but with a real guitar. Like, I'm actually learning to play guitar because of this game! It's crazy.

Aside from the UPlay nonsense that should be banned by the gaming industry, there are a few other flaws. The menu system is clunky at times, and doesn't give an immediate response, which is annoying at times. For example, it takes like a full 4 seconds for a new menu item to come up before you can make your selection, which is painful at times.

Also, now and then instructional videos or the little games involved to help you learn do actually get finicky, where it doesn't seem to be registering the notes. For example, my wife actually knows how to play guitar. There was this chord that she already knew, and could play perfectly. The game wouldn't register it in one of the training sessions for some reason. That said, we've never had this issue in actually playing songs, so that's good.

The absolute worst part of the game is the DLC pricing. Now the game comes with, I believe, about 50 songs, which is a lot! However, the fun part of it is playing lots of songs, and you likely won't fancy many of the songs in the list. The DLCs are incredibly varied, with lots of great artists to choose from, but the pricing is absolutely ridiculous. Because of the plethora of DLCs, they ""should"" try to make it an easy purchase, so you get carried away and buy tons. However, they're so incredibly expensive that I might never buy any, or if I do, I'll only buy a very small amount. It's 3.30 Canadian dollars for a SINGLE song. You can buy packs with multiple songs, but they're not that much cheaper. There's no way I'm going to pay more than the price of the game over again just for a few more songs. I love the idea, and if they were cheaper, I'd probably be impulse buying the DLC, but not with these prices, which makes me sad. I looked and there's probably close to a hundred songs I would totally buy, but there's absolutely ZERO chance of me spending $300 on DLCs, lol. That said, the game itself is totally worth the price, even with the expensive cable.",1618200796,1618200796,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I started this game as a guitar beginner. I had attempted learning guitar once before when i was really young but quickly put it down for my more desired hobby of video games lol. After being inspired watching youtubers and watching guitarist like tim henson and ichika nito play songs i decided to go buy a cheap squire and give it another shot. I had tried youtube tutorials and apps like yousician, but i could feel my interest waning pretty fast. I didn't feel cool, i knew i was bad but i just wanted to find guitar fun first before i delved deeper into reading and studying guitar as more of a passion. This game lit that fire.

i was instantly playing along with real songs, with cool tones and accurate easy to read tabs. It took me some time to learn the ""guitar hero"" styled gameplay they use along with their notation for certain techniques. But the game taught me cool licks and chords quickly, and with the tone designer you can change your sound to essentially whatever you could want or steal authentic sounds already in the game. Also it being a game, made me want to beat the song like a level, made me want to push my percentage on the song as high as i could. 

Now this game did make guitar FUN for me, but it is important to note that this game aims to be a learning tool above all else. And it will teach you a lot if you know how to use its tools properly, i learned very quickly that grinding songs over and over again like guitar hero won't make you even an intermediate guitar player. There are video lessons in game that show you techniques and other stuff that is useful, and then it will give you a ""test"" to help you apply those skills. There is also a session mode which allows you to basically practice playing in time, there are metronomes and drum kits and other stuff you can jam with and set the bpm at a speed you want.

Now to get in something that might be obvious but, THIS GAME CAN ONLY TAKE YOU SO FAR. I have spent hundreds of hours just playing songs, and to be fair i have gotten much much better technique and speed, but have SERIOUSLY neglected some of the foundation skills you should learn as a beginner that im just now starting to go back and build. Skills like learning rhythmic notation, training your ear, notes on the fretboard, etc. All skills a beginner guitarist should be exposed to early. Use this game as a supplement to your playing and you'll be fine. Just don't be like me and procrastinate until 1k hours on a guitar to start learning the basics lmao.

Bottom line, this game is a great tool for learning but also just simply to get past that miserable first month of guitar where you suck, your fingers hurt in 10 mintues, and that overwhelmed feeling when trying to learn and not knowing where to start. Start here, learn to have FUN with the instrument first, once you get the bug, your in for thousands of hours of enjoyment. GOOD LUCK!

Also if you can't get the cable, or if you already have good audio hardware there is now easy mods that can fix this for you.  I still believe that this is a great tool for learning guitar.

--- Old Review ---
The base game is really good, it does what no other music game does and really teaches you how to play guitar. But it's crippled by it's requirement for a specific piece of hardware.

Rocksmith requires that you use the Rocksmith cable and only the Rocksmith cable. The Rocksmith cable is junk, they're expensive, fragile, and hard to find.  I haven't been able to play this game in years because of this stupid little issue, ever since my cable just stopped working.

Nothing will ever beat lessons with an expert, but this game does a lot of great things for casual players who dream of playing guitar but don't have the patience to learn a skill. Lessons are fun and personally I find playing along  to songs I like to be stress relieving. While I do not spend as much time as I would like on session mode, or doing lessons, I still feel like I have gotten a lot out of this game.

I have gone from not being able to switch between chords very quickly, to playing complex songs at 90% mastery. It's not even close to what people who have practiced their whole life can do, but I find a certain enjoyment out of being able to play these songs confidently.

Last thing I'll say, is if you played and didn't like the original Rocksmith, this one is worth checking out. It focuses on teaching chords and scales more than saying ""Press the Red String"". The songs are a lot more accurate too. After playing even the starter songs on Remastered for so long, I went back to the original Rocksmith just to play some of the original songs.

Rocksmith will not give you any real music theory knowledge, but it does provide an excellent and engaging way to play along to songs. It is a fantastic tool for beginners who are just looking into getting to know how to play and is also a lot of fun for those who have been playing for a while and just want to play along to a bunch of songs.

It definitely has some faults though. Note recognition is sometimes a bit off and you have to spend some time calibrating and dealing with latency.  It seems to run into a lot of issues when you go into lower tunings as well. There are quite a bit of quality of life improvements that obviously will not be made too. The ability to hide the locked songs so they aren't showing up in your songs list (I know they are doing it to try and sell the player on songs but its annoying as all hell).

Although if you want to learn a song accurately, up the difficulty to 100%, go into Riff Repeater and learn the song section by section with slow speed then build your speed up, because playing songs feels boring and weird on low difficulties, I personally play with Dynamic Difficulty off (because I really hate it lol) and Override everything to Max

I recommend this game, as it really helped my guitar playing to drastically improve, Although if you're planning on buying this game, I recommend buying it and Rocksmith (the original 2012 one) and the RS2014 Disc Import Tool (Those outside a sale could cost you 70 bucks so I suggest you wait for a sale), and if you are planning on playing custom songs, don't forget to buy Cherub Rock ;)",1617014930,1617014930,True,4,0,0.579288065433502197,0,True,False,False

In terms of learning guitar with it, it's down-right abysmal.

I have been playing guitar poorly my whole life, I am familiar with some chords and how to play tabs, but the main problem is the game's difficulty settings. They're trying to be WAY too smart for their own good, and when you are someone like me who learns new skills very quickly, and then can never master then, this game will drive you crazy. For me to really be able to get good at something I need to be able to change the difficulty of what I am doing depending on my mood. Sometimes I feel like actually trying, sometimes I feel like just going on auto-pilot, and this game doesn't let you do that.

The difficulty for this game is either automatic, or stationary unless you are in the riff repeater. You can change your sight reading level so that every song you play starts off at a higher level if you are a more advanced player, but once the difficulty has gone up you are stuck using the riff repeater to get better; Setting the difficulty settings to default simply changes the settings themselves, not the actual difficulty of each song, which will be determined by all your sessions playing that song, and cannot be manually set unless you are practicing in the riff repeater.

I have been trying to let a song go without playing it to drop my difficulty, I have automatic difficulty on and my drop rate is faster, but it seems to be able to tell that I am not actually playing so it isn't going down. I have tried strumming rapidly and my difficulty won't go down. I don't know why they chose to do it this way, but it's infuriating. I understand it is a ME problem, but I just can't play the game the same in the riff repeater. I am always tempted to look down at the guitar to confirm my chords, but when I play the actual game my brain lets myself just move my hand and make the chords. Clearly the difficulty setting can be changed, because it happens in the background automatically. Just SUCH a shame.",1616583664,1616583664,False,1,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

# Problem - Guitar / TV latency

There can be some latency in the signal from your guitar. This kills musicality and beginners might not even notice. Problematic. It's necessary to go into sound device settings and set the speaker output format to the same exact format as the Rocksmith cable.. Generally ""DVD quality"" or ""Studio Quality"" I can't remember. This is mandatory and there is no other way to do it.

Modern televisions processes the video signal so that it looks better on the showroom and so that they can raise the price by selling bullet points on the box. This is a dirty trick. The latency is the TV image is unbelievably high these days. When I talk about TV post processing lag I'm SPECIFICALLY talking about the time between when you pluck a string and when you hear your own sound coming back through the speakers. This kind of lag wrecks the experience and can't be solved by adjusting timing in the game's settings. The game's timing settings only control the sound offset between the game's visuals and the game's sound. The more important issue is the delay between playing a note and hearing the note. This is _BAD_ and may kill the experience for the player. Hook a computer up to the HDMI in your TV and plug headphones directly into the computer and you'll see how jarring the timing difference is. If you haven't built a sensitivity then you won't notice.. But even if you don't the impact to playing along with music will still be there. Timing is a critical part of playing music.

## Solution - Bypassing Television Audio

If you're playing on a TV then you need to run the audio output directly into speakers or headphones to remove the lag. Running video or audio through HDMI into the TV will result in lag. What we need to do is remove the audio lag. The video lag is not as important and this can be adjusted in the Rocksmith menu.

## Alternate Solution 

Go to the in-game mixer and turn off your own guitar/bass sound. Listen to the song as recorded by the artists while playing your own instrument. This removes any sense of delay. The songs aren't multi-tracked so you can still hear the original instruments play.

# Problem - Obstacles to Accurate Tone Detection

Unfortunately standing in front of a computer or a TV playing or being plugged into the USB port of a computer can cause some interference and buzzing in the signal. The buzzing isn't so bad since you can absorb the electric field into your hand while muting strings or turn the volume knob down. But it can influence the ease at which the game identifies the notes being played.

## Solution - Calibration Tricks and Guitar Configuration

You can reduce the buzzing during ""calibration"". When the game asks you to 'mute the strings' you would normally rest your hand on the strings on the neck of the guitar. Instead, gently mute the strings then remove your hand so that the interference plays gently into the game. This won't completely remove the problem but it can noticeably reduce it. If you have problems with note recognition then calibrate again with normal muting. I don't think you'll have problems though.

It's important to have fresh (fresh enough anyway) strings and sometimes you'll find that certain pickup settings are ""picked up"" better by the game than others. If you're having trouble with note detection check intonation, pickup / tone / volume settings, and finally string age.

It can really help if you play the strings softly which.. is just a normal part of playing guitar.. but can be difficult for beginners to do. It's difficult enough for beginners to imagine in the first place.

# Complaints

1. The ""Guitar Hero"" style notation is a reasonable and fine way of showing you what strings to play. It takes some time but it becomes easy enough over time. It contains a lot of information including details about bending up or down, emphasis on notes, etc. But things like arpeggios can be unnecessarily difficult.

2. Just a small thing, but... I spent hundreds of hours in ""Learn a Song"" mode.. The game didn't actually tell me how critical ""Score Mode"" was.. After playing just a few hours in Score Mode I was able to unlock multiple new songs. I wish I would have known about it sooner. I wasn't interested in unlocking skins or cabinets or whatever. I only wanted the new songs.

# Rocksmith is Great

This game is basically what I've been waiting for for 20 years. Guitar Hero was cute but this is the real deal. IF you get set up correctly you can really build your technique. There's lessons that teach the beginner some basic ideas, dynamic difficulty (which I find jarring, but could be good for people sensitive to losing and frustration), and real music.

If you can get yourself some real tone cables and feel like setting up your sound device settings then this is a no brainer.

Harmonix seems to have moved on to more game-like projects for now. I hope that they come back to projects specifically designed for real instruments. Until then, this should keep you busy if you're into guitar or bass.",1607847798,1615880954,True,53,2,0.817704200744628906,0,True,False,False

Great learning tool for people wanting to learn guitar or bass but don't have the resources for a teacher or just want to see if learning guitar or bass is something for them, especially in that early phase where learning chords, scales, roles in the band, and beats seems can seem boring or difficult to learn. It also can help newcomers to music understand how equipment effects your over all sound with it's many emulations of popular amps and effects; which is helpful for when you do want to get the real life equipment, you know the differences between an orange to marshall to fender style amplifiers and what pedals to get with them to achieve your sound. 
Also a must if you do know guitar and play in a cover band; it's a fun way to learn the artist's songs and how they achieve their sound; which works way better than the tabs you find online.

It's teaching tools are somewhat flawed and I never touch the tutorial videos, weird guitarcade games or session mode. It's basically good for teaching how to play individual songs which is a good way to get started but you're really on your own for learning scales and any kind of theory. After a while, playing Rocksmith feels more like you're... playing Rocksmith as apposed to the guitar if that makes sense. You find yourself reliant on the visuals rather than following the music on your own. It's a good way to get started, a fun time waster, decent way to learn specific songs (like interactive tabs) and maybe a good way to challenge yourself with songs above you're level but ultimately your real education is in your own hands. Hands down a better idea than Rock Band and their fake guitars though.

On the down side... It's ubisoft and it's handled like one of their B grade game which means it has an insultingly bad interface, it's buggy as hell, it crashes and occasionally requires lengthy google searches to fix. At times it can throw fits and refuse to recognize the Rocksmith cable and It can take a LOT of time to get the input delay worked out of your system and the scrolling notes to line up properly.

It has a community with plenty of custom songs but the quality is very mixed. In my experience, most of the custom songs have at least a few mistakes in them including wrong notes, weird fingering, visuals slightly off tempo or, in some cases it's all completely correct but the way it's laid out is messy and hard to understand. The community generally speaking isn't super active. some songs get updated over time but most don't and stay wrong forever. You have to keep in mind that most of the people playing this game or beginners and intermediate players which are the people creating the custom songs so it's hard to expect too much and they are, of course, free so you can't be too mad but it is something to keep in mind.

I am by no way means a professional, but I performed the following maintenance using YouTube videos as a guide.

> String Height & Action Adjustments
> Saddles adjustments
> Guitar neck alignment
> Set of fresh strings

Rocksmith has a weird tendency to combine Rhythm and Lead guitar parts, and sometimes the tabs are just flat out wrong (since the devs don't consult tabs but look at videos and try their hardest to match the artist), I can't really fault them for that though, but it does make songs way harder when not even the original musician could play the song like how they set up.

It's a good tool for seeing progress on a song but don't count on it/get discouraged when you score lower then you think because this game has a tendency to drop notes, or count muted strings as ""hits"" for some reason.

I've had times where i've played the wrong chords but because the strings were muted below what I was playing, it still gave me the note.

I've learned how to play some 20 years ago, and it's been at least 15 years since the last time I played the instrument. So, chords, intervals, division of timing, reading tabs... these are all already common place - and I'm sure all of that makes playing the game much easier for sure.

(Also, I've played a lot of Guitar Hero and Rock Band back in the day!).

That being said, I'm really impressed how the game is good in evolving the Gutiar Hero concept to have some serious learning and playing. The lessons are very nice, the replay training is one of the best things I've used to learn and develop my techniques and I've realized that the fact that it's hard to look away from the screen when you don't really know the song is one of the best tool to develop this ""muscle memory"" to find the strings and the frets! :-)

If you are really starting from scratch, with no previous knowledge of music, I'd recommend to read some theory together with playing the game - so you can get some details.

To expand off of my TL;DR, this is a fun way to practice guitar and bass tabs, but it isn't without its faults, being the peripheral itself, its extensive and arguably overpriced DLC, and lack of third party support (mods.) It does a good way slowly ""teaching"" you how to play a song, but a lot of people argue helps you memorize patterns rather than actually teaching you, which I completely agree. Rocksmith is great for practicing, but I know with my own experiences, on console and now on PC, the retention of how to play a song isn't the best. This isn't Yousician or a personalized guitar training course and if you're looking to actually learn the ins and outs of guitar, specific techniques (like slapping, how to properly tap, etc,)  music theory or what have you, this is the wrong tool.  Rocksmith sets itself up as being more of a, ""guitar hero"" clone but with an actual guitar. There's a lot to be desired here if you're actually trying to learn how to play guitar and not just learn songs through mimicry, but even for someone like myself who's trying to re-learn musical skills Rocksmith does have a purpose, which is practicing. Just don't go in with the mindset that you'll be a master after a couple hours of playing Smoke on the Water over and over again.

Also just a heads up, the official real tone cable is absolute garbage. Lots of frustration to get it to work properly, so I'd recommend you find an alternative to the official cable, one that hopefully doesn't inconsistently draw power, or grab a powered usb hub to act as a bridge for the cable to work.",1613088372,1613191932,True,1,0,0.463298112154006958,0,True,False,False

My background is that I attempted to learn to play guitar in my preteens (2 decades ago) and only got to the point of being barely passable on a couple blink 182 and Oasis songs I learned directly from tabs.  While not being a musician in any sense of the word, I did briefly play a variety of instruments when I was younger, and would not consider myself musically challenged nor accomplished.

The first 2-3 weeks I was really diligent, putting in 1-3 hours a day in most the lessons and some games/songs to get ""over the hump"" on the basics so I could start enjoying some of the simpler songs.  The lessons are important early and the games are just okay (some better than others) for specifically practicing mechanics, but you are here to play songs, so songs will inevitably take on 98% of play time for most people once you learn enough to get dangerous.  Since then, I have been much less diligent but still making steady progress.  While having not taken the time to learn some of the more complex chords, quick chord sequencing, or complicated riffs, I can now 100% ~8 songs and can get ~80% on pretty much any song that doesn't rely on a lot of above mechanics.  Recently, I was rewarded with a ""how far you've come"" moment when I picked up the entire Coldplay list and got >80% on every song in my first play through (I always max speed and difficultly in the first play through to know what I'm getting into and adjust from there).

I certainly do not consider myself a ""real guitar player"" at this point, but with just 80hrs invested, I can certainly sound and feel like a ""real guitar player"" when I need a creative outlet and mental reset.  Furthermore, I feel like I have a good foundation to build upon if I ever do decided to focus more on it for additional stretches of diligence and maybe even progress to being a real guitar player... and that's really the magic of the game, you make real progress, you feel like you are really doing it, and with a little more effort (and external learning of proper techniques/habits) you can REALLY do it.  

One side note, while I would definitely consider it worth it, this is probably the most expensive ""game"" ever.  Initial cost $30 game + $15 cable + $230 HHS Squire Strat (best beginner guitar imo, humbucker variant important for game) = $275.  Since then I have bought a second cable (first died), a little over $100 on DLC songs, and a $500 Schecter C1 Platinum (best midrange guitar imo).  So I'm in total of ~$900 on this ""game"", but a lot of that is recoverable if I had to and that is still less than in-person lessons would be by itself.  In reflection, given the progress and joy I've experienced becomes a pseudo guitar player, I'd have spent more. =)",1612561861,1612561861,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]-[/b]All DLC from original Rocksmith will transfer to this title. There's really no reason to buy the old game anymore.
[b]-[/b]You'll need to purchase the Real Tone cable for electric guitar/bass
[b]-[/b]REAL TONE CABLE WILL NOT WORK WITH EVERY TYPE OF USB PORT BECAUSE IT NEEDS CORRECT VOLTAGE. IF YOU HAVE CHEAP (EVEN 3.0) USB PORTS ON YOUR PC CASE, THEN WINDOWS WILL NOT RECOGNIZE THE CABLE OR LOAD THE CORRECT DRIVERS. This can be fixed by using a separately powered USB hub OR by installing a PCIe USB card that connects to your pc's power supply (I bought a cheap Rosewill card on [url=http://newegg.com] Newegg [/url] and fixed driver issues immediately)
[b]-[/b]Low quality instruments can make this game unplayable - see cons.
[b]-[/b]If you only want to play heavier, down-tuned songs, read this entire review and save yourself the $.
[b]-[/b]No option for in-game tabs. Do yourself a favor and google ""RocksmithToTab"" to create tabs that will play in Guitar Pro 5 or newer from your entire Rocksmith library, including DLC. (YOU ARE GOING TO NEED THEM.)
[b]-[/b]When learning most songs, there will be times that this game simply frustrates the user by throwing in notes/chords that cannot possibly be understood by a human. Rather than cursing the game and giving up, switch over to your tabs and teach yourself the most challenging parts the old fashioned way (with a hacked version of GP5, of course.) Then you can come back into the game and kick the song's ass!
[b]-[/b]Don't have GP5 software? Just google the paper tab from any number of websites out there. Still beats trying to learn tiny bits of songs from the Riff Repeater mode.


[h1]*Pros*[/h1]
[b]-[/b]Much more polished than the original Rocksmith game. Virtually better in every category. Base soundtrack is 100x better imo
[b]-[/b]Amazing concept
[b]-[/b]Fantastic learning tool w/ video lessons, spoken instructions, and subtitles while walking you through the learning process.

[h1]*Cons* ...and how to overcome them[/h1]
[b]-[/b]Can't state this enough....most of this game is built for and advertised directly at people who are new to their instrument. What they don't tell you is that BEGINNER players usually have BEGINNER instruments and those may not be optimal. If you have a fairly inexpensive guitar or bass, you'll probably need to replace strings and maybe have the instrument looked at by your local shop to get it sounding as good as possible.
[b]-[/b]The above-mentioned issue can be EXTENSIVELY worse when playing in lower tunings on any type of wound strings. It seems that the software is too sensitive when reading the frequency of wound strings (the 3 thickest ones) when tuned below E standard. Pressing the strings too hard in this situation will count as a bend and you will miss all of the notes, even though you play them correctly. Sometimes you can get away with using a very very light touch with your fretting hand. I've found that lighter string gauges can also help here, but you get what you pay for in terms of your instrument & Rocksmith's capabilities to read sludge.
[b]-[/b]Expect a learning curve in navigating the game's menu structure and available modes/tools/etc. It can be a bit frustrating if you don't know how to address specific issues. When in doubt, just back out and retry your songs anew until you get it down.
[b]-[/b]The difficulty settings in this game feel half-baked. In theory, having the game adjust difficulty mid-song is a good idea. The problem lies in the incredibly convoluted visual language they are trying to use (e.g. nobody is ever going to be able to read the expert-level notes on this game like Guitar Hero.) Leveling up in difficulty seems to be tied to speeding up the Sightreading setting, which makes no sense when they are constantly throwing new chord shapes and techniques into the mix. ""Here are some new things to throw you off, and before you get a chance to learn them all, we're going to reduce the time that you can read them."" Makes no sense and takes the fun out of learning new songs beyond your current difficulty level. Again, this is where having the tabs comes in handy and saves the game from becoming punishment.
[b]-[/b]Getting 100% score on some technique lessons is tough. I complained about this in the past, but have since realized that actual guitar lessons are not supposed to be easy... which means not all lessons are fun to master. Come to this mode when you are ready to grind a bit & improve. 

[h1]*Overall*[/h1]
[b]-[/b]I dig this as a learning tool or something to make guitar practice a bit interesting. If playing guitar isn't already fun for you, then this may feel like a chore to learn but is ultimately worth the investment if you follow the advice in this review.
[b]-[/b]For beginners that do not own an amp, this could be a solid substitute while also saving floor space. 
[b]-[/b]There is so much to love about Rocksmith Remastered. It feels experimental at times but ultimately works as advertised IF you come prepared for the right gig. New players may encounter some serious issues to get this running as expected.

Original review:
Ever since the days of Guitar Hero, I've wanted a game like this with a real guitar. What a great idea! Unfortunately, getting this to work in 2020 is a bit of a pain in the butt. After several hours of tinkering with things, I finally got it to work. 

If you play with an acoustic guitar, you need to have a USB microphone. I tired using a real mic plugged into my sound card and it wouldn't work at all. I plugged in a cheap USB mic and suddenly everything worked (still not great, but I could play songs). 

My guitar happens to be an acoustic-electric. I had read bad things about the Rocksmith Realtone Cable's build quality, which is ""required"" to be able to play. I bought a generic USB guitar cable and with a bit of googling, installed the nocable mod and it actually works now. I haven't had a ton of time to mess around but I like what I've done so far.

Other minor annoyances: 
The UI is terrible to navigate and takes way too many clicks to do basic things.

Every time you start the game, you have to sit through 1 minute or so of logos and logging into Ubisoft's servers. Closing the game takes 30 seconds of mashing escape to return to the splash screen and then more mashing escape to get back to the desktop.

Every time I load the game or tab out, my mic stops working and/or gets turned down to 17%. This prevents me from being able to talk on Discord while I play.

I'm glad I got this on sale because I had to spend an extra $20 on accessories to achieve basic functionality.",1605181757,1612063810,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It has a heap of songs to learn, lots of lessons, custom session bands, you can make your own guitar tones. 
To state the obvious, you do need a guitar and you'll need to get a specific ubisoft cable, but they're on ebay for pretty cheap.

Graphics 10/10: they do their job flawlessly, they convey the information needed and make you feel awesome when you get a good combo going.

Audio 10/10: Same as above, except even more so because there are so many options to chose from with the digital amplifiers and pedals.

Gameplay 10/10: I absolutely adore this approach to learning guitar. Imagine Guitar Hero but with over 200 times the amount of buttons and you have Rocksmith. The game gives you many ways to adjust difficulty. first there's the adaptive difficulty that adjusts the difficulty of the song automatically based on your performance, there's what I like to call the ""rigid difficulty"" where you set the difficulty and its set for the entire song. And then there's the speed option that you can use in the game's ""practice mode"" of sorts where you can't complete the song (it restarts when you finish) in this mode but you can learn the layout for the real deal.

UI 7/10: it's good but has flaws, firstly, if you go to the score attack mode in ""learn a song"" you need to go all the way back to the song list in score attack, then through a couple more menus in ""guitarcade"" (the game's minigame area,) and the finally to the main menu to access ""learn a song"" again. there's also the fact that clicking sometimes doesn't do anything, some menus allow you to use the mouse to select while others only accept the [ENTER] key, it can be a bit confusing.

Teaching ability ??/10: This game also has lessons that teach you the fundamentals of guitar and beyond. these involve videos teaching the concept, followed by a practice chart to get you familiarized to the concept, repeat this cycle about 2 or 3 times, slowly getting into slightly more complex areas of the topic, then finally followed by a practice song that you will be ""graded"" on, this grade is dependent on the difficulty of the song and your accuracy in the song. for example if the song is at 50% difficulty and you get an overall accuracy of 80%, your score will be 40%. you can repeat these at any time and the score will change to reflect improvement but will never fall. I am currently using it to learn guitar but haven't finished so im not giving it a concrete rating yet. For now it's a 10.

Overall score 9.4: I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to learn guitar (make sure you have a nice Squier or something, y'know something nice but not overly expensive so it's easier to play.) It's a fun interactive way to at the very least spice up your practice. Even if you are a guitar god I would still recommend this to you as just a game. you can play tons of the best songs in the world and compete for a high score in the score attack leaderboard if that's your thing, or just install modded songs and goof around.",1610163934,1610163934,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Everything's been dramatically reorganized so you can instantly focus on what you need more practice at without the annoyance of going back to the main menus. Additionally, the format has switched from a gamification-focused system of points to a precision-focused system of percentages. Now you're practicing to get the songs right instead of to get the songs kind of okay.

rocksmith is an app that helps you learn and train on songs proposed on the app
it feature note recognition at a great level (bend, slide recognition)
how is the app compared to other apps :
well, i find this one pretty great because it's a one time payment only : no subscription
it """"require a real tone cable"""" (will talk about that later)
it has lessons so you can learn the basics, and even train

it has an adaptative difficulty that you can toggle on or off
you can tweak the difficulty, speed and more

[b][u]the cable :[/u][/b]
so if you are like me and you don't want to depend on a cable, you can use an amp to send the sound in your computer, it'll require a bit of setting up, but if done correctly, i'll work

if you don't have any thing that can bring sound to your computer, you still can use the app, but you won't get access to all the features
(ex : you own an accoustic and have no mic) (you own an electric, no mic or realtone)

[b][u]What was my experience :[/u][/b]
i started with A BIG STRUGGLE to get the app working with my amp as i don't have the cable yet and don't want to depend on it.

i started to try to get an input from the amp
so i tried usb (didn't work because it was not reconised as a mic)
so i tried jack mic input (worked because it was reconised as a mic)
but now the sound was cutting ( never knew how the thing fixed it self)
i tried the no cable patch (didn't work for me)
i tried the audio interface  (didn't work for me)
i tried the direct input patch (ref : steam guide) (worked !!)
now i had too much noise :
so to fix the noise, i tweaked my ini file in the game folder 
ExclusiveMode=1
Win32UltraLowLatencyMode=0

then lowered the microphone input in windows at 50
kept the amplification at 0 tho

on the amp, put the gain and volume to max as well as on the guitar
the game now reconise every single notes pretty well

if you don't want to do all of that you can buy the cable for 30€

and if you are on an accoustic you'll have to use the mic fonction and have a mic pointed at your guitar.


[b][u]Should i buy the game[/u][/b]
[b][u]yes if :[/u][/b]
you want to learn/ train on  songs and techniques
you want the good old guitar hero vibe

[b][u]
no if :

you don't have a guitar at all
you don't want to buy anything more than the game and don't have anything to make it work

I've learned to read tablature, but not having any formal instruction at all, I have no clue how fingering should be done, etc.  I want to play songs that actually sound like songs, and not just my half-ass strumming that gets me bummed out when it doesn't sound anything close to the original. Or the timing, or anything.
So for 25 years I've fumbled around, learning a few riffs here or there. I could play maybe 5 songs decently?  
   Actually in February 2020 I posted on facebook ""well, I've come to accept that I'm ALWAYS going to suck at playing guitar.""   I thought about even selling it.  I was never going to get any enjoyment out of this.

Enter Rocksmith.  I bought it when the pandemic hit and I was going to be at home for longer periods of time.  I put in the work.  I bought some song packs so I could learn some of my favorite songs.
   I was dismayed at the pace.  AT FIRST.  Because when you start a new song often you do one or two notes in the sequence, and not *all* of them, so it sounds awkward...  
    But then I put in a few more hours.  The game set up to scroll basically the tablature at you as you are playing, but it also shows numbers above the notes that correspond to which of your fingers should be playing.
   Then I go through some of the songs a second or third time, and it starts adding more notes to the difficulty.  it started to click.  
    I went from 25 years of having a guitar sitting around, collecting dust, that I could play maybe 3 songs in their entirety and actually sound decent.. and the rest was.. just crap...
     To... 9 months and almost 100 hours in on Rocksmith, and I'm now scoring nearly 100% on some of my favorite tunes, and I've learned to play many others.  And the fingering... getting used to the patterns and the finger shapes has enabled me to really branch out and learn new songs...
   Last week when I played Foo Fighters ""the Pretender"" and nailed *every note*...  I honestly got teary eyed.
It's one of my absolute favorite tunes, and I'd never thought I'd ever play it well.  And I f--king rocked it.

I'm not a rock star. I don't play in public, I play around my kids and for my enjoyment and maybe sometimes with a few friends.  Rocksmith has really given me a massive amount of enjoyment out of this old instrument I've always wanted to play, but never could quite get it.

A tad high entry price, what with the cable requirement and how sodding difficult it can be to get hold of at times, but past that, 100% recommended and then some.

Would almost say that this could be a full supplement for traditional guitar tutoring, with a combination of typical tutorials and a fantastic Guitarcade which gamify all the basic fundamentals and muscle memory training in a sometimes cheesy, but very effective manner, before getting you to the pièce de résistance, Learn a Song, which will get your fingers dancing across your fretboard in no time.

Only negatives I've had are the cable pickup sometimes not being accurate whatsoever, only passing notes after downtuning, usually the E and A strings, as a result sounding horribly inaccurate (BUT, this may just be my low-tier Behringer), and the Uplay account requirements and uplay related updates sometimes crashing the game. Not that long a list.

All in all it's undoubtedly a rocking good time to learn!

They give you access to chords and all other guitar techniques but it's not as entertaining/supported as just playing songs. I learned guitar through this game and it works wonders if you actually put the hours of dedication in to learn. The song discography is really good and spans across multiple tunings and genres and the perks of getting it on PC is that you can get custom songs that aren't included in the game.

The way it teaches you guitar is very stress free, it'll maybe send you a note or two for each part of the song and once you nail those, it'll keep adding on till you're playing all the actual notes and chords. If you aren't nailing them, it'll keep sending the same notes at ya till you do. 

There's also a nice system called Riff Repeater that also just allows you to repeat one section of the song over and over at any speed or difficulty till you have it down so you don't have to restart the entire song repeatedly just to get tries at that pesky solo holding you back.

overall 9.5/10!! 

Con: Occasionally there are issues with the guitar cable where the game doesn't pick up what you're playing especially in lower tunings and that can be annoying in terms of boosting your accuracy on a song that you know 100%, but in E Standard and Drop D that rarely happens.",1516402465,1608685488,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The problem with this game is as you are playing, you have no time to actually look down at your guitar, and for beginners (who this is intended for), that is the one thing you cant do. You cant look at your fretting to see what note you are actually playing. Maybe the absolute basic training is decent, but I mainly looked at the actual song playing portion. Not only is the 1/4"" to USB adapter horrible at picking anything up, so either you can play one fret too low or high and it counts, or you play the perfect note at the perfect time and it doesnt register, but ALSO that combined with the fact that you can only play if youve completely memorized the entire fretboard and know exactly where each fret is just by feel. All this game did for me was make me feel like a worse guitarist (Ive been playing for over a couple years now). Certain notes flat out dont register and says you are getting them wrong. If you want to learn songs, just look up tabs or tutorials as this is a complete waste of money. Out of curiosity, I went to learn South of Heaven by Slayer (I hadnt learned it yet). I spent about an hour getting super frustrated and making zero progress, so I decided to look up a tab for the song and learned the main riff in under 15 minutes. This was because you can look at what notes you need to play and play it over and over again without a program ridiculing you for playing incorrectly (regardless of whether or not you actually are). This game is literally a complete waste of money, time, and anger.

The interface is done in a way that if you come from a plastic guitar background you can easily pick up and play.

I was addicted to Guitar Hero when it came out, but I always felt stupid strumming a plastic toy guitar as an adult. I somehow found out about this game after googling if there was a game that let you play a real guitar like Guitar Hero. When I learned of Rocksmith a year ago after that google search, I immediately bought the game and also purchased a cheap Glarry guitar ($100) to practice on. 

Where am I after 1 year of playing? Well, after only 1 year of playing ~ 2 hours everyday, I can sight-read most songs on 100% difficulty and get roughly 60-80% accuracy on my first try with songs I have never played before. I am close to 100% accuracy on lots of songs from Pink Floyd, System of a Down, Def Leppard, Rammstein, the Doors, etc. I still make tons of mistakes and my fingers aren't always accurate, but I am making progress everyday and it is only motivating me to keep practicing.  

If you want to learn the guitar, buy this game, plug in your guitar, and have fun. Seriously, that's it. Do NOT WORRY OR FEEL FRUSTRATED AT THE LACK OF RESULTS. They will come slowly if you are persistent. 

I didn't even touch the little mini-game exercises, I went straight into playing songs that interested me on the easiest difficulty. After a few months, I'd bump up the difficulty a little more until I was finally playing on the hardest level. My first song I ever got 100% on was Man in the Box by Alice in Chains and that took me almost 4 months to nail down at first. 

I still have my up and down days, but the most important thing I have learned is to trust the process, have fun and also don't forget to give yourself breaks for a day or two.",1607891086,1607891086,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

HOWEVER, I'm not really a fan of it only doing the Guitar Hero-style of disembodied notes coming towards you.  It really needs to have an option to feed you tabs in a scrolling fashion (or even better, actual standard music notation for those wanting to learn) so that you can actually follow along.  It's almost impossible to learn anything meaningful with this guitar Synthesia.

The lessons aren't too bad.  I did a few of 'em just to see what they're like, and might be alright for the casual beginner to pick up a few things.

I also had problems using a tone cable.  Might be more WIndows 10's fault for recognizing it as a microphone instead of line-in, but I was not able to use it as tone mode in the game.  The game DID recognize the signal from my electric guitar in microphone mode, but that also means that the guitar doesn't play through the computer speakers, so I ended up having to connect the tone cable to a splitter with headphones and plugging that into an actual guitar amp - pretty annoying that I had to break out a guitar amp to use as a monitor.

All of this being said, the casual player wanting to learn a few notes on a guitar might enjoy this game.

After years prior trying to get into guitar, this game finally got me playing guitar. The lessons start off perfect. Other programs I've come across try to throw too much at you in terms of music theory. Rocksmith starts off as simple as can be started and just gets you playing the guitar. This is what other learning systems fail to do. They fail to get you just playing guitar and focus too much on proper technique and music theory. What good is all of that if you aren't going to be playing the instrument? Just show me how to play notes to a song, like Rocksmith. While music theory and proper technique are all important, and you probably should eventually study that, the biggest thing in the beginning is that you actually start enjoying guitar, because if you don't start immediately enjoying it, you will probably walk away. Rocksmith won't teach you much in terms of theory (it can teach you some scales which is probably the most valuable thing to learn anyway), but it is the best way to get started on guitar and, after that, keep your guitar chops sharpened.

Well...

Except, Ubisoft, the content M.A.F.I.A. and their fucking greed screwed up the gameplay for you.

You only get a handful of old songs with the base game. Each additional song adds a premium on top.
Want to play songs you already bought somewhere else? Nope, sirree. You can buy a DLC to ""convert"" what you already bought for the first Rocksmith game to RS2014. Sure, I'm gonna pay again for... nothing? It's basically still the same game. Except, it's a lot more annoying.

The ""online features"" that are forced down your throat are the cherry on the top. Want to dive right into the action? Nope, you gotta to skip at least two ""why don't you log in?"" screens (that I don't five a fucking shit about) before you actually get to the main menu. And even there, it's confusing what you have to do to start playing.

""Mastered"" a song already? Cool! Let's practice until you can play it by heart and become the rock star you've always wanted to be!
Oh, but... Now you gotta play by heart without knowing what you're doing. Great. How do I get back to the full tablature set without actually hiding all the notes so I can practice?

It just wasn't great learning and was hard to stay enthusiastic, although I did get decent with different strum patterns during this time. I then tried my luck with learning from tabs that I'd get online. The tabs only brought me so far as I'd get discouraged because it'd be hard for me to put it together and replicate the song. Then, guitar hero came out, and my friend group really took to it as we were also DDR players back then lol. We'd play day and night trying to get to the hardest difficulty and perfect the songs. But again, it didn't translate to improving further with the actual guitar. Over the years I kept trying and linking up with very talented musicians, but still it just didn't feel like I was progressing. Quarantine hit this year so I picked Rocksmith 2014 on sale for like $9, then got the cable ($30) for it a couple weeks later. I was instantly blown away at how comprehensive the lessons are towards learning the song of your choice. They start you slow and adapt to how you're doing, and there's video lessons/games to also help with different techniques. I've been someone who hasn't been able to put a complete song together in ~15 years, and in just 4 days I learned Foo Fighters - Everlong. I get that it's not the most difficult song, but for someone like me, getting a complete song down and now being able to play it without the game is HUGE.

1. The UI is bad. Its not terrible but its not great. Invert the string display after you boot the first time if you're used to reading tab. That said, its not guitar hero. Making a UI that covers the entirety of what a guitar can do is a thankless task. 

2. Don't get frustrated when you first start. Once your get over the UI the rest is natural. The difficulty ramps automatically in the ""learn a song"" mode in a way that I absolutely love. You never get comfortable until you actually master a song. 

3. Don't buy the proprietary USB cable. Buy a standard USB to 1/4"" jack input cable from Amazon. Its cheaper, more reliable, and more useful in the long run. 

4. The game doesn't support blue tooth head sets or ear buds. Kind of a let down. If that's a deal breaker for you, I don't know any way around it. I think the reasoning is the response lag.

This is a great tool for guitarists of any skill level to improve. the default library has a solid mix of both genres and difficulty and are fun to learn. The minigames are great for improving general guitar skill. The returning riff repeater feature is excellent for learning those tough riffs, such as the intro for Muse's Plug In Baby, or for nailing a solo, such as the one in Iron Maiden's The Trooper. The selection of DLC is large and continuously expanding, plus you can use the pre-existing DLC tracks for Rocksmith 1. I'd say the cons lie in the rest of the main features. The Jam mode is jam packed with backing instruments, allowing you to fully customize it's sound, but amounts to instruments that play one note while you solo in a chosen scale, rather than an AI band. The Tone Designer is similarly full of options to modify and pedals to play with, but in general sounds rather bad, the game adding too much gain and washing out the subtleties. The Tones built for songs however, sound pretty solid. The game is known to occasionally require some tweaking of your sound card settings after installing to work properly. Overall, i'd say its is well worth a full price for a game, given the DLC library and tools for building skill.

---------------------------

Let's see, over 470 hours in this game, yeah, it's a'ight.

The simplest way I can describe this is guitar/bass karaoke. Using the real-tone cable (sold separately or with the game on disk), you can hook up any electric guitar or bass and actually PLAY actual Licensed, everyday popular music.

Granted, if you've never picked up a stringed instrument before, there IS a learning curve. But just the fact you'll be learning with actual, relevant, cool songs that you really enjoy... why would you pass that up?

Will you become a rock star using this? Probably not. The best way to view this is as another tool in your tool belt. Getting actual, hands-on lessons IRL will Always help. In fact, it's highly recommended that you do that FIRST, before playing this game (if possible) so you don't develop any bad habits or practices that you may have to unlearn down the line.

This may not be a subsitute for guitar lessons, specially if you really want to get into music theory, but it certainly gives you a reason to pick up your guitar and keep playing it. The transcriptions are not always perfect (sometimes they are a bit off), and this is not really a ""game"" in the usual sense of the word; it contains some mini-games that you can play to practice different aspects of guitar playing, but they are not that great as videogames. 

In the end, I've found nothing that comes close to Rocksmith when it comes to motivating me to keep playing. Learning to play any instrument, specially at a remotely competent level, is very hard, specially if you're doing it alone, and it takes a lot of time and effort. It's very easy to lose motivation. Rocksmith is not perfect, but it has helped me immensely. Just don't expect a Guitar Hero or Rockband clone.

So, about 200 hours of practice later, it's sad to see the DLC support come to an end, but it's had a great run, and there are still a few packs I haven't bought that I'm interested in.

So I had an early mid life crisis and decided to try again at learning the guitar, tried with acoustic but I prefer the sound of electric and I'm hoping I can transfer my newly found skills over if I need to.

Before I go into more detail, you will need the Rocksmith cable or whatever else there is you can use to connect the guitar to the PC via USB or other audio equipment which as you've guessed it, do not come with the game, I got my Rocksmith cable off amazon. I'm also a complete novice and cannot read sheet music but I was pretty darn good at guitar hero, which is what attracted me to this. I'm obviously going to have to have real lessons should I go further than just playing badly in my living room but that's for future me to decide :).

The game is pretty comprehensive for newbies like me, learning all the basics of how to play and do certain things that the more experienced and pro's do with ease and it also makes no effort to hide that it does require practice, effort and dedication. But the game also makes you sound better than you are, which I think is great as it does so in order to boost your confidence when playing the [i]""learn a song""[/i] mode and when switching to the lessons part will highlight it to you that you are making a mistake and will make you keep going over it until you get it right, or at least until the game thinks you have done it right.

The caveat to this is that once you've done what's required in the lesson it throws a practice riff at you using the techniques you've just learned which is great, but its hard work transferring that around the fret board.

The lessons are great at showing you how to go about the various techniques, chords, harmonics etc... I'm learning so much from it, but its never going to substitute lessons from a certified professional in one on one or class lessons but all it has to do is get you into it and at least capable of said techniques so that you should decide you want to go further you will have covered them already giving you a head started, some might say that [i]""it is hard to fill a cup that is already full""[/i], but I disagree on this occasion. I've essentially had 17 guitar for dummies lessons at an hour each and about 5 hours of that is just me playing learn a song mode thinking I'm a rock god.... lol but it is motivating me to do more.

There's so much more for me to get into in terms of the lessons, what it does lack is showing you how to hold your fretting hand properly and teaching you hand and wrist exercises in order to get your hands in those difficult to reach positions but at this price point, discounted or otherwise it does all it needs to.

Due to how much knowledge is in it I'm not even bothered about the price per song or song pack, it's not like I will want to play every song as there only so many genres I'm into and that will surely go for every one. If you do want to be absurd and buy everything its going to cost you a pretty penny even at discount but that's irrelevant really.

If like me, you take the plunge into learning by getting a cheap electric, I got my Fender Stratocaster with a cheap AMP for £220 which from what I've found is cheap, and you loved guitar hero, then this is the perfect accompaniment for your intro into Rock Heaven.

It seems there are some issue with sound lag that are quite common.
One in particular is occurs at the point of loading the game and it the sound lags so badly it sounds like a distorted robot.... turns out there is an easy fix to this (see link) https://www.andrewhawkes.co.uk/blog/how-to-fix-robotic-slow-and-distorted-sound-on-rocksmith-2014-pc , but honestly it would leave you feeling more trustworthy of the game if this was advice easily accessible from the developer and not something you have to search online for an answer to.

Overall, there seems to be a pretty good selection of songs available to purchase and the ones included with the base game are good starting points.

It holds my attention and although finding it confusing to get used to when I first started playing, it's starting to become more familiar and facilitating my learning speed... one song mastered after only 5 hours (in 3 sessions), makes me think it does what it intends to do.

I haven't really bothered with messing around with the side games much, so I can't comment too much on that aspect. I did find the chord game has helped me solidify some of my familiarity of chords I'd previously struggle with remembering.

As a game I really can't score it, but as a learning tool, I'd give it a solid 8/10... after all, it's cheaper than weekly lessons with an IRL teacher, but will never beat the progression you'd make with an IRL teacher.",1606080929,1606080929,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I picked up bass in 2003 and once I was taught the standard tuning/fret numbers I taught myself from there.  Played in several garage bands as more of a rhythm bassist and later played in a semi-professional local band for two or three years (I think our biggest crowd was 30 people).
I bought this game either just before/during COVID19 quarantine started and I'm very happy I grabbed it.  There are a number of songs which I've always wanted to learn, but were tabbed terribly.  There are some different songs/artists which I've never heard of which I learnt the music of because of RS2014.
  
As I've hinted at, I played this game with previous knowledge, the tutorials did help refine a few things since I was self-taught.  Can also see how a super-green beginner can get off the ground by using the game's tutorials.

I tend to think I learnt songs by heart better with dodgy tab websites, by ear and watching live performances of my favourite bands, but maybe that's because I had more time / interest to play for long stretches.

I actually love it. It is fantastic. Even if you have never picked a guitar up in your life, if you started with this, you will be making very good progress. This thing gives you all the tools you need to get going, basic chords, exercises, games, session mode. 

If you can already play guitar or know a few power chords you will defo learn more, and have a great blast playing through some of you fav tracks. There is a wealth of DLC, it is kinda expensive tbh, but i usually grab a load of packs when they are on sale. 

You can also play custom created songs with a quick google and 15 mins. This expands the potential amount of songs to the thousands. 

So, in short: 

PROS:
+ Great for guitarists of all levels
+ Fun games that will improve your fretboard knowledge, and chord dictionary.
+ Great songs from a wide variety of genres/artists/decades. There will be stuff you like.
+ Made me realise that i can absolutly hate a song, but have fun playing it. 
+ Works for Bass, Lead and Rhythm

- Expensive DLC (you might also want to buy rocksmith to get about 50 more songs)

I do recommend it, but the issues make me put a ""No"".
Basically if you wanted a Guitar Hero with a real guitar, this is it.
But the sound capturing is way too forgiving, you can pull off your riffs while playing VERY faulty, not hitting the rhythm, playing odd notes, touching other strings etc. Seems like the capturing quality is just insufficient (with the Real Tone Cable).
Speaking of, it's really expensive. Buying the game, keep in mind the price for the cable AND for songs, the built-in library is rather small and paying like $3 for each song is a damn lot.

Cons:

-Oh my god the accuracy of the chord pisses me off
-Game gives way too much leadway when it comes to rythm

Good game all around other than the head aches. Also if anyone is wondering, the import tool is to transfer songs from the original rocksmith if you had it. (so don't buy it).

I think this is a good tool for beginners to get better at their preferred instrument, novice players will definitely learn some tricks, but experts will probably be bored with it. The lessons are structured well, there is a HUGE catalog of songs to learn (most of it you have to buy tho), and the arcade modes are actually kind of fun and it was a novel idea to use a stringed instrument as a game controller. This 'game' is basically how I stay in shape when I don't have a band to play with or we can't meet for months on end b/c of a pandemic. I play both bass and guitar.  

Cons:
You absolutely must have the cable as it is terrible about picking up notes with a mic, and honestly the cable is not sensitive enough either and the game has trouble picking up things like bends and muted strings. Beside that my only other complaint is that sometimes the tablature wants your fingers running all up and down the neck where you could be playing in a tighter formation; the game will accept alternate fingering if you choose to do so, but you have to know the song for this to work and then force your brain to ignore what the screen is telling you. This is mostly a problem for lead and bass, but it's a minor thing and only in a couple of the stock songs.",1604851786,1604851786,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I recommend 2 things for better expirience, First : Buy an Amplifer, i got the Blackstar fly 3 Amp as a first amplifer then i changed 2 amplifers (the vox mini 3 g2 and the fender mustang lt50), i think its better than play with normal speakers/headphones and to pratice without the game.
and use CDLC by buying Chreub rock DLC and than you can download approximatly which song do you want (except dlc)
find in youtube some tutorials for that, i really recommend it.

I've bought the Epiphone's Les Paul guitar that ""comes"" with Rocksmith and nope, the coupon for the game is expired - which kind of cools on it's own. What's even worse - Ubisoft support was of no help and I don't mean the ""no"" answer, I mean I've got a nice chat with their bot and three month later - still to response at all.

Anyways, I bought the game on my own. Only to see that their ""real tone"" cable sucks, the game does not recognize notes properly (either not picking the note our counting the whole strum as a valid single note) and the build-in lessons look more like a joke.

Probably, all that was still cool and new in 2011 or 2014, but in 2020 you can find whole guitar courses online and FREE. At the price of ""realtone cable"" you can get a nice entry-level audio interface and install FREE software amp simulators to get dozens or hundreds presets for amp/effects. You can get free tabs for the songs, free ""how to play"" lessons, free backtracks.

And which in my opinion is most important - with a usual guitar COURSE you will get the proper technical foundation, avoid getting bag habits and techniques and get an understanding of how the things work, nor just learn some riffs.

If you get crashing issues, try the steps I have below:


*UPDATE*
I contacted Ubisoft support and one of they're recommendations fixed the issue. I'm not sure what exactly was the problem, so I've posted the notes here in case it helps anyone:
1. Disabling your background applications:

Go to the Start menu on your Desktop. Press the Windows key and the letter R at the same time.
Type in MSCONFIG and press Enter.
Go to the Startup tab, and click Open Task Manager.
For each Startup item in the Task Manager, select the item then click Disable.
Close Task Manager.
On the Startup tab of the System Configuration dialog box, click OK, then restart the computer.

Note: For Windows 7, you can simply click Disable All on the Startup tab within the System Configuration window.

2. Clearing your temporary files:

Go to the Start menu on your Desktop. Press the Windows key and the letter R at the same time.
Type in %TEMP% and press Enter.
Select All (Edit > Select All or Ctrl+A).
Click the Delete key.

Note: If you are using Windows 7, you will need to press Ctrl + A together to highlight the files. Once the files are highlighted, you will need to press the Delete key.

3. Make sure the drivers for your video card, sound card, motherboard and processor are up-to-date. Running 2 cards in SLI or running 2 screens can also cause issues. Deactivate SLI or unplug any additional screens you may be using. If you are overclocking, try running at the stock clock settings.

4. Make sure that any antivirus or firewall software on your system is disabled.

5. Install Windows Updates:
Click on the Windows Start button and go to All Programs --> Windows Update. In the left pane, click ""Check for updates"" and if any are found choose ""Install updates.""

The addictive nature of Rock Band that I loved exists, but I walk away ACTUALLY being able to play my favorite songs.  
    For seasoned guitar players, this is a great way to practice songs with the original tracks, with a handy flow of the tabs as well.  
    Whether you are new or have been playing for decades there is plenntttyyy of appeal for guitar musicians. Even a state-of-the-art Session mode where you can create your own band of robots to jam out with.

    The game has over 1.5k of it's own DLC songs, but then you can go download hundreds of thousands of custom DLC songs for FREE (After you purchase 1 real DLC track for $2.99. Any DLC track Ubi has released HAS to be bought and cannot be found on custom DLC lists.)
There are super creative little mini games to teach you techniques, such as the House of the Dead style chord practice.

    They say it takes 10,000 hours to master a skill (which Rocksmith actually tracks in it's cool achievements) and that 10,000 hours can be easily played in Rocksmith, many many times over, without a splinter of boredom.

So when the lockdown came and much of what I used to do before was swept away I bought this game, a Rocksmith cable (sold separately) and grabbed my bass. It's probably helped keep me on an even keel through it all. I have to keep reminding myself it's a computer watching and grading my playing, as if I'm lazy and don't calibrate my passive pickup bass if I change tunings from something like Eb to C Drop D a lot of notes which I hit successfully will be missed by the game.
Like anything IT related, validating input before launching into an hour long session makes the difference between good and bad results.
The integrated tuner and calibrator tools when properly used together makes sure that what you play is read properly when playing a song, they're quite reliable but if your instrument isn't set up properly, ie your truss rod is too tight/loose or the string action is too close/far from the neck it can't help you beyond interpreting your notes as originating from a different fret from the one you're playing.
As for playing the game itself:
Ultimately it depends on the music you like, if you're expecting hip hop or Norwegian Black Metal you're out of luck with the stock songs preloaded onto the game, DLC is available from Ubisoft within the Steam Store and CDLC may also have some of what you like.
It's the CDLC which has made the difference between a good and great game for me. It doesn't meet all of my heavy metal requirements but it meets a lot of them.
CDLC integrates mostly successfully into the game and I have yet to hit any malware when dropping the necessary .psarc files into the DLC directory.
The playing interface is pretty simple for me as a bass player, though complex pieces will crowd the screen very quickly and trying to co-ordinate reading with your hand movements can become tricky.
It's something to get used to.
Percentage grading at the end of each song is helpful, the variable difficulty settings will cap the possible mastery percentage and will rise (not sure about fall) with successive song plays and improvements in playing songs until 100% is possible.
I don't recommend this game to people who aren't patient with themselves, or expect to go from a beginner to Frank Bello from an hour of playing.
I do recommend it to people who are willing to invest time and patience to learn, who are prepared for their fingers to become harder and more flexible and quite likely more than a little sore at times.

Get this. Play it every day.

Get your friend with the strat and tell him to get a drumset. You're the lead guitar now. Find the quietest kid in school, 50/50 he or she already rips on bass. If not, they'll learn.

Write 100 more. Record the best ones. Yep, still crappy.

Play shows whenever, wherever you can. Put on a good show, none of that standing still, tuning between every song baloney. Get a second guitar and give your little brother a cut of the cover to help load, unload, and tune guitars at your shows. Boom, roadie.

If you have any interest in learning to play guitar/bass and enjoy playing video games, then this is the game for you. There is a Dynamic Difficulty feature, along with a Riff Repeater (where you can slow down challenging sections) which are the main things that will get you better at playing. There are a handful of video tutorials and practice tracks to hold your hand through the basics if you're a newcomer. If you're advanced, you can crank the difficulty up to 100% (or play Hard difficulty in Score Attack mode, which does that for you).

I have mixed feelings about the Guitarcade (mini games based around a single technique, such as bending, fret movement, string picking, chords, etc). Generally, I only play these to complete the in-game missions and for achievements (which I haven't bothered with yet). They are decent fun, but the meat of the game is Learn a Song/Score Attack for me (which involve playing along to real music).

For the best performance, you will need a Rocksmith Real Tone Cable (works across all platforms). Currently, these can be purchased for ~30 USD on Amazon. You will also want to use a low latency audio interface (plugged directly into your computer usually will be best, but experiment). You may have to increase the Audio Engine setting if you're hearing distortion (you'll know when you have it), but preferably this will be at the lowest setting (1).",1543341359,1601926959,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You cant go wrong, Its great for learning guitar or mastering new songs. Plus, there are plenty of tweaks online to allow for use without the proper cable and to even add custom songs.
The only downfall in the long run is the lack of practising a song or slowing down a full song to learn it - these features do exist however they are often very complicated and can take a lot of time but overall it still works. 

The graphics are not crazy good but not crazy bad, this allows it to run on virtually any device.
Content library is massive, the ability to add (custom songs with external software) or paid DLC leaves you with an endless stream of playable content.

The game also features a large array of guitar lessons to learn new techniques such as hammering (on and off), tapping and hundreds more. The game has more than 500 lessons.

For reference this is my current setup: Guitar > Focusrite Solo (3rd Gen) > PC (with voicemeeter banana) ...I had to scour the internet for advice, fixes, and how to's to make Rocksmith register my Focusrite and my guitar. I have currently 6 hours of playtime. 4 of those hours were me trying to fix things. I had to download special files, edit Rocksmith's files, put new files into the Rocksmith folder, get a 3rd app called Voicemeeter Banana. Look up a ""how to"" to make Rocksmith, my PC, Voicemeeter, my Guitar, AND my Focusrite all work together in perfect harmony. The last 2 days have been a struggle. All of which could've easily been avoided had I just bought the cable.

I've been playing guitar for 15+ years, and lately have been not feeling the urge to play or practice. Rocksmith has this perfect balance between Guitar Hero / Rockband and playing actual guitar. Which is making guitar playing fun again for me. I'm learning songs I would never learn on my own and im having a blast learning them. The dynamic difficulty is a fantastic touch. (I like an idiot put it on master mode for 1 song and had regrets)

I previously played it on my Xbox 360, but due to how much I traveled I wished for years that I could play it on my Macbook Pro, or eventually my Nintendo Switch.  I never got the latter wish, but early this year (just in time for pandemic apocalyptic lockdown) I discovered that I could play it on OSX via Steam, and that was a dream come true.

Personally, I don't have much of a memory for learning songs, and this game doesn't help me with that.  There are a number of songs that I have reached 100% in ""Learn a Song"" mode, or Platinum score on Master Level of ""Score AttacK"" mode, which I would be hard pressed to play alone.  That said, I think that's mostly how my own brain works.  What I do get out of this game is a huge improvement of my ability to play in time, and the muscle memory of making my way around my instrument.  My friends who are excellent musicians definitely notice that I have been playing Rocksmith regularly (when I am able to do so) when they hear me messing around on an instrument.  It refines the technical mechanics of musicality, so that they are less likely to be in the way of creative expression and other less technical elements of playing, when I am interfacing with my instruments in other situations.

I primarily use Rocksmith for Bass guitar, as that is the instrument I have the most ambition to improve my skills on.  However, I have played the guitar (mostly lead, I'm terrible at rhythm to the point of it not even being fun) ""Path"" and I find that a lot of the ""Arcade"" games, and other modes are better suited to guitar than they are bass.  The ""Session"" mode is absolutely fantastic for learning scales, which I alway prefer to learn for 6 strings, rather than 4, because you obviously still learn them for bass when you learn them for guitar.

My biggest complaint is that Rocksmith only works for the 2 instruments (guitar, and bass), particularly when it seems like MIDI output on keyboards, and electronic drum kits would make the integration of these instruments so easy from a programmer's perspective.  But oh well, I try to play Rocksmith every day when my schedule allows, and I absolutely notice a difference when I do, in terms of other musical applications.  This game was how I justified (to myself) replacing broken Xboxes, and now that I have it on OSX, I may never acquire another one of those consoles.

- Some of the lessons throw you in the deep end, they don't spend enough time helping you build up the skill properly.
- The ""lets play a riff using that new technique"" section of each lesson starts way too quickly, there needs to be a few seconds to get ready for another attempt. There isn't enough time to prepare your hands and there's not enough time to prepare mentally for another go.
- Some lessons throw in other techniques the player may not have got down yet, for example palm mutes 102 throws in really difficult cord switches, something that takes more than a few lessons to get good at and is even harder when you're also trying to learn an entirely new technique
- Lastly, the recommended lesson order is a bit busted, some things are waaay easier than others and hitting a hard ""101"" lesson might discourage the player. (Personal example, I've completed all the 101 lessons and am fairly decent, but I can not for the life of me beat Legato 101)

EDIT: After playing some more I have discovered that some of the ""harder"" lessons are actually easier, for example, chords 102 is by far way harder than chords 201 and palm mutes 102 is leagues harder than palm mutes 103. So I guess if you're having my problem then you should just skip the lesson even if it's recommended that you do that lesson first.",1600138690,1600827668,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's genuinely one of my favorites now, and even as I've moved a bit away from it to practice outside of the game, I still return to it regularly. The game got me so addicted that my computer went down for a while so I dropped some money on a console version (and my favorite dlc songs to play) just so I could go through it again.

I find myself constantly satisfied with it, and starting over on console really showed me just how much progress I made. It's also just unbelievably satisfying to teach yourself a riff before the game has the chance to show it to you, those are by far my favorite moments.

I first got this on the xbox360 - it was great with a scart cable. Played it for days. Taught myself bass - I've been playing 6 string guitar for years before that. I then upgraded to an xbox one with hdmi - not so great because of lag, but I was playing bass mainly, so who cares right? Now I'm playing through steam and it all looks and sounds great, with no lag. The auto level up seems to work better on the PC as well - so if you play the song properly, you advance even if you are playing notes not currently shown. Both xbox versions were a bit hit and miss on that score.

Despite the fact that you can't import tracks from other platforms, despite the fact that it does not import progress and despite the fact that I am a cheapskate who begrudges spending anything on software, I still do not feel like I have been cheated. I will play this for hours. I may even buy some of the DLC again (when there is a sale obviously).

I know that there will be no further songs produced but I understand there is a very health side-loading community out there. Also do not trust the in game store - it might just be a temporary thing but loads of tracks seem to be missing.

Legitimately it is probably one of the best tools to learn guitar I have ever touched, there are so many songs out of the box, plus the DLC. You have Riff Repeater which you can use to segment songs and practice them at various speeds and complexities, and build up the muscle memory to play a song at full pace. Also, the technique mini-games are pretty useful in helping build up proficiency in basic techniques, to more advanced stuff. 

I do have some niggles with this game from the point of view of someone looking to learn guitar fresh, but they are only minor complaints, namely:
[list]
[*]The game kind of sucks in telling you why you're doing something from a theory standpoint. This is a bit frustrating if you're using the game as a gateway to music as a whole, and if this is the case I'd recommend picking up a theory book just to palm through and help wrap your head around what a 5th chord or a pentatonic scale is.
[*]The difficulty meter feels a bit off for me. Some songs/phrases are ranked really high in terms of difficulty by the game but you can breeze through, yet a fast alternate picking segment can floor you and the game doesn't see why.
[/list]

Like I say these are only minor complaints to what is honestly the best edutainment game ever. Worth buying not on sale, worth buying on sale. Buy it if you're even remotely interested in learning guitar. Buy it.",1599074770,1599074770,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

R U Mine
Blitzkrieg Bop
Paint it Black

There are a handful more songs I can play, but they are not available on rocksmith so I had to learn them the old fashioned way.

None of which are hugely hard to play, but it has been really enjoyable learning from scratch. I will say that rocksmith alone isn't enough to learn guitar, I have had to use youtube tutorials and guitar tabs online as well. Below I will list what are some of the pros and cons of the game in my mind and as well as my game rating.

[u] Pros [/u]
+ Great interactive lessons
+ Fun mix of learning songs and games to keep interest
+ Missions to help with progression
+ Guitar hero style learning which is entertaining
+Awesome amp cable that plugs into the computer so you can play as loud or as quiet as you want on the speakers of your PC/Laptop
+Large track list with a lot of variety in genre

[u] Cons [/u]
- Guitar tuning system doesn't always work well and causes you to miss notes when playing even when playing the notes correctly. (I tune the guitar beforehand and ignore the game's tuner now)
- The way a song is taught can sometimes be counter productive, the way it slowly feeds you more notes can restrict the flow of how it should be played and isn't always helpful.
-Money grabbing DLC songs which could have easily been free with the game

[u] Overall Rating[/u] 
Despite the few cons it has, overall it is still worth the money and I'm eager to keep playing guitar using rocksmith!

This is so helpful if you're serious about playing guitar. I haven't put as much time into it as I'd like, but I'm certain that I will once I'm a little less busy. It walks you through not only how to play a given song, but it also helps reinforce techniques that every guitar player need, like hammer-ons, pull-offs, tapping, harmonics, etc. One thing I will mention, though, is that you MUST buy the Real Tone Cable.

Watched some youtube videos on form and and picking (to not develop bad habits again), went on Reddit and followed the ""How to use Rocksmith Efficiently"" Guide, fired up some songs and took it from there. 

Pick it up on sale. It comes around quite often. 

P.S: And I know some people say that you can start off Rocksmith with just a guitar and get an amp later, but really, just get an amp.  It really helps when you wanna practice a riff without starting up a PC and loading up the whole game.

[b]Background:[/b] Been playing various six strings for more years than I can count. Bought RS2014 years ago out of curiosity so I'll recap my experience here.

[b]The fun bits :D[/b]
1. Great for beginners, covers the necessary fundamentals of guitar playing via lessons (e.g. holding, picking, chords and MORE).
2. [url=https://youtu.be/1mAehvLEzL0]Session Mode[/url] - wasn't feeling it until I watched this tutorial to figure out the band setup.
3. Real Tone cable (4 years and counting) Mac compatibility with Amplitube and GarageBand.
4. The Riff Repeater, what a brilliant way to pour hours of practice into your jam-a-thon.
5. SP's Cherub Rock for its pounding intro and chord progressions so make this your first DLC purchase... you'll figure it out :)

[b]The not so fun bits D:[/b]
1. Be prepared to spend a little more on your post-RS rig setup.
2. Input lag/crackling from the guitar to the desktop speaker which was later resolved by tweaking the rocksmith.ini file and changing the audio output source.
3. Note registration difficulties - there could be a song or two that suffer from this, but don't let that stop you from learning. [b][i]update[/i][/b] Resolved by using an external tuner. Keep in mind that string tension will alter as you tune from the low E to the high E string.",1596212079,1598279239,True,21,0,0.725169777870178223,0,True,False,False

I think there is a lot of room for growth in learning to play that is outside this game.

I like it a lot more on PC, mainly because my 360 controllers died, so I lost motivation to keep playing for a while. It feels like I have less audio lag and an easier time navigating menus on the PC.

I've found that each guitar I own needs to be customized in order to work well. My bass wouldn't make a sound at first, but I turned up the gain and it works fine now. If you just have one guitar, then you won't have this issue. Also, if you're new to the guitar and don't know how to set up your guitar to play well (string height, neck curvature, etc) then you will have a way easier time playing if you take the guitar to a shop and have them set it up right. It costs anywhere from $50 to $100, but it will make learning WAY WAY easier if you don't have to fight with a difficult guitar.

Last recommendation: Make an effort to do the lessons and learning games rather than only playing songs. You'll learn faster that way, but it takes a little more dedication. I notices a massive increase in my learning speed after a few hours of the game that teaches you how to pluck the right string without looking.

I tried to work with Ubisoft's tech support for a while about this game's horrible audio problems (lots of crackling and popping, both spontaneously and with gentle string touches, and any sustained notes quickly cutting out completely), and was very polite, but what I have experienced is totally unacceptable; no-one should support this.

This game makes playing fun, especially at the start where you're only playing a few notes, but get to hear a full band backing you up. It feel rewarding and focuses on getting you  familiar with the instrument and building finger muscle and dexterity. 

Note that DLC is no longer being published, but there's 100s of great songs available that go on sale every steam sale.

I don't have the perspective of newly learning guitar through this game. This game will teach you songs and will teach you techniques, but my suggestion to people starting out with this game would be to make sure you aren't learning bad habits with picking, fingering, and what not. Use this along other resources online to really become solid.

That said, I love this game. I have put a couple hundred hours in it to learn songs in a more fun and engaging way than traditional tab/sheet music. The music selection is great and I highly recommend buying the Cherub Rock DLC (read the reviews for why). This game has actually spoiled me. I find it hard to return to tab, or even trying to learn a song with my band because of how easy and fun this tool is. Want to jam along with a song you already know? Great, it starts and stops with you. Want to slow it down to learn that solo easier? Do it man, spend all day on that song with the riff repeater. You can even give it a Rock Band feel by playing score attack. Want to learn more than one scale? There is an entire mini game dedicated to that! 

This game lays the foundation for you to learn and improve each time you play. It's only up to you at this point. Thinking about learning but are put off by the initial skill wall? Get this game, sit down with a beer, and start jamming out. Within a couple months, beginner or not, you'll have improved and had fun while doing it.

I hope they continue to create Rocksmith in the future, and improve with a lot of the technical issues people commonly face. Depending on your audio set up, you will spend an hour fumbling through 6 year old forums looking to solve sound lag, video lag, no sound, cable not being detected, etc. Once you get past the set up issues, you won't have any issue until you change your speakers/headset, or even PC. And if you're really lucky, you'll get the issue where the entire directory becomes corrupt and you lose all the custom DLC songs you spent hours looking for and working towards for that 100%.

First of all the tracking is crap, I play notes perfectly in time and in tune, yet it comes up with ""miss"" when I've got a good streak going. It's really frustrating when you've trained your ear for years, you can hear that it's correct but no - Rocksmith says it's wrong. This could be very discouraging for new players.

It's almost impossible to figure out the rhythm of certain phrases - all you can do is repeat the phrase at slow speeds until you understand where the notes are supposed to be. Even then the tracking will tell you you got it wrong when it's right. FFS, just give me some rhythmic notation.

The worst part about the game is that the strings are colour coded. WHY? Just give me tab scrolling across the screen, the vertical scrolling is shit.

Rocksmith has been a really great tool for learning bass, but after almost 300 hours I find it more enjoyable as a means to relax. Most songs I can play to 99% but it's pure muscle memory, my brain sees things on screen and my fingers react accordingly, without RS I really can't remember how to play the songs, but I'm okay with that. It's a good foundation for if I ever want to put in the work to be good without it. It's very fun to just hop into it for an hour and bang out some good tunes and feel like you've played them yourself. I found the regular 6 string guitar very confusing on RS but bass guitar is wonderful for it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So far it's been a pretty good tool for learning bass.

The actual teaching elements of the game are kind of barebones, even the guitarcade stuff isn't great for learning but it's a fun distraction. Learn a song and Session mode are really where most of the experience comes from. My biggest problem when I first picked up guitar was mostly a lack of interest but RS14 provides me with a constant set of goals and a pretty decent library of tracks to keep pushing through with bass, unofficial listings make that playlist even bigger and more to my taste too. The ability to customise tones is fantastic too, it's not the same as investing in waa peddles, cabinets and heads, but it's as close to Dan Maine's set up as I'm going to get. The riff repeater and dynamic difficulty are key to what makes this such a good learning tool, being able to isolate a specific part of a song and slow it down and repeat it over and over without loading screens or fluff makes it easy to correct mistakes. I think most of my time in this game comes from 2/3 hours doing the same 20 - 30 seconds of a song over and over.

Only negatives are that the Realtone cable is actually pretty difficult to come by now and it's still really expensive, also DLC is quite expensive too. It's not bad when you consider you're getting a high quality, licensed song broken down into a format with dynamic difficulty but they always become dirt cheap during sales and it's kind of annoying to wait for that window. The tuner isn't always as precise as it could be and sometimes lower notes and especially chords don't register but it happens infrequent enough that it's forgiveable.",1515810361,1595096732,True,7,1,0.589544951915740967,0,True,False,False

Faults with the game:
- It isn't perfect. Plugging in my bass, I found on songs that were deeply downtuned, the game just had a lot of trouble reading the lowest notes. Looking at you, Heart shaped box.
- The strings can be inverted in the options, this should be default, so the notes and chord formations look like tablature, this is a minor complaint, but finding this setting changed my experience for the better in a big way.
- Easy mode and medium are stupid. The way to learn a song isn't to learn 10% of the notes and then work up. It's to learn all of it slowly, and work on precision and then speed.
- The arcade games are of various value. The whaling one is useless.

The Good Stuff
- Arcade games Ducks and Saloon will absolutely help you move across strings and around the neck without looking. I've been playing guitar 25 years, and these 2 improved my comfort and control levels.
- Good songs available, in a wide range. I never would have learned a Jackson 5 song if not for the game, but I Want You Back is straight up groovy.
- Session mode is great for developing your own voice and style in playing. The backing back is always a little plain, but somehow still good at following intensity. 
- The tone designer will never replace a full setup with pre-amps, pedals and all the rest, but it's a good facsimile. Professional tone control costs thousands, but this is good enough to help you learn how to design.

Get the cord and play this game. Between the Ramones, the Police, f**king Slayer, Outkast... If you can't squeeze some hours of fun out of this, then... I don't know, maybe pick up painting.",1595022489,1595022489,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My only issue with the game is the tuner is a little off which can screw up the note detection at times. But other than that it's pretty solid on the note detection. 

My favourite thing to do is learn a song then go for gold on master in score attack, so far i've been able to do six or seven songs and it feels great. You truly learn to play the song and it improves your playing.

+ The Good +
+ Note tracking is pretty accurate, even in really fast sections of songs.
+ Tone customiser is pretty cool.
+ Session mode is great to jam with a ""band"" and get inspiration.
+ Arcade games let you practice specific skills and techniques, such as note bending, chord shapes, string skipping, slides and so on.
+ Automatic difficulty with live progression, though you can set the difficulty yourself.
+ Can use any old USB audio interface instead of their ""Tone Cable"" (I use a Behringer U-Phoria UMC202HD and it works just fine).

- The Bad -
- Session mode doesn't have too much to offer for heavy metal players. Mostly rock, blues, jazz, funk and electronic stuff. The ""Doom"" drum kit and ""Heavy"" guitars are fine for slower metal but I have yet to find a good setup for death metal or classic heavy metal.

# The Meh #
# The game comes with a wide variety of songs from different genres, but you will get through the ones you like quite quickly.

It has many features such as the guitarcade or session mode, however, 90% of the time you'll be in learn a song. Here you are essentially playing guitar hero with a real guitar, hitting the right notes at the right time to get a higher percentage or score. You can change the song difficulty from easy to master, which governs how many notes from the original appear on the screen, with easy being a hand full, and master popping out invisible notes.

You do not necessarily need a real tone cable to play (though I would recommend it since you have access to all features, including guitar tones). If you have a microphone, you can change the input setting to mic, which works best for acoustic guitars. You can also disable the guitar hero aspects of the game, and play without an input. This is handy if you want to use your own amp, though bare in mind that in this mode you cannot access most other features aside from learn a song.

[b][10.05.2018]: [/b]Okay, It's my first day on Rocksmith leaving a comment here, I will come back after a long time and update my comment and how much I have progressed, currently can't even tell which color is which string.


[b][30.08.2018]:[/b] Okay, It has been 3 months and 20 days, almost everyday I played Rocksmith, or guitar outside of rocksmith. I used to read tabs and after using rocksmith so much, tabs are very slow compared to rocksmith, I can read everything very nicely and I can play most of the stuff and I have learned a lot of songs. I can say that my guitar playing was 2/10 before now its 6/10. I have improved a lot. I will try to continue this comment in the future lol.

[b][12.08.2019]:[/b] OK I don't know how long it has been someone asked me to update my comment, my guitar skills are up to 9/10 now, I can read and play anything in rocksmith (expect crazy solos) this song seemed impossible at the time now it looks really really easy, I am currently making custom dlc songs for the game so you all can enjoy. I'm not going to update this comment anymore.


[b]Yet another update [10.02.2020]:[/b] I can play SOME crazy solos that I talked about that I couldn't play. Rocksmith is the best, tabs are obsolete.


[b]Update time [20.06.2020]:[/b] I have spent some time in the Session Mode of the game, and I started learning music theory outside of rocksmith, now I can create my own solos to songs, discover which key the song is played in, find what chords are played by ear and write my own songs. Right now I am trying to learn how to sing so I can completely make my own songs.




[b]Original Review (30 hours at the game):[/b]
I didn't learn to play the guitar with this, but I can definetly see how It would improve yourself as a guitar player. It makes learning songs 20x easier, I used to read tabs and memorize the tab, but with Rocksmith as you keep repeating the song you just get the hang of it and start playing it outside of Rocksmith. You basicly learn the song super easy just by repeating it a couple of days and your muscle memorizes it.


There is a lot of songs to choose from, you won't have much with the original game but you can buy Cherub Rock DLC and get unlimited amount of songs... (Custom DLC), basicly people create their own charts and upload them to a website called CustomsForge and it's amazing, 95% of the time you will find what you are looking for from there.


If you don't know anything about guitar and want to learn it, I wouldn't really suggest Rocksmith to start with, try to start learning from the internet or by a guitar teacher at first. Then when you get the basic stuff done for example learning Chords, Playing a couple of melodies, Learning how the instrument works then get yourself Rocksmith.


Definetly an amazing game and its worth your time.


Only issues I would say is It can sometimes get stuff wrong, for example if you are in really low tunings then It may not recognize some notes, and a couple more stuff but other than that It's great.

One small complaint is there is no online multiplayer, only local multiplayer. So if your family or roommates also play, then it's not a huge deal, but it makes it difficult for me to play with my friends or family abroad at the same time (we just instead play the same song in a Discord call and talk about it).

The only REAL issue with purchasing this game is it requires you to already own the Rocksmith Real Tone USB cable, which I luckily already own because I own the XBox version of the game.

I have been playing guitar for about 8 years now, and when I began learning I also purchased Rocksmith. I have purchased this game on Ps3, Ps4, and Steam. No other tool has aided my playing like this game has. Now, I must say, Rocksmith alone is not enough to learn guitar. You will also need lessons or online resources to learn the instrument. 

What Rocksmith is good for, is for learning songs. If you are a visual learner such as myself, this is the perfect way to learn songs efficiently and quickly. There are difficulty options as well as speed options so you can make sure you isolate and master every part of a song. 

As for the lessons provided in the game, they are a nice little intro to guitar but by no means very expansive. I think they provide enough to get you started but what Rocksmith really boils down to is a tool for learning songs, not so much for learning the instrument itself. 

The PC version also has the option of downloading custom DLC, meaning if someone has made a chart for your favorite songs you can download and learn them as well. Fan made songs tend to not be as polished as the official DLC, but they are still an amazing option to have access to. 

The game also provides some fun little mini-games that are a nice way to beef up your skills. Practice and repetition is everything in this regard, so these are a nice feature. 

There is also a nice Guitar Hero-esque Arcade Mode where you compete against other players on the leaderboards. Now, this is where my one and only minor gripe comes in. In the typical Learn a Song mode this issue doesn't matter so much, but in Guitarcade it can be a bit of an annoyance. I'll expand on this issue below. 

The game has a bit of an issue with detecting notes, so even if you play a song flawlessly you are sometimes marked as if you did something wrong. I think this is counter intuitive to learning, as you need to get comfortable with knowing if you played something correctly just by listening. It's bizarre when I have trained my ear to detect if I am playing something wrong, KNOW that I am playing it right, and then have the game tell me I missed the note. Now that I am at the point where I know if I am playing something wrong or not it's a very minor gripe, but for newer players I could see them getting a bit confused. However, this is a very minor issue and I don't think it should discourage anyone from getting the game. The note detection is great most of the time. 

Before I wrap this up I would like to touch on session mode, which is a mode I didn't touch for years until I had a bit more experience under my belt. This mode is incredible and an amazing way to practice improv. Newer players probably won't mess with this as much, but it's essentially a mode where you build a band to play with, set the tempo, set a key, and then start jamming. It's a ton of fun, but I highly recommend learning the Pentatonic scale before jumping in. 

With all of that being said I will conclude by saying I highly, highly recommend this game to all guitar players. Whether you are experienced or brand new, this game offers an amazing way to learn songs at a rapid pace.",1593188631,1593189252,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Things like how to hold the guitar, posture, fretting techniques, how to hold the pick, basic strumming. It's just faster to have someone watch you and make instant corrections. It will be less frustrating when starting to learn songs plus you will save strain on your shoulders, back, and fingers.

Once you get the very basics out of the way, this game is a lot of fun. It's super easy to learn songs. Riff repeater is awesome. A few of the technique are really helpful.

So i never actually had an electric guitar, but recent aquisition of one called for some long forgotten gem of a game i've dreamt of playing since 2014.
To be exact, i didn't really thought it would be this good. Surely you'll need some prior fiddling with your audio interface since i doubt you'll find RealTone Cable anywhere these days. But a quick google search or even (god forbid) REDDIT search can solve pretty much any problems you have and rest is just tweaking your guitar and your DAW.
So how's the game after all this hussle? It's freaking amazing that's what i think. Especially if you haven't played guitar in ages, it's a pure blast to play. You get huge library of DLC music, that's probably going to have something that you used to love in your teens. And being able to play it after all this time, even by baby steps learning - is just a joy you cannot skip on. Unless you're a pro guitar player, in that case you probably going to have just something to do your small warm-ups in Arcade mode.

В общем, никогда не владел электро гитаркой, но недавно все таки обзавелся и из закаулков моей памяти всплыли такие игры как Rock Band, Guitar Hero и с горем пополам я вспомнил что есть еще скрытое золото всего этого давно вмэршего жанра - ROCKSMITH.
Прежде чем начать играть, нужно немного повозиться с патчами любительскими, но туториалы уже давно есть на ЮТ и прочих гуглах. У меня ушло меньше 40 минут чтобы заставить игру работать со Scarlett 2i2 3rd Gen без каких либо нареканий.

Так вот, как сама игра-то? Шикарно, если вы только учитесь, весело, если уже умеете.
Что шикарного? Все, от простых, но понятных (английский нужен вроде как, не ставил русскую версию) уроков, до возможности выучить песни вашей юности от зарубежных авторов. (Про мод сцену молчу, не трогал пока еще)
Куча разных прибомбасов, а-ля, настрой свой комбик и тюн, которые позволяют примерить возможные будущие покупки педалей и комбиков от известных брендов.
Аркада, где можно зазубрить положение аккордов в довольно веселой и интересной форме.
Да и просто сам кайф от того когда берешь новые высоты в игре своей любимой песни - незабываемое чувство.

Да, игра дороговата, но вы же уже купили гитару, по умолчанию тут уже доступны с два десятка песен, среди которых можно найти свои любимые.

А, еще игра просит затюнить гитару в нужный строй, но мне кажется что она иногда косячит, но тут лучше у про гитариста спрашивать, мне слон на ухо не наступал, но от этого ощущения тяжело избавится.",1592765482,1592765482,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Solid 10/10. 

The only two downsides I can find is the tracking on higher frets, occasionally the game doesn't like to register it and, in all honesty, the game has an issue with any guitar using single coils.

Rocksmith is, without a doubt, the greatest tool for learning guitar I've ever seen. I had a guitar ages ago and only ever learned some basic chords and never learned a full song. I just lacked focus and structure, apparently, because Rocksmith has helped turn that around and ignited a passion for guitar in me that I didn't know existed. The Learn a Song feature is amazing and makes you feel like you're making tangible progress as you level up individual ""phrases"" in a song. In just four months, I've gone from only being able to play basic chords to starting my first foray into solos, learning slides, harmonics, tons of new chords, alternate picking, complex strumming patterns, and tons more. I've also managed to master several songs that I can now play without the help of Rocksmith and learning lots more!

To put it plainly, if you want to learn guitar or bass and if you struggle with structure but love games, this is the game for you. If you ever played Guitar Hero or Rock Band and thought ""Wow I wish I could do this but with a real guitar."" this game is for you. Not only does it teach you songs, it also has a TON of lessons and ""guitarcade"" games that teach you technique and all sorts of other stuff!

Lets see...
 
I suppose that I could start with the fact that you have to [u]buy the real tone cable[/u] which would set you back another $15-$30 [u]if you want the best experience[/u]. Or the fact that there's [b]FUCK TON[/b] of dlc for this game to the point that it's overwhelming and [b]VERY[/b] expensive outside of sales. Or maybe even the fact that [spoiler]YOU MUST OWN A GUITAR TO BE ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME...[/spoiler][spoiler]PROPERLY.[/spoiler] [i]*I'll iterate later on some brands and layouts you may want to check out.*[/i]

You know what I'll try to start with the gameplay first. 

Two words (well technically ""three""). It's fun. It should be after all since you're playing an instrument. Plus if it wasn't fun then why would I even be recommending it in the first place? (I'm not a masochist lol) Also you can use this game as a [u]tool if you're just starting out[/u] like I was two months ago. The [u]chances of the game teaching you everything there is to know about guitar in [b]two months[/b][/u] like the game advertises is [i]*slim to none*[/i] IF you have a day job and are constantly occupied with other things. However it does help set a sturdy foundation for further improvement through other resources. 

It does teach you how to play different songs ranging from classic rock to pop. Some of my favorite artist listed [i]*in the dlc :( *[/i] are [b]Slash[/b] [spoiler](no not Guns'n'Roses but [i]ONLY[/i] Slash; you can thank Axl Rose for that)[/spoiler], [b]Rage Against The Machine[/b] [spoiler](Search the guitarist' Tom Morrello's play style because this game [i]REALLY[/i] dumbs it down which is my main issue with it)[/spoiler], [b]Tom Petty[/b], [b]Jimi Hendrix[/b], [b]Santana[/b] and so and so forth.

There's also a [u]collection of mini games that teaches you different techniques[/u] within a mode called Guitarcade. Two of my favorites and so far most useful being [b]Return to Castle Chordead[/b] [u]which teaches you different chords and their hand placements on the finger board[/u] and [b] Scale Warriors[/b] [u]which teaches you the different scales and is an absolute necessity to learn if you ever plan on playing with a band[/u].

Well before I start wrapping this review up I would like go back to a previous topic being the brand of the guitars you can choose from. 
These are just some of the most popular brands there are so you might want to still do some research on your end.

[b]FENDER[/b]

Ranging from the $600 for the MIM [spoiler](Made in Mexico)[/spoiler] to the $1400+ MIA's [spoiler](Made in America)[/spoiler] with a varied selection of guitar styles such as the Stratocaster, Telecaster, Jazzmaster, and more. These guitars have been used by legends (that come to mind) such as [b]Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Tom Morrello[/b] and many more. 
[spoiler]Btw in my personal opinion the MIM's are the more worth the money than the MIA's since the main difference are the electronics which can be easily swapped for far superior ones for about $200-$300.[/spoiler]

[b]SQUIER[/b] [spoiler]by fender[/spoiler]

Just cheaper made Fenders to be honest. Prices range from $175-$500.

[b]IBANEZ[/b]

Hailing from the land of the rising sun, these absolute legends of shred are priced anywhere from $400-$1400+ and are most commonly setup with HH (Humbucker bridge and Humbucker neck).

[b]GIBSON[/b]

Most notable rock legends that dawned these guitars are [b]Slash[/b] from [i]Guns'n'Roses[/i] with his Les Paul, and [b]Angus Young[/b] from [i]AC/DC[/i] with his Les Paul SG. Prices range from $300-$30,000+. [spoiler]JK the cheapest price I've seen new is $1,200 T-T [/spoiler]

[b]EPIPHONE[/b]

Really all that comes to mind is the fact that they're just Gibsons but significantly cheaper at $300-$700+.
  
Also one last thing, Humbucker Single Single (HSS) on a Strat is the best setup for versatility in my personal experience. Humbuckers being good for shredding and overdrive and Singles being good for warmer and more vibrant tones.

[i]With all this said and done just remember to get a guitar that inspires you to continue learning and playing and that when you're first starting out, don't let the price of the guitar be a determining factor because at the end of the day whether you're playing a $175 Squier or a $30,000 Gibson you're still gonna sound like [b]ASS[/b] because you don't know how to play.[/i]",1590771021,1590792816,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Rocksmith, while not perfect for sure, is amazing. I had never touched an instrument until rocksmith, and even if I'm not the best, I can play songs I never dreamed I'd be able to. AND by now I can somewhat play with some other musicians with no other formal training. If I had even more time to practice outside of rocksmith, I'd love to actually do music as a career, which I could never have imagined ACTUALLY doing.

Easily one of my favorite games of all time. Despite this, i'd still give it only a 9/10. There are serious issues with note detection ESPECIALLY on bass, and even with a properly set up instrument that's still a huge annoyance IMO. My only other complaint is with the riff repeater: speed should be on a percentage scale, and you should be able to go past 100% speed for practice.

Works well, works *best* with a Realtone Cable, but since they have such a propensity to have the 1/4"" end fail, I also recommend a male/female 1/4"" mono sound cable. They work great and just make sure to get one the length you need, as if it were plugged into the computer itself. That way you can keep your Realtone Cable coiled up and stored in such a way that it never gets strain on the ends, never moves, never twists...it just sits there and does its job.

Also, the Realtone Cable can be used for things like GuitarRig, which I also recommend for playing. One piece of software and a couple pieces of hardware and you have pretty much any sound you want out of your guitar, coming straight into your headphones, or if you're like me - right into your home theater speakers.

Those are great rhythm games and absolutely help for hand-eye coordination.  But if you actually want a fun way to learn the guitar or bass, on an actual instrument, then this is your huckleberry.  

Is it perfect?  I'm not going to lie.  No, it is not.  Seems the most common issues are with getting the ""Real Tone"" cable working, and/or the input volume from your instrument being loud enough.  (If using Windows, consider boosting the microphone input a bit.  Don't go crazy or you'll have even more issues!  Try to calibrate, quit the game, increase the microphone input bu 5-10 at a time and try calibrating again.)  And, obviously, if your instrument has active pickups, be sure you have a fresh battery installed.  ;-) 

As other reviewers have pointed out, the algo for improving your playing ability isn't all that intelligent at times.  You can control this by disabling auto leveling, or you can configure it to level up more slowly, but drop back down more aggressively.  Believe me, nothing is more annoying than feeling you have a good groove going and the game decides out of the blue that you're ready for things to get much harder!  My preference is usually for manual control, or to simply use riff repeater, which has a much more granular control over all aspects of learning the song.  

I do have one serious bit of advise: don't go straight into learn a song mode.  Go through the lessons, as painful as they are.  Stick with it.  Then go learn songs.  On the bass (my preferred instrument) this isn't quite as bad; but for guitar?  Forget about it.  Work on the ""grind"" stuff and improve from there.

I don't recommend it to those who have never played the guitar and want to start with this, because it goes from a level very very easy at a medium-difficult level in a short time, and this could discourage you from playing!;
another important thing is that the game tells you when you are wrong but it doesn't say what, and maybe you discover it is only the posture of your hand or that you are using the wrong finger... for this reason are many tricks that you can only learn out of the game with a teacher who watches you play and tells you what you are doing wrong.

This game has been a real let down over it's life cycle.  I purchased the original Rocksmith game and found the interface to be way too Guitar Hero.  So I shelved it.  I then revisited this game in Rocksmith 2014, I was impressed that i had more content for lessons and techniques than in the first Rocksmith.  However the game was still Guitar Hero on steroids.  The techniques and lesson content is pretty good and the game has a real good note recognition in it, at least on my PC.  Following along to the lesson content is simple and very well laid out.  However, try to apply that in the Learn a Song section and you'll soon quickly notice how fast all that goes out the window.  The song starts off at a simple pace to give you time to figure out what you are doing.  THEN, as you get a phrase or two right in takes off and goes nuclear.  More and more notes appear as do some chords depending on what path you are on.  Since the gameplay is not linear like what you expect in music notation or tab, it gets congested fast on your screen.  So now you are just trying to keep up and not learning anything.  So, in comes the Riff Repeater where you can slow things down a bit, however it doesn't stay there for long before I've had the game ramp back up in difficulty level again even after adjusting it lower.   I really wanted to like this software just for the amount of song content it has.  But the ability to learn it requires too much fiddling with game settings to get it at a comfortable level where you can gradually go back up in difficulty and speed.  The arcade games would be quite useful.  There is a caveat there too, in the chord games, you wouldn't learn power chords before learning your open chords first, star chords is going right after the power chords first.  For the amount of great song content and DLC Rocksmith has, I just hope the creators of this game do a complete re-vamp of the software in the next rendition of learning software.   I would also like to see the gameplay change from the tired Guitar Hero to real tabulature scrolling in from the right.  All in all I was hoping that some changes would have been made after taking a several year hiatus from this game, due to the above issues.  I see that it is still the same.

[b]Better than the original.[/b] Rocksmith 2014 addressed the few frustrations with the original, particularly making the Riff Repeater feature much easier to access. Now, pause any song and practice the part you're struggling with - at any speed or difficulty.

I've been playing the guitar for around 15 years, so for me, Rocksmith is a useful tool that allows me to play / practice casually. I don't need to memorise every song I want to play - and I don't need to mess about finding backing tracks or an accurate tab.

[b]Mull-tie-player![/b] Playing with mates is awesome - especially as the difficulty setting for each player is different / dynamic, so it doesn't matter if one is a much better player than the other. No one will be bored or out of their depth. You will need 2 cables though (I think only the second player has to use a cable, but the mic option is nowhere near as reliable).

Things missing from this game:

- [b]Transposition.[/b] Most of us have guitars in E tuning, Drop D is no bother to tune to, but E-flat (and D standard) are hassle... not to mention the few songs that are tuned slightly sharp or flat. Other apps can transpose them - that would be great as an option (play the same frets, just in the standard tuning)!

- [b]Guitar profiles.[/b] You can create multiple player profiles, but not for different guitars owned by the same player. Let's face it, other than for complete beginners, many of us have more than one guitar - with different head-stocks and most importantly, different pickups (active / passive) etc. This forces me to re-calibrate to get reliable detection. :( 

- [b]Extra strings.[/b] Ok, a little niche - but 7 string guitars and 5 string basses are pretty common. Even if the tracks don't use the extra string, it'd be nice if the game accommodated them.

- [b]Drums![/b] We were teased with the possibility of add-ons early after the game was released, but they never showed up. That's the killer feature needed for the sequel - otherwise there are few reasons to upgrade.

[b]Finally, songs.[/b] There are some gems included with the game - some from bands I wouldn't have otherwise heard of - check them out. Also, whilst you have to pay, importing the original disc tracks is worth it for the same reason. At the time of writing, there are over 1500 DLC tracks, it's not the traditional rock star addiction - but you'll end up spending a lot of money to get your fix!",1590329640,1590330307,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game can be as arcade like or as much of a learning tool as you can make it. If you are a beginner it will help a lot just building muscle memory and dexterity. If you are more intermediate go into the riff repeat and just set the difficulty high and slow it down to work on uncommon cords you might not be familiar with or just go into endless mode if you don't have any plans for what to practice.

I start off listing some fixes because the game can be finicky if those steps aren't followed. That can be a real damper on things but it seems like the problems can be mitigated in like 5 minutes of work and it seems to be stable after.",1589942274,1590035799,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I've been playing guitar for about 17 years now but I rarely practice on my own, so I maybe have the skills of someone who has played consistently for 2-3 years.  Rocksmith has me practicing for hours a day just because it's so fun.  It's exactly what I've needed and I just wish I would have bought it sooner!

This game has pretty much everything you could want as a learning tool:  

Learn a Song, you can set up ""riff repeater"" to focus on a particular section or group of sections, and play them at any speed and difficulty until you've got it completely down.  This is probably the most useful tool for me (if you're really trying to learn the song, just crank the difficulty to 100 and slow the riff down, that way you're playing every note).  If you can play it slow, eventually you can play it fast.

There is a Score attack mode that feels just like rock band or Guitar hero.  You start with easy, medium and hard.  Once you've completed Hard without too many mistakes, you can play it on Master mode where the notes are completely removed.

Session mode, you can set up your band and just jam out.  You can stick to one scale or have it move around.  Play radio friendly jams or just the same scale.  It's a great way to just get creative when you aren't learning new songs.

Arcade mode, a selection of unique retro games that really help improve your basic skills, like star chord to learn new chords, or scale warriors for learning different scales (one of the better games, imo).       

One of my favorite features is the Tone Editor.  You can really go crazy and get any kind of tone you can imagine with all the different pedal, amp, cabinet and rack options.  Once you've created a tone, you can save it, then set it on your Tone Wheel.  You can instantly switch your tone at any time, even in the middle of song. 

The selection of songs that come with game is a little disappointing.... but there are hundreds of songs you can download if you're willing to buy them.  $3 per song is a bit pricey, but totally worth it for a song you really want to learn.

All in all I couldn't be more happy with the game.  It's really inspired me to pick up my guitar everyday, and that's really all I could ask for.

I've been playing guitar for years and by playing this I feel more motivated to practice. I enjoy the game aspect of this but, the biggest thing for me is the ""Riff repeater"" mode which lets you practice certain sections of a song on an endless loop with the full band playing. Just with that I've been able to stay in time a lot more compared to before. They have a lot of lessons too for new players which would have been a major jump start for me back in 2001 if I had this. 

Like I said it's not perfect; the game will register notes even if you're not playing or maybe you'll play a note that you feel is on time but, it still says you're late or missed it. It's not too big of a deal unless you're a person that needs achievements in-game. 

For any level of guitar or bass players this is a great game/tool to mess around with. Not everyone can afford ridiculously expensive pedals or amps so this is a cheap alternative to those. You will definitely get your moneys worth. 

Oh and the main thing that has me hooked would probably be the CDLC. Endless amount of songs to play. Before I would mostly play a bit of metal now, I'm playing a LOT of metal. \m/",1589955575,1589955575,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rocksmith's songs have a dynamic difficulty range, and it adjusts to you and your progress. Personally, I didn't find Rocksmith's lessons very helpful in really describing how to perform certain techniques (like bending on a guitar). That being said, I love using the mini-games to practice these techniques (harmonics, bending, vibratos, scales, sliding, etc.). The session mode isn't my favorite; i'd probably just turn on a backing track on the internet before resorting to the session mode, but it is a cool concept.
Rocksmith is definitely a fun tool that really motivates you to keep practicing your instrument. Overall, I would recommend getting Rocksmith if you're looking to improve your rock guitar / bass skills.",1589401854,1589401854,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also, I've produced music and DJed as well so keep in mind that I have experience with weird USB interfaces for midi or audio when you read this.

This game sucks to set up. It absolutely blows. I almost gave it a negative because I just wanted to play some Opeth and Slayer but here I was with this game not even getting along with USB audio interfaces......
So I bought the stupid cable. Paid more for it than I did the game.... Annnnnd it was still a pain to set up....

A couple hours later after unplugging and disabling a bunch of audio devices, I finally got it to work just using the plain old Realtek as default output, this Rocksmith cable as default input (no other devices enabled on either) and allowing exclusive control of only the Rocksmith hardware.

Finally, after much trial and error, I grabbed my Schecter, plugged er in and something amazing happened.... It sounded like hot garbage. But then I saw that I could change my tone... Annnnd now I'm a huge fan of this game I never played as a teenager!

Once it's set up, there's nothing like it. I played Synthesia with a midi piano.. Maybe that's a little like it.. But not much. This is the only thing like this and it's amazing. Even more so that they are still making DLC. (The Opeth pack is why I bought this.)

So do I recommend this? I can't say absolutely, because I can see all of the hassle making absolute beginners shy away and cry into their empty wallet. But.... BUT, if you know your way around a fretboard even a little bit, and if you aren't afraid to fool with your sound settings, I say DO absolutely get it. It's worth your patience. It will make you love playing guitar again.

[b]TIPS:[/b]
The cable is called a ""Rocksmith 2014 Realtone Cable"" if you wanna look it up on Amazon or Ebay or something. Make sure you get the real OEM one. Found mine for about $27. Alternatively, you might be able to use an audio interface, but I had no such luck. It was easier to use with the stupid cable.

You should be able to use any guitar but make sure it's strung for regular tuning and you might wanna use your bridge pickup, because most songs only ever go about as low as drop D or a half step down on standard. Don't use EB ""Heavy Bottoms"" or ""Not Evens"" for this game. Your fingertips and expensive picks will thank you.  (Hey Ubisoft, throw us headbangers a bone and add some Belphegor or Meshuggah! I wanna chug on this in A tuning!)

I can get my audio engine setting to 2 because setting it to 1 introduced unbearable crackling with my system. The only way to play this game is to just plug your guitar into an amp so you can hear the true sound of the guitar and just stick a microphone in front of the amp for note detection (it's also kinda awesome because it picks up the speaker sounds and sometimes gives you credit for notes you didn't hit which is actually very encouraging.) It also allows you to hear the backing tracks guitar more clearly. Highly recommend for anyone who has a guitar sitting around collecting dust during the pandemic.

Developed by Ubisoft, any electric guitar can be plugged in using an adapter, which then allows the game to provide input on the playing. Hitting the notes in the game is the same as actually playing in real life. The game does an excellent job for its purpose, giving a large selection of songs to learn, entertaining minigames, tone creator and accessible to even the beginner of the music instrument. I will be treating the original and the “remastered” version as the same game, since the latter is the same only with more songs and gameplay optimizations.
	The main part of the game, called “Learn a Song,” presents a selection of songs to choose from, which are all unlocked from the get-go, which vary in genre, such as “Blitzkick Bop” for Funk and “Paranoid Android” for Alternative Rock. After calibrating and tuning your guitar (with the help of on screen visuals), you’re thrown into a guitar-hero esque highway with the notes that you need to hit careening towards the screen. The number and it’s horizontal position marks the fret that needs to be pressed and it’s vertical position and color represents the string to pluck. The onscreen strings are ordered from the lowest string on the top, and highest on the bottom, as if you were looking at an instructor playing the guitar across. You can also flip it over, so the string order matches tabs. The song starts with only playing one note per measure, but as you “level-up,” meaning you play the current level consistently well, more notes are added , till the level is maxed out. Then, Literally thousands of songs can be purchased from the story. Prices like 3.99$ per song seems expensive until you realize that the majority of the costs comes from simply buying the audio of the song. As a bonus, there’s a lessons tab which features videos and interactive exercises of various techniques (power chords, bends, harmonics). I still find myself playing these from time to time, because the lick that uses these techniques at the end of the exercise, doubling as a test, is very rewarding to play right.
	The other major mode is GuitarCade. It contains 7 minigames which are actually practice drills disguised with flashy visuals. The “games” are played with your guitar, and the game integrates guitar techniques like plucking harmonics to sneak around and steel jems, plucking the right string to hit the bad guys, or comboing by going up and down a scale. It might be a novelty for beginners, but it’s exactly that: a novelty. It gets old very fast, and it becomes boring to play- might as well set up a metronome and play to it. Related is a Jam Session mode, where the game procedurally generated backing tracks customized from settings (instruments, mode, key, tempo, etc). It’s a good place to practice solos, but there aren't enough varieties on the backing tracks.
	Next up is the Tone Designer. You can create your own tone (a guitar term used for a combination of effects, amps, and pedals that give your playing a distinctive sound), with hundreds of virtual amps, pedal effects, and preamps. While it pales in comparison to the real things (or other emulated amp software such as Guitar Rig or IK Multimedia), it’s extremely impressive given the price range for the game- 60$ plus $20 guitar adaptor accessory.
	Some criticisms I have are the lag in the audio when playing. It’s slightly mitigated by playing on the computer, rather on a video game console, but it’s still there. In addition, Ubisoft was extremely unhelpful with getting my Uplay account to work with the game.
	The reason I had chosen this game to review is because on April 12, they announce the end of support for Rocksmith. They’re working on a new game, but this game is a great place for beginners to learn guitar, who are more visually orientated learners than audio ones. This game get’s a 8/10 for originality, great execution, great selection of songs, and mediocre game modes.

I started from essentially zero experience with guitar. Hundreds of dollars (probably) in DLC. It has a huge library of music, lots of lessons, exercises, a jam band mode, arcade games that help you practice technique, and a huge library of simulated pedals, cabs, amps, etc. that you can use to model a tone without buying all the equipment. Also, a Score Attack mode where you can compete against other real people in an online leaderboard. The only thing it can't do, really, is instruct you on how to be patient and not take cheap shortcuts that gimp your playing. So definitely focus on playing crisp and not on fudging the notes. I would recommend a good pair of headphones. 

My recommendation for learning the songs best is, like many others, to start Riff Repeater and crank the difficulty, then slow it down. Also pay attention to the highlighted section on the fretboard. This is where your hands should ideally be positioned. 

Learning music theory (or not) is up to you, but it can't hurt.

I was able to play quite a few songs but could never get chords down for the life of me. I played about six hours a week at the least, mostly in two to three hour bursts. The arcade games were fun on the original Rocksmith, but I played on Xbox 360 back then. Then I moved to PC and kept playing Rocksmith on Steam. Then this version came out and I played a bit of guitar on 2014's version, felt really good, but ultimately I burned myself out and chose to play other games instead of this one.

However, even after large gaps in time, I can still pick up the guitar and play songs on this game like I never quit playing. And there is NOTHING in the world like not playing for half a year, plugging in and still getting high accuracy on some of the harder Rocksmith songs. It feels damn good.

Fast forward a few years to 2017 and I pick up my first bass, a cheapo Squire Precision bass off Amazon to fill some time and the want to learn an instrument. I decided to use a trusty tool again, Rocksmith. I fell in love with The Arctic Monkeys, I fell in love with Radiohead and some of the slower alt-rock bands. Blink-182? You bet. I learned them all. It was a familiar medium to me, the only oddity was the bass guitar's fret spacing, which I overcame in about a month. I moved from pick bass to fingers only, and fingers only to some weird form of slap that I can't really explain but it works for me. 

And now its 2020, quarantine time. I haven't played Rocksmith since early 2019. And you bet there's still no better feeling than picking up an instrument and playing a song that you haven't played in a year and getting over 90% accuracy on it. 

The DLC is worth it too.

The tab transcription style is HORRENDOUS. Read Item 1.

For classic rock these lazy marketers love to sell you songs that have much better live versions and put 5 chords then call it day or put the crappy short version. Totally feels like a scam, start with:
In a Gadda Da Vida
Love of my life

And many more.

1: is the tabbing is not always the most efficient way to play, for example on Jimi Hendrix Little wing there's a double stop tabbed as fret 5 on the G string and fret 9 on the D string. That's ridiculous, in Eb those notes are B and Bb. You can just play fret 5 on the G string and the open B string. THe songs are full of annoying quirks like that. If you know the fretboard you can do the conversion but for learning, who the hell is revieweing these?
Great example: For the Love of God by Steve Vai. There's much better ways to play the intense Wah Wah part but these geniuses turned it into a nightmare.


2: The open note notation, they use a bar that takes 2 to 3 frets, when you're playing arpeggios in the lower frets (1 to 3) and lower strings (E, A, D)  combined with the other strings it gets REALLY crowded in the screen and it becomes really impossible to sight read.

Yes, that's right Amanda from next door, you think I can't hear you at 11 AM but I can. Anyway now i got that off my chest, i do recommend this game to anyone named Amanda who watches soap operas in the middle of the day and wants something more interesting to do with their life.

But seriously though, I wouldn't play this if you want to get good at it as fast as if you were playing a guitar hero game for the first time (like the game advertises itself it does...) I would get it if you have some interest in music theory or playing guitar before considering buying this game.

If you feel at least somewhat comfortable playing guitar, this will feel like you're playing a game like Osu or Geometry Dash, where it's 4 minutes of trying to get a perfect score as possible. If you feel new to the guitar, this will literally just feel like a deadpan android is staring blankly at you in the face while you try to figure out how to play, judging you, but not actually telling you if you're doing a good job or not until the end of a song, but in a way that is obvious they're holding back criticism. In all seriousness, this could actually negatively affect your self esteem and cause you to quit playing, so keep that in mind if you're not too motivated in the first place.

A good 'demo' of this game is to look at YouTube videos of people playing it. Try to play along and see if it's your thing. If you have the money to buy the game (lets say its 95% of or something in a couple of months) but you can't afford the cable, play in disconnected mode with the default songs that come with it (there are a few really good default songs). This would basically be the same as watching a youtube video though so don't do this if it's either full price, or you never intend to get a cable in the future.

There's guitarcade, session mode, and tone designer which you'd think would add a lot to the game but get boring very quick. They also don't really do a good job at teaching you much, as the second you start to learn something it is immediately forgotten when there's a big baddie on the screen about to ruin your score.

Overall this feels like a weird plugin for a weird music software wrapped in a weird game which for some sad, single men like me sounds like an ideal way to spend a friday evening. For others, this game will just not stick. You really have to have the motivation to play this, just loading it up and selecting a song won't keep you interested for very long, and if this is the only guitar related activity you do, don't expect to make anything other than a weird buzz with the string outside of playing the game.

I hope the next one they just don't market it as a learning tool and just go full on 'yeah it's just a video game.'",1588619943,1588619943,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
