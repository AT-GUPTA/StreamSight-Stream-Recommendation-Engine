Pros:
- nice graphics
- an attempt to get back to the roots of the series

Cons:
- Uplay
- Reused music from M&M:H 6
- Bad sound engineering. Effect sounds are too loud. Enemy turn music starts too late, so in 1x1 match it plays for 1 sec and it sounds rather like a bug
- camera angles on the map are not comfortable to pickup resources
- bad UI. Double click on a city on the global map doesn't open it but commands a hero to go to the town. Double click on a hero portrait doesn't open it, instead you have to aim to a small (!) pop-up. Pop-ups are a bad UI design.
- town screens. Same mistake from M&MH6
- Combat animations - very slow. Upgraded elves attack animation is just terrible. Firstly then do few steps to align with the target, then shoot once, then wait, then shoot second time. Very long. Also you have to wait till the creature impact animation which is long too.
- you have to wait until the end of the end of the combat hero animation on the global map
- no ability to understand an artifact specs you've just picked up. You need to go to a hero's menu and observe there 
- NO INFERNO
- weak soundtrack
- main menu is horrible
- town building menu is a great example of a bad UI. Should be studied in UI courses on internet
- hero skill wheel: expert level is just blank until you click on it and read a caption that it actually opens 2 more skills
- new type of resources. why???
- visual bugs + crashes
- very strange creatures selection. Elves have 2 almost identical units: pixies and driads. Sounds like a crisis of ideas.
- UI looks very cheap. The game palette is ugly brown. The brown UI windows are everywhere. The palette could've been dynamic depending on a color of a player like in HoMM3
- price is too high for the game, it's 9 years old and costs 12.5 euro for complete version on sale

- The campaigns were fun and are tied together well through the council table stories.
- The soundtrack and gameplay make it easy to completely lose track of time.
- It's Heroes of Might & Magic.

[u]Negatives:[/u]
 - The achievement for the first of the final campaigns didn’t unlock for me when completed. Others seem to have had issues with achievements not unlocking as well.
- The balancing of the campaigns. Some are much more difficult than others even on the same setting. (Over time I found that some just require more specific strategies and become near impossible even on easy if you deviate too much)
- More factions would have been awesome.
- Some achievements require the overpriced DLC.

Buy this game if you enjoy an okay strategy game and are willing to overlook your love for previous series and realise they may share the same title but are not one and the same.
However, Heroes 5 is a lot more bang for your buck though if you want an Ashan HoMM.

Pros:

-Play this strictly for the gameplay and you're wanting to scratch that turn based strategy itch.

- The Artstyle is good but unbelievable at times. It's very beautiful to look at and I especially enjoy the Stained Glass window motif going on.

-Hero development is different enough to be interesting, feels quite similar to a mod for Heroes 5(.5)

Cons:

- I can't comment on the multiplayer

- This is not HoMM3 and I only recommend it with a open mind, the developers have admitted they cannot match that legacy under Ubisoft.

- The necessary DRM from Ubisoft is lame, so need Steam and Ubisoft to run it.

- The story and setting is not it's best points.

Just to get off my chest: the Setting is very bland and is part of why I struggle to get into the Heroes now. Ashan just doesn't work very well as a setting, it portrays a high fantasy without a lot of substance. I can think of one game that used Ashan well and that was Dark Messiah, which focused on the grittier parts of the world. The Artstyle also has a role to play with this too, when everything is so bright and colourful it can sometimes be hard to take seriously if it has a grittier moment, as an example I find the Necromancers not intimidating at all but they definitely had a presence in Dark Messiah.

Another thing to remember with the settings of the previous titles developed by JVC's team is that they had their RPGs running alongside their Strategy games and thus had a better build up and time line with their world lore. I still do not understand Ashan and I've played most of their games now, I just wish MMX delivered a strong world-build into Ashan but it did not sadly.

The fights are well designed and I cannot complain, the hero customization is easy even though it looks different. Unfortunately I found the way the story is presented to me very cliched and dull, I couldn't even see who I would be playing when I was choosing the campaign in the menu. 
The map you mainly play at is detailed and the graphics look nice. Unfortunately, however, it was often confusing and very limited. The end was demarcated by an unwelcome invisible cut - it just didn't go any further. Some treasures and chests disappeared behind trees and the landscape and the controls weren't as intuitive as I would have liked for a strategy game.

1. The Ivan Campaign is full of bugs. Through the forums you can see the issues there are years old and the fact that neither Ubisoft nor Steam releases any fix or patch is not a good way to keep a happy customer. The first mission of Ivan's campaign does not give the achievement while you complete it while the second mission has issue with the troops that are disappearing once you add them from garrisons or your castle to your rank and file. 

2. In the dungeons campaign Soulscar clan died even before I could reach him which left me stuck after winning the map without being able to claim victory over the mission as the quest was still open to open a path for him even though he is long dead. I had to use a cheat code just to move to the next mission and get the achievement.

If you are a die-hard fan of the franchise, and are simply looking for something M&M but fresh- then this is at least new, and something to do. 
I found the removal of the 'Inferno' faction to be a mistake. The addition of the Dwarves is nice, until you learn it's blocked by a pay wall which costs ALMOST AS MUCH AS THE WHOLE GAME....
The pre-existing factions have been altered, including units. 
While the aforementioned template is essentially the same, it feels eerily similar yet unnatural... Like a bad dream. 
If you love the M&M franchise or are curious about checking it out... H6 (Heroes of Might and Magic 6) is the peak state of this brand. Game 6 was by far the best version since the O.G. game 3.

In all honesty, I'm slightly disappointed with the game simply because this is the first time I've ever played a HoMM game with bugs. I'm not saying that other games were perfect, but if they glitched, it was so far and few between that I have no memories of those glitches. But this game glitched often enough to actually affect gameplay. And some of the glitches were fairly catastrophic for gameplay and required a reload of the game because of how they could affect a major battle.

Also, Necromancer's were majorly nerfed compared to previous iterations making that playthrough way less enjoyable.

Graphics seem like a slight downgrade from Homm VI despite recycling many of the game models from it.

Heroes 7 is far superior to 5 and 6, and the game play is a return to the formula from 3, with the deep lore and story along the lines of 4. The campaign is very, very long and and goes through a massive branching story line filled to the brim with Might & Magic history and lore. The writing is excellent, and the voice acting is very good.

It is not an easy game by far, but like other games in the series there are multiple difficulty levels to fit your taste. Along with the massive main story campaign, there are 2 short mini campaigns, 5 and 7 maps each. Along with that there are 25 additional story maps included, each with its on story, heroes and mission, like the Adventure maps from Heroes 4.

On top of all that content, there is a random map generator. You customize everything you want, pick from a huge roster of starting Heroes, and the game makes a seeded map for you to play. We are talking a TON of content and replay value here. 

The graphics are a little dated by today's standards, but the art style is truly great, and the game looks very good running in the Unreal engine. The music may not be as god tier as Romero's soundtracks from Heroes 4 and Might & Magic 6, but it flows with the same style and is very good.

Then there is the somewhat bad. To play the game you have to use the Ubisoft launcher. Its annoying, but its not as bad as some people would make it out to be. You log in once, link your Steam account, and that is it. You launch the game from Steam, get Steam achievements, and don't really have to worry with Ubisoft Connect, it launches itself when you open the game from Steam, and closes when your shut the game down.

All said, if you love Heroes 3 and 4,  if you like 4X, turn based strategy, you would do well to give  Heroes 7 a buy. It really is the best Heroes game since 4 by far, has great production values, runs well, looks good, and you are really getting a TON of content here. 

Solid recommend.

I will say this; the gameplay is good in this game if you like other might and magic games, duh.

I have a brand new computer. Seriously, I built it 2 weeks ago. 3070 Ti, Intel i7 12700k, with excellent cooling, 16 GB RAM, and a case designed to maximize airflow. I have no problems running brand new games with ray tracing at or above 60 fps without surpassing 60 degrees celsius. I can run Cyberpunk 2077 at 130 fps easily on max settings with ray tracing with sub 60 celsius temps. It isn't hard on my computer at all. Why am I emphasizing my PC's capabilities, you ask?

This game is the most poorly optimized POS I have ever played in my life. My GPU usage is at 100%, CPU above 50% when I run this game. My temps are 15 degrees higher than brand new games on ultra settings. This game eats your memory and is really difficult to run despite the requirements listed. It also requires you to sync with Uplay, even to run singleplayer.

This is a game from 2015, with graphics from 2009, and requires hardware from 2052 to run without stressing your PC. I had all my settings maxed, but noticed it seemed really hard on my rig, so I turned it all down to low. Higher framerate, but it still hogged all my memory and runs mediocre. At 244 fps, the game still looks clunky. It is currently 7 years after release, and this game still runs like trash. Seriously, my GPU came out less than a year ago, and it is struggling with this game. If it could cry, it would while running this.

I think it would be less stressful on my PC to chop celery using my CPU Cooler. This is more poorly optimized than pushing a dead elephant up a 50 ft hill of ice covered with baby oil. I am going to finish it due to it being a part of the might and magic games (unfortunately), then I am going to forget about it. I would suggest anyone considering buying this game to go buy literally any other combination of games totalling this game's price instead, and running them all at once on your PC.

Being a fan of the HoMM series, I have always looked forward in purchasing the next HoMM release. I love HoMM3-5, am able to play HoMM6, but honestly HoMM7 is so bad that this is the first ever HoMM game I refunded & refused to play.

After another year, I decided to give this game another try. I drilled through the first few missions, and finally I can give my honest review after putting 20 hours into the game. This game IS NOT WORTH IT. For the love of HOMM series (I am a big fan since 1996) please do not buy this game.

Homm3 is the masterpiece (completed + all dlc)
Homm4 is playable (completed + all dlc)
Homm5 is another masterpiece (completed + all dlc)
Homm6 is good (completed)
Homm7 DO NOT BUY
Pros
-a new HoMM series
-new HoMM Heroes
-new HoMM units

Cons
-Crappy Graphics - Everything looks really crappy and unsmooth
-Most units do not have abilites. Unlike HoMM5, where units like liches & Pit Lords can cast spells, Wraiths & Colossus has unit abilities, most of the units in HoMM7 can only wait-attack-defend.
-Battle animation does not look good at all. For example when colossus attacks, he does not attack the unit. Instead, he 'steps' the land in front of him (without hitting the enemy unit) and then the enemy unit receives damage.
-Uplay. After purchasing this game through Steam, you have to download Uplay and register for a Uplay account separately. Upon playing your PAID GAME, the Uplay then takes a few moment to recognize you before ALLOWING you to play the PAID GAME. Uplay downright is...a killer on its own.

[b] The good: [/b]

1. All the annoying and bad ingame concepts from heroes 6 that were totally alien to the franchise have been removed. Concepts like converting cities ,reputation system, spells that were in the skill tree and not something that you can learn from magic guilds ect are gone at the same time that the descent ones like zones of control remain. 

2. A lot of good concepts from previous games of the series are back (caravans, magic guilds, skill wheel ect) and also there are some new interesting ones like plundering the mines.

3. All the unnecessary complexity with dynasties , dynasty seals , buttons for connection with Skype!!! , chat buttons ect in other words all of the nonsense that exits in heroes 6 is gone. 

4. Traditional fractions that were missing from heroes 6 like Fortress, Academy and Sylvan are back in the expense of the ridiculous Sanctuary fraction - well good riddance, personally I am not going to miss it.

5. As far as I can tell after all the patches there are no fatal gamebraking bugs. I still remember the notorious black screen bug of heroes 6 that ubisoft never completely solve and the only real solution was to roll back Nvidia drivers to 301.42...

[b] The bad: [/b]

1. I have the feeling that the graphics of the game are worse from those of heroes 6 with no cinematics, animated cutscenes ect at all. It seems that there were nobody left (ubifoft the exterminator!!!) to retrofit the work of black hole (the developer of heroes 6) so they had to do a lot of staff from scratch with a minimum budget and the result is a game that visualy looks cheaper than its predecessor. 

2. To make things even worse the optimization of the game is terrible. It is almost unbelievable the strain those graphics put on the GPU.  I think the explanation for this terrible optimization has to do with the developer of the game Limbic entertainment. This company was also the developer of Might and Magic X legacy and if memory serves that game also have the same optimization problems. 

3. No inferno fraction!! it was my favorite. I think that an expansion like ""trial by fire"" sold at the price of 30 Euros!!! should also include that fraction aside with the fortress one. Shame on you ubisoft!!!

4. Sometimes maps are obscure and confusing because a lot of buildings are just there for decorative reasons and it is hard to distingue them from those that you can interact with.

5. I would prefer a lineal progressive complain like heroes 5 instead of the separate completely independent ones for every deferent fraction. 

6. One of the best aspects of heroes games is the development of your heroes. In certain missions that is not the case anymore because you start with a level 5 , 20 or even 30 (fully developed) hero.
 
[b] Verdict: [/b]
The game is not terrible like heroes 6 , it is a fair game that is enjoyable simply because it reverses some of the damage done in the past by removing most of the annoying game mechanics of its predecessor and restores some of the traditional playstyle of the series. But is this enough ? is this that what we wanted from the latest (and possibly the last) installment of the game?  Because if we look closely the game is cheap with obviously a lower budget from heroes 6 that moreover does not add something to the series.

So the ""thumbs down"" in my review is more like a ""finger up"" to ubisoft - the destroyer of a fabulous franchise, because the game is descent (not great) and if you are a fun of the series you are probably going to enjoy it but it is not worth 50 Euros, take it only on steam sales with a significant discount.",1678268440,1678293025,False,15,1,0.673479259014129639,0,True,False,False

Knowing Ubisoft as many of us do, I did not preorder MM7. That played out well for me as it released in the fashion I have come to expect from them. By all accounts the game was heinous and unplayable. So I ignored it. Until I started to see positive reviews float from the depths, mentioning patch 1.6 as finally releasing a finished, playable and enjoyable game. I dared not to hope... But it was also on steam sale... I took the plunge.....

And sunk into the warm, comforting bath water of a heroes of might magic game. 7 sees the return of resources and spells and mage guilds, but keeps the area control around towns. The skill dots of 6 also forgotten, now having a wheel where you can take various skills to grand mastery, mastery, expert or novice depending on your class, of which each faction has 6. Before you get overwhelmed with choice note that 6 are the same for every faction, 3 might and 3 magic with an agressive, defensive and balanced version of each. You can plan ahead, make very different heroes with different playstyles on every map... A great experience.

The game is ready to be played, it is fun, it is worthy of it's lineage.

I'm still exploring the game, slowly reading through skill trees and trying out different factions, but so far the game didn't crash once, I've seen only one or two minor bugs so far, so the performance is completely alright for me.
Moreover this game changed a lot of pain in the ass procedures from the previous versions for the better. For example recruiting can be done from one screen basically with one click. I love the caravans, that transport units to your nearest city or fort, because I don't need an extra hero just for logistics and supplying the army to the main one. 
On the other hand, based on the lynching reviews, I was somehow expecting a completely different game... But haven still has crossbowmen, monks, cavaliers and angels, sylvan only exchanged unicorns for does, the hunters, blade dancers, pixies, druids etc stayed, necro has liches, and so on... One still moves with movement points, can visit stables, windmills, various shrines with +1 or 2 something, attack crypt with treasures, own mines, and all the good stuff. City building is also more or less based on the same principal, one building per day, now with a tree of prerequisities and dependencies, which makes the whole thing very clear and straightforward.

Do not get this game if you want a fun multiplayer experience.  Games often break and loads/saves do too.  You'll finish maybe 1 in 7 games even with all the community bug patch fixes.  Which is a darn shame cuz it's a really good game if that wasn't the case.  If not for the love I have of the series and the great single player I'd say this is a do not buy.  Definitely don't buy it full price.  I doubt they'll ever fix all the bugs with saving/loading and that stall multiplayer games they lost interest in this game years ago.

I wrote a negative review which as of Patch 1.6 I have since retracted, if you want to know what was wrong prior to patch 1.6 read the many many reviews on it already here many of which won't be retracted or re-written and such is the legacy you leave if you release a game before it is tested and completed and ask people's cash.  I doubt Ubi will learn a lesson from it as they have a history of doing this but one can hope.  The amount of money this game could have made overall as a finished product released with positive reviews will now sadly never be realized.

As for the game, this game is the best Heroes iteration since Heroes IV, though as any review it is up to opinion and discussion I will try to keep it on topic and based on things at least measurable.  

Graphics are very good, I did not like Heroes V or VI graphics, V graphics very much reminded me of early WoW graphics they were bulky, fat, and simplistic with tons of bright colors.  VI trimmed it up a bit, but VII is full rendered fantasy with great designs from an artist with some great concepts, the green dragons in this one look amazing for example (they look like they themselves were grown out of the forest) and many other creature designs are very well rendered, if still a bit bulky and ill defined for my tastes it is miles past V or VI.  IV had actual scans of 3d models as sprites, and III any way you look at it, the graphics are severely dated.   But I am happy with the graphics on this game, the maps are also amazing, and the towns are beautifully rendered.  In V you had 3d animated town screens with dramatic sweeping cameras but I find I don't miss them, and prefer the solid functional and pretty town screens they implemented in every other hereos game, and so I can say with confidence this is my favorite when it comes to graphics in all areas but two: 1) the animations for some creatures are a bit odd on fast combat speed, and while somewhat to be expected even on slow speeds animation starts and stops can be awkward.  2) some of running animation of hero mounts also seem off on the map.  Overall, 9/10 for graphics, I'd give more if it had the animations better sync'd with the game.

Sound is very good in this game, I love all the sounds in combat, and the music is stunning and very pleasant and there is different music for every town screen.  This seems lovingly done and very much puts me into the mood to play and does a ton for the atmosphere of the game.  10/10

Gameplay is addicting, I just had my brother and neighbor over and we played from 6pm at night to 4am in the morning hotseating and visiting.  We intently helped each other play even though we are techinically against each other, and it was a walk down memory lane and enjoyable in new exciting ways that pleased us very much.  Since the gameplay bugs were fixed we had no reservations about digging in and very much loved it.  It is all it promises to be a heroes game playing homage to its roots, and past, and community wishes.  The skill system is somewhat revamped, but I consider it an improvement, the same things that were always there, are there but it shows you everything and what you're getting into making better strategy.  Many of the broken mechanics and annoying things any long time heroes fan would know about were addressed.  Some juicy examples: you can quick combat and if you don't like the results you can play manually.  This makes for quicker turns and less gambling on how good the AI will play on your behalf (which you couldn't expect much from the AI in any heroes game but we'll get to that more in the next section).  Town building screens are very informative now, right clicking on most things lets the window stay open so you can examine abilities, AI turns are quick (heroes V had they had longer turns than players often times AI was still bad),  there is a compendium of information for heroes and units, medusas no longer guarantee kill things, minotaurs no longer have a chance to block all damage, there's more slots for artifacts, having the wrong school of magic doesn't totally screw your hero on a map when a powerful spell is found because you can still learn it just not as strong as if you were in that school... the list really goes on and on and I'm still finding large improvements on gameplay.  There are a few minor things I'd like to see changed but I can't bring myself to even mention them at the moment.  10/10 for gameplay this is the direction heroes should go.

The AI is pretty bad in any heroes game, but it is really missing decision making in this one and hopefully that is patched in.  I still prefer it to the release date heroes V AI because it would take about 5 minutes every time you ended turn and it was still stupid.  This is lightning quick, as IV, and III were and has yet to achieve their intelligence but on a normal game at least they can still come into your territory with a sizable army and make a fun diversion.  When it gets to the meat of strategy though, no Heroes AI was ever good and there's lots of ways you can beat them having bigger armies than you but that is part of the formula for heroes imo.  You kill bigger stronger foes by being smarter,it's a strategy game after all.  Sometimes it will fail in this though and you are up against an AI that managed to kill itself.  That happened in V though and even IV a few times, but it was something to laugh at rather than get mad, usually with friends.  There is definite room for improvement of the AI however.  AI is 5/10. If they start picking up ALL resources they come across and don't always buy a ton of heroes could boost that a lot.  This would let them build bigger armies and punish players who take too long to explore or wait longer in base to build up bigger armies to use weaker strategy/take less losses in capturing objectives and collecting treasure.

The worst part of this game in my opinion is the comments on the official website, while some were deserved for releasing a game that should've stayed in beta testing for 7 months, the level of irrational hatred there and raw negativity makes me ashamed to associate myself as a fan.  I really liked the idea of the shadow council, and silencing negative opinions can seem draconian, but moderation, tone and a code of conduct are still very important factors for making a game and atmosphere built on constructive feedback.  I honestly wish they'd just remove comments on their official website as it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth every time I go there.  

In conclusion, the game was released too early and paid a heavy price for it, and will now always live in that shadow.  It is however through patching, now the best heroes iteration since Heroes IV.  It has improved gameplay, great graphics, been based on community desires and feedback, great music and sound, and fixed and improved upon many broken mechanics and annoyances from past iterations learning from the past in a good way and taking the Heroes franchise in a direction that I very much want to see, on the strong stipulation that Ubisoft will stop releasing games that aren't finished ruining not only their company reputation but the games that had a lot of potential to become market breakers.",1450862685,1669528829,True,231,14,0.841268002986907959,7,True,False,False

The main problem is that the campaigns go straight from very easy first missions to insanely difficult and almost impossible without cheating for the subsequent missions. You can complete them by activating cheats (you need to google how to do this or check the steam discussion forums - it's fairly easy). And it saves time. But it doesn't give you the feeling of finally having worked out how to win. It's just not satisfying. The campaigns become tedious as a result.

So how about single player random maps? Well those are ok, but a bit dull, because there are no independent cities to take. Each player, human or AI, gets one city. And the rest is just mines and adventure locations for bonuses and getting spells and finding items and gold etc. Which is nice enough, but makes a single player random map quite slow to do and a bit dull after a while.

Also while the skills system is ok, with interesting skill choice paths, you can only use pre-made heroes. You can't create your own with the skills and special ability choice set that you'd prefer.

Not sure whether the minimalist design in everything except battles is a design choice or due to not enough time being given to add more. You can eventually work out most things. But some people will have given up in frustration due to the lack of a proper manual before they get to that point. e.g If you click on your hero when they're in a town it's hard to see how to see your own units' special abilities. Only outside it do the unit graphics become big enough to notice the info exclamation mark button (though maybe that's due to my screen resolution settings - not sure).

To be fair the company staff on the game's discussion boards try to help (though not in the last few weeks - possibly on holiday just now). But that's not really a substitute for a proper manual that you could find things out from right away.

Going into Heroes VIII towns is a bit of a let down after Heroes V and VI. No stunning buildings and graphics. just a flow chart with boxes for buildings changing colour as you build them. The flow chart is helpful for knowing what buildings are required to build others. But can't help thinking you could have had a building tree flowchart you could have looked at when building, and the nice city buildings from Heroes V and VI too.

I gave Heroes VII a second chance and really tried to like it, but in the end it was no good.",1445964552,1661302111,False,0,0,0.537835419178009033,0,True,False,False

Posted by Storm-Giant at 19:59, 5 Oct 2016:
Heroes VII development comes to an end..

Just 2 months after the release of the first and only expansion, an update on the official page announced the end of the partnership between Limbic Entertainment and Ubisoft, and, therefore, H7 development cycle ends too.

This shouldn’t really catch anybody by surprise, considering the base game lackluster sale numbers, or the absolute non-existent promotion of the Trial by Fire expansion, which as of today has still not been reviewed either. H7 woes have been in the talk of the community since before the game started the public beta, with each of Ubisoft’s movements spilling more doubts around its eventual fate. Although it is remarkable that the support of the game has been terminated after only two months of its release, a sad record in the franchise.

It is hard to imagine where will the Might & Magic franchise will go from here. After the disaster of H6, H7 was supposed to bring some form of stability to the series, but it has obviously failed. With the spin-offs released after H6 (DoC, HO, MMX) also failing to leave a mark and all but forgotten now, plus Limbic out of the picture, it would not surprise me if the M&M brand is frozen until the time for a proper comeback is due. Or it could continue releasing cheap mobile games on the chinese market, who knows.

On an unrelated note, our veteran moderator in the Tournament of Honor forums, Vesuvius, has been working on a turn-based strategy game for the past two years called Space Wars. Game beta will start on December, and he has already posted some information about the game. If you are interested or you have any questions about the game, drop by and ask him directly, he won't bite! :)
""

The game's state at even this time is ""barely playable at best"" - Honestly I had my hopes up for H7 but instead of even beginning to really fix anything, an expansion was released. And if you can believe the news post, development seized two months afterwards.

So: Buyers beware. You will run into disappearing units, thrown together balance fixes that break faction mechanics (undead's raise), and a humongous amount of gameplay bugs. All of this without any hope it will be fixed - at all.

Going to leave the same review for the expansion.

Honestly though? Ubisoft has outdone themselves with this title. In the bad sense.

VII somehow managed to remove all kinds of good parts VI had while added some ‘mysterious’ horrible changes that lacking of consideration. Which made me had to write review for them, as a long time fan of the franchise(I have played all campaigns and most of skirmish maps from 3rd -6th).

The terrible mechanics start with: Broken OP magic
The ultimate change that breaking the game is: the general damaging magic are way too OP in the game. Moreover, it’s probably the worst case in the entire franchise. There is little you can do when met a magic hero who deals massive amount of magic damage each turn, since there is no magic resistant skill for heroes to learn apart from mastering Destiny skill which will give you 50% chance for enemies’ heroes to cast a spell to fail. Though not only there is few hero can learn that master part of Destiny, but also magic ignores all the creatures’ defense, it puts the game to be broken in several ways.
First, academy faction benefits OP part the most, having gargoyle and obsidian gargoyle completely immune any magic influences, while casting ridiculous damaging spell each turn to the enemies’ army, you can simple send your stacks of gargoyles into enemies’ legion as a bait then blasting them with chain of lighting which easily causes thousands of damage to several targets nearby. Academy’s faction skill is even more unforgivingly OP because the more times heroes casting a damaging spell, it gets stronger and stronger every turn. Gargoyles are the core creatures of the faction( equals 1&2 grades, if compare the previous titles, while possessing one of the highest defense and  HP among the rank, often large numbered because of the basic rank, it’s not going down easily). 
Let me put academy’s own creatures advantages aside(will discuss it below in ‘unbalanced factions’ section), the domination side of magic makes academy a pain in the ass to deal with, specially in campaign. Why? Because enemy’s main hero in campaign scenario is pre-set, usually at least 5 levels higher than you, their army size is often a lot larger than yours too, due to starting with multiple towns in control. The contradiction is not only that, the entire situation with many campaigns across all kinds of factions’ are intervened to the matter which suppose to giving players challenge. In the end, it often ended up running out of hand, because logically, the more time  you take to overcome enemies’ towns, your economy and army will suffer the numerous disadvantage. However, when you try to ‘rush attack’ your foes, their main heroes simply counter you by blazing your little army with damaging spells that even with summoning elementals, you still can’t last long(easily a thousand of damage a turn...remember?) Putting how lame the design itself may be, the fact is, neither you can rush attack your enemies nor you can take time to gather forces, it became very awkward to play maps like this, but it happens so often in campaign scenarios. Sometimes in order to counter the horrible system and design, players were forced to seek an alternative way to beat the game without defeating these broken OP heroes which contradicts the purpose of the gameplay, well, unless developers were enjoying gamers being overwhelmed by the AI.
Anyways, in the other hand, playing academy by your own,  in a random skirmish, the game felt too easy and boring because once you mastered the OP system of magic, you would burn everything in ash to claim the victory.  The AI hardly will have any chance if it duels you equally, in a random generated map.

So, yeah, Unbalanced Factions
I have no idea why they needed to change everything VI did great about factions. I’m not particular a fan of necropolis, for example. However, necropolis is a prime example of being treated like rubbish in this latest installment of the franchise. The entire base statues of undead creatures are not standing out comparing to the others, it now has only ONE range unit, which is lich, the 4th grade creature(elite), which suffers the penalty of range attack if not upgraded, what’s worse, the damage isn’t specially notably high either, while devs still limits the range of rising dead to be: no more than core creatures, which are 1st grade- skeleton and 2nd grade- ghost, the number of raising has limitation for each battle as well. Meanwhile, the initials of the undead are low except the vampire lord, probably only good creature left in the race while the others’ speed aren’t fast enough, if they all have to act after the others aren’t bad enough, undead has no moral which means they never get a 2nd chance to act in the same turn. The faction somehow managed to become the weakest via unfair changes, and ultimately for no reason. Necropolis wasn’t OP in VI, Blackhole did great job despite it has 3 range units including one champion creature, in fact, by limiting the damage in half using range penalty, it balanced generally their low initial and speed in battle. Also made skeletons being a bit difficult to deal with when large numbered, since it was an archer. VII had to be creative to make it melee unit again... Large number? I don’t think so. Magic heroes have many ways to reduce its number before it even reaches them. Unless you want to sacrifice your only casting turn to use teleporting on skeletons...like every battle.
The funny thing is: being very mean to necropolis, the developers seems fond of making already super OPED academy, Sylvan( not OP but...) even more OP on creatures’ advantage. If by giving fire goblins and mages as ranged units(academy) and elf hunters and druids(Sylvan) were not enough, you can choose to build Titan( academy) or Truant( sylvan) which are both champion creatures(7th grade) for more range fire power? What a FoxK? A tree shoots blazing beans across the battle field?? Even Tolkien’s Lord of the Ring wouldn’t dare to write something like this. When titans are chilling out and destroying enemy by far, it’s hero is casting all kinds of damaging spells without worrying hitting its allies. Imagine, if you are playing a faction like Orcs, how are you suppose to beat your opponents like these? I really don’t know what developers were thinking, it seems they had fun themselves while leaving us in shock. 
2 elf races, no inferno? What a FoxK again? 
Yep, the game decided to have Sylvan and Dungeon to waltz in both, while casting inferno out whom had been built decently in VI. Putting aside they don’t need any extra work for it, they deleted the faction for just...any good reasons? No. Though elf and dark elf aren’t sharing the same play style and strategy, sure. But would they be more different than elves and demons? If only I could have decided, it should be a vote between elves and dark elves, not between inferno and dungeon. The world of Ashen isn’t like Ashen, when the biggest villain are scattered across the land.

Removed converted town function
For the sake of games, why? The biggest change in 6th was the converting towns from a different faction. Despite some players reported hating it very much, I speak for myself as a decades-year fan, thinking very differently otherwise.  It’s a milestone change for the game, ultimately one of the best for the franchise. The function made conquering hard-defenses enemies’ towns finally had some decent advantage, if before, only gave you +2000 gold per day and sabotaged enemy’s army size a little. Again, VII decided its “ too much advantage”, had to remove it as if AI didn’t know how to convert players towns at all when conquering one. What’s worse, the change made the campaigns sometimes being nightmares even in a fairly low difficulty. For the most part, campaign enemy has more towns control pre-set in general, since you are unable to convert any towns while securing them (finish in comments below)

Really wanted to like this game because I'm a long-time fan of the Heroes Of Might And Magic franchise; however, since they did the switch to ""Might And Magic Heroes"", the games have REALLY gone down hill. Heroes 5 was the only decent attempt by Ubisoft at creating a successor to Heroes 3. I recommend anyone to go on GOG and buy Heroes Of Might And Magic 3 Complete and download the Horn Of The Abyss expansion. DO NOT BUY HD edition on steam!! Heroes 3 is still to this day, hands down the best in the series and still has a thriving multiplayer via Horn Of The Abyss. I would even go as far as to recommend Heroes Of Might And Magic 5 Tribes Of The East because that one is still pretty good.

I gave Might And Magic Heroes 7 a fair shot; played several scenarios, tried some campaigns, did a few multiplayer matches and messed with the random map gen. The only thing this game has going for it is the fact that the graphics look nice and I thought it was interesting to give the player a choice between 2 tier 7 units in each castle. The following are things that are not so nice:

1. First and foremost, it's a Ubisoft game so you know the multiplayer experience is going to be lacking.
2. The castle screens seem like static pictures for the most part, somehow they have less life and detail than in Heroes 5 and even Heroes 3. I feel like this game took a step backwards compared to Heroes 5 in that regard, I personally liked the 3D castle and camera tour it would give you. Granted, the castles were static in Heroes 3; however, I thought the hand-drawn graphics added a nice charm.
3. The music is some generic garbage, does not compete with previous other Heroes games. 
4. The sounds aren't that great either, there's several instances where I can hear the same sound file used for multiple separate creatures. Kind of like in Heroes 2 with the minotaur / mage and elf / halfling having the same exact sound for taking damage. 
5. Increasing animation speed in combat desyncs all of the sound effects. Things will still sound the same as if animation speed is normal (100%) even when you increase it to 300%. Makes it look really odd and not very satisfying. This is another step backward because in Heroes 3, they managed to speed up the sounds to match animation speed and vice versa.
6. The spells are very watered down compared to previous games. Considering this game is Might And MAGIC Heroes, I would think there would be more variety and cool animations with the pretty graphics. Implosion is a prime example; that spell looks epic in Heroes 5, but in this one it's pretty underwhelming.
7. There is no inferno castle!! But hey, at least they kept everyone's favorite: Fortress! *not*
8. Encountered more bugs in this installment than any other. Some of them crashed the game, but mostly it was just weird animation / graphical bugs.
9. They still went with the square grid in battles instead of the hex grid. Not as fun, nor is it as challenging.
10. Auto-combat doesn't give you the option to play through the battle manually if you don't like the results. Huge oversight maybe? But it's pretty ridiculous that this feature is missing...
11. I didn't like the skill wheel style they went with for your Hero in this one. Where's my expert earth magic, expert water magic, expert air magic, wisdom and diplomacy? Also is Dimension Door even in this game?? 

There's probably more things I missed but it's been a while since I've last played. To sum up this review, Heroes Of Might And Magic 7... oh wait, sorry I meant Might And Magic Heroes 7, is not a good successor in the Heroes franchise. It definitely seems like there's less room for skill expression due to the watered down nature of this game and it somehow has less features than Heroes 3 which is 20 years old. But hey, at least this was a better attempt than Heroes 6... but we don't talk about that one, along with Heroes 4.

This game could be so much more, but after so many months it is still full of bugs, and it seems like instead of patching bugs they bring out DLC... yeah great. (doesn't this mostly lead to a game which will never be completly working? *cough* ""insert another Ubisoft title here"" *cough*)

Don't get me wrong, the base game is really great and almost reaches Heroes5 in Gameplay (so I'm not sure wether the problem lies with the Devs instead of other parts of the Company?)

to make it short:

 -the really shit AI destroys Singleplayer
 -the really shitty network code destroys Multiplayer

 -thousands of minor bugs which could be well avoided with some more beta testing (you have to rely on fan patches to eliminate some, which does really bring shame to the original Devs)

VERDICT: I love this game.

Honestly, I don’t believe the amount of hate that this game receives is justified. I have been playing the HoMM series consistently throughout my life, ever since I was introduced to HoMM3 as a small child. I have played 3, 5, 6, and 7. I am not a hardcore fan of the series like others here may be, but I have dabbled in each of the games and have enjoyed each one for what they have brought to the overall series.

With that in mind, and upon reading the plethora of negative reviews for HoMM7, I was downloading this game expecting the game to be a terrible mess that wouldn’t work at all. I was in for a pleasant surprise because that was not the case!! This game has been running smoothly for me the entire time and I have been having a lot of fun. I've been enjoying playing the randomly generated maps and strategising with each faction.

As others have said, this game feels like a mix of 3 and 5. I totally agree. The factions expand upon a lot of the lore present in HoMM5 (the Ubisoft lore), but the 2D town art-style and feel of the maps feels more HoMM3 to me (even though I did also love the 3D towns in HoMM5). The user interfaces is more accessible to newcomers than my experience with other iterations in the series. This overall makes HoMM7 less intimidating for new players to come to terms with how the game works, as there is a lot to initially digest.

PROS:
- Random generated maps (the true joy of HoMM)
- Factions seem nicely balanced and unique
- Flanking is a fun addition
- Love the new governor system for heroes
- The choice between champion creatures is fun and shakes things up
- Graphics are beautiful 
- Maps are fun to explore and give me that classical HoMM feel with a new touch
- Expands upon the lore of HOMM5. I love the history and story of Ashan
- If you want to use cheats, then the interface is very accessible

CONS:
- Game was dropped by Ubisoft a few years back so feels incomplete (e.g. no Inferno faction)
- Random generated map doesn’t have much water and random generated maps could use more options
- Landscape textures feel a bit repetitive on randomly generated maps
- Would have been cool to have had the Sanctuary faction in HOMM7

REBUTTAL TO MAIN CRITICISM:
- I have not experienced any bugs with the game yet. The only one I have encountered is if I move to the next turn while the fog of war is turned off in the unlockable cheat’s panel. Other than that, the game runs fine for me. Upon research, a lot of the problems with the bugs was from around release and has since then been addressed.
- Even though I don't particularly like Ubisoft, I have not had any problems with their client to open and run the game.
- Yes, the AI is not as challenging as the other games, but there are community mods out there if that is what you want. Easily solved. Because I am not an expert at HoMM, I don’t really mind the AI being like this and it makes the overall game less intimidating for me. I like casual playthroughs and it can provide that for me.
- If this game had been given more time to introduce more DLC, we would have likely had an Inferno faction. However, this aside, I have really been enjoying this iteration of the HoMM series and have always been a lover of Academy and Sylvan. So, I am right at home with this game.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

CONCLUSION:
It is not as bad as people say it is, don't let all the bad reviews detract you from getting this game.

Overall, If you are new to the series I recommend getting this game during a steam sale - it goes for very cheap and is well worth the price. I have been having as much fun with this version as I have previous versions. 

Also, it is important to note that the game has a decades long history and most of the HoMM fandom still hasn’t moved on from HoMM3 or won't look at any other games in the series beyond HOMM3 to the point they will unfairly criticise on other games in the series. Don’t get me wrong, I love HoMM3 – but it doesn’t mean that the later games in the series are bad. There are a number of us out there who also love HOMM games which aren't 3.",1640346949,1640347102,True,9,2,0.497433573007583618,0,True,False,False

After playing a couple of levels for the first campaign (Thomas), I put it on the shelf for some time, and it took so long before I returned, that I restarted the campaign again from scratch. I also started the Necromancer campaign after that, but I quit not long after. Now, after several years, where I really wanted to play Heroes 7 for reals, it took all the way to 2021 before I finally started playing the game from where I left off, till the end of the game.

Might & Magic® Heroes® VII is a pretty great game, when you first look at it. Good story, being told through dialogue and voice overs, cool heroes and abilities, stunning maps, castles and army-troops/creatures.

The difficulty of the game is very different, compared to what map you play on. Some maps are mostly regular, where you start off in a castle, and you're supposed to defeat your enemies, some you get invaded in, and some levels got a time limit. On top off that, the neutral mobs can get pretty high, but normally you solve that by making good heroes, and building sizable armies. You can't actually change the difficulty of your enemies, but you can adjust your starting resources, computer started resources, neutral army size and how fast it grows.

There are a few problems with this game, that can have been the reason I had such a hard time playing it. Sometimes I feel the sound of everything is pretty loud. It was like this in heroes 6 too, but really having your horse scream extremely loudly after every battle, is really tiresome after playing the game for hours. I had most problems with the Necromancy team as they also had the Namtaru, which would not only scream once, but twice for every single combat round. When you won with these in your army, it would scream loudly together with the hero's horse, after EVERY   SINGLE   COMBAT. 

Game wise, this is probably the most tiresome, but there is an even bigger problem, that kinda ruins such a great game as this. The computer AI!

To make a long story short I am just gonna try to explain what makes the AI so bad. Lemme just explain one thing, I like a challenge, and I want it to be so things aren't that easy when I play a game for so many hours as this. When the AI keeps doing stupid things every single time you fight them, my motivation for playing the game goes down a bit

So here are some examples of what makes the AI stupid:
-The computer army hardly builds, they don't level their heroes, and in the end they have one good heroes, with sizable armies, that hardly uses any of his/her abilities, except for the war cries. 

Only a few heroes I met through the game ever used their damaging spells, and ofc they lose. They also keep sending level 1 heroes close up to my castle, with only a few troops to show for, and in the end I just feel I beat every non-time limited map pretty easy.

The enemy heroes aren't the only ones with stupid AI. Every time you meet a Neutral army, it feels very often that you will win, even if it says deadly. Now if we look at it at a smaller scale, where you actually don't have that good spells or big army, but can still win, because the computer is an idiot:

-If you put your troops behind a stone, the AI will get stuck behind it, spending maybe 5-6 extra rounds to get to you.
-If you put flame wall on any AI mob, or several AI mobs, they will keep walking inside it, hurting themselves even more, instead of just getting out and heading for you. I won a lot of combats like this, where I had a much smaller army than my enemy (neutral/heroes). 
-For some reason most neutral mobs will skip their turn. Not defend, but actually skip their turn, almost every combat, and it makes no sense. I have seen a few neutral armies being able to skip their turn, then being able to move one time at the end of a round, and then at the start of the round, damaging my army, but in most cases it never works. They even skip turn when they are inside the fire wall.

Finally I am gonna talk about the auto combat. You know, when you don't wanna fight every single neutral army there is, because there are also on most maps, insane amounts of them. Most of the time you're gonna be fighting a lot of neutral armies... Anyway. If I use an example, where you are a strong mage, you enter the combat, you either use chain lightning, killing most of the mobs you are facing, or with bigger mobs and armies, summon elementals, or use strong spells for one big creature/mob like implosion, and kill them off quick. I have seen that every time you use auto combat, any melee troop in your army, will try to move towards your enemy, meaning unecessary deaths. If you do this too much, you will eventually lose your entire army, so I like to use auto combat when I can almost for certain win, to save time.

For the campaign modes I don't wanna spoil too much, but basically you get to choose stories for every factions in the game, and you go through it with one or more protagonists, and a story unfolds for every campaign. In the end finishing each campaign will make you able to unlock a special quest in the final campaign with Ivan. If you don't get that special quest, and you don't see most of your advisers in the map, simply load your final moments of each campaign, and it should work properly. 

There are also two extra campaigns called The Lost Tales (1 and 2) in Xaeroth. These look a bit more like the campaigns you are used to from for example Heroes 3, where the story is told using text, that you read. I really liked these.

It took me so many years to complete this game, and there might be a few things with this game, that makes playing it a bit frustrating, either because a level is bugged, or that the computer simply is too easy to beat. Too many neutral armies, and sound can make you get a bit warm in your head after some time, but ALL IN ALL, I want to recommend this game in the end. It looks good, is fun to play, and even though it has it's faults, the story and campaigns are pretty exciting to play. So yeah, buy and play this game, but wait for a Steam sale.

P.S. For now I am only missing the stand alone game for Heroes 7 called ""Trial by Fire"", but for now I think I want to wait for it to come on sale, as the game is almost as expencive as the whole Heroes 7 main game itself.

EDIT: If you buy Trial by Fire, make sure you start the game from the main game, and not the Trial by Fire client. If you don't start it from the main game your achievements will not be unlocked!",1630614544,1637623484,True,35,0,0.73821556568145752,1,True,False,False

At first glance, it looks good. Better graphics, zoom functions, varied storylines and mission types, scripted campaign maps... in theory, it should be a significant improvement over its predecessors and provide an improved experience to be proud of. I myself love a well-designed map and scripted campaign events. 
Unfortunately, the actual result is a tangled, stressful, grope-around-clueless chore. It has its moments but most of the time, it's really not fun. Practically all of the maps are absolutely unforgiving; a single mistake, lose a single battle and it's game over. On top of that, most every map puts the player at severe disadvantage and requires a lot of micromanagement and patience to progress... again all while walking the 'must-never-make-a-mistake' tightrope.
Maybe it was supposed to make the game challenging? But what's the point of making it challenging if in the end it's not fun? On top of that, it really feels unrewarding. Time and again I painstakingly raised a hero or two only to have them directly become enemies in the next map and waste all my efforts. 
But that's not even the worst part. The worst part is the puzzles. I remember spending several in-game months trying to solve one particularly annoying one where two different heroes on the same map had to step on specific platforms in the exactly correct order, or get reset. Considering it could take a couple days to get from platform to platform, plus there being roughly 16 platforms in all, and goodness-knows how many possible sequences, and vague clues that I hadn't even noticed until much later... frankly speaking, I don't want to waste so much of my time untangling a puzzle when I thought I bought a 4x strategy game. Were they trying to improve the RPG aspects of it? They should have expended the skills and levels rather than crack their brains making puzzles so we would crack ours. 
Speaking of skills and levels, the same annoying level caps are still there, and at the end of the day, it all comes down to who has the bigger army that wins.
As for the storyline, most of them pretty much force you to do everything as they say, even if you think the current map's objectives are downright ridiculous. There's almost no actual choices in any of them, I've gone through most of them by now and there was only one storyline with any choices to make at all. I had been forced to play the supercidal maniac, accomplish objectives that directly brought my heroes to their demise or tragic outcomes, and repeatedly have to put up with an overgrown man-child supposedly destined to be emperor of a new empire repeatedly whine and whine between missions about what everybody keeps telling him he has to do.
For sanity's sake, Ivan, stop whining about wanting to go home and  just go home already! Let everyone else run the war - literally any of them would be a better ruler than you, including the crow! All the preaching and coaxing might have made more sense if the central character was a child or even a teenager, but no, he's a middle-aged muscle-man with groomed facial hair and his wussing out all the time really feels SO wrong. 

In conclusion, as much as I want to support it as a longtime fan of the series, there's just too much wrong in this one to give it approval. I still want to finish it, since I'd already come this far, but I've lost count of the times I wanted to yell at my screen since I started on it. I bought my copy at a huge discount but even so I feel like it wasn't worth buying. Even more, it wasn't worth all the stress, time and effort.

Myself and a friend bought this game last night and started playing today and so far we've had one game which played through with no issues! 

Issues range from:-

- Won't stay connected in lobby
- Can't load into a random generated map at all, boots host to desktop every time.
- Whilst halfway through a game the save becomes bugged AF and you can't play anymore because it crashes on AI turn. No matter how far you load back on auto save you get to same turn and Bam! does the same thing -.-
- Even when on desktop because of the many crashes or just because you think turning it off and back on again will help it seems to constantly run in the back ground even though task manager is none the wiser!? You have to literally shut down Ubisoft connect and steam to get the damn thing to reboot properly.  

All of this alongside the issues with booting the game in the first place because you bought it through steam but Ubisoft have to have you connected, dumbass system go back to the 90's (same with EA / Origin games... so F annoying!).

The thing that annoys me most is this is a decent developer and its 7th iteration of the franchise LOL! how could you F it up this much from vi??? its basically the same game with new/pre used races etc! Honestly where did it all go wrong? 

Awesome game if it worked loved every single heroes except the one we shall not name previously and this is just utterly soul destroying to try to play. 11hrs since buying and most of that has been faffing with stupid bugs and trying to get round them, honestly if your looking to play with friends don't buy it, it's fubar as fuck!",1636847613,1636848095,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Heroes 5 visual update, upgrade overhaul with the alternate unit upgrader and the initiative system was phenomenal, and as a sequel it did everything right. Heroes 6 was a downgrade in most aspects, adding very few to the game while also being damn near unplayable and extremely buggy. Not that hard to one up obviously, but HOMM 7 needed to do better than just outperform the mediocre, and it almost did that.

The flanking element is a very creative and good addition which could have added a new element of strategy to the series but since there was nothing to stop a unit on its turn from walking around the unit it was facing in order to get extra damage, you ended up with units backstabbing one another endlessly. The mutual exclusivity of the units makes strategies in general much more ""niche"", the factions themselves are great. The campaign is extensive, but underwhelming in it's writing and story progression.

I've got hundreds of hours on HOMM3, 4 and 5 and I'm loving it to the point of it being on par or even better than HOMM3. Yes, it crashes or bugs out from time to time (every 15h of playtime or so) but skill trees are much better, it fixes some imba skills from past games (like expert global magic spells that let you dominate entire battle or some messed up items), i've tried 5-6 custom maps that have always been done well, no landlocks, graphics and animations are nice...i honestly don't understand what more is needed, i'm super happy with it. Some new things as well, you can appoint governors to the cities, you can flank enemies, skills dependent on the faction...and I'm still learning after 50h of gameplay.

1 disclaimer though: I have not yet tried the multiplayer, so can't comment on that.

Also, to the HOMM community, i love you all but isn't it time we left HOMM3 behind? for the love of god :D not like it didn't have things to fix...necromancy (Isra), armorer (Mephala), and offence (Crag Hack) scaling with levels were all broken and imbalanced, and diplomacy too...you hit an expert ""prayer"" or ""haste"" and you are always first, max dmg, and each creature reaches each point on the battlefield....your lvl 40 mage with 400 mana that jumps through the map, teleports between castles...or on the contrary, you play 7h as a mage only to find Galthran with 5k skeletons with 50 attack and 50 defence and a nice Orb of Inhibition in his hands that stops all magic on the battlefield -.-

This game reminds me alot of homm 5. I never played homm 6 so dont know anything about it.

I do enjoy this game alot, however theres a few things that I find bad / just terrible..
The cutscenes are just a meh, no animations etc what so ever makes the game feel somewhat rushed.
But thats nothing that you really notice in game.

The things I've noticed when I've played is that when you play haven and you play ""defensivly"".
You will more likely run into a bugg with the ai.
The thing is that if you have the legionnaire standing near atleast 2 units and pressing defend.
The ai if close, wont know whom to attack so it will go back and forth between 1-3 units, this have happend to me like 5 times now and the only way to ""fix it"" is to reload sadly enough.
So as long as you dont have units defending near the legionnaire and you use a more aggresive playstyle with them, the ai melee units wont have any problems.
This is just terrible since most of the time what I've noticed is that the ai walks up / down and sometimes back to their side of the battlefield.
Sure you use less units but its just dumb..
I havent seen this bugg with any other faction / unit combination yet.

And on my same game with the combination I've mentioned I get another bugg.
I don't know what triggers it, but its not a gamebreaking bugg or so.
Its just that when you have burning determination and the 4x4 fire skill.
Once you have used ""bd"" on your units. It can show that you still have a hero attack to use.
As soon as you hover above the icon for spells / attack it greys out.
But, sometimes the next turn will say ""no hero"" so you cant use your hero for a turn at all.
This is just something I've noticed when I played with the haven and Inquisitor hero.
And it have happend max 4 times this far, its nothing that a problem but sometimes you really want to get a fireball on your enemy or a heal and you cant so its frustrating at most.


But enough with the negative stuff about the game.
I've enjoyed the maps i've played thus far and they are quite different from each other so it dosnt feel to much copy and pasted.
I really like the details to the map and that you can destroy bridges / rebuild them.
Same goes for the ""hero wheel"" when you level. You can build your hero as you want.
There are probably best builds and scout builds etc.
Its not hard to get into at all.
And you are allowed to use any hero as a scout without any units is supernice.

They added caravans in homm 4 i think but as i wrote earlier, i didnt play it.
So I know it was in homm 5 and it was good there and in homm 7 it feels even better.
You can even add units to it when its on the run if you want to.

The flanking system is also something I really enjoy.
Some units are really good with the flanking and that makes you think a bit more when you fight.
This for me feel like an upgraded homm 5 that tries to be homm 3.

I bought this on sale and for me it was worth it.
Would I buy it for the full price? Most likely.
Should you buy it? If you liked 5 as I did then yes.
For full price? Thats up to you.

TLDR.
Good game.
Minor buggs that can be patched.
Somewhat stupid ai depending on faction you play.
Fun maps and every unit feel really different and unique.
Strongest unit are two different ones you have to take one of that suits your playstyle the most. (If you have two of the same castle you can have both).

I would give this game a strong 8 / 10.

After a rocky launch, I feel comfortable now to recommend this title to fans of the HOMM franchise (since patch 1.2). Don't let the average positive review score scare you off, as it seems the majority of the issues are squashed.

I will hold my full review until I have spent more time with the game.

For now, I will say that is stable enough to trust and enjoy.  Heroes VII has gotten away from negative changes to the forumula from VI, brought back older and better mechanics, while still adding enough for a fresh experience. There are some truely smart changes.

The unanimated cutscenes, while at face value seem unpolished and cheap, allow for longer and less rushed dialogue between main characters that would otherwise be too expensive to justify when fully animated. I think it's an interesting and fair trade off, one that I wouldnt mind seeing other games adopt.

Overall, the graphics are not to a modern standard. Chances are, as a HOMM fan, you are OK with this. There are some improvements over HOMM VI, but this can be almost impossible to distinguish most of the time. However, at times, there are some truely nice looking environments that will surprise you.

While too early to tell, this game is on track to being my second favourite HOMM game to date.

TL;DR, The game is now playable and worth your attention, don't wait for a sale.",1444883494,1625234258,True,31,2,0.568696677684783936,0,True,False,False

Heroes 3 is probably my favorite game ever, and 5 felt like a worthy successor to the franchise. 6 was probably the biggest letdown ive experienced in gaming.

After playing around with it, its clear that the devs had a lot of passion behind the project and were about 6 months off of something truly special. I want the game that heroes 7 could have been with some more time to polish and balance. What is here could have been better than 5 and on the same level as 3. If you are new to the series, dont pick up this game, go for Heroes 3 or 5 (the base campaigns in 5 start really boring but it picks up a lot, especially in the expansions). If you have played other games in the Heroes series then I would say get 7 when its on sale, at least to see what its like, just make sure to download the unofficial patch.

Factions are a core part of what makes Heroes of might and magic fun, they feel more hot glued together than ever before, the units are unintressting at best, core gameplay is missing, core testing units and having fun is just gone, being such a massive fan I did not know that I could have so little fun with the title.

The art style which used to be traditional European fantasy has now evolved into a edgy high school teenager that thinks the word ""shadow"" is cool, animations, sound effects, ""unique"" abilities of the creatures are all bleh and does not motivate you to explore the game more, some units are so superior to others they just get redundant even as a 200+ stack, specially combined with broken skills etc, playing this against computer was broken (too easy).

Against another player the entire fight could probably be ended in 2 turns as they have possibility of wiping units with ranged units or just cheesing it with high level ones mixed with some abilities you can gain, I do not believe PvP is possible maybe just CO-OP at best.

I won't deny that HOMM5 was fairly bad. (what happened to 6?)

HOMM7 is pretty darn good!  What a Corona Crisis treat.

So it comes with HOMM3 HD edition for free, and i got this on sale.  HOMM3HD loaded right up and after finishing a 1v1 beating my zoomer friend, we were on the right path to a great self-isolation day.

HOMM3 remains in the background a lil thing i can alt-tab into and take some turns on the campaign, the memories of playing this as a kid remains, but its actually fun and looks good. Works and actually looks good.  Not like many other remasters.

We loaded up HOMM7, and it also more or less worked flawlessly.  I installed and got into ubisoft easy peazy and the game booted right up.  One of my close mates had a few issues and yelled a lot of Swedish obceneities at not being able to be the dwarves, i told him to STFU he got the game gifted from me and to join the lobby already.  And we got into a game.

And its working.  **BOLD** IT Feels a lot like the HOMM3 i am playing in the background, just with better graphics...effing simultaneous turns...and different racial names.

Great lil thing to get on sale to play with friends.  HOMM3 HD is nearly, if not, worth the sale price alone.

There are just so many bugs. The UI is bugged almost all the time. Some UI elements are modern, some are just text on a table. Very raw. 

AI is not great. I've won some battles I shouldn't have by getting the AI in a loop, doing nothing effective but moving back and forth.

Graphics? Also not great. It's just ok. It does not perform well on an RTX 2070 in some situations. The graphics, animations, cutscenes, voices, etc. from Heroes of Might and Magic 6 were all vastly superior. But since 6 is virtually unplayable due to even more serious bugs, it doesn't get any bonus points for being pretty. 

Heroes of Might and Magic 7 works. 

That's more than I can say for 6 or 5. 

4 is a different kind of feel entirely and has no HD remake I know of.

3 has an HD remake that doesn't support its expansions or good multiplayer.

If you want the best experience in this series, it's extremely sad to say you have to look back to Heroes of Might and Magic 3, and that you cannot rely on official HD releases, you must mod it yourself with unofficial HD mods. 

So Heroes of Might and Magic 7 is the best we will ever get. Ubisoft doesn't seem capable of taking this any farther than it has. 

The good? The storytelling and campaign are pretty good. There's some features in 7 that don't exist in 3 which are handy. It supports 2k resolution and actually works in Windows 10.

THE GOOD:   Combat, units, unit balance, economy just a lot of fun building an army.  A random map generator which is awesome, unlimited replayability. I really enjoy playing for hours.

THE BAD:  The AI.  Overland AI is atrocious.  Combat AI is ""okay"" at best.  The AI on the overland is so terrible, I don't know how it made it through development.  Who on the dev team thinks massing hero after hero and spreading your army thin among a dozen AI heroes is a good strategy?  I simply mass my units on one hero and stomp the AI out of existence.  Too easy.

THE TERRIBLE:  The writing.  Simply put, the main campaign story is awful.  The game's primary protagonist, Thomas, is the most annoying pathetic prepubescent arrogant dimwit I have ever seen in a game.  This imbecile supposedly commands an army...no one in their right mind would listen to this dolt.  I cant stand him.  I want his ""duchy"" to burn to the ground.  The story is so bad, I couldnt even play more than 1/10 of the campaign.  Instead, I play the Random Map Generator which is really good, except for the horrible AI.

VERDICT:  The main story is terrible, skip the campaign, and play in adventure mode, it really is fun.  You will have to understand that the AI sucks, but you can still find hours of fun regardless.  Sadly, there are no mods (that I have found) that improve the AI.  It is what it is.

So without those you simply cant finish the level as there is no andras and no jorgen

and i wrote a whole thing but clicking the button from yes to no seems to reset everything you type , short version : if ubisoft decides to sell the franchise and lets go of their own launcher i will consider heroes 8, otherwise no more ubisoft for me, i ran around hours looking for a way to open Arkath

and it wasnt there (while it should have been since i did finish them but the launcher wrote it back and i had no clue it did)

really stupid but took out all the fun and left me with sore eyes

  the good:  well the factions are all strong in their own way. you can pick anything and have a good time with your guys. both might and magic can be strong depending on how you build your guys.....   that's honestly about all i can say. i never play the story because i don't like being limited how i play and honestly don't care about stories. So that leave the duel mode and custom games.

 duel mode is.... OK, but seems more like a half assed verson of a even fight between you and the computer.  2 heroes to choose from and 4 creep builds (one being random)   If you can't let people choose their skills and creeps then don't bother. Ruins it for me.

custom mode:   This is what i like playing, LOTS AND LOTS of maps can generate well over 20k different maps on largest world. so you can pick one  you like, pick your starting area, opponents, teams, individual difficulties. All of this i think is well done........ but the game falls flat on it's face.    

  the bad:  CUSTOM HEROES!!!  IS not that hard to make a character creator. hero skins can be set ahead of time and you just pick one you want. but seriously allow us to pick our hero perk, and skills for each character.   and this is why:  mulitple characters have perks like (example) healing sisters heal in an aoe .   that's awesome.... except the character doesn't have the warfare skill, meaning you can't increase the heal you get.   so instead of a 200 heal that can revive and you can skill to control it yourself instead of the computer. you are stuck with a 20hp aoe heal.   absolute trash.  many heroes are built stupid like this.  instead of fixing the issue by just letting you create heroes it's left as is leaving with 1/2 the heroes that are decent.  next is the AI.  I watched closely after i revealed the whole max map with 7 computer players ALL on hardest difficulty. each one hired 6-8 heroes and littereally just ran around their area practically doing nothing. it's almost like they run as far as they can for half the week then run back to recruit creeps again at the start of the week. every day ALL 56 computer heroes would attack 0-3 things  while running by easily beatable guys guarding items, resources, and mines.  sure they rush getting the closest castle to them.... then they are worthless.  Hardest difficulty and the AI  is bad.

so in short.  the only reason to buy this game, is if they fixed the heroes and ai (which won't happen since it's 5 years later and they haven't touched it)   or they drop the price to $5 which is all it's really worth.    And since i have 191 hours over 5 years on this. i can say, the game wasn't worth buying, more of a let down",1611481654,1611481654,False,24,3,0.679418206214904785,0,True,False,False

Creature variety is fantastic, spells are varied and entertaining (Magic usually trumps Might), and animations feel crisp and interesting.

It looks lovely, the characters and units are great. I really enjoyed the fact that each of the units are kind of specialised in many ways, (though arguably a bit too much, I don't think it's quite as bad as in Homm6) and though I really enjoy the flow of combat and how you can adjust the speed of it to what feels right for you, I am sort of dissapointed with the hero attack animation, honestly, the magic animation is there, and it makes sense for magic classes to attack from range but I really hate seeing a might class nonchalantly swing his sword towards the enemy and that enemy unit get hit by etheral blades, like come on that could have been a spell right? (I guess I miss the HoMM5 hero attack animations x3)

In terms of the town design, I can see what they went for and all I can say is well, there was an attempt, it just feels 'flat' and I don't feel the connection of where it is in the town/ what it looks like to what it does, perhaps besides the obvious walls and town halls. I know that seems like a minor thing I'm being picky about but I don't feel the satisfaction of building my town up even once I do. Please do let me know if it's different for you. 
Personally, I like how you can choose which town specialises in the production of which units, I think it's a fantastic feature that allows for interesting games even if you are playing against the same town. 

Music wise ehhhhh bit of hit and miss I'd say some castle themes are ok others  feel kind of stale the themes of terraing are generally cool, oh and I may not have like a huge amount of hours but I AM SO SICK OF THE BATTLE THEME!! It is sooo tedious! Every single time just grrr! Oh and don't get me started on how long it takes to load into a battle, like whyyy? I just want to play game!

Now I'd like to say a little about story telling, I may not be a great story teller, but in things like movies and games a very powerful technique is to show the player/watcher rather than tell, let us figure stuff out our selves rather than force feeding us everything each character knows. I like stories especially these kind of stories, but this game has managed to completly lose my interest in the story by the third scenario on the Haven campaign, in short, I didn't like it. 
However! There is a redeeming factor to this and whether this was intentional or by accident, I feel that perhaps the best storytelling in this game is delivered by how you are allowed to level your heroes' abilities in custom games. Now hear me out, I haven't gone insane! You can see what each hero is able to achieve, some are able to get a higer level in particular skills, with each being able to achieve 3 of what I would call the 'ultimate level' of that particular skill or discipline, each hero having access to a different combination of these you can start to speculate what roles they filled throught their lives in this universe. Again, I personally like that, but I understand that not everyone likes overthinking things like this. 

In conclusion I personally had a relatively poor expeariance with this part of the HoMM franchise -I'm still mad at you ubisoft >:( - though it can indeed prove to be a good way spend a couple of good hours. If you haven't played many Homm games before, and would like to start with this one, yeah go for it!

Also, it's the year of 2020, no more news about MMH8, Ubisoft has officially given up on this franchise. The franchise is dead. In the future we might see more MMH games on mobile platform; but actual MMH on PC? No more.

I want to blame Ubisoft for killing this franchise. However, think about it, as nowadays gaming industry, the most commercially successful games are the games with fast-paced gameplay and strong competition elements. For turn-based strategy games, they generally require a lot more time to learn about the games and generally are slower paced; reasons like these make the market of the genre small. And within the genre, there are games like Civilizations or Total War occupied most of the field; competitions are tough, there simply are little space for others to survive. MMH just happened to be one of the game franchise that got killed.

To me, VI was a huge disappointment mainly becasue I play the game for the story. I believe I am not alone when I say that I do not have the time what it takes to finish a scenario on super hard mode and often go for easier settings. Heroes VI was so badly balanced that adventuros players like me had no chance finishing a campaign without denying their nature and focusing only on the objective. Enough said, I still have 100+ hours played.
 
Now back to Heroes VII, I have been really looking forward to this game, however the bad reviews and the price tag put me off. As a real fan I could not be satisfied with this and decided to wait for the christmas period - honestly, I knew that because of all the bad reviews the game would not cost more than £20 - and I was right.

So here I was, after a long time of waiting I finally got to try out the game. I was expecting clunky gameplay with tons of bugs, however what I saw was a whole lot better than what I expected.
Unlike other people reviewing this game, I started on patch 1.6 that may make a huge difference (perhaps).
So here is what I found so far after finishing the first heaven campaign and being at 4/5 in the necromancer campaign:


Negative (ish)/Could be better:
- Cutscene animation - frozen characters. Annoying, but can live with it. Doesn't change my impression of the story at all.
- Clunky movement - yes, it is true that often you stop your hero with using too many or too few clicks. Can live with it.
- Clunky targeting - Often by reselecting a target if you do not click on the rigth side of it then your character may chose a longer route to it and you end up losing movement points. To me this was the most annoying, but can get used to it.
- Not being able to replay cutscenes - This may be a user error but I missed the finishing cutscene of the heaven campaign and found no way of replaying it. Thankfully youtube had all the videos I needed. Just to clarify I did try to re-finish the campaign from a save but the council hall cutscene did not replay.
- No inferno faction - Perhaps we will have this later, cleary the creatures are there and you definitely got to see at least one inferno hero, perhaps just need to be unlocked?
- Lack of animation - Becasue I like to see my awesome creatures when I hire them there and then without any extra clicks. Not a tragedy, just would be nice. 

Positive
- Good story - yes, I read the reviews of the story not being good enough but so far I am quite amased and all I can say that perhaps people haven't quite managed to grasp idea of the story so far. Truth is that HOMM V had an awesome story and it is very hard to match this. All in all, this is different but so far I am quite happy with it.
- Balanced difficulty levels - Will not take days and weeks to finish a campaign. I love this. Easy should be easy. If you want harder play on hard...


All in all, I am glad that I did not let the bad reviews stop me from buying this game. so far I have not seen any bugs and while I agree that it should not be in the £40+ price tag it is an enjoyable game and would recommend to all true fans of the Heroes series. I am really looking forward to explore all the different factions and abilities, perhaps I will write a more in depth review once I have done this. Until then, HAVE FUN!

I haven't played heroes vi to compare the two, but I will draw references from other Heroes games.
The story of the game is kind of weird. It features 6 characters sitting on a strategic table telling tales. What annoys me is unlike heroes V the tales are completely unrelated. Its wierdness is further boosted by using drawn stills and some weird animations.
The gameplay honestly hasn't changed that much since 5. Monsters get their turn and move and/or attack. Like Heroes 3 the hero can take a turn any time during a friendly monster's turn. The new mechanic they introduce comes in the form of flanking, which in the small battle maps heroes has, gets quickly annoying (especially against AI. It's like playing tag like a 10-year-old).
As for the towns, they work pretty much the same, only with a few side-buildings. I believe that this is a good move, taken right off Heroes IV. Only issue, maybe they should have taken a little more inspiration for heroes IV and possibly have more side-buildings, like allow 2 creatures per tier again, that will support a different playstyle allowing for more variety. Only real choice you currently have is about which top-tier creature you get and some extra growth, which isn't a choice I like to make.
The game also has some kind of a territory system, but it's not used that well. It should have been specific per town and you should have ways of manually expanding it.
The graphics are quite nice and pretty realistic. However, I think that this is to the game's detriment, since a game like Heroes would work better if it had a sketchbook or storybook look.
Last thing is that the game uses the U-play launcher, which means I can't play the game when offline. Seriously, wtf? I play single-player anyways, so why do I need to be online to play the game?

TL;DR: A game that was somewhat fun, but quickly got old. I had fun for roughly 20 hours, but by then I think I saw all that the game had to offer. I cannot recommend the game, unless you find it for a pretty cheap price and want to have Heroes 3 in your library since if they haven't changed it is given as an extra.

The stories are good, the units look amazing and there are quite a few new ones. More spells and dynamics are added so that it just feels like you can do more. So glad the hero has a basic attack now. I also like the warcries they introduced. It really gives a Might hero a lot more to do during combat. 
Some of the scenery is so creative and visually stunning and I really love the depth perception it gives. I had quite a bit of fun playing through it!

Might & Magic Heroes VII evoked a bit of mixed feelings in me. The pros certainly include an engaging storyline and the fact that even on the easiest difficulty, the game is not a walk through the rose garden. Cons include some stupid artificial intelligence behavior during turn-based combat and large differences between units in armies. Some are almost useless, while others are far too strong. Another disadvantage is the need to install an additional service to run a game called UPlay, which causes many startup or compatibility issues. However, I recommend the game, because it is gratifying that after the botched VI. series, the developers were able to take over and create a quality game that is not permeated by paid downloadable content.

VII. séria Hrdinov moci a mágie vo mne vyvolala trocha zmiešané pocity. Medzi klady určite patrí pútavý dej a fakt, že ani na najľahšej obťažnosti nie je hra prechádzkou ružovou záhradou. Medzi zápory patrí trocha hlúpe správanie umelej inteligencie počas ťahového boja a veľké rozdiely medzi jednotkami v armádach. Niektoré sú takmer zbytočné, zatiaľ čo iné sú až príliš silné. Ďalším mínusom je potreba inštalovania dodatočnej služby na spustenie hry s názvom UPlay, ktorá mnohým spôsobuje problémy so spustením alebo kompatibilitou. Hru však odporúčam, pretože je potešujúce, že po spackanej VI. sérii, sa dokázali vývojári prebrať a vytvorili kvalitnú hru, ktorá nie je presiaknutá spoplatneným sťahovateľným obsahom.",1586725986,1598901831,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

First of all - maybe my actions speak louder than words;
1. I repeatedly opened settings to try to adjust the resolution and other display settings ... but it's all at max. It just looks ... really crappy - everything is grainy, animations are poor and somewhat disconnected - and .... I dunno - I can't shake the feeling that someone just contracted a cheap company to create a clone of the existing games.
2. I kept checking (and this has never happened before) if I had installed and was playing the right MM: Heroes game. It looks and plays worse than I ever remember any of the older games doing. I mainly skipped 6, but I swear 5 ... even 4 - looked better than this. If I checked I'd likely be wrong though.

I'm trying to keep playing though - it's SOMEwhat growing on me - and I figured ... maybe it'll be another guilty pleasure. There's a lot of awful elements though - a few examples;

1. Your hero learns a skill; it literally says - on-screen; ""Tomas has learned a new sk..."" ... we're talking something that happens 20-30 times even in the early missions - and ... half the text in the game doesn't fit in notifications or buttons.
2. All the pop-up notifications look like they're straight out of the 90s ... no animation anywhere - just a quick display inside fake-looking scrolls, often in the most horrible colours I've seen; neon red and green blending into the back colour.
3. While it hasn't crashed on me yet - I'm still finding bugs that can easily be simulated (and should have been solved a long long time ago). For example - if you recruit in an outpost (buy units from a distant city - to be transported there), the city in question will disappear from your dashboard. You still have a button that says ""Show Cities"" / ""Hide Cities"" ... but noting happens - until you advance the turn. 
4. When there is dialogue in-mission ... there's no animation at all; the involved characters simply have a glow around them while talking ... in completely static avatars.
5. Battle-mechanics aren't bad -  but they don't seem to have been improved at all; looks just like 5 ... even 4. If you've played Conquistador ... or King's Bounty (in any of its incarnations) ... or even Renowned Explorers - you'll see a lot more mechanics than are used here ... there seems to be very little progress.",1598678302,1598678302,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Keeping in mind that i did only play a few hours and may very well have missed something obvious....My feelings are as follows:

Look:
I am not keen on the look of the overall game or maps. For the last in the series if feels very ugly and lacklustre for me. compared to previous versions, HOMM 5 specifically as it was the last i played, there is very little terrain detail compared to previous versions and im playing on a high end gaming pc. Im missing little details like being able to see artifacts on the map rather than just a chest. It feels like there are other things missing that i cant quite pin point at the moment but overall i really didnt enjoy how little effort, it feels, was put into the small things and got bored of looking at the maps within minutes of starting a map or campaign.

Gameplay:
So there were a few things i noticed and again, perhaps ive missed something but some things just dont make sense.... One quest on the campaign, prob the second or third in, i spent an hour just skipping days to build up my castle and recruit an army so that i can attack the guy i stranded on the otherside of a bridge. I shouldn't have to spend an hour skipping days just to proceed. the entire quest was so poorly thought out. Having tried random maps, i found that the enemy players were spawning with hundreds of people in their armies while i started from scratch and they also had a ton of heroes running around and exploring but i cant seem to find out how to recruit any additional heroes. Just made no sense and felt totally unbalanced. I was on the default medium difficulty so i expect some challenge but not to be completely wiped out by a fully formed army within minutes of starting a map with no army or resources. Having played HOMM games for most of my life at this point, I cant recommend a game that i would need to reduce difficulty to easy or resort to using cheats just to have a chance because of how little thought went into this.

Sorry but this one is a bummer and waste of money. If your expecting, as its the last released, for an elevated and polished version of previous HOMM titles then you will be sorely disappointed. I cant recommend this.",1598555619,1598555619,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is my first M&M game since Heroes 3 and while there have been changes I feel like it stays true to the core of what the games have been, while bringing some new things of it's own. I've read several reviews that complain about the games stability,  however through 15 hours I've had zero troubles on that regard. All in all it's a solid turn based strat-RPG.

- the design in campaigns is all over the place. Some campaigns are quite alright (The Orc Campaign), most are meh (Haven) and some are downright bad (the unbalanced Sylvan campaign and what the hell is the edgelord Dungeon campaign about???)
- Some campaign maps are too easy, some too difficult...
- lot of the time, you don't get to play with the same heroes throughout the campaign. So you build your hero, only not to see them again in later parts of the campaign.

I just reinstalled a clean copy of Windows and with the intention of really determining whether or not it was ""on my end"". After installing all the drivers and letting Windows fully update, the first thing I install is Steam. Then  I load Heroes VII then Uplay.  Press play... still nothing.

I first bought the V as that was the most recommended one on both Steam and Online but found it hard to deal with the outdated graphics after being spoiled by all these new games coming out.

The reviews were somewhat negative for this game but personally I was just happy to find a new and updated HMM game and enjoyed that nothing has really changed. Although... nothing has really changed so I'm sure if you've played every single game before this one, you might find that disappointing.

The campaign is nothing special and the story is not very engaging but it was sufficient enough to keep it from being boring. Thankfully it is quite long since there are 7-ish faction campaigns to go through.

Quite worth it for the 10$ price I paid.

I am however hesitating to not recommend the game because it is constantly crashing for no good reason despite re-installing the game multiple times.

I bought this at discount, i'd give it a try even with the mixed reviews.
The game is good, i mean, if you're new into this franchise and feeling disgusted with old graphics, go grab this.
Speaking of good graphics, look Heroes of Might and Magic VI, it also has good graphics for today standard.
But MMH VII has smoother animation.
Speaking of why it is not Heroes of Might and Magic (HOMM) IDK,
this one is Might and Magic Heroes VII. It surprised me when i expected to see the game next to HOMM III at my library, and it isn't. I've played the Heroes of Might and Magic from 1 to 7, never skipped a single title. If you asked me which one is the best, i'd pick II with the expansion. Nothing fancy to today standard but i felt attached to the gorgeous music it was. HOMM VI also has great music BTW. But i'm not gonna suggest that one instead this. Again, if you're new, pick this one. So far i've never encountered game breaking bug, i think they all fixed ?

--A dumbed down what the game is about---
HOMMs and MMH are about fantasy themed turn based strategy game. The character based off Might and Magic RPG series, tho i could argue this is the real deal not those. You have hero comandeering an army, get a castle, upgrade it to recruit stronger creatures and start to expand. Your hero can level up, gain skills, also equipments during the playthrough.
Capture more castles, mines, or lands in general then conquer your opponents.

--Cons--
About the cons,
my biggest disappointment with the game is how the game seems to have a memory leak. I might be wrong but after playing a few hours, it will move slower and slower. It did force quit to windows if you played long enough. Maybe 5 hours ?
I have 16GB RAM. Loading the game from a save game will refresh the speed, but still could force quit you to windows.

Graphic is nice i said, but the game need a strong graphic card to let you enjoy it to the fullest. I used GTX 1050 2GB, and it can't get 60 fps even at lower setting. Maybe around 49 fps. Lowering down the graphic setting didn't seem to affect performance that much tbh. It is very weird. I turned off most of post processing if not all of them, i left texture at medium playing at 1080p. If you play this game then getting 60 fps, feel free to drop your comment down below, you're using what kind of graphic card, which settings, so people will be able to tell.

Maybe, those adressed to the very engine of the game, Unreal engine 3 i think? The same one used for XCOM 2. It is wonky, the old XCOM 2 had multiple in game glitches and bugs, also tons of performance issues. Like how about loading a battle for 30 minutes? Then crashed. Or 5 minutes to dismiss a single random people at recuritment pool, and i had like 50. If i didn't dismiss them, the overall game performance plummet. XCOM 2 however had a huge performace boost with the chosen DLC. Tho it was true that my first playtrough with XCOM 2 using a bleak potato PC, Nvidia 430GT ? Compared when i played war of the chosen with GTX 1050, and SSD. It improved the loading time to 5-11s. No more recruitment pool... No more pesky bugs. The cursed old XCOM2 showed me even a console game could blue screen (i also tried it on PS). So i wonder if somehow Ubisoft do a HUGE performance update with a new DLC just like XCOM2.

Oh, also, the game need Uplay installed. It will automatically login to it even if your account blocked...
I had account blocked for unknown reason, maybe a hacker tried to spam my password or something. This game miraculously able to login to the said account. I've contacted Ubisoft CS and got my account back. So it isn't a problem anymore. I know some people hate these kind of extra login, or even hate Ubisoft. Shrugs.

Music isn't as shiny as HOMM II or VI. But okay-ish.
I used Altec Lansing ATP-3 back then for HOMM II and Yamaha HS-5 for this game, along with Komplete Audio 6.

So, perhaps you asked why i didn't say anything serious about this and older titles, well,
Most people pick HOMM V as the best title, for many interesting and really useful innovations. Also true 3D experience.
Secondly, HOMM III, perhaps the first of the franchise ever had a photo realistic-ish graphic.
I'm a bit weird because i feel more attached to the more cartoony HOMM II and its gorgeous soundtrack.

--Pros?--
My biggest YES point for MMH VII is the unit smooth 3D animation. VI didn't as smooth as this one. V you don't say, also the 3D model is super outdated by today standard. Next, is i feel that there are many quality of life improvement from previous titles. Again, skip V because it had various innovations. To put it on number 6.5/10 perhaps. Could be 8.2/10 if they fixed the cons i've said above. 9.3 if they give it a better music, 10 if they add more content to it. +0.2 idk where if they fix the castle screen. Is 10.2 /10 even possible ? Idk. Castle screen is more utilitarian than artistic compared to previous titles, IMHO isn't a big deal if you don't know how it feels to play them back before.

For me the easier to navigate castle screen offset more than the art (which still is not that much lacking TBH), because... well do you stare your castle that much during a fight? Well i did, back when played the older titles because they stand out from any other games scenery. But nowadays games are much better.

I can go further describing differences between this and older titles, but seriously i'm tired writing. It is something you can read from the other reviews also. I will not cover stories, i never read 95% of my game stories. I can enjoy playing games with languages i can't even read as side effect. As long the maker isn't drunk screwed the logic.

Strategy is frequently removed in favor of scripted storytelling - which often doesn't work quite right. I mostly done the Haven campaign as it is the recommended starting campaign, but also tried the metamagic one. Quest completion criteria is often gimmicky - you can complete a quest, and visit the quest giver and be turned away if you visit on the same turn the quest was completed because the requirements are only checked when you end your turn - except in the cases were it works differently. You can literally be turned away, only to receive a new quest to return to exactly where you were to complete the quest at the start of the next turn. This is clunky.
Worse, actual strategy seems removed in many maps. At the end of the haven map ""Blessings of Freedom"" you are given 500 titans - and any army you had before is irrelevant. Why even give the player towns to develop or fight if the battle is utterly impossible without the 500 titans and fairly easy with them?
In the same map ""Blessings of Freedom"" you are also given a quest to have Konrad hold a bridge as long as possible. You cant' move this hero but you control the tactical combat. However, if you manage to actually win the 7th fight which is supposedly impossible the entire level glitches and the campaign cannot proceed. To be fair it is very tricky to win the 7th fight but by splitting the 100 swordsmen to have some fodder stacks of 1 to take retaliations it is actually possible. The reward for figuring out how to actually win this fight tactically - which the wording of the quest implies you should do - is the level glitches out in the worst possible way because the next quest is simply never triggered and the player may not realize the problem. This is terrible game design, clunky writing, and glitchy coding. The campaign story isn't that bad, but it is very distracting to have to constantly worry about deciphering quest conditions.
For the terrible level/map design in the campaign I cannot recommend this game.

Singleplayer scenarios: Have not tried yet.

Multiplayer: Why would I multiplayer this when I can multiplayer Heroes 3?

Also, something is wrong with the sound/music settings. I turn off the sound but at the start of the next level - maybe triggered by the victory cutscene? - it turns itself on again and only fixes itself by restarting the game. Music has annoying repetitive elements or maybe that is sounds playing broken on repeat? Something is wrong with it.",1594192652,1594192856,False,1,0,0.513513505458831787,0,True,False,False

If not for a couple reasons being, lack of inferno, and the obvious glitch to multiply your army to any number you want, this can also cause crashes so be careful. played multiplayer and campaign and beat most of it in the span of 5 hours. no thought required, just creating a couple million of tier 7 and have them on all 7 slots of your hero, next, spam quick battle. 
How to multiply- first you need the +2 slots for your hero (out numbering skill)
Step 2-
Step 3- put 1 creature in a stronghold of some kind, must be in a different slot than what that type of creature is in, castle perfered but works with forts.
Step 4- Put your hero in the top slot, combining all creatures together.
Step 5- It'll look like you have the same number, but don't worry! after you move the hero back to the movement slot, repeat step 3.
Step 6- you'll notice the 2 creatures you had in the original +2 slots are multiplying by 2 each time (10 becomes 20, 20 becomes 40, 40 becomes 80, etc.)
Step 7- When you have over 1 mil/1 bil/1 tril. your game may be fond of crashes/lags/trouble loading big numbers. As long as you have around 1 mil of shooters or tier 7's, you'll win every time!
Warning- Large numbers are fond of crashing or going negative! watch out for negatives! Otherwise you'll have to multiply that and wait to get it back to normal..

The art of the game is beautiful, except for a few town arts. Especially Haven which feels ugly and lackluster compared to the Dungeon or Stronghold one. The music was quite nice and pleasant.

Some of the campaign missions had horrible story-writing ang awkward dialogues (Haven again, which is the recommended starting campaign) while others were much better and I've enjoyed them a lot (for example Stronghold and Academy campaign). The missions did feel very unique and not repetitive at all, but some of them were way too hard (looking at you Sylvan campaign, mission 2...) and i had to look for help from guides on the internet. Also you always have to level up all heroes to the max in early missions, because they will often continue on to the next maps with the exact level and build you finished the previous map. And some maps become impossible if you forgot to level just one hero and have to restart the earlier mission if you don't have a save. 

The factions, town building and skillwheel are the strengths of this game. Most factions had unique gameplay styles and often forced me out of my typical playstyle. They also felt quite balanced, only Dungeon felt a bit weaker compared to the others. In towns you have a huge number of buildings you can build all the time and you have to choose which creatures you want to have more trained of. The heroes' skillwheel is awesome, there is no RNG in it. You can choose which skills and abilities you want for your heroes and when. It gives you the option to plan your strategy at the beginning of the game. The different ""skillslices"" are also quite balanced, tho Magic heroes with the right spells are usually much stronger in the late game than Might heroes are. 

The weaknesses of the game are the bugs and the AI which is dumber than a bundle of sticks. You cast an ability on the enemy creatures that damages every time they move - they keep on moving every turn. You cast Fire Wall on enemy creatures they rarely leave it. Hell, sometimes they even move out of it then walk right back for that sweet extra damage....
And the bugs, oh the bugs... My favourite one was when my combat grid disappeared and didn't come back for multiple campaign missions. I had to do combats on hard mode. Then suddenly it was back again. I do understand why people hate on this game for the bugs part. They are everywhere.

This is one of those titles in which i would give it a neutral score if steam allowed it, and im giving it a thumbs up, but i could might as well give it a thumbs down. Its difficult, however, to review this game alone without also talking about the previous installment. This game i can reccomend, if bought at a discount. But if you own the 6th installment, you dont get much from this game. because many animations are copied from the previous game along with looks. directly, copypasted down to even how the creatures walks. Theres also little unit variation between the factions. in fact many things seemed better and more carefully planned in game 6, rather than this game, the 7th. its also plagued by an annoying sound bug that appears from time to time.


THE LONG:

The good:
I have not tried multiplayer so ill stick to campaign and AI battles for now. 

Well, the campaign is pretty okay. each faction has its own campaign (not all games having several factions do this these days) and the soundtracks are actually well above decent, they're directly great to listen to. in fact i went ahead and downloaded some of the soundtracks on soundcloud from which they can be found. They also brought back the city screen which is great. In the previous game it was a small pop up window which was terrible. its not as grand and majestic as in game 5, but hey its a start.

Design wise many of the creatures looks good, but ill have to talk about that below as well because.. well not all of them look well, and some are copy pasted. 



Now the Odd. And the bad.

The reason i bring up the previous installment (6th) is, that from game 5 to 6, they used 2 completely different engines. that means they could not possibly copy paste any elements and animations from the 5th game, to the 6th. However from game 6 to 7, they used the same engine. While that in and out of itself isnt bad as the graphics were fine in the previous game, it means that they have opened up for the possibility to copy paste. 

When both game runs in the same engine, its possible to simply drag and drop the elements you liked from previous game (animation, looks, else) to the new game. And they have actually done that. Several creatures found in the game can be found in the previous game. and i dont mean like you find minotaurs in game 6 and 7 (which is not a problem), i mean as you find minotaurs with the exact same hitting and walking animation, and looks. Minotaurs and specific other creatures, were directly copied. thats just lazy for a new installment you charge full price for.



there are also inconsistencies:

Look at the stronghold faction. their siege unit, the Cyclops from previous game (more round and muscular from game 6) throws boulders, yet they have the same Cyclopses (cyclopsi?) as their end game unit, however, they dont share the same model. These from game 7 is more humanoid, lean and less round. Why is there such a vast difference between Cyclopses? there is a difference, because they copy pasted version 6 as a siege unit (as they did all siege units from game 6) yet for the cyclopse warrior unit, they changed it. that doesnt even make sense. 

Sound:
The game is also plagued by a sound bug. you can increase or decrease movement speed and AI speed + combat speed in the options. if you do that, the game sound bugs out, often untill you restart the game. Sure, dont fiddle with it you'd think. but the problem is, reloading a previous same file  (one where you also didnt fiddle with it) somehow also brings this bug to life as well. so you just have weird sounds sometimes. it honestly sounds like you play the game inside a cave with echo then. 

However, when the sound works, then its decent. However, the soundtracks themselves, are superb.



Animation: 
The animations are.. lackluster, and not at all as well made as previous game. Movement speeds in combat also seem highly weird. lets take the minotaur that is copy pasted from previous game to this game. In game 6, it moved at a regular slowish pace to show that its a large, bulky creature. If you moved its max distance, it might've taken about 5 seconds for it to get there. In game 7, it still takes around 5 seconds for it to move max distance, however it moves its feet super fast, yet it doesnt actually move faster from A to B. Many units have this problem where they move over all too fast with their legs, compared to how fast they actually move. 

Theres an inconcistency between sound and the animation being made. Units, when dying, tend to have the sound effect played before they happen. like you die, and fall to the ground, yet the sound of you hitting the ground, has already transpired like 1-2 seconds before hand. 

Next to that, Animation seem like its a part where they cut corners in general. like the vampires are supposed to be these master fighters, yet they dont even use a sword, and their animation of hitting is them running in to seemingly try and bite the enemy to get blood. not much of a hundreds of year old swords fighter if you ask me. Many animations are very lacking. Hell even the dying animation of game 5 was much better where the vampires would go up in flame and basically scream. now they just sort of.. 'poof' - gone. 


Over all Animations from the 6th game was just much better and smooth, and even game 5 had better over all animations where much of game 7s animation looks weird or not fully fleshed out. The developers became lazy with this game, that much is obvious. 

The same thing goes for spells. they were cooler and flashier looking in game 6 than 7, and the close up camera angles were better in game 6. The Liches attacks in game 7 looks like a purple fart flying.


Difference in faction layout?
Game 6 had better faction differences than game 7 does. Game 7 have reduced most faction differences to passive abilities, where as you could actually activate abilities and do different things in the previous game. Like the Dungeon faction in game 6 could make soldiers go invisible, which made sense, now, they just have a sad passive ability, that doesnt do anything really major. Units in this game (this is also a critique from game 6) are also a lot less varied and interesting. i mean sure theres a visual difference, but an elite ranged unit in one faction, is often more or less the same elite ranged unit in another faction. they cant do much different or interesting things. 

See, from game 5, many units had their own activated abilities, such as wizards and druids being able to directly cast several different spells. This game (and possibly game 6, cant fully remember) has removed most of those things. 
Example:
Sylvan, druid game 5: could cast stoneskin and stonespikes. that was next to its ranged attack. Meaning you had secondary ""mages"" in your army that could lay off some spell casting burden from your shoulders.

Or the liches from game 5, which would hit the first target with its ranged attack, and then everyone in an aoe around him. the upgraded version could also cast spells. The Lich in game 7? it can... well it can just shoot, and its upgraded version has a passive debuff for the guy it hits. thats sad.

it made all factions different and unique in game 5 because of these things. But game 7 doesnt have that. Or rather should i say, they do, but very little. Now most units are mostly different, based on a few stats and looks/animation. over all, its just the same. 

Game 5 had really interesting units, this game dont. 


Over all i still recommend the game because ive had a decent amount of fun playing the game. But dont buy it off sales, its not worth it then. It has mistakes, many in fact, and if you own game 6, im not even sure this game is worth it. most animations and many creatures are just copied. Game 6 is much more smooth and well rounded, where game 7 have  definitly cut corners.

Some of the game's mechanisms vere nice compared to other Heroes games (the hero no longer requires having at least one creature instance, castle defense includes a bunch of creature guards, ...).

That AI This game has the same problem as any other Heroes of Might and Magic, campaigns in higher difficulty seems to be made thinking that you will have played the map several times and know when stuff is going to happen to prepare in advance, and failed because there is no way to see the enemies out of your line of sight going for one of your cities while you move to another, not to mention that it is OBVIOUS, by the amount of troops the enemy regenerates every turn in order to try to make the computer more challenging, they are using the age old lame and stupid excuse to, instead of having the computer play better, to simply give it extra troops and resources, Civilization does this for AGES, and here it is no better.

Now, what is innovative about the game, like the caravans, is interesting, the skill wheel is also interesting, and honestly refreshing, but so few stuff is new, I recognize a ton of spells from previous iterations,  and it's the same stuff all over, you have 50 spells and use maybe 5 or 6, the others ones make no difference for being present or not in the game.

To the point that I have to say, if you like Heroes, there is not enough new stuff to justify buying this for more than the 90% discount I paid for it, and honestly, for a game so old, the base price for this ( About U$ 50 right now ) is insulting for what it provides right at the moment.",1575367268,1575367344,False,21,2,0.711679339408874512,1,True,False,False

Allthough I used to play HOMM5, especially the Tribes Of The East Add-On version in earlier times and thought that this was the best HOMM had to offer, part seven continues to astonish me even after over two-hundred hours of game play with first of all, a complete remake of the ability and skill tree that has even surmised the HOMM5 version, as well in terms of complexity as of logical congruency regarding each of the elements (skills, abilities) to the others - in the way they build up on each other and the way they have in playing the game. Second of all the maps are programmed with as in all HOMM version with love to the detail, and much more important - one of the most intruiging and best things about the game - it's masterpiece of map generator. HOMM Five had a functioning map generator that was even playable to some extent, but all the game elements were disproportionately placed and it really made one miss the designed original game maps. HOMM seven's map generator is on the other hand programmed very sophistically as one might surmise, soz the generated maps really do feel like manually designed ones with all the fun aspects they bring to the game play! Of course also the seventh HOMM part continous to amaze with a very attractive graphic, detail workouts on the fantasy elements as creatures, spells and so on and really nice, artistical game and background music. On top the changes and improvments to the earlier parts have been so extreme and the different factions a player can choose from bring such an abundance and variability to the game, that I can honestly say after the already mentioned over two-hundred hours of game play: I almost played only the two factions necro and dungeon and there is so much in the ways you can already here choose different paths and approaches on the game itself, that I simply still haven't found the time and lust to try another one, which will probably lead to some more hundreds of hours that I will spend over the coming years in this game. Since computer games have extremely improved over the last twenty years and the prices, especially for games that are just a few years old, are as cheap as it gets, I can only strongly recommend this game to anybody who likes RPGs (not rocket propelled grenades!) in general and turn-based games (for couch potato guys and of course all others) whole-heartedly as an excellent choice to invest a few bucks!

You will notice that I did not recommend this game. However I do in some part.

If you are buying this game for the sole purpose of playing the campaign or Single player skirmish then yes I do recommend it strongly as it is now for the most part polished and without major glitches.

Why I didn't recommend this game? Because I mostly play multiplayer against my brother. We've been playing this game since HOMM2. It's our nostalgic game that we grew up with and along the years we've been playing 2,3,5,6 and now 7. In HOMM 7 we've been racked with Out of synchs, disconnects but this was not the worst part.

When we are battling , we dont see each other's move on the battle map and when my creature dies, well I think its still alive because it's still up. Whereas on his side..well guess what he took the dirt nap. And the last glitch that happened in our battle was on my end it showed that it was his turn but on hiis screen it was mine. We couldnt even finish our battle. It enrages me that we spend countless hours 

Now I have searched for any fixes but couldnt find any that seemed to fix this , it is important to say that I didnt try the turn-based mode as it might be why it's so glitchy. Regardless that should not be so. Also we didnt try hot-seat but assuming this would work fine it may be the only way to be able to finish a multiplayer game.

Lastly, I highly doubt that any other update will be done so this may never be fixed.

And again, like in Heroes V and VI - multiplayer is seriously bugged.
In Heroes VII multiplayer (internet/lan), sooner or later 'out of sync' error appears. You can keep playing, but save games created after the error will be unloadable. 
You can get out of sync error, because you just touched stable with your hero, or did something else similar. ok, you load again and skip touching that damn stable and you can avoid error this time. But then something else triggers out of sync error.. so you must load and load to avoid actions, that just triggered out of sync errors. Until it totally ruins game experience and you give up.
And thats not all. You can trade artifacts only with those heroes, who picked artifact up. If at first You give artifacts from one of your heroes to another, and then try to give it to team-member hero... well you can give your artifact, but team-member doesn't see it and artifact is lost. so again, you load again and try something else.
and so on, and so on.. bugs on bugs. It's just sad.
Heroes without multiplayer makes no sense - for me it's worthless. I wouldn't have bought single-player heroes.
I don't like writing reviews in Steam. But in this case, I feel, I am obliged to. I don't have any expectations, that Ubisoft will fix multiplayer issues..

Pros:
- The monsters/units are cool. In fact the people behind creature design did a damn good job
- Magic is cool, although a bit OP at times
- Skillwheel is cool

Cons:
- The Strategic map is ugly as fucking sin. Its absoloutely disgusting to look at and you can hardly tell what all that cluttered mess is supposed to represent. Look at Heroes 3. That came out 20 years ago and yet the map is a 100 times more appeling to look at and gives the world real charm and depth
- Combat is utterly braindead and painfully slow. While the animations are alright, units deal so little damage compared to unit HP so it just turns into a long ass slog. Since you ideally want to lose as few troops as possible, all tactics turn into stacking ranged units in the corner and then surrounding them with melee fighters. You do this until you can produce elite units with more HP and get some sort of heal/damage mitigation and then you can just faceroll everything
- Its too damn easy. The toughest map structure i've come across is a tomb with a couple of hundred skeletons and some vampires and ghosts. If you have 1 champion creature, a decent hero and some ranged troops, you can do it easy with minimal losses. Enemy AI is also retardded. They dont pick up unguarded treasure on the map and most of their tactics seems to revolve around sending weak ass stacks or heroes with no units to snatch your unguraded city. Only to get molested by your army of doom 1 turn later

So here's my review.
Glitchy. 
Terrible intro, terrible graphics and movement of the main characters at the movie parts. For this tittle they should have done a better job in many aspects. 
Flickering on combat grid and other parts. 
Simple story. nothing fancy as homam 3 and 5

BUT... it is still a nice game. The gameplay is good, town building as expected. Maps are balanced and pretty (so far). Game progression is good. Storytelling is decent even tho if the story is meh. 
In a good discount it is not a bad investment to do for hours and hours of entertrainment. 
Yeah it doesnt have the good feeling we had with the old games but it is not bad at all

If you are new and you like GOT the intro character is a Jon Snow look-alike with dire-wolf units.
This is a mix of LOTR and GOT and all Heroes of Might and Magic.

My only regret is that they did not bring back the amazing Sanctuary faction or the Inferno faction.
They could even add a middle-eastern lore faction with the manticores, efreet, bandits, nomads, Rocs, corsairs, swashbucklers, and maybe sandwurms(dune)?

With this I gave up on buying 7 early and waited for a special - eventually buying it for half the price. I also intended to wait for all the bugs, glitches, etc to be sorted out with the first few patches and then buy it.

I started playing the game despite it having a 50% user review after like a year and 3 patches, and enjoyed it. I didn't like small things like the fact that they removed Dynasty weapons (which made 6 great - but I guess it didn't make sense with regards to the lore of 7; understandable). During my first 40 hours of gameplay, I didn't get many crashes - maybe 5 for the most, and the autosaving always only puts you a day behind - but found a few bugs that weren't game changing.
Overall, I started to really enjoy the story, the lore and the progression of the game.

I decided I wanted to finish up this game before I moved onto others, just for the sake of completion, and started to play the game again recently. I've been getting non-stop graphics bugs during the 3rd campaign of the elves - it's been tough, about every 5 minutes there's a roulette that starts on whether the game is going to continue after a freeze or going to be required to be closed from Task Manager. The reason I know it's a GFx issue is due to the fan speed hitting 100% for like 1 minute prior to the freeze.

At this stage, I'm pretty over it; I will be trying my best to get through it and hopefully enjoy the rest of the game, but while searching today, I found this: https://mmh7.ubi.com/en/blog/post/view/important-announcement-from-the-team
A statement that Ubi will be removing and stopping all support for this game; it's still fully buggy... wtaf.
Looking at the games that Limbic Entertainment (the developer of this game) had developed for Ubi, I see only disappointments. I wish deep down that we get quality developers for 8 --- but it's still Ubisoft... and I'm readying myself for disappointment.

It's like you love chicken, but the only supplier of chicken in your world is a company that always gets it blatantly wrong, and at the end of the day says ""Oh you don't like it, give it up, coz we don't give a flyin' f%^&"". To be honest, that's the feeling I get from Ubi about HoMM... it's like they give it little to no attention, but refuse to pass it over to someone/some company willing to go the distance and finish and complete a full development of a game, providing support and making sure shit works before a release.

I don't know if it's the day and age that has shaped gaming companies to only care about results, or if it's just Ubi that don't care at all - and haven't for the past 6-ish years. I refuse to support Ubi if this keeps going - please release a great 8th game, just to restore balance and justice. You're ultimately stealing from everyone who ever bought this game.

EDIT (2019/06/09):

Being a sucker for punishment, I decided to revisit this game. To my surprise, the crashes have dropped significantly, and this game is quite playable right now. I've enjoyed coming back to it, but the bugs that do exist in the game can easily be ""avoided""... like if certain events make the game crash, walk a little bit to the right, save the game, restart the game and voila ... no more crashes. Although irritating, it is definitely worth a try. My only advice at this stage would be to go directly through UPlay instead of Steam - there are a lot more bonuses to going that route - for this reason, I'm keeping the review as a ""No"" recommendation.
All in all ... I think this is a definite buy for Legacy HoMM, and I wish that future HoMM designs are far more robust and are planned well in the future.

I really like this game despite some drawbacks. Since it came out I've put in a lot of hours and I'm mostly satisfied with it.

The combat is engaging with aspects like flanking playing more of a role and there is a bigger focus on unit/nation synergy. A nice little bonus is that every unit has a unique attack when they get 'lucky'. 

With the skill tree, again it builds on 5's large interconnected skill wheel but simplifies this so you can't lock yourself out of the ultimate's and allows more generic progression if you'd rather be more 'jack of all trades'. It can feel a little small at times but when compared with 3's 8 skill maximum, it is leaps ahead. 

The visual are also excellent. The game looks amazing and the detail on the units is a stark reminder to how far we have come from 3 and 5. 

It really does feel, to me, as though they understood why 6 was such a shambles and that 5 was well respected so they have essentially polished 5. I don't know about the rest of you but I regularly play both 3 and 5 still and this really does feel like a worthy addition to the rolls. 

Many reviews speak of bugs but in my time with the game, I have either not encountered them or they have been so small as to go unnoticed.

I played all HoMM parts since the very first one. This will be the first one I do not play. It is a shame because the gamedesigners had a lot of interesting ideas regarding game mechanics.

The UX is just horrible. The feedback on interaction with the world is soooo sluggish. Example: Giving your hero a movement order on the map -> animation of horse turning is delaying the movement -> does not feel like direct feedback and honestly drives me crazy.

The graphics of the units are not bad, but not great. In other HoMM parts I could imemdiatly distinguish the units on first sight. That is not possible here at all. Makes the combat even more tedious.

Flanking combat mechanic results in 'dancing' units. Nobody needs that.

The UI does not look crisp either, especially not the font.

SFX sounds cheap.

I'll be deep into a mission/level, and suddenly, during the enemy turn the game crashes. If I try reloading to another, earlier save - doesn't matter, during the enemy turn the game crashes.

This has happened on two different levels so far. Last time, I was only an hour or so in and simply restarted. This time around I'm at least five hours in on a fairly challenging level (Perils of Waves and War) and it's pretty damn upsetting. I had a lot of false starts, finally got a solid footing and was doing well, found a strategy that worked and was on my way to victory, only to be defeated by a glitch.

When the game works well, it's solid - engaging gameplay, decently balanced mechanics, a few features here and there that don't work 100% (quick combat often produces casualties when it shouldn't, or produces no casualties when there would be no practical way to manually fight without at least a few), but all that is secondary. In general, it's polished and functional, the writing is excellent, the voice acting is unusually good - I can't offer enough compliments to the voice cast. A lot of developers don't put a great deal of effort into their voice casting. Limbic clearly knows what they're doing on that front, and did a wonderful job both in casting and direction.

The last part of  Might and Magic Heores and it had to be like this..... As a huge fan of this series i was once more dissapointed (MMH VI shouldnt have been released) and then you got this.... Even if i enjoy this game its more like recycled MMH 6 with some more mechanics and some older features than a new product.

So pros and cons

Pros
-7 Diffrent factions to play with (5 missions each with the exception of 1 faction that has only 2 missions)
-Well detailed graphics
-Nice story line
-Good old HOMM style

Neutral 
-You have to choose 1 between 2 diffrent ""ultimate"" creatures to produce each week 
-you can finish the game with just doing the quest's of one faction and the Ivan's storyline (7 missions) roughly 5-7 hours
-2D view of city

Cons
-Completely remove of daemon faction (except 2-3 units that serve as resource guards-stand npcs)
-Repetitivity
-Few spells (all the combat spells are 49)
-Spell animation is almost non existing 
-Glitches, best example is Academy campain mission 4 allied units teleport and block your way (you have to teleport cheat to win this)
-Achivement dosnt unlock in Ivan's campain
-Sometimes units cannot pass  over the walls (even aerial units)
-No special attacks 
-Heroes can summoned without having army (it getting fraustrating with enemy using multiple ghost heroes)
-Converting town's into your faction dosnt exist's

It's not how I like my singleplayer games, but tastes differ. That's that. 

Multiplayer! That's probably most of you reading this. That's also what the problem child is. Or rather it's grave, because it was ill, very ill. The parents were oblivious. Someone called a doctor but it was too late. You know where that's going.
Multiplayer works, or it doesn't. More likely to be the latter. You are free to scour the forums for fixes and you'll find three or four of the same official posts of the same ""fixes"", but each post being slightly different. Curious! You will be tasked with a multitude of routine network ""maintenance"" stuff, including but not limited to: 

* Updating your firewall
* Updating your antivirus
* Adding exceptions to your firewall
* (You will disable your firewall out of paranoia, it might fix it, RIGHT?!)
* [strike]Opening ports[/strike] Learning how to open ports (probably for some people, I am noob friendly) 
* Opening ports
* (Wondering why your pc requests opening a port that is unlisted on any of the ubisoft help posts)
* Disabling startup apps in the task manager and msconfig
* Clearing your Hosts file
* Clearing your DNS cache
* Contacting your ISP if they block any of those ports you want to use
* And lastly, contacting ubisoft support

Actually fun fact and story time: I've found and can link a thread on the ubisoft forums where a guy (angry) says to a staff member that he has written a support ticket which noone replied to. Support proceeds to ask for the ticket number to take a look. All's good. Someone else writes something. One month later, real thing, the same guy writes another angry (very angry, swearing rivalship to ubisoft, no rest until brought to justice in courts, contacting press) post that to this day nobody replied to that cursed support-ticket. The same support guy noticed and, well, probably answered that ticket himself, telling the costumer to check his mails. The thread died here.

Other sources say that even if someone were to answer your ticket, the help wouldn't be better than the thing the official ""fix"" posts say, which I described above. Speaking of which...
I've done those ""fixes"" and more, and I got it to work. On one of two PCs. I was getting close to having the game open 2 hours without playing it a single minute on that one pc, just troubleshooting, checking if it worked and closing it immediately after. I would't be surprised if I spent an hour of that in loading screens. Time spent trying to get it to work? Too much, close to 4.5h. 

Needless to say, I don't recommend buying this game. Reasons include and are not limited to: ubisoft dropping support of that title before it even came out it seems (or maybe the support is just bad everytime, can't confirm), multiplayer russian roulette with more bullets than anyone signed up for, generally any number grater than zero, and the amount of time You or I could spent doing [b]literally[/b] anything else before ultimately getting a refund. 
If you however decide to take the chances, I recommend you to save that steam playtime so you could still get a refund if you or friends can't get it to work on their end. If you get it to work, however, congratulations by the way, there is a unofficial bug-fix patch for the game with- or without DLC, which I can recommend.

Disclaimer, thus far I have only completed the Haven campaign and on the middle of Academy campaign, I have not played the game fully.

The good:
- Very beautiful art style, best looking Haven faction since ever. Nice looking models creature, beautiful world map. Animations range from good to alright though.
- Few but good audio sound track. Creatures sounds range from very good to decent enough, I'd job well done, for the most part.
- Deeper castle building system, there are choices to pick, overall I am glad. Overall rushing to a unit is harder than in previously games. 6 resources total, where everything besides wood and ore feels harder to acquire and more feel earned.
- The best magic school system from the entire franchise. There are are 7 different lores, Prime, Water, Fire, Earth, Air, Light and Dark, each school is strong and competitive enough on it's own. The spells while not completely stupidly broken OP as in III and some extent in V, they are pretty strong, much stronger than VI. I just feels right and it's hands down the best magic from franchise IMO. 
- Skill tree once again feels relevant, to be fair it was always good enough until VI came out. Many different choices, some are hard, but some are non brainer choices, overall almost all different skill tree talents feels well worthy to be invested until, grand mastery feels well worthy. There are very hard choices in leveling up in some skill trees as well. There's only one skill tree which I consider pure rubish garbage, which is logistics which is quite lame IMO, and the Grand Mastery from Paragorn is redundant obsolete for Academy, but overall job well done. Different heroes starts with a differet selection of skill trees, some skills can reach up to Grand Master, other until Master, and some just until Expert. It varies from hero to hero and helps to promote a different playstyle approach, based on the hero, but frankly there are better heroes and better combos.
- New Garrison system. Now we receive units to defend our towns, sadly these units cannot be upgraded, and if one already has the maximum 7 stacks (or 9 with outnumbering talent), then one would not be allowed to include the garrison units. Which IMO was a stupid idea. 
In Town defenses one should be allowed to play with all units, regardless of the stacks amount in control. Some hit and miss, IMO.
- Flanking system. It just feels right and natural, like second nature. It's just something that feels that should've been included since the very beginning.
- The combat is faster paced, more deadly and brutal than VI, but more casual and hand holding than V or III.

The cons.
- Bugs. While I have not experienced any game breaking bug, on the battle field, there are more bugs than countries on the planet. It's abnoxious and ridiculous. 
I highly recommend to try this mod http://www.hommdb.com/mods/heroes7/bugfix-buglist/
Still it does not fixes all the bugs and are bugs outside the battlefield as well, which prevents world wide buffs to work properly, such as Suzerain and Estates, some times it works, some times it doesn't, some times it works partially, it's a mess.
- The most stupid, incompetent retarded AI till date. I'm not joking last battle for instance, the AI casted ""Lightning Burst"" 
(Deals air damage to all adjacent units at the start of the target creature's next turn. If there is no adjacent unit, the spell remains active) 
Then he imediattely moved his next creature adjacent to the unit which had the Lightning Burst aura, resulting into killing his own unit! which he promply followed soon after killing other unit by attacking a stack which he stood no chance against and loosing the match.
More examples, the AI can keep running into cover or in circles, sending only 1 giving you time to wipe the entire enemy force before they could even reach you.  Some times or most often, they'll send 1 unit per time into your range, instead of going all in, making it much easier to control the battlefield and pick the foes. 
If the enemy is inside the blizzard, for whatever reason they often trap themselves and become a target from ranged missile fire, without advancing in your direction.
The ranged enemy units, some times wait, giving you time to finish them off with your own ranged units.
And so on and so fort, it's the dumbest AI till date.

Furthermore, it do not stops on the battlefield, on the campaign map, the AI does not clear neutural enemies, they often expose themselves to your much stronger army to pick and defeat em, they often miss stats boots, they are incompetent on being agressive. Once you kill their main army, they'll NEVER make another army. 
So did you killed the enemy main army? Well, game over.

- Worst level design till date. I'll give you an example as a sumary from my entire Haven campaign, it does have spoilers.
Map 1. Collect resources, kill naturals, reach the enemy city, fight a weak lame ass army, wait 18 days to fight another lame ass army, win the map. Basically the goal is to collect resources and fight naturals.
Map 2. There is not enemy faction, all you'll be doing is literally fighting naturals. 
Map 3. Scripted map, your goal is to reach Hammer Fall, running from the enemy which will come with a 192 champions and a hell lot of other units. While in your path, you've to delay the enemy progress, by destroying the bridges, collapsing stones to block their path, etc.
While this does build some tension, I have reached my goal about 12+ turns before the enemy could've reached me.
Furthermore the only thing you'll be doing on the map, the entire time, is, yes if you answered fighting naturals you were correct. 
It does not matter which building you've built, how many units you've recruited, it will comes down to the enemy 192 champions versus the 500 champions you'll acquire from completing the ritual.
There aren't any tactic, build or anything remotely connected to strategy, it's an entire level to end into a duel of 1 unit versus another unit, which you outnumber the enemy vastly. It's just pathetic.
Map 4. The enemy will send 3 armies on day 5, 23 champions and overall a hell lot of units. 
Once you've done with them the map is over, because the AI will not built another army. The tricky is, the map is HUGE, so unless you're a fan of doing battles against naturals, there's simply nothing else to be looking up for.

So basically in map 1 to 4, all you'll be doing primarly is fighting naturals. 
There's no moment with epic battles, there's no opportunity to put a show from that awesome build that you had, there's no competitive AI that would put you on your toes, as HoMM III and V can achieve on the hardest difficult. 
It's just lame.

- Auto resolve is garbage. There are many battles which were impossible to lose any single unit, which 99,8% of the time, it says I'll lose at least 1 unit. Forcing me to keep doing pointless stupid battles against naturals, over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.
The amount of different natural units is also limited, often leading to fight the exactly same unit over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.

Another very 'interesting' feature of auto resolve is, if you select it and decide to do the combat yourself, because it's worthless, then your previously deployment configuration will be lost, meaning you'll have to deploy your units in that same configuration every single battle. Just a cherry on the top of the cake. 

___

I'd love to recommend this game. If this franchise would have any hope of restoration, either from Ubisoft making a new game or anybody interested on purchasing, would require to have a good amount of sales.

Heroes VII is my favourite part of the franchise right after Heroes IV (yes you read it right: IV NOT III!). Heroes IV was my first game of the series and i will always remember the beautiful music and the campaign about Elwin and Shaera. Heroes V was just insanely hard and unfair in my opinion and VI was alright, but nothing special.
However I had lot of fun with Heroes 7. It never gets old to learn all about your own units and also about the opponent's to be able to do the best in the battles.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
There are basically two good things about this game: the [b]soundtrack[/b] and the [b]skill tree[/b]. While soundtrack is usually subjective and, whether you enjoy it, depends on your taste, In my opinion, it fits well with the game's atmosphere, is quite relaxing and enjoyable in general. Talking about the skill tree, even they reused most of the skills from the previous games, I like how they structured the tree and that they allow you to see what to expect later if you invest in a specific tree branch.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]

[b]Graphics[/b]
The graphics in this game are actually worse than they are in previous installment - Heroes 6. The graphics quality reminds me a lot of Heroes 5 which were released in 2006.

[b]Loading time[/b]
Even on a pretty good computer with SSD drive, expect the initial loading time to take few minutes... At first you wait awhile to enter the main menu and then you have to wait again for the actual game to load from the save point. By the time it finishes loading everything, you might as well have forgotten about it and started doing something else.

[b]Town Screens[/b]
Comparing just the graphics quality of Heroes 7 and Heroes 6, they can be considered almost identical. Now the representation, the actual look of the buildings, in my opinion, was better in 6. Heroes 7 town screens for me look like a mess and would be completely unusable without the shortcut buttons. I honestly wish, both 6 and 7, had town screens like they were in Heroes 5 - really beautiful and interactable 3D representation instead of just a simple static screen.

[b]Bugs[/b]
""Heroes 6"" was pretty much unplayable when it was just released. Constant crashing, AI controlled heroes getting stuck and other major issues. The Hungarian developer team did a terrible job, but eventually the game was picked up by another German team which fixed all the issues. However, looking at Heroes 7, the game wasn't so lucky - there are still some pretty severe bugs present in the game even at this point in time. For example, when using ""implosion"" spell in some specific types of terrain, it causes the units to go under the terrain and no longer be interactable. Both combat and hero AI is terrible as well - AI controlled heroes get stuck, units in combat can be easily exploited to make them just move back and forth without doing any damage.

[h1]The Ugly[/h1]
[b]AI[b]
I played a scenario with the highest AI level (""heroic""?) and the highest level of difficulty (fastest neutral unit growth, lowest starting resources, etc). The map was split into 4 almost identical sections and there were 3 AI controlled factions (red, yellow and green) with identical AI level. The result was that the red started expanding quite fast and took over the yellow AI's cities at the start-to-mid game, but then instead of concentrating its units in one or two heroes, it starting multiplying to the point where it had around 20 heroes with just small armies or no units at all. While being quite annoying with huge number of heroes, it wasn't competitive at all. Battles were just boring. Finally, the green ""heroic"" AI just got stuck at the start of the game doing absolutely nothing. 
Also, it's worth mentioning, that the neutral unit combat AI doesn't ""shine"" as well. In some specific combat layouts, you can easily exploit the AI to make it just keep going back and forth without attacking your units.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
If you want to play a recent ""Heroes of Might & Magic"" game and have fun, try either version 6 or 5. Heroes 5 has a really nice community made AI enhancement patch and Heroes 6 has pretty competitive AI out of the box and also beautiful graphics if your pc is powerful enough. ""Heroes 7"" is not ready for ""prime time"" and never will be since official support ended a long time ago and I don't believe community can fix all the major issues the game still has.

And the development looked promising, trying out a new perspective on some things(racial abilities, introduction of choke points, making the adventure map more interactive etc.), letting the comunity decice what the lineups should be(to an extent) etc. First played hotseat with my brother as we've always played Heroes together, was not amazed, nor disappointed. However there are still bugs present long after release, the multiplayer server disconnected me from both multiplayer games i've played so far after running pretty smoothly, but I still remained more or less positive. Then I started the campaign. Not that the mission design would be bad, what angered me was that you don't play one hero for each campaign, but for each mission. Not only that makes the story less impactful(didn't expect much from the story tbh, 5&6's stories were alright, even if not amazing, but their delivery was kinda bland) but takes the choice of shaping the hero to a certain playstyle. Forcibly giving you a hero with predetermined skills/perks each and every mission is just a wrong decision. I understand that it sort of teaches you new playstyles for each faction, but that's what custom scenarios were for. Overall the game is not bad, but if you want a good Heroes game, just pick up HoMMV:ToE or HoMMIII(which is included in the complete edition of 7, so you get at least one really good game here).

Diclaimer: 
1)Have only played a few hours.
2)Haven't tried and probably wont even bother with multiplayer.

I was on the same boat with the few that liked homm6, despite the streamlined gameplay. The only game-breaking thing to me, was the fact that enemies were getting too OP if you took your time and explore everything. Campaign was really hard too. I never liked playing this series with a ticking clock and probably never will as it's an immersive and relaxing experience for me.

That being said, i think homm7 is a very good game because:

1)Mechanics are far more interesting and deep than its predecessor. 
2)Extra resources are always welcomed.
3)At its current state and after a few hours of playtime, i had no crash, encountered no bugs (at least nothing too obvious) and cutscenes seemed changed/altered for the better comparing to first reviews footage.
4)Random map generator.
4)Random map generator:).

Now there are some things that need to be mentioned too:

1)This game holds a rather strange marketing decision. Seems very rough around the edges, models are being re-used from the homm6, some textures are rather low res and holds a general feeling that either is a mod or released before the homm6.
2)Visualy it could have been better. The devs obviously wanted to give the game a more washed out feel, closer to the homm3 than using the same vivid colour palette from the previous one. This can be fixed to a certain extent by changing monitor's brightness/contrast/gamma setting. I've also enabled FXAA from the nvidia control panel, but that's a matter of personal taste.
3)Runs good, but could have run smoother.

I personaly haven't encountered anything i don't like. Game moves to a better direction than its predecessor. I think that after more than 2 decades passed, the series needs some new features, additions and not another homm3. They need to move on, build on solid ground and take it from there.

I will update the review as i play, but for now this gets a solid 8/10 from me.

Update 1: Yep, finaly found a couple of bugs. Nothing that needs to lower the score and certainly nothing gamebreaking either, just a couple of combat tooltips with a mind of their own. Still very fun so far.

Update 2: After 25+ hours of playtime, i can say this is the most fun Homm game i've played in recent years (yeah i know there was only VI in between, but you get the point:). The A.I is not that bad, just weird at times but in tough times suits me just fine. It gets bonuses as difficulty raises (all strategy games -ALL- follow the same formula), but at least it doesn't appear to know where you're on map like VI did. I really can't find any major flaw; maybe i'm the lucky one that didn't experienced a single crash, or i got into it with a very open mind, but i really love it so far.

Both will open the same executable file, but with different App IDs, so playing the DLC from library won't unlock the achievements on Steam (the DLC on Steam itself doesn't have achievements).

When H7 first came out, I had tried playing it on my friend's account (because he pre-ordered the game but couldn't get access to his PC at the time) and I had to say that it was definitely an unfinished product. I even joked to him, ""Loading a map takes a year, and AI's turns are gonna end soon in the following winter."". In fact, I was telling the truth, the optimization of this game was a disaster, I got a decent gaming laptop back then and the game performed poorly. Switching from high preset to low didn't even help, probably there were some serious issues with the game itself. Another problem I had encountered was the memory leaks. Playing largest map without having the game eating up all my RAM was impossible, whenever I nearly discovered the whole map, it just happened. I have to say, my past experience with this game wasn't so good, it was pretty sad and I was so angry while playing this game 2 years ago.

I can't seem to remember the time when I bought H7 for my account, as it was completely forgotten after making me insane for a few months. Steam said that I picked it up last year while it was on sale. Well, I must have been drunk as fuck then. Anyway, I gave this game a try once more, I can say it has been transformed into something else. Loading time seems to be ""normal"" now. Enemy's turns still take a lot of time, but compared to what I did experience, it's like they made one year turn into ten milliseconds. In addition, although the game still tends to take up more RAM usage after a certain time of map exploring, the memory leak issue rarely happens anymore.

It's funny how I still remember the first time playing H7, that was when I would have no hesitation in giving the game's cinematic a 0/10 score. In the ""cutscenes"" (I don't know if it is the right word in this case), which show us the Shadow Council's round table discussion about the current situation, whenever someone talked, the camera turned and zoomed into his/her face and then the dialogue began. It was pure magic how words could get out of their mouths, because... their lips didn't move at all! Terrible, I had no other words to say. Fortunately, Limbic seems to improve the dialogue problem in some of their patches, now the camera doesn't zoom into their faces and everything is a little less ridiculous.

Yes, it is true that Limbic did patch their broken game, but it is also true that Limbic has abandoned their game (See:  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/321960/discussions/0/350543951937765662/] Their announcement [/url] ), how tragic... It means that there will be no further updates, no patches, no new DLCs for H7 whatsoever. Fortunately, developers left, community stays, fans still try to fix the game. There is [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/321960/discussions/0/1489992713709508118/] Unoffical Community Patch[/url], I did the campaigns with this community patch, and everything seemed alright, there were still bugs and glitches here and there though.

With that being said, patching a broken game just makes it more broken, it is true on some aspects with this game. Magic heroes were weak in the previous versions of H7, so to make the game more ""balance"", developers ""fixed"" this by buffing those heroes and their skills. You might think this move was reasonable, but the fact is that it broke some campaign's encounters. In some maps, you may find some unexpected difficult fights with the enemy's magic heroes. It was possible yet hard to beat them, so there's nothing game-breaking, just annoying.

Well, talking about ""annoying"", AI is the thing which annoys me the most. I heard people said H6 had the worst AI ever, H7's AI is the living proof that proves they're deadly wrong. Both scripted heroes and non-scripted ones seem clueless. Scripted heroes are not aggressive to player at all, after one or two defeats, they are just running around like crazy. Non-scripted heroes are even worse, some of them (usually empty heroes with no unit at all) just wander around doing nothing. Another annoying thing is the number of them, the first thing AI seems to do in each map is to hire all available heroes. Then they just let them run from one point to another without giving a tiny rat's ass about player's heroes.

H7's developers reused a bunch of stuff from H5 and H6, to be more specific: decent gameplay mechanics from H5 and the interface, models, music,... plus some other clunky things from H6. For instance, skill wheel and racial skills are there in the game. I liked them, especially the skill wheel, without the randomness it's easier to optimize and to choose a play-style for your hero (it's very important and really affects the power of your hero so choose wisely). Another positive point is the new flanking system in combat. The name is self-explaining, your attacking units will do more damage when attacking from side or from behind of the enemy (full-flanking), and vice versa. Some units have special abilities about this as well, like it cannot be flanked at all or can do more damage when flanking the others. This flanking mechanic performs pretty well in my game, I feel like it brings more depth into the combat system since each round I got more things to consider and worry about.

I'm more of a single-player gamer, but I did play some multiplayer maps and my experience was just horrible: random CTDs, being unable to connect (disconnected during the game), slowness, ridiculous glitches,... guess I'll just stick to the campaigns and skirmish maps then.

All in all, It's hard to say how I feel about this game, as playing it was fun yet inwardly boring at the same time. ""Should I recommend this game?"" is the question that I cannot find the right answer. However, with all the things I've said above, the latest version of H7 is decent, if you had tried the game right after it was released and couldn't tolerate it, you might want to give it another shot. In case you have yet to buy the game, I suggest you should wait until it's on sale then flip a coin to decide.",1533416915,1533575074,True,53,3,0.810059189796447754,1,True,False,False

This is a review in both Chinese and English。
推荐这款游戏，但是我发表在英文区，可能没多少国人能看得见。。。。。
尽管有那么多的非议，在我心中，英雄无敌7依然是一部优秀的作品，一部值得推荐的作品。可以看得出，育碧没有给H7项目太多的经费，许多模型，图标和系统都是沿用着6代，城镇画面也非常简陋。但是，我能感觉到，制作组在用心做这部游戏，在用心发展这个IP，在进一步完善这个亚山世界。五代跟六代的墓园建筑风格完全不同，一个是哥特式一个是金字塔，但是在六代中的墓园城镇画面的背景中，可以看到远方的悬崖上尖尖的5代高塔。七代中则解开谜底，一个伟大的亡灵巫师牺牲自己重塑华莱士，原来的金字塔主城被摧毁了，墓园势力才搬家到五代的高塔上去。七代中还用两个战役讲了兽人从法师的奴役下起义的故事，让我们亲自体验到了曾经只是文字叙述的故事背景。更加好评的是失落传说战役，4代的BGM缓缓响起时，我的眼泪都快留下来了。这个战役整合了魔法起源故事，把四元素魔法与四代的秩序混乱生命死亡之间的联系讲明白了。可以看出，制作组真的有用心去做这个系列。我们也不必太去追究英雄无敌系列是否没有革新。汽车被发明了一百多年，可是它的驾驶方法依然没有出现本质上的变革。我们喜欢的就是这种感觉。祝愿下一部英雄无敌更加优秀。我的steam首次评价，送给Might & Magic® Heroes® VII！
I strongly recommend this game!
Although there are  too much negative reviews to H7, it is still an excellent game (or  an  artwork), which is worth recommending to all players.We can easyly seeing that Ubisoft did not give too much money to the H7 project. Many 
unit models, icons and systems are used from the H6，and city window is really shabby.But I can feel that the production team is really diligent for this game, for MMH series.They are further improving the Ashan  world. For  instance, The architectural style of the Undead in H6 is completely different from H5. One is  Pyramid style and another is Gothic style.But if you are careful enough ,  you can see the sharp Gothic tower on the cliff in the distance when you open H6 undead city window. The surprise is we will  know why the undead moved their  bases to Gothic tower in H7. Another example is ,there are 2 chapters of campaign tell the story that how the orcs are independent from the enslavement of the mages. In the past  version, it is only a story, in H7,you can experience this story  in person. But i want to give more praise to  the lost legend campaign.When I heard the H4  BGM slowly sounded, my tears almost flowed down.This campaign integrates the story of the origin of magic.It makes clear the connection between the four element magic and order, confusion, life, death magic.It can be seen that the production team really has the intention to create H7.Nor do we have to blame too much for the lack of innovation in this series games.The car has been invented for more than 100 years, but its driving method still hasn't changed in essence. What we like is the feeling. Wish the next hero 8 will give us  much surprise and touch.The first time I wrote an evaluation on steam, I gave it to Might &amp; Magic Heroes VII!",1531905142,1531905142,True,14,1,0.480740785598754883,1,True,False,False

Unbelievable!!!

I don't know where to start. The list is so long but let me put my top 3.

1) in castles, UX is horrible. 
1.a)Drawings with no feelings- Come on!! Everyone would be much happier with heroes 3 style graphics in castles. I cannot imagine myself living there when I got into that view. In a way, you killed my dreams. I still  remember in heroes3 and 5, I would get into a castle and imagine myself living there on its streets
1.b) very limited connections between useful links (e.g., when I get into the magic guild after building the first level and try to decide which type should I choose as mandatory speel in all levels, I want to know expertise of my character. if I go to my heroes, I do not see his/her core spell type. So I need to go out of the castle and click on the character. SO useless

2) why would you change resource names. Really why? There is no better way of alienating old heroes fanatics from the game. Plus, since I don't know the new materials, it is very hard for me to see which area produce what without bringing my cursor on top of them.

3) the second point brings me to the third. The map looks much more realistic and gives the more imaginable image of heroes world but objects are so disproportional, and their 3Dtextures makes them very to differentiate from the background.

I loved 1 - 3, 4 was meh, hardly played 5, and never played 6. I think this improves a lot of aspects of 5, but it still feels like 5 in new skin. My biggest issue is the pacing is still SO SLOW. AI turns take 5-6 seconds per player so in a 4 person match you're waiting 20+ seconds per turn, which equates to a lot of waiting pretty quickly. End-game turns felt like my ratio of waiting to playing was pretty equal. Battles aren't worth it at all, auto-complete will almost always net you the best result and save you 5+ minutes of slow animations - which takes out a big chunk of what makes HOMM games fun. You can cut some of the unnecessary slowness down via settings, but it wasn't enough to keep me playing for long periods. 

 The art is good and the mechanics are there to make a great game, it just feels like it's lacking some final steps to make it a polished product. It's disappointing that Ubi continues to refine ideas that don't work, but here's hoping dismal sales lead to selling the franchise soon.

As far as gameplay goes, this is solid HOMM. The developers tend to cycle features and creatures into and out of titles from one version to the next; why would you expect anything else?

It is possible once again to create a doomstack of core necro creatures (upgraded!) from battles. It's not broken because you don't get many, but still...it's a good recycled mechanic. Caravans are a new mechanic which take away the need for low-level mule heroes. I love the caravans. And the factions! We have so many of the classics packed into this title.

The graphics are decent. I don't know why people are complaining about the voice acting--at all. I mean, at the point of this review, I've only played through 1 1/2 campaigns, but the voice acting and the cinematics so far are all very well done.

I'm not yet sold on the skill wheel, and I do not like the look of the town screens. The building interface is well done, though.

All in all, yes, this game is worth a buy. It has too many good qualities and too much HOMM goodness to pass up.",1529836793,1529836793,True,36,0,0.769928038120269775,0,True,False,False

Now, I actually think this game is the best in the series.  - In terms of Human Multiplayer anyway.

The downsides.  The pedia doesn't include any real game mechanics information about the troops or heroes.  Instead it includeds flavor text, which is a nice addition, but doesn't work as a replacement.

The map editor.  Where to begin?  It's awful, and likely the reason there are only a dozen maps in the workshop for a game that's been out two years.  It's massive and clunky and requires a level of technical knowledge that implies they're intentionally trying to keep people from using it.  Why is it that with each iteration of the game, the map editor gets worse?  Then there's the ""cooked map"" feature which keeps you from editing any published map.  Not just maps that came with the game, but any map created by anyone else, even if you downloaded it and it has a simple error you want to correct, you can't.

Pros

- skill wheel design allows some good strategy
- graphics is quite good
- terrain have different heights - maps are beautiful/realstic
- most bugs have been patched, in some campaign AI heroes are very aggressive (making the early game challenging)
- some good soundtrack

Cons

- some minor bugs, I heard there is an fan-made unofficial patch available
- on the battlefield, the AI does not advance to the player correctly. If I put a fire wall over them, most of the time the AI units on fire purposely travel within the fire tiles (and die)
- some recycled units and music (such as Heroes VI battlefield)

Finished only the 3 and 5 , played a lot and been kicked my ass a lot in 2, played 4 just a little.

This episode is better than the 6th in one aspect and one only : the system.
They re-introduced 4 different high-tier ores, which aren't jewels, crystals, sulfur and mercury, but that's not the point : there're 4 different high-tier ores, which is way cooler than then ""dragon crystal"" of 6.
The heroes talents is much better in this version too : much like HoM&M 5's skill wheel, without the randomness : much easier to optimise, i'm a bit sad about the fact that there is no random factor, but again, that's way better that 6's ""Blood/Tears"" dichotomy.
Now for the bad points, which are the same as in M&MH 6 :
 - a town screen which is graphically a tiny bit better than HoM&M 4 : goddamit HoM&M 5's town screen were masterpieces! I spent time just looking at them!

However, the single-player campaign seciton of the game (at least now) is really well done.  

Pros 
-A varied and legit interesting campaign for each faction.  Most of the maps are not 'kill all your enemies'.  
-Maps look nice, have different elevations, and plenty of effects.  Little touches that make it seem more interesting. 
-The units are well-animated and well-designed. 
-Champion units are finally truly intimidating.  When one cyclops has 500 hit points you have to think of how to stop it before it wrecks your front lines. 
-The skill wheel takes some getting used to, but I ultimately liked it.  You seem to level up more often in this game and you have a wide breadth of choices for your skills. 
-Each faction plays different enough to make it interesting every time you load up a new campaign. 
-The town screens, while dissapointingly not 3D, seem to have been cleaned up and are pleasant to look at.  The building UI has been improved, too. 
-The game is still buggy sometimes, but no where near the release levels so take that as a pro.  It has only crashed on me once. 
-The game plays faster (kind of) and much more interesting than Heroes VI, the only Heroes game I never finished. 
-I appreciate them going back to fix the council meeting sections and animating them.  
-Good ol' Heroes fun.  Kind of a cross between III and V, with some VI user interface fixes expanded upon. 

Cons
-I miss the secondary upgrade options and animated 3D town screens from Heroes V.  I get that budget and balance prevented that sort of stuff here, but it's still a bummer. 
-Some of the maps are too packed with stuff.  There are little doodads and guardian creatures every few feet it seems. 
-The campaign doesn't seem very balanced.  Even though the maps are varied, most of them basically throw a few enemy heroes your direciton within the first 3 weeks, all with massively powerful armies.  If you can survive and beat them back then you will be able to start a war of attrition to eventually win the map.  
-Magic is still stupidly overpowered.  If you aren't blasting every enemy army with Poison Mist, Entangle, and Agony then you're doing it wrong.  
-Lack of Inferno is a real bummer and while I was not at all a big fan of Heroes VI, it's sad to see Sanctuary missing, too, for variety's sake. 

Conclusion
-The developers obviously put a lot of time and effort into this game, with the designs, animations, map effects, campaign stories, etc.  And they should be applauded.  I know it's heresay, but I think this is a more complete game than III, though V is still my favorite overall.  It is basically III, but with a better story, graphics, user interface, and combat (the addition of flanking and initiative along with direct hero input).  

I think once fans get over the fact that the game isn't perfect they will accept this as a worthy addition to the Heroes franchise.  I got it on sale and it's a tremendous bargain for what I paid.",1522871018,1522871018,True,18,1,0.697694897651672363,0,True,False,False

The series is very special to me, but I have not really enjoyed the Heroes games since Heroes III.

To me, this is the most ""true"" Heroes game since Heroes III. And it was a pleasant surprise because I bought it expecting to be let down. I bought it expecting another Heroes V mess. Instead, from the minute I clicked on the towns and heard that operatic music - which was so similar to that beautiful music score from Heroes II - I could see I was in for a surprise. I have only played a few hours, so I will update this later, but for now here are my pros and cons:

Pros:
- Feels and sounds like Heroes
- The magic and skill system looks very interesting
- Nice town structure and town graphics
- Awesome music
- Interesting new dwellings and buildings and such
- The Sylvan town draws heavily from the Sorceress town of Heroes II - my personal favourite town ever. Loved to have the druid and elf archer combo again :)


Cons
- Battlefield seems a bit small and cluttered sometimes. Not sure why, I have not done the maths, but this could be improved
- The game map can also seem a bit cluttered at times
- The information when you right-click a monster stack should be improved. Sure, it is ""modest"" threat, but what exactly are they so I can look them up...
- AI seems dumb as dirt - but that is the case in every Heroes game ever (and also every Civilization game ever - which leads me to conclude they just cant make AI that handles so many variables)",1522152292,1522152292,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

So where should I start...

Well, i did get heroes 6, and it was a complete mess. So i didn't play it until they fixed all the crucial things like crashes.
I decided too wait because of the grafics and i felt curious about the new techtree for your hero, it was deep with alot of options.
And my wait payed of, i loved the game, i got all the dlc:s and i have never regretted it.
So before i decided to buy heroes 7 i thought i'd read the reviews incase there were some crucial bugs.

I realized pretty quickly that this was another failed attemt with even more bugs etc, etc...

BUT with a sale of -75% i thought, well, why not give it a go. Probably the bugs will be fixed just like how it was for Heroes 6.
I've played this game 1,5hours at this moment, and holy f#ck this game is a twisted copy of Heroes 3, and they went back from the more competitve (multiplayer) design of Heroes 6, that i slowely learned to love.
The heroes now got some weird techtree, and you even gotta spend attribute points too unlock new skills? Like are you fucking kidding me?
You get like maybe one skill, then u gotta waste one point to unlock the next?
Wow... just wow...
The game itself looks like a HD remake of Heroes 3, just a bit more lag... so it seems its not very optimized.
Combat feels slow and weird, and i do miss the healthbars from heroes 6. 
IMO more information is good, when you do war.
In other words game is f#cking terrible, there are no animations, its like i'm playing a show and tell game or some sh1t like that.

So after these 1.5hour i feel violated and abused, even with the somewhat fair price (-75%)
Well, calling the price fair is a bit too nice. They should accualy pay me for playing this piece of anal ebola fiesta.

So i'm not sure i will ever be able too force myself too play this outdated, crappy, piece of sh1t game...

For anyone that liked all the other heroes or just one of them, this is maybe for you? Atleast you do the same thing as in the other games...

My advise would be, not too never, ever play this garbage. Rather let the a good title die with honor.

IMO, (my ideas different than most of community) 6 was a good game for spells and skills and there was strong seasonings, like achievements, powerfull items, traits, ranks and story. 4 was a good game, soundtracks of the game was legendary, its map and ambiance was fantastic, there was some issiues about heroes (they was overpowered) but the game was incredibly enjoyable, 3 was a great game, there is nothing to say as negative but the game is very old, so it can take some elements from 4, 5, and 6 for future games normally. 5's stortelling wasgreat and its unit models was really beautiful, you can see the most beautiful archangel models of the serie in this sequel.

The reviews are very negative so I'm not even sure where to start. I love turn-based strategy fantasy games and strategy games in general. As you can see in my profile, I have over 1000 hours played on Age of Wonders 3, over 700 played on Europa Universalis 4 and almost 500 on Total War Warhammer 1. So far I have almost 300 hours with MMH7+Expansion by playing only campaigns, and I'm about halfway in the Fortress Campaign (last one).

I will highlight several points trying to explain why I like this game:

1. Campaigns. I think this is where this game shines. The base game has 6 factions, each one with a campaign made up of 4 (5 for Necropolis) missions, except Haven which has an additional campaign. The campaigns all take place in the past; they are basically tales narrated by a member of the races and have different focus. Some recall the 1000 and 1 nights (Academy), others pirate tales (Sylvan), some are epic (Necropolis), etc. If you finish all the campaigns before the final one which takes place in the present, you unlock advantages in that final campaign. There are also 2 additionally campaigns called ""Lost Stories of Axeoth"", which take place in the world of HoMMIV, and the expansion adds a 7 mission campaign for the dwarves (Fortress) and a final campaign for Haven.

The vibe of the camapigns is very fairytaily so don't expect grimdark settings or skulls like in TWW. It's really like reading a fairytale book with several stories, and there are some funny/comic remarks here and there that make you smile.

The difficulty of the campaigns is rather low, the AI doesn't expand much and even on the most difficult setting I lost a few times only and I just needed to reload a few turns earlier to win. 

2. Graphics look beautiful, the map is fully 3D and zoomed in the camera goes up and down mountains, lakes, etc. Colors are very bright and flashy. Maps also have different planes: there are portals that lead to dungeons, heavens, etc. Some maps have puzzles that need to be solved to proceed (i.e. entering the realm of the dead in the Academy campaign), so that makes for a fun twist. 

3. Gameplay is simple and fun. There is way less campaign strategy compared to AoW3 and TWW, for examples cities don't rebel, cannot be converted, diplomacy is absent, etc. It's very easy to learn and makes for a fun, after work casual play.

Battles take place in separate maps and are very similar to the ones in AoW3. You can use spells, unit abilities, flanking, etc. Some units create magma lakes, spew venom, jump the whole battle map, create a defense, catalyze magic damage, etc. A very nice touch is that the battle maps change in size, some are huge and allow for the safe use of ranged creatures, others are tiny and lead to fast melee fights. There is no way to know in advance what battle map size you'll get, which allows for some fun unpredictability.


4. I did not have a single crash in 300 hours of gameplay! And I have a 2013 laptop... I'm not sure why crashes are reported by other players so often... There are bugs, yes, but they are more annoying glitches than anything else, like a unit disappearing for a fight (but it comes back after it), a caravan getting stuck somewhere, a unit ability working slightly differently from the tooltip description, a campaign mission ending only after a relaod, etc. However these bugs are  far in bewteen, I usually notice them every 20 hours of gameplay or so. 

When it is first installed, likely Uplay will give you an error message. It's just a glitch, you need to go to Uplay, create an account, and then start the game. It will work seamlessly from then on. It plays online and offline.

About the multiplayer bugs, I don't play multiplayer so I can't comment on that.

5. The races play similarly in the strategic map, i.e. conquer cities, occupy resources, build units in cities etc. but they differ slightly in what resources they need the most, how fast the caravans go, how much money they make etc. 

Most differences though are in the battle mode. Every race has a different hero specialization that I find rather strong so I usually take it before any other. Races also have different units. Some races rely on ranged attacks, others on stealth, defense, fast attacks, magic, etc. I find them very well balanced and well done, everyone of them has a different flavor and mechanics in battle even though they all retain the basic differences of melee, ranged, support and siege units.

6. Heroes support units in battle but don't fight directly, differently from AoW3 and TWW. They can cast spells and do ranged attacks but cannot be targeted or attack in melee. A fun aspect of the heroes in this game is that are almost infinite way to specialize them. They all fall into the might  or magic classes, and then there are subclasses for every race. They also have an exclusive starting ability or bonus such has starting skills already activated, gain some money per day, improve a unit's performance,  replenish mana, etc. When gaining experience, you can upgrade them following a skill wheel divided in several slices. Every slice represents a skillset, which in turn contains several subskills. Only 3 slices per hero allow to reach the final subksill, the other trees end earlier, forcing the player to decide if they want to go deep in a skill tree, remain shallow but activate several trees, or a mix of both. In random and scenario maps there is the option to randomize the selection of skills. 

7. Other than campaigns, there is a random map generator, and many single mission scenarios, so the replayability is huge. AI in these maps is very strong (it likely cheats) so they surely provide a challenge. I find it impossible to win on the max difficulty in random maps for example. 

So final remarks: I love this game, I think together with AoW3 and TWW is the ultimate turn-based fantasy game of this decade (I don't include Endless Legend because I did not really like it). Compared to those two, it's more simple, more arcady and richer in RPG elements, but I find it so charming in its simplicity and I adore the fairytale, storyteller, magic vibe of it all. Yes it has a few bugs, a few more than those other two games I mentioned, but again nothing gamebreaking and usually rare. 

So yes my suggestion is go buy it!",1517286369,1517537286,True,22,0,0.696440398693084717,1,True,False,False

On the face of the negative reviews seen at Steam and Heroes Community, I think is safe to assure that you'd be scared of getting a game full of bugs, clunky animations, moronic AI, awfully-done visuals, slow-paced and  poorly optimized and balanced... Nah. Upon releasing the game was actually THAT, but that's not the case anymore. That's the main reason why I've waited for so long to write down this review. Fuck, because I know Ubisoft very well, so back in 2015 I decided not to invest any money on it until the first reviews came out... so they did, confirming my worst expectations. Even more, I think Ubisoft should be issued for fraud, since it's been selling an early-access game at full price, a common practice that cannot be allowed. Period.

Currently HoMM 7 (aka. HoMM 6.5) is a 'standard', solid, classy and revamped version of Heroes III, however it claims desperately to be purified from bugs (partially eradicated by Antalyan), as well as modded (I mean, expanded). If it were not enough, HoMM 7 found an additional BIG hindrance on releasing: the appearance on the stage of magnomagus's great opus: HoMM 5.5. This excellent mod made by a skilled fan devoted to make Nival's offspring great again, finished HoMM 7 off, by putting it automatically to the test in every single way you can think of. Ergo when it comes to review our game, we just can't avoid comparing it with its big brother. Sad, isn't it?

1. HoMM7's global map is far superior. Arguably the editor. And for a guy like me, who maintains that the global map plus the map editor constitute, at least, a 60 % of a Heroes game, that is not a minor thing. Why is it better? Easy: we (i. e. our Heroes) can reach more distance per turn, so the consequences are self-evident: we are able to do more stuff in less time, ergo our experience is increasingly dynamic, enriching and fast-paced in the long term. But that's not it: the graphical engine (I insist, from the 'global' perspective) is understandably better (2006-2015): for instance, orography is a pain in the ass in HoMM V but it feels smooth in HoMM 7. 

2. This leads us to the second point: the visuals. I'm aware that not everybody would agree with me, but the graphics à la Warcraft provided by HoMM 5 weren't exactly within my taste. On the contrary, HoMM 6 and HoMM 7 made the grade, setting the bar above Nival's generic pretensions. Bravo on that.

3. HoMM 7 is faster. Sure, you'd say it's because AI is ridiculously implemented and yeah, you'd be right about that, but still, for a casual player like me that's not even an actual issue. A Heroes game, fellas, must be relatively fast if it doesn't wanna ruin the whole game experience. I'm not willing to accept more than 8 seconds between turns; everything above that it's unthinkable for many players, at least playing solo (the hot seat experience is pretty much other). Moreover, we're living in 2018 CE, fellowmen: why in the hell is this even an issue at all?...

4. The campaigns. I recall Heroes V campaigns to be dull and ridiculously written. Not that I care too much since I'm not particularly interested in them, but it's something to be aware of.


[u]In what elements HoMM 7 is as good as Heroes V (even 5.5):[/u]

1. The skill wheel. To be fair, I'm not sure whether skill system in Heroes 7 is better than Heroes 5.5, but I do like it very much. Having the chance to decide how our heroes will grow is fun, so it's in Heroes 5.5. Again, not everybody would agree with me (definitely not the 'hardcore fans', for sure).

2. Those praised features inherited from Heroes VI and Heroes IV: converting towns, controlling zones, choosing different ways for developing our towns, etc. These are extremely valuable features, shared or not with magnomagus's mod, that enrich our gaming experience an awful lot.


[u]What HoMM 5.5 (and HoMM 6) do better than Heroes 7:[/u]

1. Everything related to the game system. HoMM 5.5 is better balanced, tested, fixed and polished than HoMM 7 in regard to the skills, the combat, the factions synergies, etc. I've been witness of extremely fruitful debates at Heroes Community on that particular area and men... you just can't compete with these keen nerds. HoMM 5.5 is a machine extremely-well lubricated while HoMM 7, on the other hand, it's still in a raw stage.

2. The townscreens. What the fuck were you thinking, Limbic fellas? The townscreens in HoMM are no more than glorified smartphone screens that can't be compared with the 3D beautiful environments built in HoMM 5 or the well-crafted 2D landscapes of HoMM 6 (actually my favourite saga-wise). No debate: HoMM 7 is clearly below the two previous instalments in that particular area. Anyway I can live with it: it's not a game-breaker. except in the case of the goddamn 'spider' necropolis, otherwise fixed by Libertad's townscreens mod.

3. The overall animations: HoMM 5 and HoMM 6 are far superior than HoMM 7 when it comes to the combat. It isn't true that HoMM 7 animations are THAT bad, but they're not good either. The experience in-combat is a bit disappointing while in the previous two instalments is so exciting. If it wasn't enough, some sound effects are missing at sieges... Once again, HoMM 7 is the true offspring of a rush and sloppy development.

4. There's no inferno faction in HoMM 7, nor even Sanctuary. Yeah, we're missing, at least, one more faction to it. Modders, get to work! 

5. The ARMG is a Heroes 5.5's powerful tool that clearly overcomes HoMM 7's generic map generator.  

6. You must own a cutting-edge machine in order to run HoMM 7, in exchange for a few more than an enhanced 'indie' game. Really? Poorly optimized.

7. HoMM 7's multiplayer is still in development. Again, not that I care of: I'm not playing a Heroes game for it. 

8. HoMM 5's AI, revamped by Quantomas, is clearly superior, as I already stated it.

9. A loyal fanbase's following HoMM 5 over the years, however it seems that HoMM 7's an early abandonware, only supported by relatively few good chaps.

[b]Verdict: 6/10:[/b] Properly modded, HoMM 7 might become the best Heroes of the franchise, in my humble opinion. Nevertheless, in its current state it's merely a wannabe.

This game has fallen a victim of greed, strategically incompetent, lazy publishers. Instead of having some patience and make careful investments to the future, they just threw all away.
In fact, you can see some kind of a textbook example what does the proverb ""to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs"" mean in real world. Such a shame. The grim fact is that they betrayed both the developers and customers by disabling any future support for this game - as soon as it reached definitely healthy stage and get its first expansion pack, Trial by Fire. The same story as Heroes VI & Shades of Darkness one. 
So, technically, what does it mean for you, player? No future patches. No future content. No fresh creative community members to make interesting mods because HoMMVII is so badly crippled with negative reviews and overall hatred that it's almost impossible to attract new players now.
If such things doesnt't scare you to death, see below.
* End of unavoidable briefing *

Now, I must say it loud that I still recommend this game.
It has its own lovely looking design, not a fairy-tale, but definitely fantasy looking one. Units and factions are memorable and have different looks, not a strange-generic-trash one like in Heroes VI. 2D art is also very pleasant, except unit icons which could be better if devs have more time for them.
In Heroes VII, if you'll be patient and play through long campaign maps, you'll see some examples of really unique map designs not only for Heroes series, but for fantasy turn-based strategies in general. I mean terrain features - like crossings, destructible and rebuildable bridges, obstacles, or like mountains from dwarven campaign - which surprisingly look like big real mountains, in full 3D. I was so amazed when I saw them that I felt myself like a child playing Heroes a first time. The maps are beautiful and they spent a lot of efforts to make it that way.
The plot is so-so, but it's not boring as in Heroes VI. You don't feel yourself captured by the story, but mostly it is gameplay and beautiful looks that inspires you for playing. The game has sort of warm, convenient and calming feeling and I don't think that is just because it's a part of the famous franchise. HoMM VII has it's own attraction. Consider it better, remastered edition of HoMM VI (and final version of HoMM VI is not that bad too) - or a new concept on how HoMM VI should look if designers show some more love to the details.

That game has been ostracized for its numerous bugs. I have to say that I've yet to encounter a game-breaking bug, contrary to Heroes VI many graphic glitches. Most bugs are just annoying, from heroes that ""disappear"" in battle if you act too fast after casting a spell, to stacks of creatures being ""recruited"" while you have no room in your army and therefore just disappearing. The kind of stupid things that should be fixed by a patch, but thanks to Ubisoft's glorious move it will never happen...
The gameplay and factions/unit roster looks like a best of of former Heroes episodes. No more town conversion neither Sanctuary faction from Heroes VI (too bad, that faction was maybe the best thing in the game). The number of factions is reasonable (7 with the extension). There's no daemons, but they appear in the neutral units roster, that is full with other old creatures from the game (they even have lizardmen). The battles are very close from what they were in Heroes VI, but thankfully the healing/regeneration spells have been toned down and the focus isn't anymore on winning without losses at all cost. The skill wheel is a good skill system, especially since it avoids Heroes V main disavantage of forcing you to follow a single path to obtain an overpowered racial skill: in campaign mode, you'll probably develop one or two of your three grandmaster skills, and the rest (about half of your 30 levels points) can be spent in the rest of your skills, offering a good variety.
The campaigns are pretty interesting. It kinda lacks the feeling of each being part of a greater story, like you had in Heroes III, V and VI, but the stories and maps are good. Alas, here is the main drawback of the game to my eyes: the AI is just disastrous. It does rather ok in battle, but is absolutely unable to offer a challenge in campaign mode. Even in heroic difficulty, it still doesn't use its resources to full capacity, leaving resources on the ground in its own territory, I even met an enemy mage faction that didn't specialize its magic guild and therefore couldn't learn any spells from their towns - specializing your magic guild is just clicking on a button and costs nothing... So it is rather usual to just steamroll the campaign maps from the first to the last. No more huge (and sometimes almost impossible) boss fights like in Heroes VI, just some a few harder fights against heroes at level 30 when you're level 15 or so, it's not much to be proud of.
All in all, the game isn't too bad, it's worth getting when it's on sale (especially since there's a complete edition and no risk of paying overpriced DLC). It's just a pity that they couldn't offer a bigger challenge to the series' veterans.

I'm a long time gamer and there are certain types of games I can't play now. Heroes was always my fall back and I always looked forward to the next series. I'm hoping they'll fix this mess for the next round.

You're basically forced to go from point A to point B. Period. I've tried now with 3 separate races and they're all the same. You get no city to start with and no city to find. You have only a small army. It used to be you can play the game a variety of ways. If you wanted to just go for the quest, you could do that and move on. However, you could also take your time, collect all the various resources lying about (exploring the world), capture the main resources and really build up  a big army to smash your foe. Now, that's impossible. You have to figure out exactly how many men you can spare to finish the quest. It sucks. 

The AI is terrible. The fighting is also choppy and slow. There may be a way to speed it up, but I'm finished trying to figure it out at this point.

In my opinion Might and Magic Heroes VII takes the best mechanics of the heroes games such as skill trees, artifact sets, building decisions, tactic phase at the beginning of combat and more.
I really like that the quick combat that can be played manually if the player is dissatisfied with the result and the magic skills and different factions seem very balanced to me.

I have some issues with the creature design - the creatures look amazing but to me they lacked some love in terms of sound design and abilities. You have to focus more on skilling your hero to come up with interesting strategies since the creatures are mostly just for the purpose of hitting and shooting, no specials. 

The music is gorgeous - you just never get sick of it even after hours of playing, it's enchanting and catchy and makes you enjoy staying in town a little longer, even the enemy's turn is fun when you listen to the music.  The soundscapes are beautiful and the interface sounds are great.

In total I really recommend the game to all people - be it fans of the Might and Magic series or not - it's a good addition to the series and a lot of fun!

If you're a fan of the HoMM series, you need to play this game just so you can see how far the franchise has fallen. It's like going to a funeral: You need to go just so you can gain closure on the fact that your loved one is in fact dead.

If you haven't played any of the Heroes of Might and Magic (its PROPER title) series by now, then don't bother. I loved H3, but that's mostly just nostalgia now. H1 was my true love, with its colorful and silly graphics. But i'm spoiled now by visions and hopes for a better future that never came.

The problem with H7 lies in its bland story, bland setting, poor AI, and lackluster art direction. H6 and H5 had the same problems in different ways. But H7 fails in another significant way: It takes place in the past, before H6! I'm not even going to bother going into detail on this.

By it isn't perfect, I mean the bad:
- The AI isn't great, but at least this time it doesn't cheat like it did in HoMM2 and HoMM3.
- It still crashes. For me, this was around once every 10-20 hours, mostly when ending a campaign and returning to the campaign screen, so I never lost any actual progress.
- There are some weird bugs, like the infamous firewall bug (enemies stay within it instead of leaving it) and some other minor weirdnesses. For me nothing game breaking and (besides the firewall one), I did encounter one once every ten hours.
- You need to login to uplay on the first run, otherwise it won't work. However Uplay never went down when I played it, so again, it is much more stable than it was a couple of year ago.
- The community died in practice. The base game has walkthroughs, but the expansion has none. Not even on the usual places. You are on your own to experiment.

There are other things which it does very well, also the good:
- This is HoMM5 2015 edition in most regards.
- There is a huge, very well balanced campaign. The level design is good, there is a good story arch, it does help you by testing different skills and setups and the skill system is easy to understand and fun to experiment with.
- There are some combinations which are much more useful than they appear to be. The skill system is well balanced.
- There is no ""best"" build for a hero. There are a different approaches working with different situations.
- The AI is somewhat bad, but the campaigns are build with that in mind. There are some levels where I was outnumbered by far by every single enemy stack.
- Also, there is a huge variety of well balanced units. This also mean that there can be small number of entry level creatures you need to skip when you can defeat large packs of champion creatures. This was an usual case for me under the wizard campaign.
-The graphics look great and the interface is easy to use.

And the great:
- The hero build variety is amazing. I ended the last level of the expansion with an economy / diplomacy hero which had a righteousness / leadership combo buffed by positive spells (read: prime magic and fortune) within around six weeks without ever buying a single creature from a city / dwelling, but building up the army on the way relying on constant good morale in the end. On an earlier level, I used defense / fire focusing heroes, just to realize on the last battle that I need to switch to a full offensive approach with melee units to win instead of casting fireballs and having the army look at the fireworks from a distance.
- The armageddon build is working and shining like it did back with Heroes 2. Because clearing out half a level with a couple of elite creatures is fun.
- All the magic schools have game ending builds, and one is not necessary better than the other. You need to adjust your strategy a lot depending on the situation.
- Some of the levels in the campaign are similarly epic as the ending of the Sylvian / Inferno campaign in HoMM5. The expansion is a bit similar on how I remember Armageddon's Blade even on normal difficulty.

4, and 6 have been controversial games in the series as it has really divided fans over the years as with these installments, different ideas were employed that were not viewed so favorably. 

Heroes 7 does fix some of the mistakes that plagued 6 and does feel like more of a classic heroes game, but it does come at a cost and with its own slew of issues. Its incredibly buggy. Sometimes it takes me multiple times just to make it to the loading screen. Quests can break, but that is usually fixed by exiting and restarting the game. And lastly, with few exceptions, there's really a lack of any challenge. The AI is pretty dumb and will usually just lay down while you steam roll over them. I found this especially true when enemies would prefer to just sit there and take it when you have an AOE spell that lasts multiple turns, as opposed to escaping the area.

All that being said, there is a good game here. It feels more like a heroes game than its predecessor, there is a huge amount of content, and the way the campaign plays out is unique, even if I may prefer the traditional way the campaign was told.

It was work to get this game to run at all. The installer doesn't create a working installation, and you are left to Google up the fix yourself, uninstalling some Ubisoft app that the installer just installed with the game and reinstalling it from Ubisoft's preferred download location. But, that, plus a little extra work, merely gets the game to run. Running the game remains an impressively annoying experience.

In single player, roughly once a minute, the game is interrupted by a dialog complaining about server connections. What on earth do we need server connections for in single player?! Extra time spent checking that everything reasonable related to firewalls, etc, is correct, to no avail.

Hours wasted that could have been spent actually playing something else. A few minutes tossed in here to try to save others from wasting their time.

I've played every heroes since 3 and liked them all. This is a heroes game, there's no doubt about it, and as such I am still enjoying it, although there are many poor qualities about this game. Overall it feels unfinished and rough around the edges.

At this stage there are not many bugs, and I've come across none that are game breaking. Crashes do happen but are rare. After 3 full campaigns I've come across only one unfinishable quest due to a crash whenever you complete it - I think this is very bad for a game released so long ago. Still, this was just an optional quest. Ignore it and move on. Some minor UI bugs are common but can easily be ignored.

The AI is indeed very poor and generally the difficulty is rediculously easy even at hardest difficulty. On hard difficulties the opposition strongest heroes spawn with huge armies but after that the resource gathering, town building and army recruiting of the AI is weak. Even at highest difficulty this is a faceroll. I consider this the game's greatest failure. 

Storyline are borderline OK. The writing is significantly worse that previous versions, but I never played Heroes much for the story so I don't care too much.

The system changes regarding skills are OK, I preferred HOMM6 in this regard. I don't begrudge the studio the changes, but I do believe HOMM6's system was better. These changes do not reduce my enjoyment of the game.

Verdict: Not recommended due to poor AI, the rest I can live with. I'm still glad I bought & played it as I am a long time fan, but this is clearly significantly worse quality & finishing than previous versions. For die hard fans who love HOMM still worth a buy, but my recommendation is to wait for a massively reduced price special.

When I first heard of HoMM 7 I was super excited. I followed the website and every piece of news they provided. The artwork for the units is amazing. So I pre-ordered the game and was allowed to beta-test it. I launched it, got to the menu and was disappointed. The menu looked like drawn by a 10 year old. I thought, fine, it's a beta. But the menu didn't change a bit. It looks as if it was from a game from 10 years ago. Also, the entire game looks like strechted to a too high resolution. It appears pixel-ish. It might be a choice of design but after a well polished game like HoMM 6 I just think that can't be.

Gameplay wise I find the added choices of more buildings and resources welcoming. They went back to the old HoMM 5 gameplay with that and a lot of other things. So also for the dreaded skill wheel and spell learning mechanics. While the skill wheel can be set to self chosen, the spells you get from building magic towers are purely random. That's why I can't call HoMM 5 and 7 a strategy game. They are random. Random is not plannable.

Also, they removed my favourite faction again - the Sanctuary. I know a lot of people didn't like HoMM 6 because the game mechanics differ greatly from the previous series. I pity that because now you see the result: the ""same old shit"" with barely to nothing new. HoMM 6 was a great attempt of redesigning the genre. But it seems people like to play the same game over and over and don't care what edition HoMM it is.

If you are a player like me who likes new game mechanics now and then, don't buy the game. If you liked HoMM 5 you should go for it because it's basically the same game (even though the art in 5 was better imho)",1494517867,1494517867,False,16,4,0.494337230920791626,0,True,False,False

Re-started playing with a friend, after a loooong disgust (sadly) caused by all the bugs post-release. Enjoy almost a full game without any bug, crash or ""out of sync"" issues. Then, we saved and restarted the game the next day.... aaaaaand out of sync after 2 turns. And now the game is dead.

Content-wise and gameplay-wise, the game is great. But the rushed release and poor development kills everything.

Update review to patch 1.2.

Behooooold, the mighty patch 1.2 is out!
Brand new and coming right out of Ubisoft's lab, this new patch titled ""Might & Magic Heroes VII: Has Stopped Working"" is the worthy successor of the beloved patch 1.1 ""Out of Sync"" and will delight you with long hours of bugs.

Even better than pre-patch, you won't have to play 15 long turns with your friends to enjoy drowning in ""out of sync"", it now comes right at turn 2 ! And cherry on the cake, you can't go past turn 3 because neutral monster don't play in fights!

Purshase totally worth it. 100% recommend.

First review:

I won't re-write what has been so well written by other reviews, just highlight my opinion and why I don't recommend this game AT THE MOMENT (hopefully, it will get fixed some day...).

From a long-time fan of the HOMM series, the game itself is fine and looks fun enough to play. I bought it with a friend and we have been TRYING to play online together against computers to get used to the game.
The game is so buggy EVERY-FUCKING-WHERE that it's impossible to play. This game is barely beta-level mature, and those lovely people from Ubisoft sell it as a fully developped game.

But a few patches and starting at the right campaign makes a world of difference, and I can honestly say I'm enjoying it now and it's giving me that ""one more turn"" feeling. But even to veterans of the series, I would warn you of starting at one of the advanced campaigns. Go for one of the campaigns sthat starts you at level 1 with no skills and a couple basic creatures. For me, that's the right way to get to learn the game. A few campaigns start you with fully developed heroes, towns, and armies, and you're like... oh... that really feels like you're starting at the end.

Just want to reaffirm for curious parties that this game has not improved one iota. In fact performance has gotten worse. This title is an absolute turd, DO NOT BUY IT, DO NOT BE TEMPTED!

As someone who has a great amount of love for HoMM II, III, and (modded) V, watching Ubisoft run roughshod over this franchise with their soul-sucking touch of death is depressing as all hell. They charge FIFTY DOLLARS for this buggy mess and then release a substandard DLC and charge THIRTY MORE DOLLARS for it?!?! I seriously can't believe this is real, but the truth is...it happened. What an absolute joke.

My disdain for Ubisoft can't go any lower at this point. Ubisoft makes EA look like a bastion of virtue at this point. Shout-out to their god forsaken DRM service Uplay, which makes games an even bigger hassle to play and has no right to exist.

I don't really understand how this game's performance went down the sh!tter. It was slow and clunky at launch, but it didn't take this long to load. This game now takes almost 5 full minutes just to load up through UPlay. It has absolutely nothing to do with my computer, I run any modern open world game on Ultra settings perfectly fine. I didn't want to suffer through their boring campaigns anymore so I tried a custom map. God. Prepare yourself for several more minutes of loading while it generates the map and probably 5x that if you want a subterranean map. I have that stained glass montage burned into my retinas as we speak. By the time the game finally loaded up I had lost all will to play it again. Screw the gameplay, it isn't even worth it.

Ubisoft, please relent. Do the entire HoMM fanbase a HUGE favor and sell the rights of this franchise to someone else. You obviously don't care and have plenty of other IPs to make money from. SELL THE RIGHTS!",1466813066,1492850857,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some have stated that there is an issue with area effect spells where the AI will stupidly wander inside the kill zone longer than necessary.

This does occasionally happen,  but it has not stopped me from enjoying the game,  nor do I find all the campaign missions easy.

Here are my pros and cons:

pros:
Battle mode graphics are excellent.  The skill tree is improved over Heroes 3 and Heroes 5.  For once you have some control over the development of your hero vs the random attribute that some fanboys insist on.  Spells are interesting and varied and there are monsters that will be immune to your attack which makes for good strategy planning.   

They have reduced the ease by which you can bring troops to the front line and heroes will attack undefended towns.  This is a vast improvement over heroes 6,  which essentialy plays like Kings Bounty,  wherein you are really only fighting and advancing a single hero,  who has all your army.  Now you do need to have more than one strong hero to defend your territory.

I am really enjoying the campaign missions for a change.  Some of the maps are quite varied and interesting  and there are some nice twists involved in getting to the next map.  It's far more varied and interesting than Heroes 3-6.  I actually was interested in what was going to happen next.

I did also like the varied monster choices of the 6 races and found their individual quirks entertaining.  There is also some side skills like shouts or rage levels etc.,  that makes planning your heroes skills quite challenging and fun.

cons:
The main player map is OK  and takes some getting used to.  The graphics do not improve from Heroes 6 here except of course when you are inside a town.

Some spells and shouts and abilities are overpowered.  Having a shout that gives all your units a lot of initiative can essentially rapidly annihilate a better equipped opponent,  especially if you have nasty kill spells like chain lightning.   You will often find your entire army destroyed before you even have a first turn in battle mode.  It then becomes an arms race towards increasing your initiave over your enemy.

Against the AI area effect spells can be overpowered.  I used blizzard to good effect here since the AI will not move out of the blizzard region in some cases unless you are within attack distance.

There is a fundamental sameness to the build of all towns and the makeup of their units with the exception of unique quirks for high level units.  Still I hungered for more units or perhaps rare units that can only be acquired under unusual situations.

Overall this is an excellent game that any heroes fan should enjoy.  Unfortunately we have fallen victim to fanboys who insist on only remaking heroes 3,  due to their fond memory of playing it.  I do play heroes 3 on occasion,  but this is a better game.  Yup I will commit that heresy.  It has a much better campaign and more variation than heroes 3 in almost every aspect of the game.

A bit of background:
[list]
[*]I started playing the Heroes series with the first one, at a time when I had to go to an ""internet cafe"" in order to play, because I didn't own a PC. Played and loved it.
[*]Played the second and loved it.
[*]Played the third from highschool all the way through college even after the 4th appeared. I still remember the nights we spent playing hotseat. Played even the ""In the Wake of Gods"" mod
[*]Played the 4th and loved it.
[*]I think I played the 5th, I can't remember anything about it, so I guess it was average.
[*]Played the 6th a bit and I found it not completely bad. I was in the beta, and preorderd it. Then somehow, Ubisoft managed to make it unplayable. Due to a conflict with an Nvidia driver it was unplayable for about half an year for me. Recently picked it up again, and it's playable apart from some performance issues. NOTE: I don't have any performance issues with more recent and more demanding games!
[*]Played the 7th for 2 hours, and just couldn't bear more than that.

So at this point, I don't recommend this game to anyone. I picked it up on a big sale, so it's not much of a financial hit, but I was strongly considering a refund.

Solid mechanics, but a godawful amount of bugs remaining and I've changed my review from recommended to not at all seeing as how the developer announced that they stopped supporting it in October 2016, issues be damned.
1. The might / magic balance is insanely broken on the side of magic (Any character with Chain Lightning will devestate you. It's not a question. This will happen.).
2. I've had heroes just up and vanish mid-map (Not defeated, mind you, just vanish outright. Game still thinks they're present, but they can't be moved or located.)
3. There are monsters just... floating around the map screen sometimes. Way, way up in the air. No reason to be there.
4. The last thing I care to write, but certainly not the last thing wrong is easily the worst thing about this game: The campaign balance is broken to the point of being infuriating. The final map of the expansion is easily the hardest in the series, even when played on easy. I've beaten every single game in the series, most on the hardest difficulty, but the balance is so badly off-kilter, I had to give up.

The exploration and strategy you loved from previous Heroes games has been replaced with frantic running and forced reloads since you couldn't possibly have known what was coming in the map, and encountering it is an automatic failure due to time constraints.

Definetly not a classic and imo not as good as heroes 3 or heroes 5 but still very enjoyable. 

PROS 
+amazing sprite gfx and animations. most of the creatures look great
+some very cool units. not only do they look great but some are great fun to use e.g the Haven Legionaire (protects units around him) & the Swordmaster who has an awesome sweeping attack. There seems to be a new emphasis on units and battles and I like this about it. 
+the music isnt up there with the best in the series but it is in keeping and i like it. some of the battle music is awesome
+leveling up - i actually really didnt like the skill wheel to start of with and wished it was more random. the more ive played the game the more its grown on me however. there are some nice skills in there e.g economy skill allows for two buildings to be built in a day! 

CONS
-could be my grx card but there were accasional glitches with the floor shacking at start of battle. only minor gripe as it only happened a few times
-NO INFERNO i have always loved inferno. i didnt care how weak they were in H3 the units just look so cool. so not having them was a massive dissapointment for me. 
-skills wheel - i also have this as a pro as i do quite like it. however i also feel they went into a little bit too much details with some skills being so situational and unnecesarily complicated. most examples of this are with the faction specific skills.
-an age old heroes problem imo but games can really start to drag on after a while. you will often find you've basically won but in order to do so you need to chase down dozens of weak heros and you cannot get around this or use 'quick combat' to kill them

I mean, I was hesitant about buying this game, seeing the ""mixed reviews"" and all. In the end I am actually glad i went ahead and bought it. It's been lots of fun for me and I am looking forward to finish the game.

For this review, I am only focusing on the campaign.

I just love it over Might and Magic 6 and, I might dare say even 5, as not only it gives you several stories interconnected in an overarching narrative. but the context is just great. Duke Ivan is meditating a deal made by another duke and he summons forth a council of characters (including Anastasia from MM6) he asks for their opinion and each of the councilors proceeds to narrate a story that will enlighten him. There is something cheesey and charming about this. be it the back and forth banter between. It is a great oportunity for world building as well as having different settings for each of the tales.

The gameplay is an improvement from the previous games. While the inferno faction is absent here, the sylvans and academy make a return. The classes are still pretty fun to play and each come with their own particular passive (rather than actve ability) that adds a uniqueness to the faction. Necromancers still revive skeletons and banshees after every combat, making them ""more sustainable"". Elves do more damage the more they hit the same unit in a turn. Haven has this thing for leadership and high morale and so on.

Units are still the same, and in some cases, feels like a callback to previous games, and in a good way. They each have their strengths, weaknesses and upgrades. Each faction can has 2 champion units, one of which you will produce. While I love having dual units choices.

The heroes part is better than previous game. The game features a sort of dial system with about 10 different ability ""trees"" to select of, six of which can be raised up to ""master"" level and three of which can reach ""perfect"" level. Each of those brings in bonuses to certain occasions, such as making a certain spell more effective or allowing warfare units to attack more. Also I am glad they got rid of the pointless morality system of the previous game.

I am however a huge fan of the franchise, for me the random map generator and hot seat functionality make or break whether I buy an edition. I am glad to say H7 has both of these which is why I brought a copy after skipping H6.

The good:
•	A nostalgic blast from the past that has kept it core features that you know and love
•	Units look great in the battles and a lot less ‘cartoon’ like than in H5
•	Building and skill trees are easy to understand and use
•	Single scenario AI seems to be perfectly fine and reasonably challenging
•	Random generated maps are interesting and of a sufficiently large size to allow a decent amount of adventuring before meeting opponents (something H5 lacked)
•	It is still pretty and engaging as it always was
•	Graphics are far better than H5
•	I have not noticed any significant bugs in 23 hours play and it seems perfectly stable for hot seat games.
•	Factions are sufficiently different and the creature designs are very good

The Bad:
•	Not a lot has been added since H3 with some of the better innovative features such as 3D cities and attacking monster stacks being removed.
•	Campaign map graphics are not very modern and take some time to get used to, it helps if you zoom in close though
•	The interface is horribly clunky feeling like something from the mid 90’s not the 21st century 
•	Even when brought on steam you have to Uplay running as well to play the game
•	There is a pointless 3d camera on the campaign map that isn’t necessary and if you do accidently nudge it pretty clumsy to use

So to summarise this version of the game is not breaking new ground but re-treads a tried a tested formula without falling over itself. I will enjoy playing it with my daughter for many hours to come but do get the feeling Ubisoft’s tenure with the franchise seems tired and worn out and hope a more slick and innovative company such as Amplitude (SEGA) get the chance to buy the rights and move it in a new direction (an Endless Legend infusion would do wonders I think).",1484571161,1484571615,True,1,0,0.504662632942199707,0,True,False,False

I hated how they dumbed it down ""for the masses"" in the previous game - by combining all special resources into one type, and by letting you convert any town to your faction, and be able to teleport around all over. 
Heroes VII brought back the 4 special resources, (although they are not the original 4), you can't convert towns (yay), and you can only teleport once to the nearest town.
There were a few stupidly hard moments in the campaign but after restarting the level once or twice, and after adjusting my strategy, i was able to get past them. And that's a good thing for this game - it forces you to rethink what you're doing. 
Everything else is standard Heroes fare. Yes, the campaign is silly, but that's not really why you play these types of games now is it.

- outdated Town Visual, either inside or outside (this was epic back then, when you visit your town with epic background music, I love it. But I think they fail hard on this one)
- outdated GUI (I can't believe my eyes by looking at the GUI. doesn't matter where you are, hero screen inside town, main interface. That kind of art and brownish color..aie..even Heroes of Might & Magic 3 feels better than this or Diablo 2)

At the time of writing this, I only had ~2 hours in the game.

First off, yes. The graphics aren't as good as VI, but the game mechanics are better overall.  They also brought back some factions that were missing since III or IV (can't remember the version that last had Academy)

PROS: 
* Simpler interface, more reminicent of the old versions (read: < HOMMV)
* By far the most intuitive hero leveling system to-date
* They really went back to their roots.  It feels more like a pre-Ubi version of the game

CONS:
* To Be Determined

I know there was caravans in the last release but they do help stop the running around between forts stacking forces, much similar in the new version.

The only negative issue I can point out is the camera angles can be poor on death sequences in the combat play. Too often do I see combat taking play to only be shown a close up of a wall or tree..... please fix that with a map patch guys.

The Mod editor is back and straightforward to use. The random maps feature is my favorite as I tend not to play the main quests. Sadly Ubisoft lock certain graphical options until you have achieved certain quest achievements which, though these things are minor, I feel like I paid for a game that requires me to play what I don't care for in order to get the full functionality.

If I pay for a game then achievements should be optional not mandatory. After all this is not a MMORPG.

Now I run a pretty high end PC with multiple SLI cards and the large maps with dungeon level have a red exclamation point telling me it might crash. This is kind of annoying because it does crash and I suspect this to be due to sloppy memory programming on the part of the developers (an excuse often used when a weakly tested product hits the market) as my system runs some pretty memory heavy graphics applications which don't crash. I used to work as a software developer so trust me I know this.

This game could have been a lot more and sadly because all these software publishers only care about profit they have cut some pretty harsh corners. The graphics are a slight improvement on Heroes VI, but only slight and I mean it. In fact some of the graphics are really poor considering what they could have been. 

Pros. Random map generator.
Cons. Poor memory management
          Much of the same old same old
          Expansion is hardly worth the money
          Requires a powerful PC graphics system which it should not need considering the quality of the graphics.
          The spell, hero and battle graphics are not new but borrowed from HOMM VI which is annoying.

So apart from nerds like myself who have been playing HOMM since version I and will always buy it because we're suckers for it, I cannot recommend this game at its full price. It is worth $9.99 in reality, especially if you consider other games at the $50-60 price point like Skyrim, COD and the like.",1480954627,1480954627,False,77,8,0.730804562568664551,5,True,False,False

-----------------------------------------------
Original review:

I waited long until I decided to buy H7 and the add-on, both due to the amount of bugs reported and due to my negative experience with H6 (which was boring and repetitive, despite the nice graphics).

Well, all I have to say is, H7 after patch 2.0 is definitely worth playing and has the potential to become one of the highlights in the series. The gameplay is diverse, it keeps me coming back for more, the hotseat mode fast and entertaining, and I love the campaign so far. It is also positive that the devs added several single-player scenario maps for free.

Of course the bugs are still noticeable, and the game is technically not well optimized. The most notorious problem is the memory leak: There is a constant and increasing consumption of memory and it does lead to the game becoming slow, game sounds getting distorted, and bugs like the infamous double attack getting more common. The only way to solve this right now is to actually terminate the game, wait 30-50 secs until the bloated RAM usage goes back to normal, and then start it again (rinse and repeat after another 4 hours).

If a few bugs and the above described technical issues do not bother you that much, then I definitely recommend you give the game a try. H7 is slowly becoming my favorite Heroes title. And since I am confident that the devs will fix the remaining bugs (and hopefully add some more content), I rate the game positively and look forward to a 2nd expansion and further improvements.",1472086524,1475695141,False,0,0,0.526712656021118164,2,True,False,False

Edit as of 8th of August, 2016. Please, please DON'T buy this game. The long awaited patch 2.0 didn't fix any of the issues, the multiplayer is still utterly broken. It's unplayable.

UPDATE: 27th September 2016, patch 2.2. The game is still unplayable. Bugs uncovered in the FIRST 15 MINUTES of gameplay so far:

* Some random resources can't be picked up from the ground (Savage Sea)
* First two times I tried to host a game the lobby worked fine, my friend could join. Then afterwards it just didn't work, he couldn't see the game in the server list
* My friend's wolves were standing on top of sentinels (on the same grid!) in combat
* Two hard freezes for my friend on Haven, Savage Sea, position 2. Each time when he fought for the ore mine and each time the computer hard locked and had to be rebooted. ONLY occured on the ore mine fight
* Missing stats: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=771089428 - Very helpful indeed, %stat is a good way to describe it

I was surprised to find that the game was quite entertaining.

Additionally the expansion price is ludicrous at $40, offering only a single faction.

If you're like me and enjoy some hotseat or online multiplayer than maybe have a crack at heroes V or VI before playing this and hope the price drops to something more reasonable in the future.

PROS:

-Nice graphics
-Interesting new building mechanics
-Nice variety of Spells to choose from
-Skill wheel offers some decent replay value
-Some interesting new creatures to see

CONS:

-Overpriced
-Limited number of factions (where have Inferno gone?!)
-Limited number of maps
-Buggy online play
-Issues with memory usage over extended period of time
-Insanely overpriced expansion",1473143152,1473143237,True,7,0,0.537720680236816406,0,True,False,False

I have played roughly about 20+ hours thus far. I have noticed that there are still a few bugs, but they all have been rather negligible. Now onto the actual gameplay, if you have ever played any of the earlier versions of Heroes then you'll have to readjust from the past few releases of Heroes. This one is an attempt to return to the idea that you have to out wit or focus on the objective of the scenario. Otherwise it will be rather hard to get started on trying to get a large army up and steam roll your computer opponent. I say this because most of the CPU heroes are OP to start of each scenario. Meaning that they can easily wipe your entire army out in a matter of a few short turns. Now there is a draw back on the how the CPU player was set up and that is the computer does not  really do much once you defeat the first few OP oppenents because it builds in its town, but alas it does not ever seem to do much with actually buying a building an army afterwards. 
Overall the game is a huge resource hog just as Heroes VI was so I would be wary if you don't have a decent computer to handle the game. Also it is challenging at first and can come with a bit of trial and error (aka aggrivation for some), but once you figure out what to do you can easily overpower the computer and walk around as the army of annihilation over an ignorant CPU player.

Time in game is wrong. Since I own the game on Uplay and since I own the DLC Trial by Fire, Steam time is not counted.

I'm not a Ubisoft fanboy. I don't get paid writing reviews in broken English for games. from no one.

There aren't that much games lately that keeps me interested enough to write about them and recommend them to others, or friends.

Since I'm hooked to Homm VII lately and start loving the game more the more I play I love to share my story about the game, why I like it so much all with respect for all fans who are dissapointed by the game, Ubi or the dev team who created this masterpiece.

Homm III was one of my first games and it was for sure the first game I played night over night on my 15"" CRT screen in 16 bit color with the manual on my desk and the creature card pinned on my wall.
It was amazing to see creatures I only knew from boardgames coming to life on my screen while I was able to hunt for treasure and monsters in a random generated land full with little things to explore.
I still love to play it with the Hota or WOG mod, maybe even will try VCMI one day when it's more stable and I love the HD mod which makes it possible that I can play the game fullscreen in 1680 x 1050 resolution.

I was a fan of Homm IV as well. It was my second Homm game and I think they managed to make an amazing game and story for that time. I did not get back to it after playing some of the campaigns and the lack of RNG was not good for the long livity of the game I think.

Homm V was mixed for me. 3D engines that time did not render detailed graphics. I loved the 2D art in Homm III and IV and V was just a bit too blocky for me. I was not impressed, but together with the later DLC, the improved random map generator and the Homm V 1/2 mod it's a pleasure to come back to that game again.

I don't want to write much about VI. I was not a fan. Game was too streamlined imho, too casual, or better say too cartoony, and I missed the atmosphere and nostalgia from III and IV again. I did not played VI very much even not with the later DLC. But graphics in VI was improved and the UI was very well detailed and nicely done.

I'm a real fan of the series, I own all possible collector's editions, I own some of the games on Steam, GoG and Uplay and already for over 15 years I compare every new released game with Homm III.

Most close to this experience last year was an indie game with the name Thea. That was for the first in many years that a game was so gamers friendly that I fall in love with that game. You can read my review if you like.

At the same time I played Homm III there was a very different game from a different genre I liked very much, but my PC was not capable of running it very well and I was stuck to the editor instead of the game. Unreal was the name. The editor to make your own 3D levels was delivered on CD and frequently updated which I have to download with a simple modem.

Many times I thought as a child how cool would it be if someone will be able to recreate Homm III in the Unreal engine.

The rest is history now because Limbic, the dev team of Homm VII, managed to create the closest Homm III experience available this moment in my favorite 3D engine. That means the game is fully open to MOD, is fully possible to script the hell out of things, is fully capable of importing your own lore etc etc. 

It's also a modern engine, with beautiful graphics if you ar able to run it. I can run it on a mediocore PC with a cheap AMD R7 video card and it runs ok. But not only the full 3D landscape with waterfalls, real dungeons, living trees and many buildings and resources is very charming, atmospheric and nice to look at. Also the Heropedia with all skecthes of units, unit models, stat lists etc is impressive. When you open the lore you see a enormous list of units and when you read bout them you get aware of that was just for one faction. All factions have a very complete list of units. And of course many neutrals, many spells, many skills with a new designed skill wheel and series of artifatcs to search for.

Campaigns happens on a huge map with a different campaign for each faction. Each campaign have 4 - 6 scenarios and there are loads of skirmish missions and scenarios.
All factions are present, over 50 heroes, and you encounter characters from III and IV in your journeys.
Between scenarios and campaign maps you see animations, stills, sketches and it all works very nice together.

Since latest patch you are able to create a simple skirmish map with a random generator from within the game as well. Those maps aren't very impressive in quality yet but the feature is just implemented. Random maps you can create from within the games editor are much better but take some time to generate and apply lightening to them. But when you save them and play them because everything is rendered already they are superfast to play and you have a totally new adventure.

Battles are very diverse but always integrated in some way with the enviroment. The maps are much bigger then the battle maps in previous hero games. The tactical battles also have a much better strategical approach since you can flank your enemies now and have different skills for units to work together as a team. Those buffs can realy make a difference between an impossible game or a cakwalk even in the first few campaign scenarios.

The campaign scenarios themself are fully handcrafted and you see incredinle designed bridges, dungeons, and landscapes with Wizard settlements you have to negotiate for right of passage or just planting suspicious seeds from Orcs in Elfs land. Open the Elven story map for the first time and you sit for your screen with your mouth open for a few moments when you see those details. It's really very nice done.

In short I can recommend this new Heroes game. Not because I think it's a mediocore game for fans only but because it is an amazing game at it's own. I did not play any Multiplayer maps so in this review I did not judge any aspect of that. 

As a single player experience so far I love the game. Limbic is still improving the game. I'm sure the team was a huge fan of the series themselves and they created an great adventure.

Original storyteller from Homm IV was involved to make some lost chapter campaigns and those campaign are integrated in the base game when you buy it. Those maps are great and the stories very good. You can even listen to some returned music tracks. The random map generator is included in the base game as well.
To play as Fortress (Dwarves) you need the Trial by Fire DLC I reviewed yesterday.

I've been playing it since HOMM1 was released (yes I'm that old). When 7 was released and I saw all the negative reviews I thought I'll wait a bit. Turns out I had to wait a year for patch 2.0. I bought it while it was on sale (50% off) which still made me cringe as I was afraid I'm buying a broken game from all the reviews.

However, it turns out the game is marvelous. I'm enjoying the campaign and story thoroughly and I'm not experiencing any issues whatsoever. I don't know what all the fuss is about? With that said, I haven't played or seen the game prior to patch 2.0.

In summary - The good:

+ Adventure map visuals are stunning
+ Careful thought went into the campaign maps and making it fun to play through
+ I enjoy the sometimes cheesy voice acting, reminds me of theatre and the previous games
+ The non-animated cut scenes don't bother me at all. I don't know what all the kids are complaining about. Feels like a story that is being narrated with still illustrations. I guess kids these days don't read anymore?
+ No hand-holding. The game isn't dumbed down. It takes a while to learn and even longer to master on higher difficulties.
+ Spells and hero talent wheels are great.
+ At 50% off a great bargain.

The bad:

- Game doesn't feel optimised. Even though I'm not experiencing any performance issues, my PC sounds like it might take flight as both my CPU and GPU are working extremely hard.
- The towns feel bland. One of the most rewarding things of previous HOMM games were the towns and how they come to life as you build new structures. Here, all the buildings look kind of the same and the animation happens so fast from the 2D selection screen that you sometimes miss what you just built.
- The units themselves are adequately animated but again, their colours and armour seem bland. Take the Seraphs/Celestials for example, they are ANGELS for crying out loud but look like foot soldiers with tiny wings.  Also my favourite factions have always been the Necropolis and Dungeon factions. The creatures themselves are great but their modeling struggles to distinguish them from the crowd (bland).
- Still some balancing issues.
- The opponent heroes' AI is weird sometimes. On occasion their actions are non-sensical but from what I've seen, this is rare. 
- A bit pricy at full price. Especially charging so much for an expansion (haven't bought it yet - will wait for sale).
- During combat, the camera has some angle issues but these are rare.

All in all, it seems like I'm complaining a lot but, for me, the good outweighs the bad by far and I think Limbic has done a good job. I also love the way their developers are directly interacting with the users.

If you're dead set on buying it, I would wait until the expansion comes out in early august. It is supposed to include a lot of fixes and changes for the better.

The AI is dumb as a brick as well. Even the combat AI for neutral enemies...

Once you've spent about 4 hours chasing down enemy heroes with no armies in them on a large map, you'll appreciate how frustrating the AI tactics can be at times as well.

The animations and animation timing - despite going through multiple major revisions - are still barely acceptable.

There are multiple issues tied to adjusting the gameplay speed settings..

For some reason it forces you to stare at a blank screen while enemies fight combats in multiplayer.. (in previous versions you could still look around at the world and examine things, etc.)

After reading all the negative reviews I have to write my own.
Heroes VII gets rid of all those gimmicks from the previous title that we didn't need or want and returns the core features from older games, like more resources. The core gameplay is still mostly the same (you build your town, level up heroes, train troops, conquer enemies and so forth) and hasn't changed for the better or worse.
The units in this game, at least to me, look a lot more interesting and overall better than those of Heroes VI. Nothing still beats Heroes III.
Othervise the visuals have improved slightly and are now up to par with other similar games. However, due to the nature of the 3d environment, it his sometimes harder to distinguish objects in the map and battle screen.
The sound in the game is, well, bad. The units don't really have very unique voices and sound effects like they had in every previous Heroes game. This is also made more clear when you speed up the game; some sounds can no longer be heard and others become unrecognizeable mess. The music, however, is among the best in the series.
The game has its share of bugs. I have encountered nothing game-breaking, but some annoyance may occur, when, for example, an enemy units model suddenly goes underground and you can no longer interact with it until it moves again.
Probably the worst ""feature"" in the game is forcing another layer of DRM, the uplay launcher. Ubisoft, we don't want it, don't force it on us!

TL;DR

Pros: Removed the gimmicks of Heroes VI, added features missing from previous games missing in VI.
Units are interesting once more.
The music and visuals are good.
Retains the feeling of the series.

Cons: Bad sounds.
Bugs
Uplay DRM
AI isn't very bright
It's not Heroes III

All in all, it's a decent addition to the franchise. If you loved Heroes III, don't get your hopes up, no game in the franchise can reach the level of III, II and V. However, if you liked V and hated VI, you might just find this one to your liking.

I'd give it a 6-7/10.

I'm running a pretty high end laptop, plenty of RAM and HDD space, optimised for performance and it is ...slow.  No instantantaneous move option and even at the max 400% my troops move slowly.

The AI?  Well I remember a game called Galactic Civilisations where their idea of ""AI"" was to give the computer around 2 times as many ships as you had and even though their tech level was the ""same"" you'd be killing them at a rate of 5 of yours to one of theirs, so to beat one enemy fleet meant throwing around six of yours at it one after another.  This one is the same.

Easy difficulty, built the army up quite nicely and went over the bridge with around 200 tier 1, 170 tier 2, 120 tier 3, 80 tier 4, 40 tier 5 and 22 tier 6, hero was as high as I could get at the time, level 11.

Ran into the computer...roughly three times as many troops at each tier and the hero was level 25.

Was not exactly a fair fight.

Tried 4 different scenarios and never got more than 2 hours play out of each one before being thrashed and subsequently I've a game that, even on easy difficulty, I've no hope of beating

The community knows what the 7 core factions are: Humans, Elves, Dark Elves, Demons, Wizards, Undead and Orcs so can you please, PLEASE stop releasing piecemeal games. I for one am tired of it. If you want to add others, like Naga glorifying the flowing grace of Shalassa or a return of the dwarves as worshippers of Arkath or even some mysterious new faction who turn to the impetuousness of Ylath in the abscence of the humans then go right ahead. We only ask that you add them as extras, hell even as DLC, I know I'd jump on that like a bunny with hiccups.

HAVING SAID ALL THAT... Credit where it is due, in its current state Heroes VII is a vast improvement over its predecessor and pretty close to to it's far superior ancestors: Heroes III and V (I haven't played IV so apologies to all the fans. Personally my favourite of all time was II)

The game clearly needed more time and/or a better QA team.

There are a lot of bugs which would have been obvious with ANY level of QA. Just a few examples:
- Sometimes buildings which should be clickable just don't respond to your hero. For example a weekly ""tax collector"" says not visited but cannot be clicked. A fort you just captured sometimes cannot be rebuilt for you. In both cases, restarting the game from an autosave makes the buliding clickable on the same day.
- Sometimes your towns will flash that you have a caravan to unload for the rest of the game long after the caravan area was emptied.
- The game froze on me several times. Most were just at the end of a level. Thank God for autosave.
- After freezing, the game continually told me it couldn't authenticate my UPlay account and wouldn't start. The screen that said that had a support link which points to an dead webpage. Double-DRM is no fun, especially when it's not rock-solid. Why do you need to check DRM on a Steam version of a game anyway, especially when I'm going to play in 1-player mode? 
- A few times I updgraded a stack where I only had enough money to upgrade some of the stack. Rather than just refuse to upgrade or just upgrade what I could afford, it upgraded what I could afford and the rest of the stack disappeared. I tried to upgrade 20 Cavalier and it turned into 2 Cuirassier and 18 poofed!

There are also a lot of issues which aren't bugs, but just show they didn't spend enough time with the game:
- The council room has ""Cutscenes"" which are really just camera pans of frozen 3d characters with voiceovers. That might have been expected in the early 90s, but doesn't make sense today. Hand-drawn stills with audio would be better than creepy frozen talking 3d models.
- Somehow the UI was better in HOMM 3 and 4 than 7. The UI should improve over previous games, not make things worse. The buttons to move all armies disappears when it can't move every stack, rather than just being smart enough to combine as many stacks as it can and leave the rest behind. It takes more clicks than it did 20 years ago to go from town to town and build and purchase units. The necromancy screen doesn't even have combine stack buttons. You have to drag your skeletons manually every time.
- The game needed a lot more performance tuning. My laptop can play Overwatch at moderate graphics settings without much problem, but it chugs on this game even after swapping to a low resolution and changing all graphics settings to lowest. The problem gets worse the longer the game is open, suggesting leaks. Even at high settings the graphics aren't good enough to explain why this game would push a computer so hard. Ironically HOMM has always been more of an ""icon"" based game and I would have been happier with worse graphics or psuedo-3d view like the older games than poor 3d graphics if it meant the game ran better.
- Some of the levels needed balancing. In past HOMM's, sometimes you would get slaughtered if you took too long to expand on a level or you pushed into the more difficult areas of a map too early. On several maps in this game I would get slaughtered even just a few weeks in the game, still in the general starting area of the map. Sometimes very high level enemy heroes with huge armies would come out of the fog and kill my low level hero fairly close to my first town. Because you could not have seen them coming, it seemed just luck that you and they didn't move close enough to each other than the other hero would ""aggro"" from the fog.
- Maybe it's just a limitation of using Ubisoft's DRM in conjunction with Steam's system, but the game runs a ""first time installer"" every time I run the game.

Personally I'd like to see Ubisoft give someone else a shot at this series. They've really tarnished it with the last 2 games. If they're going to keep it, I hope they don't make another one unless they're going to spend the time to make a game that runs well, doesn't have many bugs, and doesn't feel like I'm fighting the UI.",1467468557,1467468557,False,17,1,0.611747264862060547,2,True,False,False

1- Yes I got a few crashes here and there but nothing reloading an autosave couldn't fix.
2- Yes there are issues with getting HUGE random maps to work in game, they work fine if you choose a smaller map and the only huge map I did get working was too big and too long anyways (48 hours in and we hadn't met any CPUs or each other yet)
3- People complain about not having Inferno in the game, make it sound like there's no villain anymore but that's because Inferno were banished according to the story -> There's still random inferno Units here and there.
4- Also made it sound like there were only 3 factions left without inferno but there are 6.
5- Factions are really well balanced and have interesting differences that make them play differently rather than undead being the only one that plays differently.
6- I personally didn't like 5, I found that the map view was clogged with too much obstructions and you have to constantly move the camera to see where you're going; this made games a lot longer than they should be -> HoMM7 manages to make really nice maps while keeping the view unobstructed.
7- The random map generator kinda sucks but that's part of being random; you won't see really nice maps if all you play are random ones.
8- Another big complaint is the AI, I'll concede, no the AI isn't all that bright but the game is focused more on the classic gameplay of HoMM1, 2 and 3 where the greatest threat for a good part of the game is simply surviving and successfully defeating random mobs to level-up and grow your army... The AI had always been made kinda meh because it allows for assigning the CPU much more powerful heroes and armies right off the bat so they become a mountain you must climb instead of a constant race like any other Strategy game.

Obviously my experience is vastly differnt from those who have played at launch day or a bit after lauch day.

This game is still addictive as the previous HOMM series and cannot wait unitl more content is implemented. Creature abilities could be more diverse and there were a few bugs and glitches there; nothing gamebreaking for me at least. I fully believe Ubisoft/Limbic are working on tweaking the game and fixing these minor issues. The visuals are nice touch and improvement over HOMM VI as well although alot of units have been reused from the previous game too.

Some of the main story missions were a bit bland (Dark Elves and Griffin) but I loved the scenario missions and The Lost Tales of Axeoth missions as well. I've stayed up some nights trying to figure out how many heroes in the scenario maps will come to a close; beats the voice-acting scripts by alot IMO and gives the player a backstory to some of the history of the characters in the game.

I'm not a diehard fan of HOMM III and V which seem to be the best in the series for alot of fans, but I also appreciate attempts to make the series unique (Flanking mechanics and skill wheel) You know you have been a supporter of a company when you've been by their side during their ups and downs.

I noticed after a while that the AI is dumber than a bag of hammers and unless the campaign puts it on a rail it can't fight its way out of a paper  bag. You might think that the auto-combat would be improved as it gives you the option to manually replay the results, but the trouble is you will always replay the results because the AI is killing your army when it manages the combat. So in the Campaign you'll have a boatload of little battles to fight manually.

The town display didn't work right at all at 1440P the improvements didn't show up half the time and the text references to them either weren't shown or way off the mark. 

Town improvements are expanded, which you might think is nice, but since there's so many you have to carefully pick & choose otherwise you'll have incompatible creature variations & types from different towns, and thats if they are the same town type.

The Skill Wheel suffers from the same expandititis. An actual manual would've been useful since picking skills was like throwing darts. You just don't know how to value some of them.

Finally, possibly the most disappointing is the lackluster graphics. All the maps I played on were dull-looking, and have so much hill-climbing there should be a Mountain Goat skill.

I'm the sort of person who buys games randomly so a lot of games I bought were at least a year since release, and for that reason all the previous fuck-ups were just hearsay and I didn't know how bad it is. Until now. This time I've witnessed your unprofessional abusive irresponsible behaviors first hand from start to finish. 

When I first heard of Shadow Council I thought great I get to see the game in development! Then what do I see? Mistakes after mistakes. First you had the audacity to put Inferno up for a vote with Dungeon, do you know how retarded that is? Now the game is without Inferno and Dungeon is the only villain (barely), do you know how boring that is?

Then you had the gall to use recycled assets, again! You had plenty of time but you just chose not to put in the money and effort. But what bothers me is you keep saying that this is a great comeback, something that resembles H3 and H5. And look at what you have made, what a disgrace.

The artstyle is not worthy of the Heroes name and the townscreens are the most hideous I've ever seen. Also if you don't fix the still 3D figures at the council table, it will be a laughing stock for eternity. Characters talking without animation, only you can make something so stupid like this, Ubi.

Plenty of people were vocal about the right direction the game should take while it was being developed, but you just had to do it the hard way. You have to make your own pizza wheel and change the whole thing after release. Today as of 5/20/2016 you have delayed the patch that's supposed to fix the dumb AI and a bunch of other game-breaking bugs, are you out of your mind? Nearly 1 year after initial release this game still has the dumbest AI on the planet. You do know the current state of the AI completely undermines the very fundamentals of the game right? Have you stopped giving fucks altogether?

Well I have. I saw you terminating the PR stunt (shutting down the SC site) and releasing these half-assed patches. I feel like the goal of these unhelpful patches are here to say that ""we still offer game support"" (no you don't"" instead of solving actual problems.

- Former games allowed you to bond with heroes by building them up from scratch at level 1 through 30 through multiple campaign maps.  Most maps in the campaign scenarios don't continue with the same hero you built up from the last one and the new one they provide you for the 2nd or 3rd map in the scenario is already pre-built and leveled.
- AI is pathetic!  Strong AI heroes will bypass your weak castles, forts, etc.. on their way to their target.
- Combat AI is no better.  At first AI creatures would always move forward automatically right into range of your creatures.  All you had to do was tell your creatures to wait till AI creatures have moved first.  After a recent patch, AI creatures now wait as well, but unfortunately this also includes all ranged AI creatures allowing you always to get your ranged shots off first.
- Battles are ridiculously slow, especialy if you have healing or war units, even when fastest battle options are chosen. 
- There does not seem to be any option to make AI heroes aggressive.  All you can do is alter starting resources, weekly resource gain, or neutral creature growth in order to try to make the game difficult.
- Final campaign map can be completed using a side hero with your main hero and others only required to collect resources!  

After playing all the campaigns from start to finish I can honestly say this game is very repititious, not very challenging, and disappointing.

Even with the negative changes found in M&M VI, at least they included some very interesting ""Boss"" fights during the campignes which would have been nice to see continued in VII.",1462904362,1462904362,False,35,2,0.657115340232849121,0,True,False,False

I have attemtped to come back to this game several times to try and just play through the campains of each faction, and everytime i do, I run into a bug that ruins the game and makes it unplayable. 

The most recent bug, and the final straw, is about halfway through the orc campaign my ranged units would no longer shoot. I attempted to close the game and reload, thinking it was just a glich and that restarting might correct the issue, but of course it did not. Anyone that has played any of the games in the series knows that ranged combat is vitally important and without it, it really makes the game unplayable. 

At this point the only thing I can hope for is that either Ubisoft no longer publishes the Might and Magic series or Limbic Entertainment no longer develops the games for it. Preferably both. Sell it off to someone that will make the game properly!

This is my last time purchasing a Ubisoft title. I have continued to buy into my nostalgia for the series but how can I continue to love something that the people that own and produce it do not put thier own love into making.

1. Graphics: these are definitely more stylized than those in HOMM6 and even 5, which doesn't seem to deter the game from being an agressive GPU and memory hog. After a few minutes I've stopped noticing the ""downgrade"" and rather enjoyed the lack of clutter on the screen and the artwork that the developer DID focus on (town screens and creatures)

2. Cutscenes: after scratching my head for a few minutes I realized characters there were supposed to be inanimate. While I'm somewhat perplexed this decision, I can guess the reason for it has something to do with the absolutely beastly GPU and memory drain that HOMM6 cutscenes sported (it forced me to uprade). Optimization is not the strongest point for this developer, but frankly that shouldn't be an excuse for not even trying.

3. Audio: gorgeous. This installment lives up to its predecessors.

4. Gameplay: Despite the confusing UI layout that might obscure the fact, the character system is basically a souped up HOMM3 clone. It's a good thing. Having started the series with the second game, I was also pleasantly surprized that the 7th had the same faction choices. Paywalled Warlock faction in HOMM6 really rubbed me the wrong way, as did the out of place Weaboo faction. Glad to see that mistake subverted. The game flow is very smooth, UI is not terrible either.

5. Overall impression is positive, I'm not seing any of the bugs that spoiled the game for previous revieweres, so I'd say at this point it's worth picking up the game even if you're  not a hardcore fan of the series.",1459061442,1459061442,True,6,1,0.50834190845489502,0,True,False,False

The character models have good work put into them and are magnificent such as the behemoth of stronghold. There are 6 factions to choose from. You can plunder enemy mines or take over an entire area's buildings by only capturing a solitary fortress. The magic is an indepth system based on the lore surrounding the 7 dragons. You can choose your own branch of skills(who didn't cross their fingers in Heroes 3 and hope for logistics?). 

[h1]Story/Lore:[/h1]
Yes the timeline is different from Heroes 3 because Enroth was destroyed. The survivors had went through portals to a land called Axeoth. It is because New World Computing went bankrupt that development of this new world did not continue. Ubisoft picked up Heroes instead of letting our fan favorite series die and made their own world Ashan with its own history and intrigue. You can see the new history here: http://mightandmagic.wikia.com/wiki/Ashan

321960,21887963,76561198075327801,0,2,9656,0,6304,1556458180,"I started playing the HoMM series since HoMM 2, but fell in love with the series at HoMM 3.

An amazing concept: 

-Build up your town and visually see its progression.
-Building up your army of epic creatures and eventually upgrade them to be even more epic.
-Leveling up your hero (without a lvl cap) to become an unstoppable force, with spells, hero stats that boost your army and  skills that boost your hero/army.
-A wide selection of races to play with ( the lesser known conflux and fortress for exmple), each with unique creatures (thunderbirds, the mighty gorgons, dragon flies, pit lords never forget!) and buildings.
-I can keep going but most people get the idea by now ;)

But with every sequal coming after HoMM 3 they kept ruining the experience in some way or another..

-Heroes 4 was horrible. The creatures, the buildings, the spells, the heroes, the whole map, basically everything looked bland, pale and washed out (the music was ok). 

-Heroes 5 (or in my view the true Heroes 4) was enjoyable. the style was a bit cartoony but overall it was a decent game and thank god the didnt follow up on homm4's system of spells, creatures and buildings.

-Heroes 6.. well all i can say is that heroes 6 was from another planet. They changed so much that it felt like a complete different game (in a bad way). I didnt recognize anything and couldnt relate to the games of old (ill call it the HoMM3 feeling). It was too smooth, too sci-fi... IMO..

-Now the review of the version that matters here: HoMM7 !! (108 hours played so far)

The game has a lot of positive and a bit of negative.

-Looks: heroes on minimap and in combat look amazing, creatures, spells (great effects. Spells feel like your doing something big now), environment (Focus!! your in combat but damn that little streamlet oozing gently throught the landscape looks legit. Or the volcanic landscape where your screen actually shakes because of nearby eruptions.. SICK), basically everything! No negatives there.

-Bugs: to my knowledge and experience non-existent (anymore perhaps?! I didnt play it at release date). 

-gameplay: smooth. Perhaps a little too much, because when i wanted to dig up the grail i was looking for the dig option for a good 10 minutes before i found out its an option in your spellbook... So not a 10/10 here.

-Music and sounds: Maybe a little more soundtracks would make it perfect but overall it sounds nice.  8/10 in my book.

-Towns: you actually have a town view again!! ty! and FU heroes 6.. When you add a building you  can actually see it in your town view. ther is a clear section where you have your hall of heroes (tavern), marketplace, warmachines (blacksmith), caravan overview etc. etc. I like it 8/10

-Multiplayer/hotseat: Very disappointing really. Im talking about the amount of maps available. 10 in total with like only 2-3 large maps. Its just way Way WAY to few maps to choose from. Given theres a map editor but who has the time or will or more importantly the skill to make well thought out maps of his own. I dont have a lot of free time and i just want to play a map instead of create one. I want a map to be a surprise , so that i dont know where everything is located etc.

-Factions/Races whatever..: Too few. This has been an issue with all of the HoMM versions past HoMM3. But this time we dont even have the ""Inferno/Devil/Demon"" faction... WTF I really hope that there will be some new races being added in future patches.

So to conclude my rantings:

Heroes of Might and Magic 7 is a good game. It again gave me a bit of  that feeling i had when i first started playing the HoMM series. If Ubisoft finetunes this game with future patches and additions in terms of maps, campaigns and factions (maybe 2-3 more) this will be a great game instead of a good one.",1458229208,1458229208,True,63,1,0.745457947254180908,2,True,False,False

There are SO MANY things what I'd like to say, but the major truth, why this game is a nightmare and perfectly failed game, are as follows:

1. Broken and messed system
The one of the major problem is the system, i.e., hero, skill wheel, town designs. All of those seems creating via copy and paste and even without any deep considerations. This game's genre is Turn-based Strategy Game, but there is actually NO strategy in this version due to the brainlessly designed skill wheel systems and the specialties for heroes. You would not want to keep playing this game more than once in your life.

2. Bugs, bugs, and bugs!
There are still huge number of bugs after six patches... So... you even would not be able to imagine how many bugs had been before. Actually, this shit game still cannot support multiplayer game since it has been released 6 months ago. Remember that this trash game has been saled in 2016. And they said that there was a technical issues that cause the bugs while playing the multiplayer game... You can easily guess how much poor technical skills the dev team has and so there would be also no hope, I mean, no significant improvements for this game, in the future.

3. 0% of creativity
This game totally copied and pasted from the previous versions of HOMM/MMH series. Sounds, Graphics, Icons, whatever. This means their primary object of saling/releasing this game is to make money without any efforts via deceiving the fans of HOMM/MMH series. DO NOT be taken in by their fake advertisements.

Only played with haven so far, so my knowledge about other fraction aint that great yet, I feel like the units are a bit boring and no real exiting special ability for any of the creatures (Haven without Griffins WTF!!!!) ... same goes for the skillwheel

Havnt tried Multiplayer yet and i have no intention its to time consuming. 

For me this game is a bit of a disappointment and for the 2nd time in a row the heroes series let me down and put out a game that really underpreform",1456440709,1456440709,False,9,0,0.4957599937915802,1,True,False,False

I was disappointed in how badly they messed up one of my favorite franchises. I don't think anyone will dispute that the game was in no shape to be released and shouldn't have been, especially for a AAA price.

With all of that said, this game has some of the most attentive developers I've seen for pretty much any game in the past couple of decades. A team that actually listens to its customers to this day and works quickly to address issues. So much so that I rebought the game.

The game is currently release worthy on the singleplayer side. I've not experienced any crashes and while there are still some bugs here and there, they are more minor and do not heavily impact the enjoyment of the game. And it is the first HOMM game in a while that redefines just enough of the mechanics to feel like a brand new game but at the same time keeps enough of the original to still be a sequel. It's quite simply a lot of fun (in contrast, I couldn't even bring myself to finish the H6 campaigns).  

There are still things to be fixed but the game is currently miles apart from the atrocity at release. Make no mistake, some folks still have problems with the game. I have a reasonable powerful system and have had no technical issues. If you are on the fence because of the reviews and are getting it primarily for singleplayer, I highly recommend it. If you are getting it for multiplayer though, I can't speak to that yet as I haven't had time to try a game (it does connect a lot better than when it came out though.)


Update: (2/21/2016) At this point, I think it's fair to say the community has given the dev team a lot of chances. They continue to be responsive and they continue to try to fix things. However, it seems each patch takes longer and ends up making the game more buggy. I don't understand how they can spend weeks testing a patch to release it with ""no problems"" only to have the community run into some very obvious problems in less than an hour (some of them you literally have to be blind not to see and are universal to all, not hardware dependant.) I am changing this review back to negative. The $60 I spent rebuying the game I will consider a loss. At this point, I don't even care anymore. I've wasted too much time on a game that might work each time a patch comes out only to be disappointed. I won't fault the dev team for not trying but I do fault them for being some of the most incompetent devs I've ever seen. Given they keep digging the hole deeper with each patch, I seriously doubt this game will ever see the day where it runs perfectly.

Generally you will like this game if you like its predecessors. The main concepts stay the same with very little changes.
As I like these concepts and as I think everybody who's interested in this game knows them as well, I just point out what I didn't like about the game:

[list][*]All in all it was a little too easy. While I have played most of the HoMM games and other TBS (e. g. Age of Wonders), I wouldn't claim myself to be an expert. I played on normal difficulty and just followed the general strategy of focussing on leveling up a single hero on each map fighting with him only, until the level cap is reached. Then I would level up the next hero. And before finishing a map, I always tried to visit every building that increases stats with each hero.
During all of the campaign, I had 2-3 tough battles. The rest was quite easy.

[*]Somehow the battles got repetitive quickly. I don't know if there are more neutral enemy armies in this game than in its predecessors or if the tactial possibilities are more limited but I often had a couple of battles in a row that played completely the same. That most likely is connected to the game being too easy.

[*]That may as well be connected to the spell ""Summon Elementals"" being too powerful. If you have this spell with a decent mage, you'll blast all enemy armies especially in the beginning of a map when they're still small. 

[*]The wizards campaign starts with a beautiful map with two memorable heroes. Unfortunatley the next two maps are played with different heroes that are only loosely conncted. While the stories where nice as well (Arabian Nights atmosphere) I would have liked it much better if you more or less played with the same heroes through the campaign.

[*]When one of your buildings gets attacked with no hero defending it, you can't do a quick battle or surrender in the tactical combat map. You're forced to (auto)play the battle. That's unnerving when you'll loose the battle anyway.

[*]I played through the campaign with version 1.6. While there were some minor bugs, there was only one really unnerving one: artefact exchang on heroes is totally bugged, making it impossible to distribute artefacts as you wish. You may even loose items permanently. That a bug like this slipped QA is pathetic. I more than once considered stopping and uninstalling the game because of this.[/list]

On my personal fun scale, I gave it a 7,5/10, so for me it wasn't as good as Age of Wonders III (8/10).",1455568912,1455569067,True,20,1,0.596639335155487061,0,True,False,False

I feel they really made some good choices with a 3 style combat/hero system combined with caravans. The only reason this game is not doing well seems to be failures on the technical side which is a shame... The tech side is suppose to be the easy part. I really think they over did the graphics for a turn based game. Just make them crisp and fast. Would like a new caravan graphic that actually looks like a caravan and not just a hero's horse. The ledges don't have to be so steep with such crazy camera angles. Also story line seems to be lacking originality, everytime I read a different factions storyline I'm reminded of some mainstream movie or book series from the last 20 years. Still think the creatures and towns in 3 are cooler; really not a fan of the sylvan theme. They should think about marketing this series towards tablets. I can't think of any reason why this wouldn't make a great tablet game if done correctly. Plus the graphics level and player expectations would be more on point for the series.

+ Hero's act seperate from creature stacks as in H3.
+ Siege and other support devices like in H3 but more unique; better than H3.
+ Castles have towers and more; better than H3.
+ Creatures need hero to travel but hero no longer needs at least 1 creature; better than H3.
+ Graphics are the best of any Heros.
+ Long campain with depth.
+ Retained Hotseat.
+ Caravans and Forts included.

- Graphics, battle scense, and inventory are glitchy.
- Caravans look like a horse; could be more unique.
- Campain characters faces don't move when talking (little creepy).
- Story is not original.
- Faction names and creature choices are a little lame. Factions not as cool as Hero's 3 or even 2 for that matter.

I like the new skill wheel.  The availability of each skill slice being only available to certain types of heroes adds a bit more uniqueness than the the skill tree of HOMM6.  They are still not super diversified, but enough to give the heros a different flavor.  I felt alot of the HOMM6 heroes were carbon copies of each other. 
The castles and their units are a bit modified as well, though certain staples remain.  
I thought I would find the built-in 'tactics' phase at the beginning of every combat annoying but I kind of like it now.
I am enjoying the gameplay (almost done playing through the campaigns at the time I type this), the graphics, the music and basically the whole package.

The game itself was excellent, great visuals, the use of the 3D map was very well done. The storylines, for me personally, were engaging and entertaining, and the combat was well-balanced and very enjoyable the way the new systems worked. 

I enjoyed the music, I enjoyed each campaign (passed each), and was overall very impressed with the changes to the way the town systems work, loved the way capturing a city would automatically grant you control of all mines and dwellings within its sphere of influence, and also really liked the way that hero skill points were distributed.

I dunno, for my money, this was more than worth it. Some are complaining about the lack of cinematics... who cares?

I mostly enjoy the gameplay and the campaign is a nice story. The gameplay and the battles are what we know about HOMM, so no complaining about that. 
Graphics are in my opinion good, the sound too. So i like the game

There are a few little things which I think it could better.

1) The game doesn't remember the game settings, for example I disable the introduction of the enemy at the start of a battle, but everytime I start my game again I need to disable it again.

2) Because of the level cap, in my opinion are many skills according to their skillwheel from the heroes you have or can hire wrong assigned. For exaple in the stronghold campaign you get Imani. She needs Bloodrage, Defence and Warfare for her full Chieftain capacity. But pre assigned are Bloodrage, Defence, Diplomacy and Explorer. 

3) After played the campaign and like to do a skirmish map you can't hire/start the heroes you like. Danan (mystic Sylvan) Zenda and Anastasya (necropolis) are unavailable.

HoMM VII is actually very good and to me the worthy successor of HoMM IV and III. Have now 70+ hours logged and have only experienced one minor bug and that is sharing artifacts between heroes if one hero have more then 2 rows of stuff the artifacts gets mixed up. Apart from that it is great playing the game and I recommend it to all old and new players.

What needs work is the editor which is very buggy, at least for me. Constant crashes when trying to create maps makes it very frustrating.

-the optional skill wheel for planning ahead

-the faction-specific ability to make every faction play completely differently, 

-the choice between champion units to make the same faction play differently between different players

-the 5 creature levels I think is an ideal number (each faction has a strong core and elite unit that is essentially its own level, so you have 2 core, 1 core+, 2 elite, 1 elite+ and 1 champion for a total of 5 levels) as the 3 levels of heroes VI were too little variety, but the 7 levels of Heroes III made the move from 1 level to another feel almost nonexistent, with level 3 often being better than level 4 (Rampart, Castle, Inferno) and level 5 better than 6 (Stronghold, Fortress, arguably Dungeon) 

- the town building options are very varied between factions, as opposed to the carbon copy it was until now with 1 or 2 special buildings but otherwise extremely similar. Now depending on your faction different structures lead to different things and there are a bunch of special structures per faction with choice structures as well.

Best gameplay of all Heroes games thanks to Gouvenorsystem, Skillwheel, huge differences between Factions (unlike HOMM VI where they all played nearly the same) lots of individual skill and playstyles for the Heroes, choices in Townbuilding for more situational playing.

Poor Release, and fucking of the Community from the Start. But nowadays its patched and I have no more bugs.
Poor graphics, but to be honest I never played Heroes for good graphics so it doesn't realy matter.

This make you want to level up and to get more and more spells and skills. This also is with the artifacts you will find. The music and the sounds are also very beautiful. Also during the fights. This is so much better then in Heroes 6. Also the music in the castles are very nice and beautiful. 

The controls feels as usual and more of that. The different options you have are very very good. Ai speed, adventure speed, combat speed, camerea scroll speed etc. II really like the option to slide the fight movie cam from 0 till 100. So you can choice how much you want to have a cutscene form your fight. Overall, I am very very pleased that I have bought this game. The game is top and has already gave me al lot of gameplay fun with beautiful graphics, sounds and music",1451142221,1451297778,True,5,2,0.516096591949462891,1,True,False,False

I have played heroes of M&M since the first one.  At least in VI the animations were cool, the combat was much closer up to the characters and the battlefield, the skills were better... even though it had a bunch of issues too, not enough factions, the monsters were not really correct etc.  I completely wasted $60 on this.  Its made me so incredibly angry I can't even express it.

Ubisoft is imo, one of the 3 top worst game companies in the world for game quality and support.

I bought heroes 7 deluxe edition a few days ago at the Wintersale and i absolutly dont regret it. Yes, i played the beta 2, which was amazingly bad in the sense it was almost unplayable (windows 10 i have). So i didnt buy it at launch.
My game patch 1.6 runs fine, no bugs whatsoever. As far i see it all the negative for singleplayer is gone.
The in game graphics are in my opnion very very nice. True, lots of units of heroes 6 are the same, but the artwork on the units, townscreen and map is great. The cutscenes graphics in the campaigns are maby not up to date, but then this game is not about the latest graphics technology. Go play the Witcher 3 if you want that.

The gameplay is very nice too. Better than AoW 3? I think so. AoW 3 is like running around with the Magnificent 7. Units are more like sidekicks.

In the old days i have hat so much fun with multilplay H3. It ended for me when i realized it was so easy to cheat.
You could beat a pack of dragons with one pikeman.
I didnt try multiplay in H7 yet. But i have good hopes Ubisoft wil sort i out.

H7 is a wonderfull game. The team who made it did a great job.

Note: This review addresses only the campaign aspects of the game. I have not touched multiplayer.

The Good:
-The bare bones HOMM series mechanics are there and, for the most part, work.
-The addition of flanking is an interesting change.
-Fortifications are a nice idea.
-The AI is very fast and the game responds well to input.

The Meh:
-Graphics are decent but not a visible improvement over the previous instalment. 
-The fact that they reused a lot of the HOMM6 textures is a bit off-putting.
-The slide show ""cutscenes"" feel cheap. 
-The dialogue is bland and cringeworthy but this has been the case with HOMM since HOMM4. 
-The spell book looks very cheap but the spell animations look decent.
-Hero customization and itemization feels inferior to previous instalments. The items and skills feel like they don't have as much impact as in previous games.
-Castle screens are still a mess. Not as bad as the Lego pieces in HOMM6 but nowhere near the beauty of HOMM5 animation.
-The tooltips and GUI feel very cheap and intrusive.

Most of these are minor complaints, but it's exactly because they are so minor and easily rectifiable that they are so frustrating for me. It feels like the devs are investing the bare minimum of effort to check off different features which in previous games added a lot of value. 

The Bad:
Most egregious: the game crashes during Necropolis mission 4 (after the second dialogue with Zenda). I can't even finish the second campaign. It's possible that this is an issue with my configuration (Radeon R9 290 GPU + i5 3570K CPU; Win7 64bit) however, it's the first time I've encountered something like this in what I thought was supposed to be an AAA release.

After completing the Haven campaign + the first 3 missions of Necropolis here's what I can tell you about the actual gameplay problems:

Several in-game bugs:
-Moving artifacts around sometimes causes them to disappear or behave erratically.
-Several creature abilities do not work properly (Marksman's ""Piercing Shot"" doesn't actually affect the tiles it's showing).
-Some campaign mission events aren't very well scripted. For example: you can ""break"" the scripted Necropolis Mission 3 ending by recalling to one of your castles. 

The AI is borderline retarded in a lot of aspects. In most previous HOMM games, even on normal, the AI knows not to move their melee units into the player’s melee unit range during the first turn. In this one, they just mindlessly rush you, always moving as close to you as possible. In previous installments the AI knew not to suicide their heroes into fights they have 0% chance of winning (I've had the AI run heroes with a few core creatures into my fortified castle with 5 champions + several Elites).

Conclusion: even if you ignore the game breaking bugs you are still buying a mediocre product. If you take into account the blatantly broken aspects of the game this is a downright terrible investment. First HOMM purchase I genuinely regret, even with the winter sale discount. This will be the last game in the series that I purchase.",1451166098,1451166098,False,7,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I was initially put off by the negative reviews, but as they were mostly due to bugs related to the initial releaser, I waited a few months before purchasing.

This is my initial experience:
My experience with patch 1.6 has not seen the recurrent crashes and game ending bugs. I am almost done with the first campaign and the game has been stable. There are a few improvements over the past iteration, such as being able to easily set up caravans to ferry troops from one city to another, as well as a well thought out ability tree - at least for the Haven general abilities. Haven't had much opportunity to use spells, but I'm having a blast of a time.

All I can say is that if you have been putting off getting HOMM7 because of the bugs, I think this is not a bad time to get in. I would positively recommend this game if you love any of the previous HOMM iterations. It is feeling better than HOMM4, slightly less engaging than 5, and I prefer the graphics over 6, even though the lips don't move!

Yes... It can and it is. 
- Ubisoft wasn't even interesting in making good intro!
- briefing before campaigns is pathetic... I was always using it as part that puts me into mood, helps visualizing world around... This ""something"" that Ubisoft made was annoying from first 10 seconds!
- I have no problem with epilepsy by constant animations of vortex before every fight almost made me puke
- Hero leveling and skill system is... weird. Hero card looks like project dropped from developement
- You liked admiring details of units on the info screen? Now you can forget about it

In depth-analysis 

   This game is not a heroes of might and magic game. If not this one just takes the papers and everything ""Heroes of might and magic"" and wipes its ass with it because why the fuck not? To be honest they did a fucking terrible job with this, it's pretty bad if Heroes of might and magic 6 is better than this bug infested crazy piece of shit. Let's see why.

Graphics:

    Alright, alright I know ""Graphics aren't everything!"" But look at what I said back in the beginning paragraph below the starting sentence. ""it's pretty bad if Heroes of might and magic 6 is better"". This also includes; guess what? If you guessed graphics you are correct (why else would there be an answer other than the topic which is literally graphics). Now let's look at this. Oh god, I can't believe this. They reused the units textures and meshes from heroes of might and magic 6???? For what looks to be Haven and the Inferno? (I'll talk about inferno later) Oh and what's this? they don't look as detailed! WHAT THE FUCK all the creatures in the game aren't as detailed as the ones in the game ""Heroes of might and magic 6"" hell even the terrain in ""Heroes of might magic 6"" was better. The town screens were better in 6 and the building screen looks less like an orgy in 6. It's just the artists were lazy, otherwise they would have tried harder not to make the golems looks like the golden army in Hell Boy -.- ( I could explore more into this but I am to lazy look into other reviews)

Game-play:

   Alright, I'll have to admit the game-play is rewarding BUT not FUN. I say rewarding is because you can try to manage to put up with impossible odds and feel this warm sensation of achievement. It's not fun because you'll be screaming at your screen telling the game to ""Fuck off"" ""You can suck DICK"" ""ETC"": for deleting your spells, saves, your sanity, even your love and devotion for the series/franchise. But, the main game-play after you whip everyone's asses calms down to a slow and steady halt... BEFORE IT SAYS NOPE AND JUST RAMS AN ARMY THAT IS BIGGER THAN YOURS UP THE FUCKING ASS ( This song EXACTLY displays what the game is saying to you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPGa6vzfvqk ). Then there's the most horrible problem this game has. They have glitches. These glitches don't care; they will ram their dicks so far down your throat you will cry and quit the game (Trust me I lost my sanity from this game.) These are so game breaking you can't even complete the whole fucking campaign! An example of this was when I was playing my wizards all innocent only to go to the 3rd map to discover that yellow jerk-off yanky bastard of a mother fucker sitting there on this one linear path that I NEED TO PASS. The glitches in a short sentence is: The glitches will ruin everything for you in the game. Now remember, that one sentence you love (I hope) ""it's pretty bad if Heroes of might and magic 6 is better"". In fact that game you could do the following: own dynasty equipment, convert towns and forts, play a game that is less bug ridden, have pets that do things for you, actually have story, but most important have good solid game-play not fantastic nor bad but solid. Actually incorporate a difficulty to the game than just spamming armies of the thousands.  Here's the simple solution to fix the game-play problems... alright your ready? Are you sure? Okay, okay just stop screaming at me. Just play Fallout (any fallout).

Story and lore:

   Okay, I don't give a fuck but if you get rid of my demons I will flip the fuck out with my shit. I mean really? How hard did they have to masturbate to have the idea of getting rid of a core faction to the franchise??? (I told you I would talk about this but NOOO you didn't believe me. Right, back on topic.)  and the story oh god, (also spoilers!) I can't complete the stupid academy campaign (Refer to the paragraph above) and I flat out abandoned it. I don't get the advisors though; in all of my 100+ hours of game-play I have only found ONE advisor incorporated to the escapades of a hero only to disappear the next map which is dungeon. Then there's the Academy where (So far) it's story is so tangled with all of these characters that are introduced out of nowhere you're lost (Well I lost interest in the second mission) like Masfar the old fuck and then the gay lesbian duo in the first map to the good hearted prince who destroys his hard work in the end to kill some 500+ Shantri titans that appear out of fucking nowhere then you have to travel into this portal to get this flower that somehow ends up in your possession even if the first map hero still has it only to follow a really narrow path, oh and that's as far as I got before that yellow yanky bastard got there. Then there's the Orc story which I could NOT give a single solid shit about but so far that's the story that I find has a good story in it (mind you I haven't finished Haven nor the Necropolis campaign.). Then there's the weak ass pansy elves who I couldn't give a flying shit even if you offered me a million dolla... okay maybe not then even if you offer me thousands I would not care and I wouldn't waste my life on that shitty ""Oh I'm a pirate and I am going to help these random ass elves that I JUST MET even if that means I will die to escape this job of being a ship captain which is much easier than helping a bunch of fools. Before being offered a choice in the end to become a captain or a tree hugging hippy."" Need I explain more?

Lastly, Overall:

   Over all I am so disappointed with this game I need to visit the old great games like heroes of might and magic 3 and 5 to try to regain and go back to my love for this franchise and to hopefully regain back my sanity from this egregious piece of shit, bug ridden, fake heroes of might and magic game. So in the end I am giving it a 3/10 because it has some value and not a lot of value, I deducted points partly from the fucking glitches oh the horror, OH THE HORROR! Now a recap: the stories are shit, the game-play is kind of shit, the graphics are shit, the inferno being removed is shit (Seriously I can't get over that), the building mechanics are shit, the graphics are shit, the Orcs are shit, the elves are shit, the academy is shit for being to overpowered, the elves are definitely shit, Haven is meh, Necropolis is meh, the custom single player games are shit, Uplay temporarily down is shit, Uplay is shit for releasing so many buggy games lately, etc.

Individual scores
Story - 1/10 --- [See update below. Originally 3/10]
Game-play - 2/10
Graphics - 4/10 ( I mean they aren't that bad to me at least could have been better than heroes of might and magic 6)

Update: Just played the Haven campaign don't know how I persuaded myself but I did, the campaign sucks so much! *BOOM* meaningless map with meaningless character once again! Magic Demon out nowhere (Incorporate my demons already! You already did so. Like shia labeouf said ""Just do it!"" [Told you I was not letting that go.])  Oh! Wait your dad's a bloodsmith? Don't care, and now he's facing the armada when they could've sent the strongest force to avoid loses, we're so edgy declaring war on the GRYPHON EMPIRE that is fucking 10X stronger than your weak ass force. What's the point of these stories if everything is hundreds of years in the past? Lastly, why? Just... why? Making herose worse are you serious? Changing the God-send ability of full range to just a measly 3+ damage to range damage just why? That's going to far with ""Balancing issues"" Your balancing has now completly destroyed the way the campaign plays. God, these people spent all of their funds on P0RN and not the game itself.

Now known as, I guess, ""Might & Magic (trademark) Heroes (trademark)"" (sigh). If you are new to this franchise...stop reading right now and go download Heroes 3 complete for a few bucks on gog. 

Anyways, I sort of recommend Heroes 7, at least to fans of 5. I had an okay time. Thumbs up for not being Heroes 6!

Heroes 2 was the first game I ever really loved as a kid. I have more hours in Heroes 3 than any other game ever. I didn't care for the direction of 4, I thought 5 was pretty enjoyable, and 6 is DEAD to me.  Heroes 7 is very reminiscent of 5.  It is a step back in the right direction for this franchise, I think, but by no means a classic, and I will be back to playing 3 soon. 

PROS:
*Talent trees have some pretty nifty abilities and actually seem to matter again
*Beautiful home castle screens
*Multiple kinds of resources 
*Return to more ""old school"" factions from V
*Interesting flanking tactics added
*Uplay still lurks in the background and I get spammed with game ads everytime I close the game, but the horrid separate Uplay login from VI is gone

CONS:
*Buggy and crashes (10/17/2015)
*Not very many single player scenarios outside of the campaigns (woo DLC?)
* I love the campaigns in the older games in part because I can level up a few carefully-selected heroes from scratch into my own customized squad of killing machines over multiple scenarios. In Heroes 7, I keep on getting handed new pre-leveled heroes in each scenario that I don't particulalry care about. 
*I really didn't know it was possible to ragequit Heroes. I don't know who thought it would be a good idea to add so many ""find this secret without any hints!"" and ""have two heroes step on all of these switches at the same time without any hints!"" gimmicks to a turn-based, time/day-based campaign...WITH a time limit...but...stop it.

Don't misunderstand me, the game isn't that bad, but it's not that good either.
First of all, this is not Heroes of Might & Magic. It is Heroes of MIGHT & magic. Magic is not very useful, except at the game beginning where it decides the battle. Once you reach mid-game, your best spells are these that alter inititiave or movement, the spell that conjures elemental and a few troop enhancing spells. Anything else is mostly useless. And unlike other editions (I did not play 6 however), I have never been mana starved. 

Combat is too deadly, and hardly lasts more than 3 rounds. Usually, it is over at the end of the first or somewhere during the second round. This explains in part why magic is no that important: you cast one, at most two spells in one combat!

The game is unstable and may crash. I have identified an artifact that causes the game to crash as soon as I enter combat. Too bad, it was a good one! Since you have autosave at the end of every turn, you can live with such bugs. 

Much can also be said about heroes skills. Some are very poor, such as the exploration tree (1 skill point for 1 movement point is a poor trade off!), and some are just too good to pass over (the parangon tree if you get it.) Since you have only 30 levels, you will very often end up with the same skills. Too bad.

I've yet to finish the campaign. It was not too bad, until I got stuck in the land of dreams (mage campaign); I'm possibly too dumb, but moving around doesn't open the next passage at some point. So that finishes this campaign. But it looks like a bug. (Edit: I restarted from before entering the land of dreams and it did work.)

Also, I'm still missing Heroes 3 graphics. They were clear and looked like fairy land. These graphics are 3D (yeah, that's trendy!), but the game doesn't need that and it tends to obscure places in the land; you don't know if you can pass through or if there is a treasure etc... until you try. And in many cases, you have a hard time distinguishing a pile of material or an important land marker from the surroundings.

Overall the game is not unpleasant.
It's just not great, with many little things that should have been seen and corrected.

Edit: One more reason to be warry; today, I discovered that my most recent saves are bugged, and loading the last uncorrupted one makes me lose 2h of game. Or so I thought. This happened again after this, so I'll have to end the campaign crippled or run around the map losing time to recover my spells. Amusingly, my skills are scrambled too: some are lost... nothing to do about that! This latest discovery doesn't plead in favor of the game!

Edit2: This last bug is getting more and more ennoying and it cripples about one game out of three. I'd recommend not to buy the game as long as it is not solved: regularly having to reload old saves, having to make check points (which you load to know if the save is correct) is just plain unacceptable and removes much of the game fun. Many other less apparent bugs spoil the game; for example, I noticed that mage's towers don't shoot when sieged; necromancers get so many skelettons from the middle of the game that it looks like a bug; I could name others... Clearly, even though the game will let you get some good time if you like the genre, the editor definitely doesn't respect the customer. And aout the editor, I did not mention that you will have Uplay running in the background, and unlike Steam, it is a pile of s..t; it may send you pop ups every thirty seconds should you lose your internet connection, and it may even crash your game...",1447871071,1449091874,False,17,1,0.566840827465057373,0,True,False,False

This is NOT acceptable, especially when asking 50 dollars for a rushed beta advertised as a ""complete game"".
After two months, the game is playable, at least in single-player, but it's still filled with bugs, even big ones. For example, my heroes tend to lose ALL THEIR SKILLS after a save/reload or when going from one map to another in the same campaign. This bug defies the very meaning of the game, which is to build and improve our hero(es) over time.

Apart from the bugs, the game itself feels bland and uninspired. My favorite heroes titles are II, III and V, and this chapter just doesn't feel the same. It looks more like a cheap copy of those great titles.
If you are new to series, I suggest you avoid this title. Here on Steam you can get Heroes V: Tribes of the East and Heroes III, which are still *amazing* games. 

I've bought the game during Fall sales, and I'm still wondering if -35% was cheap enough for this title. You may want to wait for a bigger sale, because Heroes VII will probably leave you disappointed in many ways.",1449065291,1449065291,False,33,1,0.63843458890914917,0,True,False,False

Most of the bugs are fixed and the game gets nicer but...

The intro still sucks (Static video with some talking explaining the story, WHAT STORY???)
The ingame ""actors"" giving their voices during the story are how can i say it? Not actors?? My friends are not actors but they could have done it better, much much better in reading a small role.

Remember the tears of Asha?  It used to be avalaible on all maps in heroes V. Now only 1 or two maps have it in this game and you win as soon as you build it. What is the point of having boons attached to building it if you automatically win when you do???

Lots of minor issues.

-Lack of good sound design does the game a disservice. The sound pitch increases with an increase in animation speed (wtf?) 
-Some of the combat animations stall the gameplay sequences unnecessarily
-Not a core multiplayer game, playing against the AI provides no challenge, and the RPG element is not enjoyable, so then what is the game really about in the long term? Building and battling larmies, conquest, and strategy. But, I don't really feel the execution of it stood out.
-Story focuses on individual characters and lacks a grander scheme, big picture, or struggle
-RPG elements in the campaign are silly
-Annoying small bugs and issues here and there
-Lack of content outside the campaign (little maps)
-Maps seem overly complex to make, which is a good thing for the breadth of things that can be done, but prevented the quantity of good maps made by developers, and players alike.

While this game does have several interesting features (i enjoy the new leveling system for example), the game is, for the most part, quite broken.  Though the dev team is working constantly and pumping out patches fairly quickly, the multiplayer is still broken after 5 major updates (each of which somehow manages to be a whopping 2 GB).  

I am unable to play a LAN game without the game going out of sync.  Sometimes this take a week or two, sometimes I can't even make it through a single turn.  It is the most infuriating game that I have played in quite some time, and I wish that I could still get my money back for it.  The campaigns are truly awful, there is no random map generator, and only 9 maps to play on (for skirmishes or multiplayer) and 7 extra scenarios.  The ""movies"" in game are only slightly moving 2d stills, and the 3d town interface is gone, going back to a town interface almost identical to the one used in HOMM3.  

And for all of this, the game uses a ridiculous amount of system resources for what is given to us.  In short this will most likely be the last game that I purchase from Ubitrash.  Good job guys! You've lost another customer!  

Should the game ever make it to an actual usable state, I will revisit this review.  Until then, I cannot recommend it to ANYONE.

Thats the main reason why i stopped playing Heroes 7. In every Game for me WORKING Multiplayer is a MUST.  Because after I played a time against the AI, which is by the way shocking stupid in heroes 7, i get bored. No new strategy, no human thinking i'll never play a strategy game against an AI for long.

Every Heroes i played from Heroes 3 (i played heroes 2 Multi too but only Hotseat) had a working multiplayer.

And at the top of that if you made a savegame, at a point where the Game was not OUT OF SNYC, well that was useless. Because the Game CORRUPTED the SAVEGAMES from before as well.

I NEVER encountered a game in the HISTORY of GAMEPLAY that allowed the program to TOUCH AND CHANGE your SAVEGAMES. Because a SVEGAME IS SUPPOUSED TO BE SAAVVEE!

I Buyed the Geme for me and my girlfriend and and was looking forward to the release. I rusheed home from work after i started downloading the game before work and started playing. And what a dissapointment. After 4 hours of screwing around I came to the conclusion that the game was not playable in multiplayer. 

They announced a big patch and after the patch release (over 1.5 GB) i hoped they fixed it but it still didn't work. 


One more Thing: the convertion of Cities that worked perfectly in heroes 6 was not implimented in heroes 7. 

Now let me tell you one thing, fans of cities non convertable:
If you ar playing Academy and your Human opponent plays Sylvanas. You conquer 2 Cities one is Dungeon and one is Nekromacer.

Your Opponent conquers the other 2 and both are sylvanas. He stack all his creatures and you don't. How can you still win that game when your human opponent has 3 times the ammount of creaturens on a stack??? At least it should be an option at map settings before you start, so if anybody doesn't like that, it can be disabled.

Converting Cities was Progress. And they removed it and replaced it throug errors out of sync and by the way where are the dwarfs, my favorite from Heroes 5. Of course it just happened there were no programmers left to work on them, they were too busy programming errors and removing progress.

I would like to say that i never was that dissiapointed by a game. But honestly i have to admitt i was: Rome 2 total war was quite the same dissapointment.",1447927219,1448410049,False,17,2,0.520204722881317139,0,True,False,False

Why didnt they wait a bit to release directly a good game at launch? The abysmal critics at launch almost made me pass this.
I can't really comment about global balance, I'm still playing the campaign, but so far I like the factions that I played.

I am very glad I ignored the bad reviews, this is going to last me a long time.

Edit (addition): patches are released on a frequent basis, and the game feels actually very stable. Balance is pretty good, although there are still two factions which I have not played.

What I like is that the spirit of the best HOMM games is back: the game is not linear. You have to plan each day of the week, assemble carefuly your teams, change hero depending on the next fight, etc.

It might have been the expectations I had for the game following HOMM VI, but I've been enjoying the game more than I thought I would. Overall I think it was a good purchase for me and would likely be enjoyable for most fans of the genre.

The good:
+ There is a compelling reason to explore and conquer again thanks to the area of control style of resource mine ownership and reasonable assortment of resources.
+ Heroes feel a bit more distinct now with the variation in available skill 'branches' based on faction and class. 
+ Combat is enjoyable and most of the units seem to offer something useful in battle. 
+ Missions seem quite varied compared to prior games, which keeps things interesting. 

The meh:
* The mid-mission map changes are gimmicky.
* The hero stories are okay, but not particularly engrossing.

The ugly:
- The cutscenes at the council table come off cheap.
- Buggy release. Noting that most of the issues are now resolved.

However, in Heroes VII players once again had to battle with a mountain of bugs despite two Beta trials. Very disappointing. Unforseen compatibility issues are understandable, campaign breaking bugs and basic game play bugs are unacceptable. I for one an fed up with Ubisoft's habit of releasing games unfinished. With many of the bugs finally fixed with patch 1.4, the game is playable. 

All the basic are there but the still screen movies are disappointing but not a major problem. The 6 scenarios were a welcome addition. The skill wheels are a great idea. The town portals are frustrating in that you can't choose which portal you wish to go to.

What is a serious problem is the severe lack of playable skirmish maps. Sure there is a map editor, but not every player has hours to spend on building playable maps. Most players do not want to spend more time making new maps than actually playing the game! New fans are unlikely to find the world builder useable. Sadly long term replayability of the game is just not there without spending more time making maps than playing the game. Fans were seriously short changed.

- Animated cutscenes
- UI with decent usability
- Character models worthy of 2015
- Character animations worthy of 2015
- Progressive campaign
- Character customisation during campaign


Cutscenes are ""animated"", but show frozen models, with speech laid on top. 


Using the game feels clunky, you will often accidentally stop your hero mid stride because you accidentally clicked twice on the target, when you should have clicked once. Or your hero doesn't move, because you should have clicked twice when you clicked once. 


It doesn't seem that there has been a User Experience designer involved in the development of this game, there are too many basic usability issues. Such as that you can't bring up a town screen by clicking on a town. It took me nearly 10 minutes to figure out that you need to double click the little town name on the bottom left to do that. Ridiculous. That's just one example, expect a lot more like that.


The character models and animations certainly look dated, and many look like they are reused directly from Hereoes VI. Most of the time, you'll notice that Heroes VI had much better character models though. Models are small in battles, so you don't see the details (maybe this is for the best, as the details are not that great). The entire game has a washed, grainy feel to it that takes away from the ""Heroes feel"". Heroes should be lush, with powerful colors, to immerse you into this fantasy world with its multitude of colorful, odd beings. This is not the case. You get sort of the same feel as when opening a spreadsheet or something. The delightfulness is clearly missing. There's a sparse, somewhat empty feeling to it. 


The animations are clearly a step down from Heroes VI. For example, the Centurion will bash his shield at the opponent, then stick his spear in it, and only about half a second after BOTH attacks are completed does the target react and make some kind of motion. Not immersive.


The campaign is not progressive. I. e., it doesn't build a story for you to follow, but rather it's just a few short stories that you can play through in any order you want. Personally, I would be fine with this, if everything else had been good.


Same with character customisation, you start out with predesigned characters, sometimes at level 0, for other scenarios at level 30, which may annoy some people, but would have been fine if the game was otherwise up to snuff. Of course it isn't. 


The good things are: It's a new instalment of Heroes! For people like me, who grew up with it and love it, this is great. The maps have depth to them visually, which is fun. Castles can be in valleys and so on (but the washed out, derelict feeling that I mentioned earlier detracts from this). Skills feel slightly more useful than in the last Heroes. They've taken some time to groom the skill set. On the other hand, it's not the glory that was Heroes V.


If you're fine with all this, then this game might be for you. The truth is however, that Ubisoft again is trying to get away with minimum effort. What I don't get is, do these people take no pride in what they do? Does it feel good to crank out one half-assed effort after another? Is it a matter of competence, do they not have the right people? Is everyone working on the game too junior? Or is it a conscious strategy from the management?


Don't they want praise from the fans? Why aren't they creating it with ""game of the year"" firmly fixed in their minds? I simply don't get how someone could be satisfied with creating something with this level of indifference. That can't be a satisfying way to live your life. If you don't like the series, for fucks sake, sell it to some studio who DOES love it.

I remember when heroes VI came out and they said they couldn't make a 3d map maker, it would be to dificult and to expensive, turns out they where right on the expensive part, as the game is severly lacking.

 AI could be patched later, but the fact that so many champaign games have gamebreaking bugs in them, at launch is rediculus. Those are mostly fixed now, but what really breakes it for me is the out of sync errors on multiplayer, even over a LAN network whitout simultainius turns and whitout spectateing combats I can never get a game to last longer then 2 weeks if im LUCKY.

Im severly disapointed whit the lack of contact they have had with the comunity so far and the sorry state the game came out in, and still is for many people.

Old review below, some is still true
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Many have mentioned the graphics, UI, bugs, slow AI(!) and lack of faction and so on. And to most part i do agree that a lot could be better.

on a positive note they have added back more resources, mage guilds and random hero skills like the older versions. We have also a OK selection of premade heroes to choose from.

What annoyes me the most except from the above things is that even if you buy this on Steam you still have to use uplay to run the game. I dont mind uplay but it is just dumb to run two applications just to start the game. Also, if I hibernate the PC when taking a break from the game, the game will instantly close when i start up the machine again. why? because I have lost connection to the uplay servers. I am playing this game as a single player game. This is bullshit...

I'm glad I paid full price as this will encourage them to continue to build expansions for this awesome game, that I will happily pay for as soon as they are made available.

Wondering why I mostly hated was that I found the storyline , gameplay and a lot less features that I was missing is just an outrage. Heroes 6 has so much more than 7 so I had hopes to see MORE in 7 NOPE it just looked like Heroes 5 no extras units  not even new ones . units are been re-used from 5 all anime. graphic units where the same ( did they even do anything , or did they just copy the thing from 5 )  I do not see any different between these 2 games.
story line was MEEEEEEH could  do much MUCH better , and the gameplay is just staggering had to move so far for resources/quests and back again it almost took me one day to play only 1 level ....that's just boring not even some old style villain that attacked me so I could level up fast only at the end when the campaign was almost done .
and last but not least THE SPY ROOM thingy or .....whatever seeing at the beautiful market place and dwellers the thief gild was just horrible like  they did just not finished it . 
I had high hopes but I now know this this game is pure made for money this game has nothing to do with HOMM series  this is just a game that looks like HOMM they took the name and ran with the money . sorry for putting it like this but it is just an outrage and thinking I payed almost 50,- euros for this game ....NEVER AGAIN",1445671838,1445671838,False,23,0,0.512052595615386963,0,True,False,False

* Altough i read a lot about crashes, the game had never crashed on my PC, and I only have the min specs.
* I don't mind the 'short story' campain
* Altough I agree the graphics could use some tweaking, the overal battles and map are well crafted. Hero portraits and diversity in hero models could still be better, but is fine
* Flanking, a new and a big tactical advantage
* More diversity in the units, and you can't buy all of them, even with a capital. So, loosing a battle is not such a big deal as it used to be

-
* I can understand it's a bit overpriced. About 35-40$ would be much fairer
* Yes, we ,need a free inferno!!!

However, the more I have played this game, the more I have come to the conclusion that I cannot in good faith recommend this game in its current state. 

I am a longtime fan of the Heroes of Might and Magic series. I was introduced to the franchise with HOMM2 and instantly hooked. Heroes 3 holds a dear place in my memory. It was the game a friend and I would sneak away from school during lunch in order to play hotseat. I didn't play much 4 but 5 and 6 were both extensively played. The hours total on my steam account do not count the much larger part of hours I spent on the titles before linking them to my steam account. 

Anyways, I held off purchasing this game for a long time because of the negative recommendations I read on forums and from a friend who played during the betas. I ended up purchasing it the night before the release because I am a huge fan of the series and felt like it could scratch an itch for me. 

I started with the Stronghold campaign and played through without any issues. I was one of the few who had no CTD or game ending bugs. I read the negativity on the forums and just attributed it to bad luck or people with an axe to grind. I then proceeded to play the Haven campaign with a couple of game ending bugs and CTDs. I gave up and then tried to Dungeon campaign ( my favorite faction) and couldn't get through a first level of the campaign. I struggled through the Sylvan campaign but eventually was able to beat it. Now, on the Necro campaign, I think I'm calling it quits until this game is fixed. Corrupted saves means that I cannot load up a mission I have been working on and complete it. The game has no way for me to restart a mission when all the saves are corrupted so I cannot do anything to restart a mission unless I restart a campaign entirely. I'm sorry, I'm on mission 4 of necro, I don't want to restart the entire campaign. Through all these issues, the game has slowly worn away my patience and enthusiasm so that now, I don't want to spend a huge amount of time loading only to have a CTD while loading a save. 

Look, the game has great bones. Once this game is polished, it has the potential to be one of the top entires within the series. I think the developers took the game in a good direction BUT the game has far too many bugs in it to be released.  When the game is working, I love it. When it isn't, I am incredibly frustrated. I want to play a heroes game and this game is not in the condition that I can reliably play the game.

I plan to change this recommendation once these bugs have been ironed out. I like the communication the developers have had on this forum and others about their plans. Free content to be released, fixing issues and balancing things show that the developers are interested in the long term health of this game. However, the game is currently in a state that will frustrate many, even among the most hardcore of HOMM fans. 

Check back in on this game in a month or two. I hope that it will be in a much better state and you will be happy with the purchase. I do not regret my purchase because I see the potential the game has but I cannot recommend someone to purchase a game and then wait a month or two until it is in a more playable format. As of now, the developers have some work to do in order to fix the amount of good will they have burnt through.",1445569175,1445569375,False,274,4,0.928158223628997803,12,True,False,False

I think mechanics and gameplay improved a lot compared to HOMM6, there is more buildings, more diversity with your heroes and more randomisation (for example as oposed to HOMM6 there is a magic guild with random spells each level, very similiar to the way that HOMM3 handled it) so each time you play you don't just chose the same skills & spells.

Yes, its buggy and requires improvement but at least for me it didn't crashed even once so it can't be that bad (or maybe I'm just very lucky).
Most annoying bug I encountered is vampires sometimes don't steal life making them kind of weak... 

My only non bug related complain is they could add more content, it seems there is not enough spells, neutral units and structures on the map.

first of all this game feels great and is a welcome additon to the HOMM franchise and i got a feel like i was planing multiple games through this one HOW EVER this game need a lot of work i seriously suggest that the game designser play the game itself as there are far to many mistake in and out of the combat system. in saying that i have managed to do 2 campains so far and i have to say the combat system is pretty good when it works the spells look fantastic but again have had severe problem with spell casting like only being able to cast one spell permatch cause it keeps thinking its an adventure spell.
Secondly the campains so far so good playing through the wizard campain i found myself enjoying the combat system and the story in which it had to bring in saying that though i all most died at how slow the enemy and my own teamates where moving as it could take up to 5 minutes to actually get to one spot.
Thirdly single player maps are to few and really wish there was more varity also the are humougous glicthis in enemy ai when they choose to runn side ways down the map when quitely moving forward would have been the better option.
Overall this game need a butt tone of work done on it my suggestion would be to start with the simple things and make sure you do them right. as to views of this all i can say is you are probalby better to wait till it gets cheaper or the game play picks up cause at the moment it is not a complete game but if they manage to pull though and fix there mistakes and there are ALOT i would rate this game a high point for the series.",1445486208,1445486208,True,6,3,0.487471848726272583,0,True,False,False

But if you are able to cope with those (patches are getting out on a regular base) you get a really enjoyable game. The cutscenes are ... not anything you really talk about in regards of state of the art, but they still tell the story that is the background for the game in a way where you just want to continue to see what the next map will bring.

Now to the actual gameplay:

- the missions offer a high variety of goals (not just capture all towns etc.),
- scripted events actually surprise you, sometimes in a positive way sometimes with a groan
- the combats run smoothly, the units are balanced and with the skillwheel you don't just go the old heroes VI cookie cutter builds

It's a conservative installment of the franchise, but all the little things are ""done right"" which I've felt was lacking in heroes V and VI.   For example, while hovering your mouse over a guy you want to attack, you see where he can move shaded out, so you know exaclty where to place a unit so he can't reach you, likewise, you get coverage details if you're moving a unit behind a rock or what not.  The campaigns, it tracks where you are in each campaign quite nicely so you're not stuck with finishing one campaign before you start another if you like to try out each faction first like me.  They added neat little ideas like warcries for the warrior classes, metamagics for the wizards, and some wicked ass spells (tsunami was like holy shit) and the sound effects and music are pretty good.  It has a lot in this game, but not so much that it turns you off which I felt made Heroes VI suffer.

I was hesitating to buy this because of all the negative reviews, but they seem to be trash reviews because of bugs and stuff which I haven't had a problem with (and I'm saying this after the patch).

First off, I don't mind uPlay, it's required to launch the game and that's it, doesn't impact gameplay.
Second, even if the lauch had issues, devs quickly fixed the issues and more updates to come.
Third, it's the gameplay that mathers, GUI and little graphic artifacts are minor and can/will be fixed.

I have played Heroes III, IV, V, VI and VII and so far this game is up there in the best in the series.  Ok so first release was not perfect, but patch 1.2 fixed a lot of bugs and I am very hopeful for the next couple of releases.  

Campaign is actually pretty fun, every heroes had crappy campaigns and actully this one is one of the best.  Yes cutscenes suck, but we don't really care, as long as story is good and gameplay is fun, which it is.

Gameplay is really great, it's on par and even better than Heroes V, magic wheel is good and you also have the choice to get the 4 random choices like older versions.  So far played with 2 factions and have enjoyed them, can't way to try the other ones.

Town screen is great, simple and to the point, spells are great, a lot of variety there.  Units variety is pretty good so far, haven't played every faction but enjoying the variety thus far.

I am actually playing with laptop (i7, integrated HD 4400 and SSD) and can play with medium graphics settings (1200 x 720).  I am sure the game would perform a lot better with better GPU, but am still impressed with the result.  

Things to improve:
-Graphics and design should be improved, it's ok, but could be a lot better, the only place where Heroes VI is better than VII is in graphics.
-Sounds and music should be improved, it's kind of generic, especially in battles.
-GUI is ok, could be better.

I updated to Windows 10, considering that maybe they tested more on a newer OS (I was on 7, still hits minimum reqs), and maybe I was right!

The game is running fine for me now, except for one crash and one bug on a map, but this is all before the update that was just released today, 10/14/2015. I've been playing 8 player FFA singleplayer (my favorite way to play Heroes), and I've had a great time.

Overall, I think they took great parts of previous releases and put them together in a clean way. 

Magic: They went back to the style from HoMM3 where you upgrade your mage guild and get a new set of spells. Plus, you can select your desired sphere of magic, and it'll ensure you get at least one spell of that per level. Also, each faction has its own specialization that you will always get, and one that you will never get. For example, Haven always gets one Light spell, and never gets Dark, and on top of this you choose the other type you always want to get. I think this is the best magic system I've seen in HoMM so far, from playing 3, 5, 6, and now 7.

Graphics: The graphics are not so much noticeably better than 6, but they are better. In some ways you can really tell, but either way, they're up to date for 2015. 

Towns: town building feels like HoMM3 and I really enjoy the style of the towns so far. You have a good set of options early on for what you want to build, and there are hard decisions to make, like when you should save up for more expensive buildings, or just buy extra units and go fight battles. For several buildings, you have two options (+X harpies or +X gnolls?), and for your core 7 creature, you have two different versions. This is a really strong aspect of this release. For example, Dungeon has the Cave Hydra or the Shadow Dragon, and each have their own upgraded version. It's a fun feature.

Also, the caravans are a great feature, as well as some spells that you may have which allow you to summon units from your town to your hero (a dark spell, maybe some others).

Heroes: The heroes level up and have skill points you can drop into different areas, and 3 ""ultimate"" skills, one unique per faction. This has been really fun so far. I've had a Stronghold hero that did massive damage after fully upgrading the special stronghold ""Bloodrage"" skill set, and I've had Dungeon creatures that can walk through enemies, flank them from the rear and attack twice, without retaliation! It sounds unfair, but this is very late game, and it takes a while to build your hero to the level where they can do this. Either way, the game just came out and balancing will take time.

Battles: One thing that I think is a huge step ahead: flanking! If you attack from the sides you do extra damage, and from the rear you do a good percent more. Upgrades can make this even more damaging. You will have to think hard about placement so that you can flank someone with the right creature and do massive damage, also possibly having special abilities that are faction specific that work when you flank from the rear.

The Bad: As for steps back, inferno isn't here! I'm betting it's coming in DLC, but that was a core faction that we all loved.

Overall, I heartily recommend the game as the next in the series, and it looks like it'll be up there with 5 and 3 for me. It was a really sloppy release, but they have probably worked their asses off to get the patch out the door two weeks later. I've been fine in windows 10 so far, but with 7, it wouldn't even run, at least before the patch.

Cheers!

Previous review: This game crashes a ridiculous amount. I can't run the default 64 bit binary or it'll just crash before even showing the splash screen. If I run the 32 bit one, I can get started to play, but usually it'll just crash before the game loads.

I've only managed to get a decent 1v1 game going with an AI, and it crashed when I was winning and attacked their castle. I just tried to do 2v2 hotseat with a friend and 2 AIs, and it crashed before the game loaded. Twice, different maps.

I was so excited for this game, but sadly, it's broken. Wait until they actually finish the game before considering purchasing.

If they don't fix this, this is the end of the HoMM story for me. I'm certainly not pre-ordering the next one. I thought I'd at least get to play a buggy game, but no, if I'm lucky I get a splash screen.",1444533840,1444873355,True,32,0,0.540521442890167236,1,True,False,False

Okay, I've played through the first two Wolf campaigns, and part way through the third. I'll give a quick summation of my thoughts about the game. The game is a vast improvement on Beta 2, but still has a long way to go.

The AI still has issues (enemies running sideways or backwards for no apparent reason, for example), but I'm sure others are better able to discuss that.

I like the style of the new map (going over and down mountains, for example) and the new additions of seeing other characters get off boats and onto the map (start of second campaign), which gives the map a new and upgraded feel.

However, the colouring of the map is still too soft and needs to be saturated with colour, and the objects you can interact with need to stand out more in some way. Sometimes the Alt highlight is blue, sometimes white, but I do find myself having to use it a lot (unlike in previous Heroes games).

Likewise, the battle screens still need work with the graphics (for instance, casting fog on an enemy doesn't surround the enemy in a fog, so you have to right click on them to see if the spell is still working, or try to target them with a shooter). My other half played Heroes 6 while I played Heroes 7, and the general graphics in the battle screen leave a lot to be desired by comparison. I think it's to do with the softer colours, so nothing is particularly well defined, as per the map.

As for the castle map, ugh! It looks like someone stuck a cartoon painting in the middle of a 3D game, and just doesn't suit the style of the rest of the game. While the colours are brighter, the flatness of the castle screen detracts from the rest of game. It's like different artists worked on the game without a lead designer to ensure that there was a single look and feel to the entire game. It just feels wrong going from such clever 3D (map) to the flat 2D of the castle screen.

An additional reason why I have such issues with the castle screens is because we were not given what was promised. Take the Sylvan town screen, for example. We voted and chose this image for the screen on the first Sylvan vote: [url=http://static14.cdn.ubi.com/0004/prod/images/141105_Vote_Townscreen1/Vote_Townscreen1_Island_Mini.jpg]Tree Island[/url] - note its detail and feel of the image.

The second castle screen vote was for this image: [url=http://static14.cdn.ubi.com/0004/prod/images/141110_Vote_Townscreen2/Vote_Townscreen2_Moon_Mini.jpg]Harmony in the Moonlight[/url] - again, note the detail and feel of this image.

I thusly expected an image of similar complexity, with a 3D-ish feel, but a night time version of the first image - expanded, of course, to fit all the buildings.

I feel that the final product - [url=https://ubistatic-a.akamaihd.net/0004/prod/images/units/sylvan/sylvan_screenshot.jpg]Final Sylvan Townscreen[/url] - in no way represents the look and feel of what we voted for. Sure, it is a night time town screen with a tree on an island, but it is 'cartoony' in comparison to the original vote, and feels very flat and looks like a watercolour painting rather that something that fits into the rest of this game. 

I do feel that Ubisoft falsely advertised Heroes VII, as the original images posted on the website all reflected the original look and feel (eg. [url=https://mmh7.ubi.com/en/factions/sylvan]Sylvan Faction[/url]), not what we got in the final product. There is also no word that these sorts of things will be fixed, or if they will be fixed at all. Very, very disappointing.

Similarly, the council table is also in need of work. The characters don't move at all, let alone have their mouths moving when they are meant to be talking to each other. Do they have telepathy? Why are they so frozen? It's super creepy, but it could be so cool. This is one of the first things a player sees, so it really reflects badly on the entire game as a result. This isn't the 1990s, where such things were impossible to do!

As for bugs... Just before the final battle for the first Haven campaign I upgraded 5 chaplains and joined them to a stack of 10 upgraded chaplains making a total of 15. When the other army attacked, I was back to the 5 chaplains and 10 upgraded chaplains, rather than 15 upgraded chaplains. This is certainly a bug that needs investigated.

The time between the end of the battle and the battle results window was getting longer and longer the more I played the game.

Also, the game crashed on me quite randomly on the third campaign, whilst on the map page. Because the game takes so long to load, I gave up playing for a while, and am currently playing Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II on the PlayStation, and I have to admit I am enjoying that game much more. (Plus, it actually has animations and cut-scenes, which Heroes VII does not seem to have.)

Anyway, I really hope that these issues are corrected with a patch in the very near future. Currently, whilst far better than Beta 2, the game feels like Beta 3 instead of a final product. More work from the graphics designers is sorely needed to get the game together and working as it should. Right now, the game in no way reflects the advertising pictures throughout this site, which is highly disappointing.",1444706290,1444713083,False,17,2,0.570060014724731445,0,True,False,False

I was very pleased to see that UBI brought back the 4 rare resources instead of just crystals. They also got rid of the ""main hero"" feature from what I can tell. Again, I am happy about the revision.

At first I only thought that the SFX were atrocious. Upon closer inspection though, I've realized that the entire game is lacking. IMHO the graphics are WORSE than the 10 year old HoMM5. Lame spell effects! 
The combat is less interesting also. There are fewer caster units. Take genies for example. Instead of being able to hurl blesses/debuffs from afar, they have to attack in order to implement their debuff.

They took a step or two forward from HoMM6, but then took several backwards. This is a bad product as is.

- so i can't continue the playing.

=====================
It's not worth the price. If it was 25-35,- price range it would be worth it.  (probably 20-25,- when the novalty of release has worn off.)
All the visual elements don't come across Tripple A quality or pricing but more of an experienced indie dev. I'm reminded by the difference between Simcity and City Skyline but I'm not sure the gameplay advantage City Skyliners has is valid for this game. Add the major Lag bugs and you don’t see gameplay compensating for lower visuals. 
(for a quick view of what gameplay they improved on look at the last paragraph)


Misleading
I find the ingame pictures  on store page misleading. It feels like they added more saturation and bloom effect in photoshop. I'd suggest watching gameplay footage on youtube.


Aesthetics and Visual Design
There is no good overall aesthetic design. Even when the models have the detail they they don't come out that well in the game like it does with the previous HoMM 6. The game also uses many models of HoMM 6, not necessarily problem if the price was right and more was improved graphically.  

Animation, special effects and audio is also of lower quality than HoMM 6.  This all contributes to a lower ambiance than the players had of the previous title.

Interface feels outdated, some elements are good to decent and others are not and in some areas feel unfinished. There is also lag in the interface where it does not properly update elements fast enough.


Gameplay
All the previous elements contribute to the overall experience the gameplay gives, but looking at the gameplay alone I'm not sure of it yet. It feels like there is more diversity in heroes type, more construction options and there are more factions to play compared to Homm6. The skill system is new and the morality system is gone which is probably an improvement. From what I've played and seen I expect a bit slower pacing than HoMM 6, giving you a more wide world exploration experience like the old games. This I see as a positive. The garrison system I really like and is a very nice addition that prevents leaving everything unguarded. I also want to add the Governor system, it's a nice interesting innovation, although i'm not sure about certain bonuses are worth the skill investment.

But when compared to HoMM 5 or the ones before I don't think the gameplay is broader, probably smaller. The Game-editor might be one HoMM7 strenght which is pretty good from what I heard.



Bugs:
- Interface lag
- Long wait times for computer movement
- Multiplayer problems
- Combat bug where you can’t move forward and with wait or defend for bonus turn
- Windows 10 problems
- More

What I’d have liked:
Looking at it now, I wish they just expanded upon HoMM6 since the visuals are good there. Just upgrade that engine add 2-3 factions and put some gameplay changes they made in HoMM7 like:
- 1 extra resource
- slower pacing (more world exploration feel)
- Garrison system
- 2-3 factions added
- Unit/construction options
- More heroes class types. (liked the new skill system)
- Removal of morality
- Governor system (seems interesting and new innovation)
- A good editor",1443871377,1444385855,False,51,1,0.655192553997039795,1,True,False,False

After reading many negative reviews, I decided to give the game a go any way as most of the reviews seemed to revolve around issues with multiplayer. I wanted to play the campaign or single player vs AI so I gave it a go. After about 20 hours of playing the extremely EASY and lacklustre campaigns.. I was still actually have fun as some of the game mechanics are really good. The campaigns dont really progress however and so 1 map you might start of with a level 5 hero, the next you are playing a different hero who is already level 20. This didn't really gel with me  [spoiler] and I began to see that rather than take my time to explore each map the best thing to do was simply beeline straight towards the finish line [/spoiler] and the campaigns really are easy. I found no real difference between playing on normal or playing on heroic - so I just jacked it right up to heroic just to try and give myself the illusion of progression on each map.

So then I decided to try single player vs AI. No simultaneous turns and the time between your turns really is ridiculous. I found myself reading a book or applying for jobs in between my turns - which hey actually I didn't mind but really shouldn't be necessary. AND THE BUGS. Oh my gosh there are a lot of them, bugs ranging from some of your building not working, your strategic spells not working, things which are only meant to let you cast a spell once per combat seem to increase this spell count each combat you are in until you can cast said spell an unlimitted amount of times (and your spellbook is fullup with multiple copies of the same spell. Let's say you are defending in a seige and someone flies over your wall and you decide to shoot them with a crossbow, well because they are now on your side of the wall they get a cover bonus even though they are standing about 1m away from you with no wall inbetween.

A lot of the bugs I could forgive as many of them cancel each other out - 1 bug hinders you and (although I felt like I was cheating) another bug will aid you. But I can not forgive game-breaking bugs that pop up many hours into a game and just render the game a complete waste of time. An example of this is when I defeated an enemy hero inside their city. I gained control of the city and the game informed me that player had been defeated. However his hero still took up the hero slot inside the city. This meant that I could not enter or exit any units or heros from this city what-so-ever.

This is turning out not as short and nowhere near as sweet as I was hoping.

TL;DR: game is fun at first until you realize the abundance of bugs and lack of polish and care. Combine that with game breaking bugs that will waste hours at a time this game really is not worth it in its current state. Once the bugs are dealt with multiplayer may be fun but single player will surely still be lacking.",1444374446,1444374446,False,79,0,0.713842034339904785,3,True,False,False

games like this graphic is only 10% of my demands. 
My bigest demands are balance, chalenge & gameplay, many strategy options.
1) Balance - need to be fix 3/5 point ( three points of 5 max), moust of games i give 1 pointa balance iam very demanding in this thing.
2) Chalange&gameplay - played on heroic dificulty (map and computer ) 3 big maps 4/5 point - start is chalenging
bet later is not so.
3) Strategy in batles - I give big + for interesting batles even more interesting than 3hmm, but only minus is 
that magic spell power in batles is not doing much impact. 5/5 if magic will be fix.

I had initially played close to 10 hours to it and gave it a thumbs-up. As stated in the previous review, the game is a generally fun game but does not really add anything new to the genre.

However, as it stands and after more time spent on the game, I honestly cannot recommend the game in it's current state.

It is buggy beyond belief. Previously, I encountered several minor bugs/glitches involving skills or enemy AI or spell/skill effects and such. Most of these were relatively minor and I was prepared to give Ubisoft time to patch these up as most did not really affect gameplay drastically.

Right now, I've encountered what seems to be a fairly common game-breaking bug (as per the game/steam forums) where loading a save file causes the game to crash to the desk-top. The ridiculous thing is that when this 'glitch' occurs it seems to corrupt/affect ALL the other save files. In other words, once you crash one in a campaign map/scenario, you effectively cannot load any other save files!

The thoughtless manner in which the devs designed the game ui is such that you cannot even now reload the map/scenario when this bug happens but have to restart the whole campaign ...

The game as a whole just felt really boring.

 Now a bit more personal; I disliked the factions and their creature distribution. I don't know why they had to make dungeon associated with dark elves and sylvan associated with elves. Just look at HOMM 2 and 3 titles and you'll see that those two factions were a lot more inspired. Some units design as a whole are terrible. I don't know, it just feels like the game was rushed, they threw everything inside a big cauldron, mixed it in a senseless manner and released the product for us to buy. Everything just feels very disconnected. 

The building tree UI is also bad. Looks very confusing and the townscreens could've been MUCH better. HOMM 2 and 3 townscreens were much more appealing and charming than what we got here, and they are 90's games. We are in 2015.

For a week it was still ok. Yes game itself lacking many major features (fail cinematics and artwork, inconvenient battle sound etc.) but was still bearable since i mostly look for playability and challange. 
But after a week, when i am back from another city for a couple of days and wanted to play again but couldnt load my campaign save. Tried to fix it but i couldnt. After 10 mins i even couldnt launch the game. The game i was playin with no crashes for a week was not launching this time. And yes this is terribly annoying. 
In conclusion my opinions about the game (i stilll feel sad to write those about that masterpiece series)


Negatives 

- After playing so long, be prepared to have crashes and never be sure that you can load your game from your desired save, cose it may be corrupted already.
- AI is dumb. Even with a crap army but with a decent hero, you can win against AI easily. 
- Units are unbalanced. It shouldnt be that hard for a pack of elite unit to kill a weakling pack of core unit. But you cant...
- Artwork is not beatiful as other HOMM series. e.g in HOMM3 remember city artworks, but HOMM7 towns look like a cheap japanese manga cover
-Some unit artwork is pointless (check upgraded asassin and black (fearie) dragon)
-Sometimes AI turn takes hellishly long
- Crappiest cinematics ever
-Not a great selection of talent trees and might and magic heroes are not designed well according to their speciality. Why would i have 3x spell talent tree but crap might tree on a ranger hero??
-Artifacts are not alluring like in previous series. I shouldnt be fighting with  zounds of undead in a crypt just to get +2 defence cloak...
- Outdated graphics in total
- No random map generator and so few maps in core game
-Game seems like it is beta and not finished


Positives 

-Campaign story is very nice
-Playability and gameplay is good and not boring. Feels like kinda between homm3 and homm5
- City features like spying/sabotaging etc. are really nice additions. 
- Item sets are also nice addition for gameplay
- No spells to be abused and mastering on magic heroes is not a piece of cake as on previous series but when mastered it is really powerful
- Racial talents on heroes are reallly nice. (Righteousness and natures revenge are lovely )

To those of you who feel this game hasn't evolved enough... look at what has happened to final fantasy due to all their innovation. The whole console series is now garbage and it was once gold. There ARE other games to play than first person shooters and action rpgs. Dont fix what isn't broken.

The only REAL complaint to make about this game are the motion graphics. Heroes levitating across maps instead of galloping. Mobs on combat often float diagonally and not in a way that looks at all normal. I've played two maps and I'm going to set this one down for a few months and hope this get's worked out.

The cutscenes do look like crazy wax scenes and it's hard to tell what they were going for. My guess is this game got pushed out before it was ready (which btw, who told gaming studios it was ok to release unfinished products?! It seems to be the norm these days). Perhaps the scenematic movements are not there the same as the combat/map movements are off but it is obviously due to a lack of polish.

1. some quests are just straight up bugged out that you have to restart the map, and redo everything again for the quest to work. I spent more than a day to finish a map, and the last quest bugs out. It just pisses me off.

2. The sound is the worst thing in this game. Sometimes, there is no sound during combat, like at all, but there's sounds during normal play. Sound doesn't match with actions on faster combat speed. 

3. Crashes. This game crashes a lot on my system. When some textures have a hard time to load/render, it just crashes. Some other times, when I fight that particular packs of monsters on the map, it just crashes, everytime. If I skip just that one pack, it works fine. I can play a much more demanding game like Witcher 3 on highest settings, and my pc handles just fine. I'm not even sure why this game crashes so much.

4. Spells don't cast at locations you point to. Especially firewall, firewall sometimes wouldn't place on the tiles that you want to assign, but it would cast a row in front/behind it. It's just stupid.

5. Effects texts on units/monster just fly all over the screen. 

There are many more bugs, that I can't possibly list them here.

On to game design,

Quests/stories are boring, so boring that I don't even spend time listenning to them. This game quests are worst than HoMM VI. The quest logs don't even explain how to get something done, or have no direction. The pinpoints on the map sometimes work, sometimes don't. I would pick HoMM VI over this game anyday. 


Units are plain, and boring. Range units from all factions either shoot through a row of monsters, or throw something in the sky and do area damage. There are not much design or imagination went into designing these units. The champion units are just stronger, and have more health, with a bunch of passive effects that no one cares to read, and rarely visibly matters during combat. 

There is no balance between might and magic. I just pick magic everytime. I can finish the whole map with 1 stack of monsters, and maxed out firewall if I play correctly or I can just use Prime magic and summon stack after stack after stack of elemental units, and the AI just attack those summoned monsters. Most spells are just useless, I just use those very high damge spells, and it would get me through everything. 

Their cutscenes are not even animated, well I'm sorry, the candles are animated, but the characters are still images, and if you look at some models, the design is just ridiculous. The necromancer girl eyes are not even lined up. etc. etc.

I can sit here, and tell you how bad this game is all day, but I'm sure you're already convinced not to buy this game, not right now.

TD;DR:

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW. JUST DON'T. There are so many bugs, crashes, balance issues. Story is boring, cutscenes are not animated, units are plain simple, not unique. There is little nothing new/intuitive about this new installment, they took what was already there, and made it worse.

The game is still almost as buggy as during the last Beta. Most of the bugs I encountered were of the game breaking nature and forced me to restart the respective mission. But I never had problems loading into the game and it didn't crash on me even once. Therefore, I am not overly affected by the bugs since having to restart a mission might be a big annoying but at the same time it is nothing horrible and allows you to optimize your farming pattern and readjust skillbuilds of the heroes. 

Publishing a game with so many problems shouldn't be done and can be considered an insult to the customers. Yet, I am still recommending the game because the campaign is beautifully crafted, the mission design is pretty awesome and you instantly get sucked in by the typical Heroes of Might and Magic charme that makes it so hard to stop playing. 

If you liked the other Heroes of Might and Magic games and if you do not care too much about missing animations during what ""could"" be called cut-scenes if there were animations, you will enjoy this. If all you want to do is ride around, collect stuff, build huge armies and strong heroes, then you WILL enjoy this game. The pace during the campaign is quite high, which is why this game clearly is NOT RECOMMENDABLE for beginners. There is no tutorial whatsoever, no introduction to mechanics, if you never played a game of this genre, you might be overwhelmed and pretty helpless. As a HOMM veteran, I think that is awesome, since you are just thrown right into the big epic fights!

One downside that has to be mentioned is the quite horrible AI. The fights are far from ""hard"" and even playing on heroic, you can easily defeat ""deadly"" enemies if you know how to play. The AI moves around confusedly, suicide attacks sometimes (without doing too much damage) and generally just isn't a real challenge.

Skill system may not be very flexible, but it's interesting and transparent (as opposed to homm5 skill wheel). Fraction abilities no longer require charging for who knows how long.

Bad thing is it's basically must have for a main hero for most of the fractions (stronghold just doesn't work without it). Some fractions, however, have it considerably weaker. Overall balance is also very questionable.

I've been fortunate and I haven't had any problems, and I can only rate this game off of my own experience; which has been pretty good so far. The core gameplay is very solid and this game has all the ingredients there to be a fantastic heroes game. The graphics are nice. The animations are great. The storytelling is decent enough. The addition of a map editor with a RMG is nice. The combat is as fun as in any other heroes game. The town screens are a pleasant oldschool 2d approach. Most of the spell effects are cool. 

I do have problems with it, but I hope these things can be ironed out and improved in future patches/expansions. The sound needs work. Certain animations don't have sound effects that should. And the town screen music sometimes cuts off for no apparent reason. The non-cinematic cinematics do feel super cheap and just don't really work from an artistic standpoint. The user interface is shoddy, and the skill wheel just seems like a pointless ""innovation"".

I haven't experienced any issues with Uplay or performance (Win 7 64bit, i5 2500k, GTX 560 Ti). Too early to make conclusive judgments as to where it stands relative to the other Heroes titles but I feel it is a step up from 5 & 6. I give every Heroes game a shot and this one is just fun to play and that is all I was hoping for.

Edit 05/Oct/2015:

The Haven campaign was mostly fine. The only issue was not being able to assign the ultimate skills to certain heroes that were picked up on the third mission.

Now having started the Sylvan campaign I came across more unforgiving problems. The main issue for me was that save games started to get corrupted on the third Sylvan mission. I essentially had to play through that entire mission with certain 'checkpoints'. By that I mean that there were certain savegames that would work but most of them wouldn't. So If your game crashed for whatever reason you would have to restart at that 'checkpoint' which in my case was about an hour behind my current point in the mission.

Another issue is the AI. While playing on Heroic I never encountered the AI using the special abilities of the creatures.

They are everywhere. EVERY. WHERE. I can't fight other heroes, because it crashes. I can't load a game, because it crashes. I can't edit a map, because it crashes. Can't do this, can't do that... basically, don't do ANYTHING, beacuse it may crash.
How can you fuck up Unreal Engine like this? I saw hobbyist developers, HOBBYIST DEVELOPERS do better stuff in UE than these ""Professional"" (I put it in quotes because they are clearly not professionals at all). Hell, 7dfps people do better than this, IndieDB, GameJolt... sure it's hard to compare because this game is massive and those are indie games, which means they are smaller, but there is no excuse for so many bugs. Why? Because these people are supposed to be ""Pros"". GameJolt, 7dfps, IndieDB (and other sites) they are indie devs and their games have less bugs than this AAA+ title. It's kind of expected now in 2015. 


Next, let's tackle ""teh grafics"".

They... I think they kind of fit. The UI is a mad mix between Heroes of Might & Magic V and Heroes of Might & Magic III, it's kind of appealing. To me at least. The town building is OK, the town screen is a MAJOR step backwards from Heroes of Might & Magic V. I thought it was AWESOME when for the first time, we finally could see the city 360 style! It was sooo awesome! Aaaand then came Heroes of Might & Magic VI... aaaaaaand then came Heroes of- oh sorry, it's no longer called Heroes of, now it's just Might & Magic VII... 
Graphical glitches... are rare, which is surprising. Really. After you look at the campaign menu and you see the STATIC MODELS ""talk"" to each other you are surprised that the rest of the game has animations and almost no graphical glitches. I wish I could rotate the map 360 as  well, but no, of course not. They have to hide unfinished assets somehow. The underground world is a joke. It doesn't look different than overworld. In III, V and EVEN VI, you could clearly distinguish underground from overworld. Here though... It's a mess. One big pile of kaka.
Another thing that gets me: Heroes V, when you selected a monster and wanted to know more about it, you saw it's 3D model next to the book with all the data and you could easily compare the monster's upgraded version with the standard one. Here... you get a short bio! No, like REALLY short. It's amasing that these bios are longer than 10 words. Oh yeah, and instead of a cool 3D model, you get a ""cool"" concept art thingy. Another step backwards. Sure the 3D in V was not very good and the animations and models were more... childish, but... really? A concept art painting? *sigh*... 


But we're not done yet...

Teh epic soundz...
Yeah if only they were epic... The VO (Voice over) is... meh. it's not good, not terrible, not ok... just meh. The sounds aren't always synchronised with the animations. It's surprising that they ARE synchronised most of the time. REALLY. I am serious. It's especially evident in combat if you set the speed higher or slower than 100%. Ridiculous. 
Other sounds and music... it's meh. Want a visual representation? Do a thumbs-up, turn it sideways and then turn it a little more downwards, but not completely down and there you have it. 


The A.I. 
Ohhh boooy... since we're talking about A.I., I bet that Spielberg's movie is better than this one. I can't really compare, because like I said in ""Teh bugz"" section, I can't fight the other heroes at all, both the A.I. and other player's heroes. It's not just ridiculous. It's ludicrous. I can't fight heroes, in heroes game. WAT.


BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET!

The map editor.
You think it su**s? You bet it su**s. I can start it, sure, but can I edit anything? Well yes, I can click on ""new"". Guess what happens then? Did you guess crash? Because if you did, then you are 10000% correct. Again, it's ludicrous, because the editor is the DEFAULT MAP EDITOR from UDK and UE3. You even have an option to SWITCH THAT VIEW. WHY? WHAT IS THE REASON!? Did they forget to edit it out? Were they too lazy to? Were they too busy wiping their virtual/real bottoms with our virtual/real money? WHAT!? WHY!?



TL/DR (IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MY FINAL THOUGHTS, IF NOT SKIP EVEN MORE):


FINALLY: 

Teh conclusion.
It s***s. Of the 3 new Heroes, this one is THE WORST. There is no comparison. I could play VI, it was not as good as V and not as memorable as III, but I could play it at least. The sounds are meh, the graphics are OK, the A.I. is most likely meh, the UI is OK. 
Between these new 3 Heroes, I would recommend V with the expansion packs. It's the closest thing you can get to Heroes III and V is the best of the new 3D Heroes. Compared to this, it's perfect. Compared to VI, it's excellent. 
Oh yeah and may I ask WHY is there no Inferno? Why are so many factions missing? ""Because story, duuhhh"". Bulls**t. We always had Inferno. There is also one more faction missing (I think? IDK, they were not so memorable as the factions from Heroes III.) from the previous games. 
Wait, I just figured out WHY it's missing. DLC! Yes! Brilliant! Yeah, that's the way to do it! You think they will feel ashamed that they are doing this? You really think so? Go back, all the way up in my review and answer again, or let me answer for you: No, of course they're not going to feel ashamed, because people WILL buy the DLC, because ""nostalgia"", because ""I can't play without my teh best faction evaa"", because of ""reasons"". 
I can't belive I wasted my money on the deluxe edition, I could get Metal Gear Solid or Fallout 4 FOR THE SAME PRICE AND I know that Metal Gear Solid will work and I'll have 50+ hours of fun with it and I'm 90% sure that Fallout 4 will work. The rest 10% is reserved for bugs, but nonetheless I will have 50+ hours of fun with it as well. 



TL/DR:

Don't buy this, it's kaka, if you want 3D Heroes that is the closest you can get to Heroes III, get Heroes V. It may be more childish (for my taste at least), but it's the best 3D Heroes there is. If you don't want 3D Heroes, get Heroes III with ALL the DLC on GOG. If you don't want Heroes at all, save yourself the trouble, save those additional 10 euros or whatever your currency is and buy Metal Gear Solid V, Fallout 4, Just Cause 3, Xcom 2, etc. etc. 

This is the last product I bought from Ubis**t. No, really, it is. I'm done. I'm done with Heroes and Ubis**t. That's it. Keep in mind that those stars do not replace ""-of-"" in their name, they replace nasty letters ""-hi-"" and if you combine this with ""Ubis--t"" you get a very plesant word.",1444081687,1444081687,False,23,2,0.511568367481231689,0,True,False,False

Truthfully i like this game but... T_T theres no animation for the Campaign Council and it was very odd. The textures on the faces were a bit weird and not smoothed out. Maybe they were trying to go for a different style i dont know. I feel like the publishers dont give enough time for the developers to make something great. =/
TO those people of complaining about some textures and such. I had no problem with it although i do admit it has problems when rendering rarely. 

The Building concept i liked very much, i dont know what some people have against it. I loved how they brought back the magic guilds. Classic HOMM.

I did notice that some of the governor abilities bugged out and at the end of turn or did not integrate at all. to fix it i had the hero go back and redo the application of the governor. The last mission of the Haven was especially annoying because most of the time the governor abilities for economy would not work. Highly annoying.

I love the options to choose which monster growth or champion creature to build. A lot of the new concepts i like however as i read other reviews there is no TUTORIAL... Very weird. I only knew about the Governor concept through the 2nd mission of the Haven campaign. WEll i did do BETA but forgot afterward. 

The AI is a bit of a joke easily tricked and summoning elementals will just attract all the aggro.
 
As of right now the game is lacking. Hopefully they improve it tremendously with an expansion or update. 

Hmm... no wonder they didnt show the campaign council in BETA because EVERYONE would complain. They shouldve done it like the trailer animated like that. And more immersive story like in HOMM V and HOMM Vl.",1444080702,1444080702,False,17,0,0.501845002174377441,0,True,False,False

The animations are beautiful and the designa and layout of the maps is pretty good. There are even areas cosed off in certain maps until you unlock them by visiting shrines and the like. Spell animations are great as well. I find it interesting how they show the opening of each campaign with a still frame on the speaker as they talk. its kind of cool and looks great ithout animating their mouth. Are there bugs? sure there are. But the game has been out only 6 days as of my writing this. None of the bugs are really gamebreaking either. The storylines are all well written as well. Literally my only complaint is that The campaigns take much less time than they did in five or six. Ive nearly beaten the undead with and human campaigns and havent put in more than 20 hours as of now. Other than that, great game. I would give it an 8.5/10.

Still won't start on my end...

Edit:

Finally got the game to work... after putting uplay offline, setting the .exe into win8 compatibility mode and running the .exe as admin... yay...

So far... the game doesnt look that great compared to its elder HoM&M3... Textures are bad (and they should feel bad), I feel as if im playing at the 6th heroes at some moments... The cities look ""ok"", but they should have used that artstyle for all the game, and forget about all the 3d crap, as it tends to mess a lot with the space appreciation, in a game where movement is key.


Gameplaywise... It's unfortunatly closer to HoM&M6, TTHE GAMEBREAKING TOWNPORTAL IS STILL HERE, FLEE, YOU FOOL! Seriously. No. No. No. We all know how that thing ends up
The new flanking mechanic is ""insteresting"", but end up resulting in akward running around as there is no ""tacle"" stat...
And its no big news the game is still using squares instead of hexagones for their combat phases.

At least they brought back the 7 ressources aspect in the game...
I've got to give props for the new building system (though the building menu is really awkward to look at and would probably appreciate some tweaking and polishing): some buildings require you to chose between one choice or another (ex: for the 7th tier creatures).

That aside, the number of available maps is incredibly low, and I have found no random map generator...so...


As much as I would love to give a HoM&M game a good review, they all pale in comparaison with the third, which is a true masterpiece (go gog and grab it, not the HD bs :)  ).

Oh... and good luck with the overall UI... it's terrible ^^'

Pros:
I love the plot, and very original to tie it around different stories. 
Graphics are good, and all you weasels complaining, the makers have clearly taken inspiration from Heroes 3. It is exactly what you have whined and yelled that you want. Heroes 3 type graphics and pallete of colours. I also saw some morons complaining about the 2d town screens. Again, as the majority wanted, very Heroes 3 like. 
Music, as always in a Heroes game, is sublime, way to go Romero.
Gameplay is good, they tried to go back to the roots, as in the past the plebea has complained of any inovation attempt. Campaigns are trying to break away from ""this is your castle, now kill all the other players"" which is a good thing, you have skirmish maps for that.
Some superficial idiots complained about the cut scenes. Well, I am sooo happy they went with this solution than with what they did previously. I would rather have still images than the mess of animation for cut scenes in Heroes 5, made with the game engine that looked hideously and moved their mouths like fish freshly pulled out of the water. If you can't do a great job then don't do it, go arround it, and thats what they have done.
I also love the in game menus in Heroes 7, colours and the feel of the spells book, the portraits of the heroes and so on. Again, Heroes 5 sucked big time at this chapter. 

Everyone screams BUGS! I am not saying there are no bugs, it's just that I didn't encounter them, and I played  one campaign, now in the middle of the second one. I also played the beta and that was a buggy mess, but the final release seems okay up till now.

Cons:

They did not have a breakthrough like they did when they released Heroes 3, if that can be called a fault. And nobody does these days. The difference between computer games generations is getting smaller and smaller as are the steps towards visible, shocking improvements. 
Also, I am not crazy about the wheel type of the hero specialization. It seems a little weird, but I am getting used to it. I am sure they could have found a different, better solution to that.

I cannot comment on the AI, but all heroes games besides 2 and 3 sucked at AI. Let's hope this will also be an exception.
 I forgot to mention that I hate the influence of japanese style graphics on some of the creatures. I mean the archangel should look like a dam archangel, not some asian legless, faceless emo teen with a long robe, sleeves and ribbons flying ""graciously"" around. I really miss the archangel from Heroes 3 with western type drawings. It looked more biblical, less cartoony, giving him a more dramatic feeling.

Yes it has flaws. Yes, it should have been better right away given it's price. But let us not forget that neither Heroes V or VI was even close to finished at release. Heroes V with an incredibly complex skillsystem with no explanation in game, and several crashes and graphical bugs, and Heroes 6 with no town view (Might seem small, but for us who love Heroes, a major requirement). Both games was in my opinion much improved through patches and expansions, resulting in two games I to this day can pick up to play and enjoy. I see no reason to not expect the same development in Heroes VII.

First, I'll tackle the bad things with the game, because we all know they are there.

The cinematics for campaign intro. Horrible stills of what seems to be a 3dmodel cinematic under development. Painful to watch. However. I think we can all agree that if Ubisoft were to save money/time somewhere during the development, we would rather have it somewhere where it doesn't disturb the general gameplay of the game. And this is a pretty quick fix with patches, as I would be surprised if a proper cinematic isn't placed here at a later stage.

The slow AI turns. This is rather bad. We've all played the huge or impossible sized maps where we have to wait several minutes between turns when we've progressed a good amount into the map, but waiting for so long from the very beginning is bad. By timing it, I found that on average, during the first week alone, you have spent almost 10 minutes just waiting for your turn. This is something I assume will be adressed rather quickly, if the development team has any good sense of prioritizing.

I'm not even gonna mention bugs and crashes, because frankly, most of the ones I've seen are very minor graphical bugs, that get fixed with just a hover over them with the pointer, and I've only experienced two crashes so far, and one of them was probably my own fault for overtaxing the machine with background processes. So to sum it up, I've seen far worse in newly released games than this. Even same priced ones.

Now on to the good stuff.

The Hero system. I really like the return of the skill system of Heroes V, but in a simplified and much more explained version. And that each hero has it's own unique set of skills, with it's own masteries, makes heroes more unique and it matters more to you which hero you get.

The new flanking system. I love this new feature in combat. It makes large scale battles much more dynamic, and we avoid the old scenario with two stacks of over 1k units standing still and wailing on eachother for several minutes until one dies. Now it is a constant battle for getting the upper hand in terrain, terrain obstacles have a bigger impact, and making a wall of melee units around your ranged units might no longer be a valid idea, as you are giving away flanking opportunities to your opponent and getting none yourself, making it a possibility for losing even if you had the stronger army. In general, battles are less tedious and each battle is a bit more different than in earlier games.

The music. It's great. Sure, there are some tunes I don't like as much as the others, but on average the music is really good. In fact, thanks to the long waiting time between turns, I found myself answering natures call when I found myself thinking that the music I heard coming from the game was really great. And we all know the the best thinking happens while on the toilet. Jokes aside, the music gives that great atmosphere of Heroes we've all grown to love, and THAT is one of the places I would have been unable to accept any flaws.

And last but not least. The developers have proven that they are willing to listen to the fans. By letting us vote on what the two last factions of the starting 6 were going to be, they gave us influence and insight other developers do not. If they keep that trend up, there is no reason why we can't help make this game as great as I think it has the potential to be.

But that can only happen if we actually give this game a chance. So I implore you, give this game a chance. It has so much potential, and is still very much enjoyable the way it is today. I think this can become the best Heroes game yet, especially with the involvement of the fans :)

From the bugs that occur, it feels closer to a alpha -> beta transition than a beta -> release transition as the bugs are blattant and trigger easily doing required actions.  The AI is apaulling in that enemy creatures focus on either stacks you can't replace in your base or just smalled stack to penalize for the new moral system rather than actually focus on any of your creatures that matter.  The AI heroes will ignore pretty much anything non-mine or base related and will even sacrifice heroes.  As such, there ai is easy to pick-off and trick into destroying stacks of creatures of your choice.  The weird trend of removing one faction from a previous game is still in trend as there's no infernal faction anymore but the new factions are interesting.  The spells still feel rediculously overpowered for mage heavy characters, but the melee characters are a legitimate alternative now at least.  The base aspects of the game and new features feel good all around, but aren't even close to polished and there are some sever balance issues that need to be addressed to.

I want to recommend this game, I really do, but I can't, at least not yet.

The game trailers where gorgeously animated, impressive as hell, but when you load the game you're given a cinematic that looks like someone doing it gave up or got fired about 1/4 of the way through.

Here's the promo sequence;

https://youtu.be/5ed6MNCMh8s

And the incredibly shitty ingame cinematic.   No stylization, no animation, just a complete and utter failure.

So, with that said, I watched the sequence, and exited, going to bed, but optimistic about getting to play it this morning.   Booted up my machine, launched the game, and.... crash.   Not even getting to the studio logos, just black screen critical failure and back out to the desktop.


I don't know who let this abortion out of the studio early, but they should be dragged into the parking lot and beaten with rolled up newspapers.   It's an insult to good games, an insult to the fans, and a slap in the face to Ubisoft's reputation.

PRO:

+ new heroes game. weh!

CONTRA:

- game start intro video looks super cheap
- 3d characters in game-campaign-intro video dont move while talking. rly super lazy. they dont even move lips.
- menu looks hasted and super bad like from a 15year old game. 
- multiplayer is not working at all
- single player is working, but there are so many bugs that result in maps dont finish even if u do all quests and stuff...
- minor and greater bugs allover the place
- textures of the whole game look cheap and hasted (even on max max settings)
- hero skills development is super forced and doesnt offer anything interessting
-uplay plz die.

I have been playing Heroes for over a decade and hoping to see this one for a while.. And they even add Solmyr again which is my favorite hero off all times. By the introduction video starts the disappointment starts also..
From the first second you can feel how far from the quality this product is.. I really think even Heroes III have a more interesting introduction cinematic. And the menu.. The colors they choose, the fonts.. everthing looks so cheap. 

For a while I tried not to see all of this. Just start a single player map, of course choosing my favourite hero Solmyr. They even managed to ruin that. In map screen you see a floating genie but in hero page there is a man figure with two legs.. 

Everything looks so sloppy that it looks like they give 0 importance to the details.. 

I must say they did create some very interesting game mechanics which can add a variety of possibilities to the game. But some they serve it in such a poor condition that you must force yourself to play it... The game looks way behind of Heroes VI and even Heroes V.

If you are not totally committed to this series never ever think of buying this.. And even if you are committed still think twice before buying it..


----UPDATE------
***My views after 15 hours of game play***

I continued to play for the strategy elements that I mentioned before.. The result is more disappointment.. The game really is as bad as it looks and feels like.. The AI ie totally broken. I played custom maps so I don't now how it works in campaigns because maybe it can be more scriptted so you may have more fun but for custom maps..It just doesn't work. The AI is so lazy and arrogant(!).. It passes by many free resources on the map. Doesn't even bother to collect any of them. It never try to invest itself. Most of the times it dully wonders with lots of heroes (w/o armies)  around the map. 

This looks bad but the battles are even worse.. Sometimes units just go left, and next turn, they go right while continuing to tkae ranged damge from my army?! Or big units (2x2) try to go narrow passages (1 square).. Then wait there or turn back to try later... In the battle map with river, whcih has only one way to pass trough to other side, a bridge, enemy units try to go left corner where there is a river.. Then they return back to the bridge.. But  again they wanted to give a second try to river.. If you have one or two rangeg units or some solid spells it is really makes no sens to fight.

The AI offers no challange at all..

So pardon me because I don't want to be rude but this game is an insult to its fans more than a tribute!.. After Heroes III, nearly all games tried to do something different.. In the end, they also mostly failed but at least they tried. This one try to gather all of their good parts and ruined them all for good.. I don't know what to say more..",1443547505,1443894108,False,453,11,0.825514912605285645,6,True,False,False

And also, that I really enjoyed heroes 6 after the patches fixed it, and that i really dislike the obsession this community has that every game has to be exactly like heroes 3 or ""it's not a heroes game"".

This game just feels really sloppy in almost all aspects. As soon as you start the campaign, you are greeted with a static 3d screen of this guy's council. Are you serious? It's 2015, and this isn't an indie game, it's not priced like one, and you can't even animate this? At first i thought this was turned off as a performance option, but no. And there are plenty other similar ""cinematics"". Seriously ubisoft if you're gonna use static 3d scenes, DONT, use drawn scenes or something else instead.

The gameplay is actually allright, but it doesn't do anything new or different from the rest of the series, for multiplayer or single player vs AI you might as well just play 3, 5 or wathever your favorite installment of this series was, and the campaign is pretty lackluster compared to 6. I suppose two things i liked here was the hero progression in general with that skill wheel, and having more factions at release like Academy which is an old favorite of mine.

The game as a whole doesn't look that good. I wasn't expecting ultra-photorealistic graphics in my heroes game, but this doesn't look any better than 6 concerning texture quality and effects. Also re-used assets piss me off.
The units are the things that look the best in this game, and yet many heroes 6 versions still look better.

Considering heroes 6 was such a mess at release and was eventually patched into a decent game, i'm hoping this one can improve but right now it just isn't worth it at full price.",1443807655,1443809153,False,255,8,0.886522650718688965,6,True,False,False

pretty decent game given ALL the apparent bugs and glitches... once they improve on all these i feel like the rating for this game will skyrocket. though i will have to say its really disappointing to see no actual cinema when we are in a generation where its really simple to achieve.

2. Inadequate tooltips (at least in Russian). For example when I first got the heal spell during the campaign I read its tooltip and it said: heals 0-0 hp to damaged units ressurecting any dead units if it can. While at first heal does not resurrect and moreover it heals for a bit more than 0. Overall it's extremly common that tooltip gives you a range of damage and you deal damage lesser or greater than possible.
3. AI is really bad. While on the tactical map it barely works (it's awfull: it can not focus fire stacks, never waits even if it is reasonable, can try to kill a fire elem with fire... But combat AI never was a strong part of heroes), on the strategic map it's almost useless - it ignores loot, travels with empty heroes to your lands and more stupid things.
4. Campaign story is really boring. And campaign is too easy even on the highest difficulty level (it will be easy even if they increase all enemy troops by a factor of 1.5) almost all battles can be easily win with no losses, but AI is stupid and plays them very poor so autocombat is not a variant. This makes campaign even more boring, playing all subcampaigns looks like a torture (i gave up to boredom after one and a half).

Pros
- nice 3D models and particle effects
- dungeon and sylvan factions are back in the game (not DLC this time)

Cons
- a lot of bugs/crashes, it crashes for me during the start
- mission objectives are randomly not working (preventing player from finishing the campaign mission)
- very cheap cinematic
- cheap sounds
- no feel of progression, you have all missions except one unlocked from the beginning
- no progression in the missions - you can build every building and unit from the beginning
- a lot of models are re-used from HM 6
- Uplay is forced upon player again
- AI is dumb during combats

There is nothing that previous titles in the series have not done better already. Also shortage of new, fresh good ideas and overall feeling of laziness stems from the game on every corner.

Many users have reported issues with crashing (I have not experienced any crashes), multiplayer does not work (desynchs), and most importantly (in my opinion) units do not behave correctly on the tactical map. This is pretty standard stuff for a Ubisoft game, so unless you are a big Heroes of Might and Magic fan, like me, then you should hold off on buying the game.

------

Honestly, I'm surprised with how much I'm enjoying the game. I've sunk a ridiculous amount of time into every heroes entry since 3 (yes, even 6--I shit you not, I played it for over 250 hours). Fortunately, they have outright removed all of the awfulness from 6.

Hero leveling is fairly interesting. The schools of magic seem reasonably distinct and useful. I have an inkling that Prime might be a bit OP (seriously, the perk for teleport, +50 initiative, is very, very powerful, and time control, for its cost, is super useful). [b]UPDATE:[/b] Light magic is also overpowerd. Dear God retribution is absurd. If ALL of the schools are overpowerd, then I'm totally behind that design... but I feel like fire, water, and earth are probably lagging behind. We'll see.

They have massively reduced the ease of resurrecting units, to the point where you have to specialize pretty hard to be able to do it, which I think is appropriate.

There seems to be a good number of items. Not like heroes III, but respectable. Set bonuses can be very nice, and on larger maps where you get more items, mixing and matches these bonuses is good fun.

Factions are nice and distinct. Each has its own style of play, and they seem to be balanced by each being unbalanced, which I prefer.

Creatures are, for the most part, pretty good. There are some that I dislike for various reasons, such as pixies and dryads being way too similar in appearance, and others which seem either under-powered, or too difficult to reach critical mass (as in, they keep dying off in combats because the AI will prioritize targeting them). Some examples of these include blade-dancers (very low HP for an elite unit, melee, low growth, expensive creature building), vampires (melee, low growth, bugged--will come to that in a bit), lamasus, etc. I think a balance pass will fix most of these issues.

Town development is interesting and full of meaningful choices. Do you squeeze out a creature building before the end of the week, or are you fiscally responsible and prioritize getting your town hall up ASAP? It takes a lot of time and adventuring to obtain the resources to max out your town, especially since you'll also be recruiting creatures and a hero or two. 

Walls now come with a garrison, which can't be removed, and defend towns from those pesky 1 creature hero armies. Forts, and gates also come with garrisons, which fill over time for free, allowing some meaningful zones of control. 

Caravans are back! In IV, you could order a caravan, and it would magically appear after a set period of time. In VII, caravans are an actual unit on the map, with a high move speed, that can be interacted with by your heroes and by the enemy, so they can be somewhat risky if your territories aren't secured.

Finally, let's go ahead and mention that this game is buggy as all hell. I personally have not experienced any crashes, freezes, or issues with the SP campaign. I HAVE, however, noticed a lot of incorrect unit behavior in battles. Do not take any perks relating to your warfare units right now, because they are very glitchy, and perks seem to make it worse. I've noticed gnoll hunters don't always do what they're supposed to, the treant's abilities don't seem to work at all, and effects that trigger on damage/unit kills will not trigger on the battle-ending attack (so vampires don't lifesteal if they end the battle by killing something, and Djinn won't provide mana to your hero). Units sometimes also get really excited and decide to ignore their move speed, allowing them to cover the entire tactical map. Similarly, heroes will sometimes get a second wind on the campaign map for no discernible reason. Also, the AI is just terrible, both tactically and strategically.

So why the hell am I enjoying this game? Because it's a fucking Heroes of Might and Magic game, and it's got a lot of potential, and it's actually a well designed game. Also the music is quite nice.",1443803084,1443803084,False,15,1,0.554054081439971924,0,True,False,False

TLDR: AI is very dynamic and adjustable for people looking for a more challenging experience. Those complaining about ""slow gameplay"" might be new to the series or simply not used to it, being as it is a unique style of startagy game in general that isn't re-created every other day you log-into steam. (Zombie, Survival Sandbox, JRPG, Pixel Grapic Adventure Games, ect.) There have been very minimal bugs in my experiece though this may not be true for everyone. Campaign has been a blast although I did turn voices off because they have rarely been good in any game ever. This game should be cleaned up with a patch and will be solid gold for any true HoMM fan.  All this game needs is ""3DO"" at the beggining to make me smile even more.

I read a lot of complaints about the CGI being ""cheap"" and I honestly don't care myself so I may seem biased but if you really care about that enough to dislike the entire game then yes I would tell you that the cutscenes aren't mind-blowing. It's such a small fraction of the game though and really not worth being sour about considering whats beneath it all. It's your life, time, and energy though..use it as you like.

The AI is easy enough for begginers at normal difficulty or for someone learning the new dynamics of the game. If you want a real challenge then try Heroic difficulty to make all your masochistic dreams come true. I'm still picking my teeth up off the ground. You can select maps that will take you a few hours to an entire real time week long. Thats one of the reasons I like this game. I can play many different campaign types, start new maps to figure things out, play the same game for a very long time, or go online to play against other human beings. Lots of options on only a vanilla version of the game.

The maps are absolutely beautiful; serious nostaliga rolls in from every corner. The music is awesome, atmospheric, and engaging. Theres a glitch right now as of 10/2/2015 where the music stops looping. In battle this is more obvious but i'm sure this will be sorted out in less than a weeks time.

The skill wheel is awesome. You can build your city at amazing speeds right away with certain skills trees that help economic growth like being able to build twice in each holding every day or increase income of gold and resources. Caravans work wonderfully and when utilized correctly can help the flow of gameplay quite a bit. The maps offer tons of secrets and potential advatages if used correctly, potentially changing the flow of the game. The town screens are very nicely done and the progression tree for each very much pays homage to the older games of this series. You can make your heroes governors of certain holdings to gain great buffs and even spec into different types of magic as you go. The items in the vanilla version so far are awesome. Back to the old school in ways that HoMM VI really detered from.

My favorite part is that I never have to look at Uplay. I booted it up the first time and it asked me to sync my steam account. After I did that I simply just start the game through steam and it starts right away. After i'm done it syncs with the cloud and closes up through a HoMM splash screen on my desktop. I'm easily going to forget what Uplay looks like.

On top of all this, the map editor is absolutely stupendous.This game is a breath of fresh air for the HoMM series..finally! I feel bad for the people who are really frustrated with the game after only a few hours of gameplay but hopefully they get their refunds and move on to another game they truly enjoy playing.

A lot of people had problems with the game launching on the first day. For myself, I found that it would only launch through steam if I first had Uplay running in the background. As of this moment, I still need to have UPlay up or it will not launch through steam. There is also a significant wait time when I first launching the game. It's a minor annoyance at best that I think will be fixed at some point. 

As far as graphics go, they aren't bad. The screenshots are a little deceiving thought. The game screen is not as crisp as the screen shots would lead you to believe. They aren't bad but they could be cleaned up a little. What I really like is the artwork and design of the creatures. It's not just a copy of creatures from previous games either. There is a nice variety of creatures that are decently animated, for this type of game. But I almost suspect that some of the screen shots were touched up a little. 

I'm not really deep into the campiagns yet but so far, this one seems slightly easier than some of the previous campaigns from earlier games. So far, I've only played it on normal difficulty so I can't really speak on other difficulties. So far, I haven't had to restart  a map because of being overwhelmed by the enemy too early. I haven't played through all of the faction campaigns yet so maybe I have just gotten lucky so far.  It's a decent challenge so far but not overwhelming.

There are a large number of threads here and on the Ubi forums discussing game-breaking bugs and system compatability errors. In my case, the game uses 100% of the system disk throughput for 10 minutes while loading saved games, and then crashes silently. Across the board, for various reasons, stability seems to be a major problem with the game client.

When it does run without loading a game, it uses ~6GB of RAM and shows mediocre performance, which is hard to understand for a game with such unremarkable technical and graphical ambition. Any 4X game, including any from Ubi's own wonderful Anno franchise, provides a much larger and more complex world at a much lower RAM footprint and with better overall performance.

As much as I hate bringing price into any discussion about games, it should be said that $50 for a game that clearly has serious technical faults (even without considering the vast number of problems preventing people from even playing it) is unreasonable, especially when you consider how high the bar has been set for indie developers in the $15 range.

It starts up when you launch the game and then just sits in the background. Then it synchronizes your save files when you exit. That's it. Not to mention Uplay has some unlockable content such as a few more artifacts, a llama mount for your heroes, and different decals for underneath the heroes.

TLDR: I go into a lot of details, but overall 7 brings nothing to the table that 6 doesn't already do better.  And the graphics are really terrible.  Thanks to Steam's new refunds I'd recommend checking it out for yourself, but personally I'm going to be refunding this.

I've played every Heroes of Might and Magic game since 4 and I always look forward to the next iteration.  They've had their ups and downs over the years, but each game has changed the gameplay in a refreshing manner while still sticking true to what we've come to know and love about the series (for the most part).  Sadly, 7 falls FAR short of this.

First off the biggest and most upsetting part of the game that struck me right off: the art.  This is 2015.  Games are coming out each looking more beautiful and amazing than the last.  And yet this game looks like it came out 10 years ago.  You start the campaign to horribly low poly 3D models that they were even too lazy to even animate.  The 2D drawings that introduce the individual factions campaigns looks better than this horrific series of still shots of 3D models.  In game, the art is all much lower quality than it was in 6 as well, I even booted it back up afterwards just to make sure it wasn't my imagination.  I'm running both games on High and it's night and day between the two games with 6 easily looking far better.

But gameplay is what really matters at the heart of things.  I was willing to overlook the shockingly poor art quality if the game at least played well.  It doesn't.

I started on the Dungeon campaign since they're my favorite faction (YAY, they're not DLC this time!) and was insantly disapointed that everything looks exactly as if I were playing Heroes 6 (minus the crappy art of course).  The buildings your heroes interact with are all identical in appearance and functionality, most everything seems completly reused.  Navigation is the same as always as is town manegment (although more on that in a bit).  My first hero leveled up easily thanks to a 1k exp shrine and I was taken to the talent wheel to pick a new skill.  Selection seems to be drastically down from the customization you had in 6.  I can't comment on this too much though since I never got a hero to level 3 to select more than one new skill.

Combat is identical to 6.  Heroes behave exactly the same, attacking or using a spell once per turn.  Troops act based off of initiative and use luck and morale identically.  In fact the only difference I noticed at all in combat was that the game lied to me and told me that my units wouldn't be retaliated against when, in fact, they were causing me to lose half my assassin stack.  However, unlike in 6 there's no rewarding audio or animation on attacks.  Your units just sluggishly walk around the board and half-assedly wack your opponents with no real impact.  A large part of this is likely the lack of any real good audio cues possibly, but combat just seemed really dull and boring.

So back to town manegment.  Town screens are animated and look decent so that fiasco from 6 didn't repeat itself.  I do have to say that the town screen is actually quite beautiful.  The Dungeon town is by FAR the best looking art I saw in the game, if only the rest of the game had recieved the same treatment as this.  I'm not a fan of the building upgrade UI, but that's pretty minor.

Oh and Inferno fans?  Your faction was removed, so if you don't like playing the other factions you should probably steer clear.  Maybe they'll get the DLC treatment that Dungeon got in 6, but considering how much outrage that recieved I'm pretty shocked they did it again.  On second thought, maybe it's not actually that surprising.

So to wrap everything up, ultimately to me 7 feels like a DLC extension to 6.  The game looks the same (only worse), plays the same, and just doesn't seem to do anything that 6 isn't already doing just as well if not better.  The game also performs far worse on my computer for some reason, averaging around 20 FPS at High as opposed to the 50 FPS I get on High with 6.  The lack of Inferno as a faction is incredibly annoying and if it ends up being DLC as well it just seems incredibly greedy.  I'm going to be refunding the game and sticking to 6 since it just seems like a better game to me.",1443584345,1443750889,False,201,5,0.671799242496490479,3,True,False,False

It's true this game crashes and sometimes during critical fights (happent once for me) but it auto saves everyturn( some might say they saw forth the game crashing hens the auto save per turn feature).
I've done 2 parts of the story campaign on normal and really enjoy the story and how its told no glitches or issues at max settings.

The multiplayer aspect is anoying for someone as me that dosen't have a router that i can open the port on and hamachi isen't helping that much so i scratch that away.

The campaign mission can take along time to finish and give u a nice feel for the persons that you are controling.

The fights against enemy AI on normal is very easy atleast for someone like me that just stocks up on my army and come way to powerful into the fights wich makes every mission take way longer then it should.
The AI isen't as poor as people say here but they do tend to always go for that one target almost no matter what and it does make turning a fight that could have been difficult into a ranged happy hour.

But i enjoy this game and embrace the bugs and hope for them to be patched out. I mean honestly what can we expect from a game that's from ubisoft and runs with U-play.

I thought it was a disgrace that there was no support for windows 10. I spent hours upon hours screwing around with the settings etc, still nothing. Eventually they released the hot fix so I could play it. 

Initial thoughts were average, I can deal with the DX9 graphics, that’s not what HOMM is about its about gameplay. That being said I don’t actually mind the gameplay, I have only played a bit of the arcane campaign, I’m not sure if the other campaigns are as disjointed as this one, but it doesn’t have a flowing story through the campaign which is a bit weird. Not a massive fan of this. 

Sound and music are not the best, not the worst. Animations are ok, I think they just played it safe with respect to this game. But underneath it all there is a little bit of the Heroes 3 charm in there. I’m sticking with it. Still disgusted with the fact that they clearly did not test windows 10 capability but all in all the game is definitely worth playing through. It’s not HOMM3, but I think it’s a good addition to the series. Probably not worth full price, I’d wait for a sale if you’re on the fence about buying it.

Pros 
+Units and spell animations are beautifull, by far my favorite of the franchise (wait until you get the spell tsunami)
+Campaign so far has been great as far as pacing, you don't have to follow a specific path to win like in some of the others iterations of the franchise. I am on mission four or five of Wizard so it may be different for the other campaigns.
+Caravans and reinforcement spell! You rarely have to backtrack because you can now summon or caravan new units in pretty efficiently.
+Heroes are ridiculously powerfull, you can easily win battles that are not in your favor numbers wise with some tier 4 spells(I can see how that can be a negative for certain players though)
+ Maps take a lot less time to complete in comparison to Heroes 6 which I find a major plus due to the fact that I would get bored or have to stop and pick it up later half way through most of the really long maps on Heroes 6.

Negatives
- Story is weak(at least for wizard campaign). I dont really care for the protagonist mostly because there is very little dialogue.
- Clipscenes are still images with voices narrating the scene with the camera zooming in on the person ""talking"". Not sure if this was a poor design choice or laziness I am leaning towards the latter.
- Two of the wizards missions gave off a side quest feeling that did not offer anything to progress the main story line.  I hope I don't run into many more of these.


BUGS: The only bug I have run into with this game is a unit died on the final battle of the map and it wouldn't proceed to the next turn so I had to reload the fight. Also some of the spells you can use outside combat would occasionally not activate so you have to cast them again (pain in the ass for town recall). I am currently using an i7 12 Gig ram and a 670 nvidia graphics card.

Others have already pointed out the instability (black screen crashes where you can't even open task manager to close the game) and the horrible ""cinematics"" (that manage to be choppy despite being simply moving cameras through bad unanimated 3D scenes), so I will contend myself with pointing out the attrocious design of some of the levels. After all, cinematics can be ignored and crashes can be fixed, but levels really affect the fun you can have.

I started with the wizard campaign, the first level of which is possibly the worst designed level I've encountered in games.

You start with two heroes who at some point get separated. Nothing you do before they get separated really matters, because your troop counts get reset to the value the designers think you should have at this point anyway (I hadn't lost a single creature, but after the separation some were missing). While separated, there's a couple of gates that one hero can only open after the other hero unlocks it, meaning that usually one of your two heroes is not doing anything except wait in front of a gate.

These are just minor annoyances beside the fact that there's two spots in the level where you can pretty much randomly lose, through no real fault of yourself, making you resort to the autosaves to be able to play on.

The first is a ""riddle"" where you have to pull 4 levels in a specific order. The clues given don't seem to bear any meaning that I could decypher. Get it wrong three times and you have to fight an unwinnable fight.

The second auto-lose spot is right after. You get the mission to have your two heroes meet up and exchange a quest item (you don't really get a warning that this is your quest now btw, your path is simply blocked and you're supposed to check the quest log yourself to notice it's updated). After you exchange the item, you get a new quest to defeat the bad guy within 7 turns. Unless you knew ahead of time that this meant being close to the spirit gate that you now suddenly can travel through (it was nonfunctional before),  you probably are too far away from where you have to be to get there in time, meaning you have to open a savegame from before your heroes met up, make sure they meet up next to the gate and then continue.

Oh, and the quest item you got grants you a spell, castable once per combat that destroys the entire enemy army of the big climatic final fight in one spell cast.

During all that, there's a ""story"". In it, your lesbian protagonist is literally accused of beastiality because her lover is a djinn (looks like a lovely lady to me, shrug). Not that she seems to love her that much, because she doesn't try very hard to desuade her lover from killing herself so that she can have a bit more power to defeat the enemy (who, by the way, she sortof believes is on the right side, though that doesn't stop her from killing him anyway). Earlier you talk with a proud orc who vows to take some secret to his grave, until you threaten to kill him, after which he spills it immediately. After which you kill him anyway.

It is frankly impressive they managed to get so much wrong in a single level.

That it would grow from maybe a rather childish position, to a mature, sophisticated, excelent masterpiece. This is, of course, not entirely possible, since, I presume that certain types of games are always being produced for the same target age group of players. So I am allways a little disapointed when a new version doesn't meet my always increasing expectations. Anyways, I am sorry to say, that in the case of Might & Magic Heroes VII, my disappointment has more severe reasons.

Based on what has been presented for many months on the products home page (mmh7.ubi.com), I expected monumental visual experience and immersive, exciting gameplay.

Instead, the graphics of the game is many levels behind beautiful visual style and artworks presented on the homepage, obsolete by any standards, cheap and, in some parts, utterly unprofessional and shoddy. If the UI of the game was only by half as beautifull as is the web page, the day would be saved.

Cheap icons, which, somehow, do not fit the background. Uggly fonts with heavy drop shadows. Inconsistent color combinations. And, after all, that windowy user interface with a lot of old days buttons and scroll bars. All that brings the feeling of refusal and suffocation.

Gameplay is tedious and, in comparison with the previous version (Might and Magic: Heroes 6) doesn't bring any added value or refreshing novelty. Game as a whole is, dare I say, a very telling evidence of underbudget or mismanaged development project, especially when you see quite a good conceptual art.

From reasons mentioned, the game is simply not worth of money I spent on it. I has already submitted a refund application.",1443649986,1443682676,False,19,0,0.502592325210571289,0,True,False,False

TLDR: bad AI and slow gameplay. Stay away.

It's been said that this game would be the one to restore the old ways of doing things that 3DO and New World Computing had set in place. However, this is just a false promise meant to make you spend money on a cheap product that is glitchy and isn't even fun.

I'll start with the poor AI. It's worse than HOMM 3 AI. Yes you read that correctly, a game from 1999 has better AI than a game from 2015. I played a map on hard difficulty and found no difficulty at all. The AI is so dumb it's laughable. To explain, all of the neutral armies made serious mistakes that didn't even make sense. In battle, enemy melee fighters, for example, make movements that aren't even towards my army. They just made themselves fodder for my archers instead of causing me to take losses. The most annoying AI shortcoming of all, which made combats not challenging to the point of no-fun, was enemy archers defending instead of attacking. When I would move a single melee troop next to them to stop them from shooting the AI would just have the archers defend instead of move or attack to clear their path so they could shoot again. This was on hard difficulty. Don't get me wrong - I want to win but it shouldn't be that easy, especially on hard difficulty. Shouldn't AI maximize my losses on hard difficulty? At least in HOMM 3 that's what would happen. In this game it didn't even do that.

This game feels cheap too. The opening cinematic is a camera panning over stained glass. No nice animation or anything. The fonts are terrible and did I mention the crappy AI? It's also riddled with glitches; e.g. windows supposed to have text have none, creatures disappearing from the battlefield etc. Shouldn't this stuff been weeded out during the open beta that this game had? It really seems as though Ubisoft is just taking advantage of the dedicated fanbase that the HOMM series has and just churning out whatever crap it can slap the name on to make a quick buck.

If you can get past the rest of the garbage AI and poor quality that this game has to offer then you'll have to deal with the long winded slow gameplay that makes the rest of the HOMM franchise look as fast paced as Starcraft 2. In older games you could build up your army and move out quickly if you played intelligently. In Homm 7 there is so much trash in the way and reaching your high level creatures is such a pain (because of the town level system) that you get stuck within your zone control slowly amassing an army to move out just to get stopped by more trash outside of your zone. This change in strategy is amplified by the reduced movement speed of heroes compared to older games.

This game is a disgrace to the HOMM series and I can only hope that my refund request gets accepted. Don't make the same mistake I did, if you want HOMM you'll have to go back to the older games or just be disappointed like me.",1443682247,1443682247,False,501,22,0.90370786190032959,12,True,False,False

+ Looks good (way better than 6, due to Unreal engine)
+ Campaign is interesting
+ Towns are not the clusterfuck that Heroes 6 offered. This includes the looks, the upgrade tree (magic guild are back, choices which buildings to make / upgrade etc), ressources (7 this time) and overall design
+ New units
+ Characterprogression way better than Heroes 6 

Negatives:
- Weird cutscenes (3D-Models that are not animated with a voiceover - looks really cheap)
- Combat tooltips wrong sometimes (units retaliate even though the tooltip says they wont)
- Objectives not always clear (talking about campaign)

To adress some of the complaints in other reviews: I didnt have one crash in about 7,5h of playing. The sounds in combat do feel sluggisch, thought higher tier units tend to have way more satisfying sfx. Yes, Uplay, whatever, doesnt really bother me.

And I personally would recommend the current incarnation.

Oh, sure, it's far from perfect. They skimped on things that seem just silly to skimp on, especially for such a big name (company and game). Cutscenes and menus, and the interface in general, look like they were designed a good 10 years ago. The town screen is..okay.. but come on, when they had the majesty of H V's Haven to draw from? 

However, to me most of the drawbacks are fairly trivial, at least so far. It helps that so far I have not experienced a single bug or crash, unlike Heroes VI which I found to be simply unplayable at launch. Bitter disappointment that, was glad it didn't turn out similarly..though, I guess there's still time.

The graphics are good. Design, excellent. I'm alternating between this one and the Witcher 3, and I find no cause to complain about this.

The formula is the classical one, which to be fair it was what the fans expected. And it's good! Combat and hero progression feel vastly more satisfying than Heroes VI.

There are a number of blasts from the pasts which also make me glad - such as the return of the Magic Guild, Thieves Guild, and the War Machines of yore.

The new additions - or all that I've seen so far - are all to the good, if fairly minor. The hero skill progression is interesting. Combat wise, they've added in cover to the battlefields and flanking. There's a ""local guard"" added to castles, a fixed defence force you cannot remove, not too strong but decent. World map boosters last multiple battles.

Campaign and story, I like it.

- Unplayable multiplayer : tried to play with a friend in co-op, took ages in order to even get in a game together (port opening, static IP setup... really ?), and then out-of-sync error spam for like 20 turns starting at turn 5ish, until my friend gets stuck in a previous turn and can't play anymore because well... it's actually gone out of sync.

- No RMG outside of the editor ? If I want to play with a friend, I have to select one of very few predefined maps that support more than 2 players. I just want to select the number of players, a few variables, and have a randomly generated map to play on against some AIs, is that too much to ask ? It's that simple in Age of Wonders III.

- No spectator mode for your ally's battles ? All my friend got to do while I was playing my battle was watch a map, a progress bar, and listen to the sounds of the battle being played. Wow. Then again, in Age of Wonders III you have to watch battles that are being played. It gets dull to sit there watching other players do their things... but at least you have something more entertaining to watch than a noisy loading screen for f*ck's sake.

Other than that I have no real complaints about the game. It's got a nice style, and to me the graphics are fine and the animations are decent enough.

This game is soooooooo scaled down version of previous Heroes game. This game feels rushed and incomplete.

Where do i start:

1. The intro is not even properly done, its like pictures and you hear voices, no movements, no mouths that move when speaking, if you compare this to Heroes VI, i mean really, how could they drop the standards so much, they just wanted to rake in the money and not really put in much of an effort making this game.

2. Lots of things missing in the game and in game buttons, menu etc that was in previous game.

3. Graphics looks crap and i still say Heroes VI was better, even the combat looked better in Heroes VI, again scaled down quick buck rushed version this new Heroes VII.

4. Things i miss in combat (i cannot find this and might have missed it), this is small example but it made Heroes VI so much better than this game, example: When troops died in combat, you could check the stack and see how many died so that if you want to use resurrect spell you could check which stack of troops would benefit it the most if you lost troops from more than one stack, this is COMPLETELY GONE, no way to check what stack qty was so no idea which stack lost troops unless you keep track of this in your brain. WHY WHY remove that. It was very helpfull info during combat.

5. City view looks crap, like animation type picture, not even close to how nice Heroes VI was.

6. City building: A real stupid building tree and if you build one choice you cannot build the other choice. Confusing as well.

7. Spells, no proper tree to know what field of magic you want to go into, no way to check spells etc, so you have to choose blind between Air, Fire, Water etc. magic schools and not really know what spells you could cast. Also the spells are very limited.

8. Again info and tool tips not informative enough or non existant.

9. Skirmish maps, i saw like 8 maps, WOW i can really enjoy myself a lot (this is sarcasm). Then there is scenario maps but you limited in choice because of being a scenario, like who you play as, victory conditions etc.

10. Game rushes you once again, this has been a problem with all Heroes games and i really thought that they would listen to their clients because there has been loads complaining about this since game 1. You still have to rush and get everything as fast as possible, you also have to attack AI so quickly otherwise he will have 3 times more troops than you.
Example: Played 2 player skirmish, found AI Hero, had 3, 1 had the most of his troops, destroyed all 3 heroes, checked his only city, had like 40 troops between 4 stacks in defence, left AI to get the other goodies i had to leave because YOUR ALWAYS RUSHED IN THIS GAME, like 20 turns later, AI comes with his hero again, guess what, almost double the troops i have...NOW WHERE DID ALL THOSE TROOPS COME FROM, i destroyed everything, so even with my 20 turns later of adding more troops to my existing troops, the AI has more troops than me out of the BLUE!!???? So the cheating still in game, even on Easy difficulty.

11. This game feels like it was made with someone sitting in his garage and making his first game. This from people who brought out 6 titles before this crap game. This was rushed and NOT complete and then still want to sell it at such a HIGH price. Not worth the $50 or $60 (deluxe) price for this game. Should have been around $20-$30 price tag.

This is a game that has always needed tweeks and adjustments for a time after release (via patches).  Further, no version (save Heroes I) has been ""great"" until expansions were released.  Heroes 3 was best upon release and best post expansion.  For most of us who have played them all, H3 is the benchmark.  As of the first day of release, H7 comes close and I'll elaborate as to why below.

Heroes has always been a mix of turn-based-strategy and RPG with a big dose of ""discovery and conquest"".  Parts ""Risk"" and ""Civilization"", parts Chess and other such games, with decent stories, interesting Heroes, and a wide assortment of creatures to use in armies.

H7 is no exception.  In fact, developers intended for this to have some of the best elements of the series throughout its history.  While my final judgement will come after it is ""Complete"", I'd say this one is well on its way.

For players like myself, immersion is the key.  Does it get me invested in the battles and the urgencies that come with a strategy/rpg?  Am I excited about the discovery aspect?  Are there surprises along the way?  Is there a variety that keeps me interested and re-playing?  Answer:  YES.

Top that off with the best Map Editor (with a Random Map Generator) since H4 and its reasonable to conclude that this one has staying power.  One of the best parts about the Heroes Community, is the fan made maps shared via sites like Celestial Heavens and Maps4Heroes.  Keeps the game fresh and interesting.  Developers boast too that the editor has a modding element that make the possibilities endless.

In my house, we're playing the Hot Seat all the time with some combination of my wife, my 7 yr old daughter, my 15 yr old son and myself with my 4 yr old son rooting us on.

Now heres why this is a negative review. THIS GAME NEEDED AT LEAST ANOTHER YEAR of SOLID DEVELOPEMENT.

Period.

Everything from the reused units and animations and sounds from 6 (yet somehow they all feel and look crappier) to the fact it lacks SO MUCH POLISH badly, and not even in a ""this game crashes a lot"" way, but you constantly see units ""skate"" or ""hydroplane"" across the battle / campaign map or be doing an animation the wrong way (moonwalking orcs anyone!?) to just doing the wrong one flat out.

The sound is TERRIBLE, just anything from music to sound effects. Hell a lot aren't even synced up right with animations.

Those nice HOMM6 mission intros, outros and stuff? All the cinmatics are pictures of models that clearly had intended to be animated but aren't. It's hilarious.

The units look TERRIBLE not to mention some are just so stupid for the race, or even the entire races theme in general, anything from the fact that the haven faction is mostly reused stuff to nagas being called a medusa and now a dungeon unit... Trust me when I say the units look bad graphically AND theme wise for their respective race. Not to mention how pathetic towns look on the campaign map artwork (however the town screen itself is quite nice) it doesn't even change anymore at all it seems! I seriously doubt it does but it doesn't matter anyway because they all look terrible.

All in all, this game took a look at some of the old good heroes of M&M like 3 and 5 and SOME stuff of 6 and that stuff makes you WANT to like this game, it really does! However the glaring fact this games budget was slashed or time cut WAYYYYYYY too short, and the awful art direction race wise makes me honestly say avoid this game at all costs.

 Go to gog.com and get heroes of M&M 3 complete, the chronicles of tarnum (yes all 8 ((?)) of them) and HOMM5 complete and M&MH6.

Pros +

+Unit variation
+Artwork
+Town management
+Governors(Actually makes every hero usable, even if their not fighting)
+Warfare units
+Ambient music!!!! :D
+New one use scroll system
+Hero skill wheel
+Balanced range units
+Short AI turns

Cons -

-Campaign seems very unbalanced at the moment (would wait for fix)
-Some combat sound effects are a bit off
-A bit bright in my opinion even if bloom is not on 
-Multiplayer problems from what I have heard

I can't say too much about AI strength, I'm playing on hard atm and I haven't fought the AI yet. Monsters however seem to fight better. Some ranged units don't attack in close combat so they don't die for example.

Judging from previous games and this on it is definetly a 9/10 for me :)

Alas.  Among the issues I've discovered:

- Character animations appear to be broken and stuttery in many places.  (I'm looking at you trogladytes)  

- The intro video is done in a hybrid still-life characters / real time fire animation that actually made me think that the characters were frozen.  If they're not supposed to move, why does EVERYTHING ELSE move?  Seems like they ran out of time to make the cut-scenes animated and just said ""to heck with it.  Freeze them""  It's weird.  You'll think it's broken.  Seriously.

- The ""zoom"" animation they have going into battles is incredibly disorienting.  Not ""cool"", just disorienting.

- There's not enough contrast on the maps to see where anything is.  You'll frequently overlook things because they blend in too well.

- It doesn't scale well at large resolutions.  I've tried it at 2560 and 1980 resolutions, but fonts are too big, and combat dialogs appear half off the screen for a second or two before jumping where they should be.

- Something about combat just isn't exciting.  Maybe it's the music.  Maybe it's the textures.  Who knows, but I'm missing the coolness that was in previous Heroes games.  

- The list goes on and on (meaning I can't think of any right now but DARN IT I'm sure I will)!

[b]It is, at best, an unfinished project.
At worst, a mockery of all that Might & Magic stands for.[/b]

The animations and sound are worse than they were in V. The creature sounds in particular are even more sloppily done than before - it seems they let an intern play around with a soundboard from HoMM2 and applied a filter over it.

The gameplay itself tries to return to the HoMM1/2/3 roots while retaining most of the mechanics from V and VI, both the good ones and the clunky ones - the result is something that has absolutely no synergy and is generally just confusing.

The creature/faction balance is good, however. The addition of flanking adds a new depth to the battles, which make them as fun as we're used to. It is, unfortunately, a pearl floating on a pigsty. A very large pigsty.

The game itself is pretty, but things get very weird and jarring - the 'cutscenes' are a horrible mess of 3d characters that don't even get to have animations, the soundtrack is mostly HoMM VI's almost track-by-track.

[b]In short:[/b] the game brings nothing new to the table and only serves as a disappointment. Pick it up on 50% sale or more. At full price, it's a mockery. Just get VI or V - VII is a rushed, unfinished project that is barely fit for an open beta, let alone a 50€ release.

This game borrows heavily from all three of them. Necromancers are back as they should be - raising skeletons (and banshees) from the dead enemies, dragons are back (You now usually have a choice of last-tier unit) and the graphic style is a heavily modernized version of what you saw in III and Dark Messiah. The skill trees are more similar to the ones in HoMM V - which was the best in the series in that regard, I think - but it's not without ideas of its own.

The graphics look good, but my GFX 780 is struggling a bit at very high, but it's not bad. The graphic style is, for me, very good, they've  rolled back the 'reinvention' they did in #6.

The interface has a few problems - you can't see the stats of your hero while choosing what to upgrade from goodie huts, which is the most direct complaint I have.

The random map editor seems to be saving maps to the wrong directory by default. That is an easy fix, presumably, but it makes things just a tad bit more painful.

The hero creation seems to be confined to the map editor and I have not yet worked out a way to create my own hero for use across multiple maps - so far as I can work it out, it seems like the only way to play custom heroes is by editing them into individual maps. That's a pretty big pain and kind of a downer as I would much rather play my own custom than the premade heroes.

The campaign has a good story, but there are some flaws in the presentation. Namely that the opening ""cinematics"" aren't really animated. The council talks, there IS voice acting, but since nothing is animated you just end up with a camera panning around to look at still, unmoving faces.

On the second map of the Academy campaign, the enemy AI seeks refuge in a ""shelter"" of sorts and refuses to leave... leaving you unable to complete the map. You might be able to have one of your heroes make a B-line for the sanctuary and try to occupy it first, but I have not tested this. I have tried moving heroes away from the vicinity of the sancturary in order to lure out the enemy AI's hero, but that does not work. I even tried having my heroes garrison themselves in towns, but even that did not lure out the enemy AI. Thus, map 2 of the Academy campaign is not completed on my game.

Despite what some other users are saying, the game does run fine on my PC (windows 10) and has not crashed or had any sort of slow down. Uplay, while I don't particularly enjoy having to use it, also works fine. The game's graphics are nice, I like a lot of the animations for the spells and units, and the soundtrack is pretty nice so far.

I think that, overall, much effort was put into this game. If you take a moment to analyze the details, you can see that the team worked really hard on the game. I just don't believe that their hard work is finished yet. If the campaign is fixed (or that sanctuary shelter thing is removed), random maps generate in the right location, and you are able to actually make your hero in the game to play across multiple maps, then I would say that this game is much more in line with what I had hoped for. As it stands now, however, the inability to complete the Academy campaign, random map problems, and lack of my own hero are pretty disheartening.

Hopefully I am mistaken and there is a way to make your own hero, fix the location of random maps, etc.",1443569857,1443569857,False,62,1,0.589894592761993408,0,True,False,False

Just submitted for a refund on Steam. It's that bad. There is a real trend in the reviews posted on Metacritic so far that its ""The best of Heroes 3"". Look, I love Heroes 3. It was great. At the time. I still go back and play it every now and then. However, that is not what modern gaming should be compared to. The nostalgia glasses are very thick on this one, and it shows. The interface is very busy and clunky. The animations are clunky. It feels like they ran out of time or something because the opening scenes are mostly static images. The intro to each mission is drawn stills, and that's fine. The problem is the intro to the campaigns and such clearly were meant to be animated. 
The whole thing just feels so stiff. I think a good comparison would be the controls of X-com the original, VS the new X-com Enemy Unknown.

I won't even comment on the Uplay aspect as thousands already have and their complaints have clearly fallen on deaf (read: uninterested) ears as the platform is still being pushed. I will simply take you through my  Heroes 7 experience.

Giddy with delight at the prospect of playing a new Heroes game full of promise, judging by the pre-release gameplay videos, I purchased the game before release. Not just the game but the deluxe edition. As such there began a waiting period where Heroes 7 sat majestically in my library shining brightly like the bastion of turn based strategy I hoped it would be. If only I had looked a little deeper and seen the carefully woven fabrication or opened my nostrils and smelled the mile thick coating of polish that adorned the turd that was this latest Ubisoft offering. But i digress; the day finally arrived... it was ready to play.

With a slight tremor of excitement I moved my mouse to the play button and, as a lonely bead of nervous sweat rolled down my temple, with bated breath I pressed it. Little was I to know that was the most fun I'd have. After what seemed like an eternity there began an intro. 'Ok', i thought to myself, 'not too bad, don't judge yet' as the lacklustre video
continued. I arrived at the main menu and was instantly struck by the garish colours and dare i say lazy menu design. But yet again I resisted the urge to give up and pushed on; 'maybe the gameplay will make up for it' I thought to myself.

Having selected campaign there began a 'video' intro to the campaign. Now the observant among you will be wondering why i have left video in quotes. The campaign intro is in fact a series of static pictures that are pushed across the screen with some clunky, poorly acted dialog playing simultaneously. This all but confirmed in my mind my earlier  suspision of laziness. I then reached a point at which I could select one of several campaigns and lo and behold after choosing one i was treated to some more static images pushed across the screen with further uninspiring commentary. It was at this point I began to take some personal offence at the release of what I was already beginning to suspect was a shoddy, unfinished mess.

All this could have been forgiven however had the gameplay been of a high standard. To say the gameplay is clunky is to say the heart of the sun is a little warm. In comparison to other games in the series the movement around the campaign map and the combat both felt sluggish and mired.  While the faction town was visually appealing the menu was again  cumbersome and unwieldy and the town was lacking in customisation options. The hero skill wheels were disappointing too and provided dull, minor benefits at best. All in all the gameplay was as poorly implemented and devoid of innovation as all that had come before. After my campaign attempt I tried twice to begin a single player scenario. Both times the game crashed when trying to load the list of available scenarios. I struggle to comprehend how Heroes 7 made it through the testing phase to the point of release in the state it is. The only explanation i can think of is that somehow a build from very early in the development cycle has accidently been released (fingers crossed the mistake will be rectified).

And with my foray into the underwhelming gameplay the offence was complete. All that was left was to remove it from my system, scrub my eyes that they might recover from the horror they witnessed and try to move past the extreme regret i felt that day.

In conclusion: thank you Ubisoft for my 'deluxe' piece of garbage.",1443569091,1443569091,False,139,39,0.785757303237915039,2,True,False,False

First of all I played the campain for 5 min and i got a really bad feeling about it. 
They didn't even get the character animated  during the cinematic... WTF?!
So it pissed me off and after about 15 min of campain i was like ""nononononononono i'm just gonna try a normal game""
So i tried..
and it was not too bad!
-Graphism are not the greatest but it do the job (honestly i don't care about that for a HMM)
-The good old system for the castles is back with the 7 different types of ressources (which is pretty cool)
-the heroes upgrade is intuitive but i don't really like the wheel 
-I found the IA a bit slow, I played a 4 players map and  I sometimes have to wait a bit for my turn (even if i put the IA speed at 400%)
-castles upgrade is nice and with a bit of tactics (but really not much)
-good nostalgic feeling building up my 1000 skeletons before roaming on the map :D
-auto combat available against neutral army i like it (and it sometimes play  better than me haha)
So overall it's not too bad. Not the greatest HMM and i will most probably not touch the campaign before i got nothing left to do but definitly better than the crazy system from HMM6 and good enough for me to spend a lot of hours on it.
I would still recommand it, and if i could give it a grade, I would say 6/10 maybe more if the campaign is good (but again i got a really bad impression of it)",1443568990,1443568990,True,28,4,0.538289248943328857,3,True,False,False

For all it's flaws, I enjoyed Heroes 6, but hated the arbitrary difficulty the AI received in the campaigns.  I have played all the other Heroes games, with 2 and 3 probably being among my favorites.

I was excited to get into a new Heroes game, with fresh updates on graphics and gameplay.  What I got was a whole lot of disappointment.

While the graphics look nice, I feel like 6 was cleaner looking and in motion.  The animations are clunky, from movement to attacks.  And the combat sounds.  Oh good grief, the combat sounds.  They are either horrible, or flat out don't exist.  There are no impact noises to speak of.  The music will play once through, then just stop.  So you are playing a battle, which should be exciting, without much combat sounds, and no music.  It's horrible, and ruins the gameplay for me.  

And the don't get me started on the cinematics.  They are atrocious.  It's 2015, and every charcter stands frozen like a statue, giving speeches without moving lips or their bodies.  I enjoyed the opening cinematic from Heroes 3 far more than I did this one, which is saying something.

Until these things are fixed (specifically the buggy sounds, and the non existant sounds), I have no desire to play this game.  It should never have come out of beta like this, and needs quite a bit more time to develop.  I cannot recommend this game, and that saddens me, for my first review and because it's a franchise I love.  If the game gets updated and fixed to work properly, I will edit my review.

Definately not worth the release price, even if you are a fan of the series.

I am a fan of the Heroes series and I also dislike Ubisoft to the point where it is usually a deciding factor in not buying one of thieir products. However, I will never let this get to the point of me missing out on a great experience.

To the game itself:

On launch (once you get past any uplay annoyances, some may experience none, some may) the game presents itself as a rusty old game. Shamefull still camera shots with voice dialog and poorly rendered images. You honestly need to see it to believe you just bought a AAA release. I felt like I was playing an Alpha, let alone beta/early access.

Wanting to really enjoy this game i skipped to the actual gameplay. They have kind of gone back to thier roots, it does feel alot more like 3 or 5 but without any polish. The map is awkward to control but suffienct. The graphics are nothing like the screenshots (I play on max, which doesnt take a super comp). I liked the gameplay, it was very much more of the same (heroes 6) but felt a bit shallow. I thought I was enjoying it but before I'd played an hour I was very much telling myself I can't wait to play this game when they have done testing and optimising, before remembering this is the full release.

3. unit, heroes everything moves slowly. you may say i can simply fix this problem by speed up at option category. sure.... problem is, when you max speed up on unit, sound effects are not provided. so during in battle, what you hear will be some background music, and bit of sound effects when the turn started.

i did hate homm 6, and thought it was worst game during homm series..

but no, this IS THE WORST ONE.
if you dont belive me, just buy the game and play it
im sure u can't play it for 7~8 hours to make good reviews. playing this game is another good way to present you a decent pain in your ass :) thx",1443531179,1443541932,False,80,9,0.146591454744338989,16,True,False,False

They should have used the ""Unity"" engine for better in-game menus as the palette used is rather bland.  Would even say it looks a mess.

Also it is very odd with the main war screen having chars there that are not animated at all when they speak, yet its all in a 3d enviroment, the candles move and the screen scrolls around the  3d chars but no movement with them just the voices.  Did the main animator leave the company before they finished the game? All the char pics are either non moving puppets or 2d pics, a bit of a miss with todays tech level. 

I will still recommend this game as its still a ""Might and Magic"" game but like so many games released looks like the skill level of devs/animators/Logic is far lower than what it used to be, to many rose coloured specs wanting to make millions with there console/phone programming lack of skills.  To much airwear released of late

Cons:
- The graphics are awful given that this is 2015 (I'm playing on max settings)
-  I don't know if this is a bug or just a horrible choice by the dev team but nobody moves their mouth when speaking in cinematics
- I am unable to find a way to show a grid when moving in the world or in combat which (at least for combat) is extremely annoying)",1443530624,1443530624,False,100,5,0.281184196472167969,5,True,False,False
