[h3]First the good things about Portia.[/h3] 
[i]
-The graphics are cute. I like the aesthetic, it's clearly not trying too hard to be edgy or overly details. I feel that the way the game looks fits the game-play pretty well.
-There are plenty of things to do. Between fishing, farming, ruin diving, sucking up to the locals and trying to complete commissions, there are plenty of things to keep you occupied whilst you play.
[/i]

-The relationship system sucks! it takes WAY too long to grind reputation with people even once you've figured out their preferred gifts. The dating system is absurd and unrewarding
- The commissions are boring and repetitive. Even the story-line commissions just feel like arbitrary time gates to the next piece of content. You will spend most of your time initially gathering materials from ruins and then the remainder of your game waiting for the machines in your workshop to complete their tasks which are again arbitrarily long. By the time you're half way through the story-line you'll be just sleeping days away to try to speed things up.
-The commissions are unrewarding. The rewards for the work just suck. 
-Everything is time-gated. The amount of times you have to go and speak to the researchers because someone just had an idea about a new project is laughable. It's pretty lazy and just adds more time wasting to the game.
-The combat is just appallingly bad. It just is. It's slow, clunky and boring.
-The game does a lousy job of explaining how special events work. You end up having to go back through the ""help"" by which time it's often too late.
-The pacing is bad. Everything takes SOOOO long! I get that this is meant to be a comfort game and that you aren't supposed to be running around like a lunatic all the time, but Even the most basic tasks take days or even weeks to complete, and huge chunks of the game are gated behind days of grinding to afford the upgrades to the workshop or your house or the yard.
[/i]

So my TL;DR is this: My Time at Portia isn't a Bad game so much as incredibly convoluted. If you want a slow paced game where there are constant arbitrary reasons why you can't do certain things, and everything takes forever, then this is the game for you.

EDIT: I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO 100% THIS GAME. it is extremely difficult and time consuming - but only because you have to marry specific characters in the game in specific ways for achievements - I am not a fan of having specific romantic relationships be an achievement when it locks you out of other things too 

PROS: 

1. You can spend time just messing around - story specific quests you can take your time on - and usually there is no due date on it either so you are able to go at your own pace. You still have the side quests that are timed and the build requests that are timed - but it allows you to be able to stock up on materials or money that you may need early on

2. Leveling up is not locked - you could kick trees for HOURS to get to the max level before doing one quest, to me, it can make things a bit more enjoyable since it seems like there arent any hard blocks on when you can level and it again - at your own pace

3. You can lose yourself in the grind - there is a reason I have 200 plus hours in the game, it is way too easy to be able to chill and fish, get your workshop running, fill out relics, etc. etc. - after a long day it is SO relaxing at times and quite nice

CONS: 

1. sounds/animations - certain sounds dont match, such as when a horse is running, or when it is running through the fountain water or on the stone/dirt/metal/grass etc. Also specifically for the horses it will still show the sprint animation even when going walking speed at some points...it quite weird. The other characters in the game that ride horses, it is a glitching mess. they will spend 5 ingame hours just glitching on and off their horse all over the map - it is just...bizzare

2. pathing - some characters will just run into a wall for 5 minutes and just dont get to their next destination until they glitch out because they time they are supposed to be somewhere isnt met - teleportation them to the correct place. 

3. colorful llama - its just fucking horrifying. When you pet a llama I can see the firey pits of hell in those unblinking eyes from a psychotic serial killer nightmare demon thing. I named mine Steve because a cute name just didn't sit right for a abysmal beast such as that, I am pretty sure I will have to make weekly sacrifices to that thing at some point in the game

4. character models of animals/monsters/fish - farm animals look like 2 different art styles were slammed together, the cows and sheep dont feel like they belong in the same game together - they ARE cute though, just not consistent. Fish are good for the most part - certain fish though (looking at you king frog fish and king golden salmon and King wise fish) arent consistent. You have comic looking fish and then a realistic salmon, and the naming convention for the king wise fish is also not consistent (wiser fish). King frog fish didnt feel like near as much effort was put into it as the other kings with a blue stripe instead of a green stripe and thats all. The monsters...I dont even know whats up with that shit ngl. you have sentient bugs and humanoids, and then you have sea urchins in balloons? wtf is going on there. I feel like morally in the wrong for killing Mr and Mrs Ladybug - obviously they know enough to get married and wear glasses but I need to steal their eggs to feed my fish so they have to die, sorry. Monsters are also not consistent with the design, some look comical and silly, and others dont, you have sentient ladybugs but regular looking spiders? you have a blobfish looking thing with legs and then a bird wearing a hat? There is also not a way to catalog the monsters and the loot they drop - it is pretty frustrating trying to remember what drops what. 

5. Lack of Emotions: holy fuck these people are psychos. I try to give my married partner a kiss or cute photo my character and theirs just stand there, unblinking, unwavering, unsmiling. EVERYONE stares and looks like that, I have NEVER seen a smile from these characters or any other emotion for that matter - it is horrifying 

6. Certain items are hard to get with the constant need of them - looking at you tempering liquid!!!! 

Overall I am probably still going to play - but I am going to be killing all colorful llamas ON SITE. Main problems are really just consistency and lack of guides and information, and the tutorials that are there are not really THAT amazing",1665945875,1705852494,False,0,0,0.478227078914642334,0,True,False,False

[h3]crafting[/h3]
Oh yes, the crafting, the sweet sweet progression of collecting ores, turning into bars, processing into plates and pipes, and so much more. Extremely addicting loop of mine, craft and sell only mired by the annoying market rare mechanic, which is the next point of discussion.

[h2]The Bad:[/h2]
[h2]Market rate mechanic[/h2]
Simply put, it's annoying to not get full value out of your sales because of market rate, and with merchants only have fixed amount of money on hand (like Skyrim lol), I had to constantly sell my stuff at much lower rates than I should have been doing because there wasn't enough money on merchants on selling days (120%+ days). I'd rather they be kept at 100% throughout with some days giving you a special discount on purchases only, and that's it. That would be lovely. Ultimately, the market rate doesn't mean anything because the player just ends up hoarding a lot of crafted stuff, sell some on high rate days, be unable to sell the rest until the next few days when the rates go down again. End-game, it doesn't matter, because merchants are hardly able to afford much of player's items, so 71% rate hardly makes any difference to the player.

[h3]limited music[/h3]
There are only a couple of surprisingly very short music tracks for each season, and the same one plays all day long, starts to get a little too repetitive, especially the combat theme, which frankly gets super-jarring after a while. Having longer tracks/ambient tracks/random selections or something along those lines would help a lot.

[h2]combat[/h2]
Frankly, combat is exhausting in this game. I found myself ignoring most of the sentidogs and sentinelbots in later sections of the game, just rushing from point A to point B most of the time, cuz monsters were such sponges and dealt too much damage. I mean 8 hits to kill 1 guy, c'mon, and I have maxed attack from my house bonus. Lack of weapon upgrades might have played a part in this as well. 

[h2]lack of stamina regen stat/items[/h2]
Early on in the game, the loop is just: work, run out of stamina, go to bed, start next day, work, run out of stamina, then go to bed and rinse and repeat. Later, it's just spamming from 999 tasteless broths or apple slices. I think having food should give stamina regen, yes a new stat, for a limited amount of time, along with a couple of items available right from the start of the game and getting better versions of along the way that give stamina regen would be nice.

The thing is, the world feels kind of empty and one dimensional, the combat is boring, and progression isn't satisfying.

There's no motivation to explore, as chests and secrets are more or less useless, and much of the environment feels stamped and homogeneous. Once you get past the light saturation, it could be a very pretty game with just a touch more effort. I'm all for the cartoon art style, but something about this doesn't quite hit right. Maybe it goes back to the lighting engine. Very flat shadows, nothing pretty to look at volumetrically or even on backdrops such as stars or sunsets.

The combat is so bland and repetitive that I actually found myself dreading it and going out of my way to avoid it. There's no gimmicks, let alone actual mechanics. It's just ping pong with damage numbers.

And as for item progression, you start out with a small backpack that forces you to shuttle items like mad, and end with a bunch of chests to dump items from a backpack that never quite gets large enough. So you end where you started. Shuttling items like mad. Except now you have to sort everything. And weapons change a little bit. Also at some point five gidgets made one gadget but now a hundred widgets make one wadget.

They forced a little Stardew Valley in there somehow with the whole relationship thing. But without the rich storytelling it was just sort of there. I wasn't drawn into that at all.

It's a cute game, and I adore the concept. I would definitely buy it on sale, but don't expect a lot from it. Maybe a few days at best, but don't expect replayability or to stay entertained for very long.

- Level design is kinda bad, particularly the collapsed wasteland. Lots of empty space and awkward terrain.
- Pointless items and features that haven't been fully implemented (Unkown Recipe books, Mount happiness and loyalty)

[i]Crafting and ruin diving:[/i] The most important part of Portia's gameplay is crafting. It is kinda basic, you collect resources and you build stuff from them, on the worktables. On later recipies you need to process the materials first, on different types of worktables. In late game you can automate the whole building process.
The interesting part here is the ruin diving. To get wooden resources, you need tro cut trees, but for minerals and hard to acquire tech parts, you need to go to these ruins, where you mine stuff, until you find what you need, or run out of stamina. Also, here you can find different relic parts, which you can assemble into relics. You can sell these, or use them as decoration.
[i]Homestead and farming:[/i] You have your own home in game, which you can upgrade, expand it's territory and add new buldings to it. The problem here is, that all of these are pre made buildings, so you can only customize there position and the decoratrion items you put down. Worth to  mention decoration items give you stat bonuses.
Also, you can grow plants and harvest them, so you can use them for crafting or cooking. There are some parts that you can automatize, but not much.
[i]Social and family:[/i] There are a lot of social elements in the game. You interact with the residents of the town, befriend them, romance them etc. There are fun seasonal events, to break the monotony of the game. 
You can even marry and have kids. But this part fills unfinished. The kids never grow up and your spouse never helps you taking care for them. So they add nothing to the game, jus tan extra daily chore. Some spouses work as a helper around the farm and animals you have, but not all of them, so there are some, who adds nothing to you in the game.
[i]Combat:[/i] The combat is pretty basic, hack'n slash type, but not a big focus of the game, and for most bosses you can just let NPC-s kill them. On storybosses you hAve infinite lives to revive mid fight, so there are no real stakes.
The annyoing part of this is the equipment. You get one the 2nd best weapon of the game.. after you beat the main story boss and you get the best weapon, after beating of the last level of the 110 lvl dungeon.
[b]10/7[/b]

[b]-- GRAPHICS --[/b]
Well, for a 2019 game of this age, it is not bad. The artstyle though... The world looks good, but the characters are really ugly.
[b]10/6[/b]

[b]-- STORY --[/b]
The story is short, with a constant green message on the background. Not an epic tale, but matches the game's style.
[b]10/[/b]

[b]-- CHARACTERS --[/b]
Sadly, not all characters are handled the same. Especially romances. There are some with their own questlines, on romancing them or befriending them, achievments tied to them, and there are some who just there. You can marry them, but no special quests or anything.
[b]10/6[/b]

[b]-- REPLAYABILITY --[/b]
No new game plus, no harder difficulty, all achievments can be earned in one character. You can find replay value in it though, since this is a life simulator, first and foremost.
[b]10/7[/b]

[b]--TL;DR--[/b]
My Time at Portia is a fun game. Sometimes feels really slow and grindy, but that is by design, since this is a life sim game.
If you enjoy games like this, you will enjoy this too.

That being said, the game is absolutely massive. There is so much to do and see, so many characters to get to know, I found myself constantly discovering new mechanics and features even up to the very end. The game really successfully manages to serve as a portal into a whole nother world, it feels like a second life more than a game really. The art style is very childish, unique, lighthearted and above all, extremely consistent which makes for a super immersive world.

Subjectively bad: The art style is absolutely horrible, especially the human models and the ores/mining. Everyone looks horrific, like some nightmare fuel puppet that was modeled/textured by a drop-out artist. The cosy feeling of a somewhat vibrant world is ruined by these ugly-faced creatures I need to talk to all the time.

Objectively bad: The colors when mining are very, very hard to distinguish - I'm not colorblind, I have 20/20 vision and it's still a massive strain on the eyes to try and tell where ores are and where stone/sand is.

Then there's the crashes. I don't know what's up with this horrible ""save when sleeping"" concept but developers need to stop and drop it. I could be 95% done with activities for a day, out of stamina, out of anything to do, then boom - game needs to close because it shat the bed. I re-open the game and I'm at the very start of the day, in the bed, no progress saved.

Why??? Why not have an autosave that cannot be loaded from or anything like that, but simply as a backup if game dies? Even every 5min would be more than okay, I can deal with 5min of progress lost.

Game is not good enough for me to spend time modding it unfortunately, and as I've learned, the developers also took the same route and made another game lol.

The English VAs were all carefully selected from a single list that met one or more of the following criteria:
Gay
Woman

The scouts need to branch out from the coast for their VAs.  Every young male speaks with the same quirky, lispy LA style coquettish accent.  Women VAs were tolerable but once again, mistook this as their opportunity to oversell their VA abilities.  And the elders/parents are voiced by 30 somethings.  It's distracting.  When the village elder sounds like the guy next to him half his age, someone needs replacing.

There's a marketplace that features the rising and falling values of goods.

Mods truly did save this game for me. It has a wonderful, enjoyable core and nothing but rough edges. Thanks to mods, I am part of a [b]tiny[/b] percentage of people that actually finished the game, and the publisher got my money for the sequel. 

That's a win-win. 

[b]Mods I'd Recommend[/b] (All found on Nexus Mods)
[list]
    [*][i]Storage Anywhere[/i]: Name says it all. Top recommendation.
    [*][i]Your Game Your Settings[/i]: Highly recommended. Improves (fixes) the pace of the game.
    [*][i]Inventory Gift Highlights[/i]: Keeps track of how people react to gifts you given.
    [*][i]Storage Size[/i]: Helpful but not essential.
[/list]

[b]The Spoiler-Free Problems:[/b]
[list]
    [*]Scheduled events can overlap and even cancel each other out.
    [*]You can take on quests/contracts you have no way of completing (and have no way of knowing), failing them permanently.
    [*]Voice acting is regularly absent or doesn't match the text.
    [*]Sound effects is often missing entirely. 
    [*]Everything is drawn out. Build times, prices, leveling, travel times.
[/list]

[b]But The Big One...[/b]
Inventory management is horrendous. You build your own storage boxes, manually manage them, name them, organize them, and whenever you need something, you have to visually search through hundreds of icons. No filters, no search, no sorting, no text (until you hover over them).

This problem affects everything. In many contexts, you need to have items not only in your personal inventory, but sometimes directly in your action bar. And if you forget something, you have to run all the way back to your house. [b]Slowly[/b]. 

Honestly, I'm torn between Hanlon's Razor and wondering if they had planned on selling ""solutions,"" but weren't able to polish the game enough to justify it.

It feels like a low-effort, rushed, unfinished cash-grab attempt to mimic quality games like Stardew Valley (if you haven't played SV, please look into that first). Portia, unfortunately, will never live up to the standard. They're already working on a 2nd sequel with clear problems remaining in this 1st game in the series.

Pros: it is somewhat addictive, and it is a 3D open-world game, for what that's worth. The crafting/assembling can be fun, and some of the character arcs are cute. Lots of upgrading goals, lots of missions, etc. Friendships advance as you take quests, give gifts, or go out to ""play"" (hang out) with characters. The romance aspect is sweet and pure. The festivals can be fun, once you figure them out. Background scenery is artistic in a cute style. You can tell they made an effort to make combat progressively more difficult as you level up. If you're like me and have already given 500+ hours each to SV and Animal Crossing and want another cute farming/crafting game to play, it will scratch the itch until you're able to save up for Faefarm.

Cons: Voice acting is AWFUL. I turned it off within the first 5 minutes. Character faces in-game are SUPER uncanny (not the same as the art on the store page). All of their faces creep me out, except for maybe 2-3 of them. Animation is just bad. For example, when your character jumps, animation is delayed and looks really unnatural. Similar character types clearly have the same exact gesture movement each time you talk to them. Combat is affected by poor/delayed animation, making some of them Nintendo hard just because of a glitch. Hitboxes tend to move either before or after the enemy does. There are lots of ""invisible walls"" and places you can fall off the map and get stuck, especially in dungeons on the boss level, forcing you to reload the game and go through the whole dungeon over again. Dungeons are procedurally generated, and they get longer as you level up but without any more variation so it gets really old going through the same 3 levels over and over. There is no such thing as fall damage (maybe a perk?). Literally, you can just run off cliffs and be fine. Some of the side characters have interactions that just don't make any sense. It can be hilariously bad. Last but not least, this game is made by the CCP (look up Pathea). 

All in all, I'd say make sure you exhaust all of your better options before considering this game, and if you are just THAT bored, make sure you get it on sale. It is not worth full price.",1701048167,1701048303,False,2,0,0.484886646270751953,0,True,False,False

In contrast to most games, my 90+ hour playtime does not equate with deeper investment. Quite the contrary; the more I played Portia, the less I liked it. My biggest issue with the game is that production takes an *incredible* amount of time. What is fun at first quickly turns to dread when later blueprints require dozens of parts, themselves each requiring slow-to-process materials, which must be individually produced on expensive machines. Again, all this would be fine under different circumstances but the time gating slows down the pace far too much.

The combat is serviceable. The gathering resources is enjoyable, and the actual assembly of larger items is quite satisfying. The character design is simple but distinct, and the minigames are enjoyable enough. It's just the massive time wall that comes between you and any serious progression. 

Overall I'd give a 'maybe' if I could. It is a pretty, charming game that only really begins to show its rough edges once you've dug into the true meat of the experience.

It's a game where I frequently ask myself ""What do I want to do today?"" and I go do it, I can dig for artifacts, battle monsters to get loot, snap up commissions and build things, or spend a day fishing with my spouse, but there's nothing that I feel I NEED to do. If I don't want to fish or farm I don't, if I don't want to fulfill a commission I don't take it, and most commissions have enough time on them I've never felt the need to rush or grind for materials for them. This is a game where I can take a deep breath and play at the slow meandering pace that I like to play games at. 

There are a few things that are less than ideal in game, it's possible to run into commission requests where the area to gather the resources needed has not been unlocked yet but after the first time I just am more careful about taking on commissions for items I haven't' created yet. I also don't love the fishing mechanic but as stated prior, I don't fish if I don't want too which is most of the time.

666140,149927322,76561198800261101,0,26,675,0,675,1694767083,"Decided I had enough of this game and here is why:

1. Ugly visuals: The graphics arenât half-bad but the art direction is just so generic and bad. Even the music has this kind of happy-go-lucky feel to it which feels especially degrading when the entire game reeks of capitalist propaganda where the plot is literally just a guy âmaking a name for himselfâ by kowtowing to a system and its rules unquestioningly. Sorry if this is a bit edgy but thereâs very little in the way of flair or individuality in the way this game is presented. Itâs as basic as it gets and in a meta kind of way truly lives up to its own premise: a bland, institutionalised piece of work that I donât know why anyone who loves video games would find enjoyable. You come home from tedious work only to play a game where youâre subjected to..more tedious work? It simply does not excite the imagination.

2. Tedious gameplay loop: So it follows the farm-build-collect structure that a lot of the games in this genre does, exceptâ¦building requires you to wait a pre-set amount of times and the only way to lessen the pain is by building more machines. Resources are also only available in specific locations and so thereâs virtually no player expression. You figure out how and where to get things and itâs just a matter of seeing it through, often in an arbitrarily amount of time. I felt like my time was disrespected when I played this game, as if the developers had absolutely no regard for my enjoyment and just complacently assumed that weâd all fall for this crap for no reason when thereâre far more superior games in the genre. Also the combat is a joke, and thereâs never a sense of discovery both in the mechanics and the world. Iâm not encouraged or motivated to explore, I just want to get to points A and B where I know thatâs where the resources are and finish my tasks ASAP before my stamina or attention runs out. Does this sound fun to you? Because it certainly didnât for me.

3. Terrible world design: The denizens in Portia are all one-dimensional, uninteresting quest givers with no real substance to them. You donât feel like youâre let loose in a lived-in world. I didnât look forward to returning to the world of Portia to unearth new stories or enact new adventures. Instead the plasticity and the gaminess of everything is just so nakedly presented to the player that you end up losing all sense of immersion. Characters give you fetch quests with no real import, their relationship to you makes the grand difference of one more generic dialogue when you go to them and click a button on top of their heads (riveting gameplay I know), and thereâs no dynamic events, interesting backstory or anything that might induce a chuckle. Think A Short Hike and its cast of eccentric characters. Thatâs how you make a charming world, and you donât even need a AAA budget to pull that off. This is just lazy and uninspired.

The game plays like a mobile game, feels like a mobile game, and looks like a mobile game. It reminds me of the early Facebook restaurant/zoo simulators where they make the gamers wait for so long to build something so that they can start selling you speed-up packs. It has no charm, no personality and worst of all, no payoff. It barely held my interest while I was playing it and thereâs no way in hell Iâm ever going to finish this.",1699702729,1699702729,False,4,5,0.480812221765518188,0,True,False,False

Pros:  NPC interactions are satisfying and lead to new areas of play
          -At about the time you are tired of walking everywhere, you get a faster way to navigate.
         -The daily task board keeps you busy.
         -Story line was fine.
           -If you stay up too late, you just end up back in bed.
             -Battling enemies stays safely in the ""casual"" level of difficulty, except in one of the mines where the difficulty is kinda the point (and you can just not go there if you want.)

Cons:  -The dating is a big part of this game, requiring participation in a bunch of mini games.  I hate dating mechanics, and you even have to watch your character actually kiss the NPC, which is weird, a little cringe, and also annoyingly repetitive if you are trying to level up their hearts with you.   I could have continued a little longer after I beat the story line, but my ""husband"" just annoyed the crap out of me.  But you can just wholesale ignore this part of the game if you want to and still really enjoy it.

farming comes later, i was a lil disappointed at that, but getting to know the area, gathering supplies... it was too much fun not to explore. Forging and mining metals, cutting down trees for so many types of items to create like clothing and in house rugs even!  
building on top of the old house you get. paint the walls, board and floors. upgrading the house entirely. adding collectibles you find or make. 
my fav part is that there are a lot of NPCs who you actually meet and chat with. I usually ignore all that, but it's quite engaging. also you can give gifts to the NPCs you like, to make them like you more. you can even get a husband or wife. 
Caution! this game is meant to played for a long while, there's no real instant gratification, it takes a lot of time. (months in game) to acquire better housing, money and equipment, HINT; you can slow down in game time if you need to or just go to bed to quickly pass the time. google is your friend on holidays. (look at your calendar and prepare ahead of times for the upcoming events.  

~CON~ Enemies don't fight back, at all. there's some bug and I don't know why, but it's free real estate. so I just sell all the HP stuff. also, running expends stamina. there's a LOT of running.  
graphics are what you see. some events are a bit confusing, but you can reload. (or google before hand)

+++++  Great graphics, slick controls, interesting game world and story.  Fun combat.  Customizable main character.  There seems to be plenty to do and work towards.

-----  Few transportation options.  Few armor/clothing options.  Farming is currently confined to planters.  I haven't seen any sort of projectile weapons in the game.

I loved learning more about the people that inhabit this interesting world. It's a great touch that Portians have their own social circles and becoming better friends with someone will improve relationships with people who are close to them. The progression of the game feels nice as you're slowly able to make better equipment, earn enough money to order resources instead of gathering them yourself, and unlock new areas with new activities. Some days feel a bit overwhelming with the number of quests and requests, and the end game drags on a little, but the story is fun to experience.

Unfortunately, the game lacks polish. Some characters (e.g., Dana) are very underdeveloped compared to the others. There are many lines of dialogue that aren't voice acted, some voice lines occasionally have poor sound quality, some characters seem to have multiple voice actors and some of the dialogue is written in broken English (e.g., a lot of Dr. Xu's lines). The characters occasionally get stuck walking in place or getting on and off a horse. The world also seems too big with various areas feeling rather empty and pointless, but perhaps that's intentional, since it's a post-apocalyptic world.

There's no crosshair, which wouldn't be that big of an issue if you could target specific enemies or lock onto specific enemies, but the game automatically and arbitrarily decides which enemy you meant to target and not actually and intentionally swung at. 
This game will teleport you to the ""nearest"" enemy regardless of where you are and where the enemy is. 
You will teleport into a wall, you will teleport into a hazard and get poisoned and die because poison is a slow but gradual kill, you will teleport into an enemy's attack when they completely missed and only hit you because you teleported into their fire. 
This game's combat is sooooo f*cking bad.
Bosses will heal to full if you knock them too far away from their spawn position, not to mention bosses have unavoidable attacks that will garanteed hit you even if you dodge roll away. The dodge roll is a glorified invulnarability move but regardless of being unable to be hit, still get hit.
And the trinkets you can equip to ""do more damage"" or ""do more ciritcal damage"" is so f*cking bad because they don't actually do anything. A 200% damage increase still takes two hits to kill a level 1 llama which is the starting enemy of the game. I do over 200 damage per swing and it only one shots on crit on a creature that has less than 200 health. It only one shots to a crit, anything other than a crit takes two. Which is f*cking stupid.

Don't even get me started on the core gameplay. There's so many random fucking items that take hours of in  game time to make. Does the game really expect you to make multiple stations to be making items at the same time? I don't have the space, or the money to make more space. Why the fuck does 1 bronze plate take the same amount of time to make as a sheet of fabric? 
Why does smelting stone into brick take more time than smelting iron into bars. It doesn't make any sense. It takes days to get the parts to craft the things you need to make the thing to craft other parts you need for the quest that expires in 5 days. 
It's so tedious because the game expects you to sit there and baby sit your buildings instead of going off and gathering more materials. 
This is genuinely one of the worst gameplay loops to start your game with. 
On top of the fact the skill tree does literally nothing. A 5% decrease in materials when crafting? Wow! I can't wait to upgrade that 3 more times into a 20% less materials used which rounds down instead of up! Wow I literally have to use the same amount of materials because 20% of anything less than 5 of an item doesn't actually do anything? WoW!
I don't understand why games do this. It's one thing if you can do something in bulk where that actually applies, but for the most part you aren't crafting anything that can be reduced by 20%. Or even just the beginning reduction because there's literally nothing in the game that gets effected by a 5% discount of resources used. There is so much quantity over quality in this game.
The sheer amount of random garbage, unecessary crafting materials, and overall useless items you'd find from mob drops like in runescape or maplestory. 
The economy doesn't make much sense either because it doesn't shift day to day. So the fact that one day suddenly prices have increased by 38% doesn't make any sense especially if it stays like that for several weeks. I don't have any space to farm. I don't have any space to store items in chests. How do you unlock the 2 rows of storage that are x'd out? There's nothing in the skill tree. Is it an upgrade for wooden chests somewhere down the line? Or is it just made up nonsense? 
Why do you have to pay to unlock your inventory slots? 
Why does it make sense to have literally hundreds of npcs but not know where any of them are? You see blue dots on the map, but none of those signify who is who. I don't know their schdules. I don't know where they live. Why is it like that? It's not a small town either. You literally spend 3 hours from your place to reach the summit on foot. The scale if so fucking redundant, and mounts just get stuck and spaz out so it's faster on foot for the most part.

In the city of Portia, filled with futuristic rubble, we play as a character who inherits a workshop and has the freedom to customize our character's appearance. I really enjoy the crafting feature, which provides various materials that we need to identify and utilize. We undertake commission jobs as the main source of income, building our reputation with the town's residents and interacting with them for benefits.
My Time at Portia also offers a variety of mini-games, adding to the enjoyment of the gameplay. We can engage in battles against monsters and explore hazardous areas with additional RPG elements like a skill tree. Furthermore, we can customize the layout of our home, which affects our character's status. For fans of games like Harvest Moon, this game is, in my opinion, a choice worth trying.

It is enjoyable enough, but it feels incomplete. I would easily trade the open world for less glitches and the voice acting for more dialogue. The plot feels empty, which I could easily overlook if the character interactions were interesting, but they simply aren't. You get the same three lines to alternate between and then a line after major events are completed, but even if you are married, have children, or have certain friendship levels with other characters, none of that seems to be considered. There aren't proper conversations, and the characters don't even feel like proper characters, but more like models with a couple of voice acted dialogue attached to them.

First, this game only have beautiful graphics, but that's all, there are nothing else: tutorial, mechanics, help, progress, unlockings, etc are a mess.

You start the game and at beginning game offers an small tutorial, just the keys to move and use, later he will helps in making your first tools, but when you finish is when the pain starts, where do you find more minerals? i see there are stones and wood scattered but there is a limit, hello game? oh, then you just explore and finally find a cave (no free entrance, you must pay, thanks game to warn me NOW) and inside you will find all minerals you need to continue the game, if  not? outside you will find them but at very low quantity. 

Thanks to this mechanic, needed to start 2 times from the beginning, but werent the last...

Then i continue playing, to found when you finish the first ""major"" quest, making the bridge, then quests from merchant building to fight for a score in your workshop goes random, why random?, if i didnt unlock x recipe because game didnt offered to BEGIN the quest what rewards us as players with the recipe, why the game have a chance to spawn a mission in the blackboard along the other 3 quests to choose demanding to make the item you didnt learn? Question for developers, DO you REALLY think we players have a computer in our brains and will remember all things we can make or unlocked in our workshops?My answer? NO.

Not only this, when this happened to me, i restarted again, to find another surprise, another bad one, game starts to giving me quests to cook meals, sorry but i was still unlocking the industrial furnace, i didnt have access to cook nothing, only meat with salt.

For all of this i uninstalled this garbage, and if you remotely wants to know how i was feeling when i wrote this review, try to make a handstand next to a wall and poo at the same time.",1680038761,1697178004,False,2,0,0.426179796457290649,0,True,False,False

This is probably the biggest deterrent in My Time At Portia, and it deterred me at first too. The game is half-voiced, the graphics look like a cheap [i] Disney Dreamlight Valley, [/i] and sometimes the UI feels unpolished. If you can use mods, I would highly recommend downloading some from Nexus to help (mostly with the graphics). 

If you are willing to give My Time At Portia a chance, however, it is such an [b] impressively immersive game, [/b] and perhaps one of the most immersive in the life-sim genre. Seriously. I felt like I was an actual citizen of My Time At Portia. As a new resident, I sure did feel like an alien in a new town. But as you live your life and develop both your farm and the city, you become a Portia resident. Quests actually change and add to the town's ambiance, even seemingly minor side quests. Django asked if I would craft him a new sword, and the next day he was out practicing with the same sword I crafted for him. You're asked to install streetlights in the town, and your newly installed streetlights permanently light up the city.
I feel like I am actually supporting and helping the town and its people. 

The characters are all lovable...even your despicable rival, Higgins. As you develop your relationships, you'll gain insights into their behaviors. For example, I would find Antoine oddly standing in the shadow of a tree at the end of his day. ""Very strange...to each their own"" I thought. After befriending him, you learn he actually has a crush on Dr. Xu. Funnily enough, Antoine would stand by the tree to observe and fawn over Dr. Xu, who would just be enjoying a sandwich on the nearby bench. It's these things that add to the world-building and game personality. 

There are a LOT of quests, both major and minor, that gives you great contribution to the city of Portia. I'm at ~180 hours, and I am still yet to see the end of the plot. I am now good friends with most villagers, and it feels well-earned. I enjoy that while this game has the usual features of a life-sim--mining, resource-gathering, museum-filling, crafting--it handles these aspects differently and uniquely from other similar games. It's refreshing. 

So yes, the graphics aren't well-polished and some recorded dialogue sounds goofy. But if you are willing to look past its development flaws, your time at Portia will immerse you in its own special universe that will leave you eager to discover more.",1696796441,1696796441,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's colorful and cute, and has a similar feel to games I love like Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon. The graphics are adorable and the music is pleasant, reminding me of Animal Crossing. 

The gameplay is unique, with a focus on crafting instead of farming, and there are mobs to fight as well. It does require some effort to progress, but it's perfect for when I have nothing else to do. 

The developer has clearly put a lot of thought into the game, and it's still being improved. They even have a feedback section where users can provide suggestions. Unlike other poorly-made games, the creator seems to genuinely care about making it something we all enjoy, even after we've already paid. 

I would love if they added multiplayer capabilities, but even without it, I've already spent almost 20 hours playing it since I bought it just two days ago. And for the price, it's definitely worth it. â¡",1524887636,1696243811,True,2,1,0.549549520015716553,0,True,False,True

What makes these games so successful is a long (and good) story narrative (with voices!) and goals to work towards that somehow don't get too repetitive or boring. The characters are well-developed (though Sandrock's are better, just sayin'!)

Graphics is just terrible, all textures are blurry and low-res, character models look like they were made in 2000s, and default tone mapping makes everything desaturated and just boring.

In addition to this there are bugs and inconsistencies that just make it look unfinished.

For example, you can sell a mission item and soft-lock yourself from progressing in the story.
Or there is a type of enemy that appears only in one location in one mission, and the location is later accessible later if you date specific character.
Or there is a skill that reduces amount of resources required to craft, but it doesn't make any sense, because game starts to show something like 1.5 bricks required and you spend 2 bricks anyway.

Dialogues are ok-ish, but voice acting is very poor, and there is a bug that makes all characters open their mouths in sync.

It does sometimes crash, which can be frustrating, but it also autosaves at the end/beginning of every day.  It doesn't feel as grind-y as Harvest Moon often gets, and it's very low-stakes if you wanna focus on mining versus farming versus fighting.  There are lots of fun (bisexual!) options for romantic partners, and my only complaint in that arena is the lack of nonbinary options (visually very gender, but the voices and some other minor things can be quite binary).  I also like that there are plotlines that periodically and sporadically appear, so it isn't exclusively driven by the player's own desire to get better at things.

Update (27/9/23): I haven't picked it up much since I started playing it because there's so much to do and the map is so large and there are so many people that it's honestly a bit overwhelming for me to think about getting back into.

Honestly, I love the layout and the whole place looks so beautiful. It's such a perfect open world game that I can spend my time playing just to enjoy the view. It feels like a game that took inspirations from Stardew Valley's most popular mods and made them real features in the game. Of course I can only say this because I love using mods. This game has some mods, not many, but enough to tweak things around especially to help you when some mishaps happen within or outside the game. My favourite is the use jet pack anywhere because then I can just go anywhere with it and watch sunset from the highest point in the entire map. The fast travel is amazing that even I don't feel like using the jet pack mod sometimes. Even conventional ride is great. I caught a llama and I don't care for horses now, llamas forever! The social system is pretty simple and nice. The events are charming. And I really, really love how we can see the whole calendar at the beginning so we can choose carefully when our birthday is because I was filled with so much sorrow when I played Stardew Valley and my character's birthday coincided with an event. Though, the event system in this game is much more lenient so I guess it wasn't going to be a bad choice anyway? Lmao, anyway, it's good to know before. I also like the fighting animation, almost giving me rouge-like vibe, which is also one of my favourite types of game. I always enjoy a good battle, Also, a spar option with townsfolk? Yes, thank you, I'll take that.

One thing that bothers me the most is the fact that Aadit's voice did not come out when he spoke after I fulfilled his requests. My character's voice was still on, though, so it felt like she was talking to a mute person, which was not a bad thing except Aadit should be talking normally. There are some glitches and typos, but nothing a restart would fix (the thing with Aadit's voice is persistent, though). I actually enjoyed the voices so much, I love everyone's voice in this game. So it was very annoying when someone's voice didn't come out at all. I just hope this is not going to be persistent, though.
I still love it very, very much.

The mining system was so buggy as to be not worth playing, and the game's writing/translation and documentation were all spotty as hell. The farming was uninspired, wonky, and almost entirely took a back seat to running around the countryside so you could build whatever latest thing a villager was demanding of you; most of it just served to gatekeep/time-delay advancement through the progression of fetching and crafting.

However, while you can definitely farm and fish in this game, it is more focused on you as a builder who fulfills commission from the townspeople. So you will definitely be spending more time foraging, mining for ores and finding discs to obtain blueprints from the local scientist, or going to abandoned ruins to fight monsters

What is unique about this game is that your actions do brings visible changes and improvement to Portia and its people. It felt like you lived in Portia. The yearly town festivals are fun and felt like the bonding of a small community as a tight-knit town. Your birthday are remembered and you are also able to host parties like your spouse's birthday party

Romance in this game are great, but some of the spouses's storylines will feel more fleshed out than the others. The spouses comes with different perks, like helping you in your work, giving you half of their income, or having discounts at their stores. [spoiler] You can even build a dream clinic for one of the spouse to work in, which is sweet. [/spoiler]

Even if Portia isn't as graphically polished compared to their successor Sandrock, it is a nice introduction to the series, and one should definitely give it a try. Overall, I think the My Time series are a standout in the farming sim genre, it has its own unique features and you can feel the love put to it like Stardew Valley, Rune Factory or the older HM series

It is very recommended for those who just want to chill and roam around in your little town. I thought this is mostly going to be farming like Stardew Valley, Staxel, and such, but perhaps I should do some more research first before downloading lol. You are playing as a builder and you aim to get as many commissions as possible to be the best builder in town. 

The farming part of the game is actually not that fun - it does not really give you money, and you mostly can buy the produce at a low price because the market pricing can decrease at times. 

I also hate the cooking process on this game, I personally think it is a bit annoying because of the time limit. Cooking should not be something challenging - hell, fighting monsters are easier on this game compared to cooking. 

Just like in Stardew Valley, fishing is the one thing that gives you a lot of money in the beginning of the game. There are not that many kinds of fishes on this game though.

The fighting part is one of my favourite things on this game - challenging but still fun. 

Mining is also quite relaxing because you just dig dig dig and maybe you find something cool.

While in Stardew you play as a young farmer, in My Time At Portia you play as a young builder who has inherited their workshop from their absent father. As the new builder, you undertake commissions from the people of Portia, competing with four other workshops to be the most reputable in the city. This consists of building machines and structures, using resources you've collected both from the surrounding land, as well as relics from the world's dark past, known as the ""Age of Corruption"".

All 51 residents of Portia are incredibly fleshed out, with unique backstories and dialogue which corresponds to upcoming events and recent developments in Portia's infrastructure. The game also includes 28 marriage candidates, but despite all these options, Arlo is my absolute favourite.

Personally, I love the lore of this game. I love the idea that humans became too arrogant and had our own machines turn on us, and there's now a church whose mission is to abolish the use of relics and old technology. I love that there's characters like Merlin and Petra, who are on the complete opposite end and encourage the research of old tech. I love the characters' stories too. The Mayor's family in particular are so interesting to learn about, but I'll leave that for you.

Hi Guys,

I played this game when it was still early access and fell in love with it first sign.
It is funny, exciting, sweet, not boring, imaginative, amusing and yes..., I will stop now.
You should definite have this game in your inventory!
But if you donÂ´t like craftmanship work or the farm work like petting animals or donÂ´t like to have task with a time limit. ShouldnÂ´t buy it. Then, sadly look, hands off.

Wasn't a fan of farming type games like harvest moon, etc but this one stands out different, mainly because it focuses more on being a 'builder' rather than just planting trees all day. you'll find yourself looking forward to what kind of weird stuffs MC will build to improve Portia every single time, and the changes comes with new stuffs to do, which is good.
Story wise, rich and immersed, though the clunky transition between cut scenes and gameplay do have an annoying effect to me. 

Buy it, both during sales or not. It's a game well aged.

Now, onto Sandrock (Waiting for the full release).

It also has an offensively bad gay character, which I'll get to in a minute. First, a brief overview of why the game itself sucks.

During the game's introduction, you're asked to build a bridge. You can also take commissions from villagers to make things for them, gaining money and reputation when you do so. That's about as much information as the game gives you at first. The handbook explaining what you need to build the bridge is fairly straightforward, and I like that it tells you where to find each item you need. 

Unfortunately, there are about a thousand nested requirements to build the bridge. It took me 8-9 hours of my 10 hours of play to finish it because crafting is time-gated. I HATE this. There is no reason to time gate crafting materials or items when you already need to build and gather so many precursor items to build one thing. Gathering isn't always that straightforward either, and gathering higher level materials, again, requires precursor materials, which are time-gated. Everything takes SO LONG to accomplish. 

Apparently you're also supposed to form relationships with the villagers. I truly did not realize this was such a big component of the game until someone told me. You can chat with them about once a day, but they only give you one line of dialogue, and then...I guess you just have to wait until the next day? I still don't understand how you're supposed to gain relationship points with them other than doing things for them. The villagers themselves frankly aren't that interesting. I'm not expecting Bioware levels of character development, but I don't really have any desire to get to know them, and mechanically, I don't know how I'm supposed to do that.

And then there's Antoine. I didn't talk to him until I realized you're supposed to socialize, so I didn't get a grasp of how bad this character is for several hours. I truly haven't seen a lazier, more offensive effeminate gay stereotype in a video game. He speaks in a parody of a gay lisp, he makes stereotypical gay limp wrist gestures, and he sashays around instead of walking like a normal person. I should emphasize that even if female characters can romance him, the stereotype he represents is still offensive. It's very clear what he's supposed to be, and I don't see how this can be an accident.

As a queer person, this upsets me.  As of writing this review, it is 2023. You should know how and why this stereotype is offensive. You should know not to include it in a video game, especially one that seems to be aimed at younger people. If you had a character that was a stereotype of any other group, you'd be pilloried. I don't know why you thought you could do this. For anyone reading, if you think I'm being an oversensitive snowflake, think about how you'd feel if a character in a video game behaved in a way that represented part of your identity in a way that people have mocked and used as a reason to hate you for literal centuries. It's not that hard to write a good, or even just a non-offensive, queer character. Just make them act like an normal f*cking person.",1688847831,1688847831,False,5,4,0.450869977474212646,0,True,False,False

The graphics are beautiful, I like the combat, and I think the post-apocalyptic environment and story is cool. It's really addictive and different in a good way. The music is awesome.

The voice acting is really spotty and there's a lot of grammatical errors, so it makes the game feel unfinished, but it doesn't ruin the experience. Building relationships with characters is a long grind, and there are characters that feel like walking stereotypes and not much else, like Antoine. Seems like this studio doesn't know how to make gay male characters without resorting to stereotypes that make up the characters' entire personalities, like an obsession with physical beauty, because apparently there's another character like Antoine in the sequel. That being said, I think some of the characters and voice acting are really nice, like Ginger. I like that you can adopt stray animals and give the dog poop lol.

The character models are also very off-putting. And I'm all for diversity and unique character names but again, some names sound strange and lack the feel of a cohesive region or ethnicity. I think the worldbuilding could definitely have been worked on for this game. If they choose a real world culture to base Portia on and tweak it a bit to make it unique, that would be a lot better.

- Outdoor lighting is too dark. I always need to switch to the Miner's Hat at night, and the night feels long compared to the day (game hours are 7 AM -  3 AM, with sunset around 6-7 PM).

- Finding gift preferences for NPCs are difficult without looking up information on Wiki. Conversations should give hints to allow smoother gameplay.

- Sometimes, especially in the early game, a lot of missions come up at the same time and it would've been nice to allow UI to display more than 3 missions at a time.

- Base level Relic Scanner should have longer range or upgrade should be allowed earlier in the game.

- The Round Table should provide more Knight Badges for games played, or the Badge Exchange rate should be better. Some missions force me to play games everyday and I wasn't looking to play mini games that often.

- It's so hard to count fish in Fish Display, making it hard to breed fish as game intended. I can't count more than 4 fish in a display without a tiring my eyes, and I won't be able to use bigger  displays for fish breeding.

- Some item descriptions need to provide more information. I couldn't figure out how to get the  Irrigation Tower to work until I consulted Wiki.",1686924206,1686929144,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Added complication: I'm a brain injury survivor. Stroke level memory issues so I am constantly struggling to find this place or that place yet, I can promptly regain my bearings and be productive.

this game has potential to be waaay better, but it just feels unfinished, like they had 90% of it done and hit compile. the art style is pretty, but a lot of the characters look like deformed fetuses which really takes away from an otherwise nice enough style. even the player character, who is customizable to an extent, will always look a bit like like an inflated baby.

I'd say 30% of the voice acting, especially for the 'introductory' characters and the main character (thankfully this is optional, your MC can zip it forever in settings) sounds tinny, amateur or just 'off' in tone. cutscenes and events in the game are awkward and unpolished, and often cut to and from gameplay in a way that can be jarring.

if it was more of a 'mine and craft' game than a farming sim I might have enjoyed it more, because farming is actually kind of boring. the mining mechanic in this game feels very satisfying because you can actually dig away at the earth in set locations, but having to rent those locations becomes annoying after the second time.

if you have a Gaming Laptop(TM) like me, as in it's cheap and has minimum requirements, your laptop is about to become a space heater because this game could be optimised a tad better.

at full price, this game is not worth it. it really needs more work in every aspect to feel less like a demo and more like an actual published game. one thing I will say is that the artwork *for* the game is very nice indeed.",1685217386,1685217386,False,40,6,0.655192673206329346,0,True,False,False

I have to say the PC version is way better than the Switch version of the game. The switch version has so many bugs it makes crafting things impossible. But on the PC version it runs smooth for me.

Attacking this game with building as much as possible does not gain much profit. I typically keep 8 industrial forges running 24/7 to keep refining ores to ingots and I am keeping my 4 industrial cutters running 24/7 to keep making planks, sheet metal, etc. I really wish I could hire NPCs as employees or have a co-op mode to get some help.

I am at the point now where commissions get done right when I get them because I have so much surplus on materials. For those who are struggling or want to get into this game. It is hard at first to build up stuff but stick with it. I started just by looking at items on the weekends in the game at where you get the commissions to gain some money and supplies, doing side commissions to build up blue prints. During that week mining materials. After collecting 1000+ of all the ores from Ruins 1, Ruins 2, and just around town I was able to build up enough to move more around the island.

You have an abundance of them, but it takes way to long to process stuff. I am sure there is ways to change that but I feel it would ruin the concept of the game, and building 20 factories to process carbon steel felt a bit over kill. You get all this copper and other stuff but barely use it. They focus on carbon steel which takes 3 game hours to process 1, so sleeping a day for 8 kinda sucks. I was using 5 industry furnances at one point. If you master the processing needs the game will fly by pretty quickly. 70 hours of game play is only in the amount of time wasted on processing items. I have 59 hours of game play and about 50 of that is just waiting around for good to process. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game, but when you need 8 carbon steel to build one thing easier to just sleep the days away instead of waiting around.

There's a reason this game is compared to Stardew Valley. It's Stardew Valley on steroids. While Stardew Valley is a lot more relaxing, My Time At Portia tends to remain exciting due to time constraints and the constant competition thats the ranking system. Which rewards the top 3 Workshops every month with money and prizes, and then an even bigger reward for the best over the whole year.


Pros:
The combat is fairly simple but it works.

No sidequests (commissions) on weekends but you get to play 4 ""find the differences"" minigame, fun fun.

Unique skill tree gives noticeable changes. (Edit: even better skill trees with the new update.)

I simply never enjoy fishing in any game I play ever, besides POTCO, but in this game its pretty great.

Unique characters.

Interesting quests with twists.

Having something you make appear in the world as a permanent addition is great. ""You see dat thing, I made that.""

Interesting world.

Crafting from your storage is great.

Bosses are all unique and fun to fight.

The competition between you and ""squints* Higgins. (Seriously though, I get they want to make sure the 'new guy in town' doesn't beat him Month 1 but giving him 5,000 points right off the bat day #2 is a big pile of poop. For reference, you'll generally make 10,000 points by the last month in a year if you want to win the yearly competition. You can win Year 1 though, just take a commission every day.)

Saw someone say once that Horses are useless, wrong. They really help get to places and it saves a ton of time.

Play dates with friends offer a more fun way to gain friendship points.

Romance is simple enough but interesting. (They added more spouse options like having babies.)

Buying more land, upgrading tools, upgrading workbench/station, buying a bigger house.
Getting mail is stupid exciting.

Cons:
Sadly there are issues. Let's get the obvious ones out of the way. Lack of voice dialogue (update added tons more but still needs some), lack of sound effects (lot more added with updates), and performance issues.

Other issues include no real purpose/money in raising animals and farming (Partially fixed with the addition of the South Block Trading Board.)

Difficulty in befriending NPC's, most of which give nothing for befriending. (Edit: partially fixed in new update. Easier to gain points.)

Cutscenes need fixed.

Some recipes require way too much leather for the reward given, so when enemies only have a 50% drop rate or less and you need 100 of that drop *cringe*. (Fixed in latest update, you can now commission the Guards in town to go fetch you items at a price, very much worth it.)

Item drop box needs to be movable.

Inventory system needs tweaked. (Edit: update added option to 'sort all' but it also needs to allow you to 'Favorite' items, otherwise it sorts most things.)

[strike] Why you no love me Horsie, I pet you 3 times a day, pick up your poop, keep you fed yet you're always sad . [/strike] (Edit: Horsie actually likes me now with new update.)

Holidays need tweaked. (Edit: partially fixed by adding more Holidays. Item rewards still need tweaked, not enough of them.)

Level system needs adjusted, played 80 hours and only have like level 37. (Update made it far easier to level at higher levels.)

I would like for the helper system to be better, maybe have them plant seeds, not just harvest. (Edit: They now tend to your farm animals better with new update. Your helper can also fertilize and plant seeds if upgraded correctly.)


I love this game beyond words. It took me 80 hours to do every quest. For me the game is already a 9/10 must-buy. If you like Stardew Valley, buy My Time At Portia. The developers seem to update the game every couple months. At this point the game is complete but they've stated they'll still tweak things and add some new features. (Edit: Newest updates added more quests, fixes to some quest bugs I had, a lot more Holidays, and added the Factory, which allows mass production, new types of commissions that's filling out orders of crops and such.)

One other thing: I saw someone giving the game a bad review because there's too much waiting around. It's true that you have to wait A LOT in this game. That's the point though, you aren't supposed to sit around and wait. Go fetch more ores for the next item to craft, fight, fish, gift people, quests, chop wood, find relics. Multitask.

If you read this far, thanks for sticking around. Will gladly answer any questions.

4/30/2023: game has basically been abandoned by the developers with HEAVY issues. extremely unpolished, missing some quality of life, tons and tons of missing voice dialogue, translation issues never fixed, unfinished content, bugs, every cutscene is still basically broke, still no reason to befriend half the people in town. still a great game but come on, have a little respect for your creation and finish it.",1531123477,1682835493,True,58,1,0.823363423347473145,8,True,False,False

Not really worth the price, honestly it still feels like an Early Access game that was abandoned for,,,,some reason,,,, (cough, My Time At Sandrock).

Lacks in areas like story, combat, NPC interactions. Also it's just generally unpolished / buggy. Character AI sometimes malfunctions, movement is kinda choppy, character dialogue breaks often. 

A lot of the ""special events"" are underwhelming. It will just be characters standing around & if you talk to them they'll get stuck, their dialogue will break, or their movement patterns/pathfinding will mess up.

For a game that offers a marriage option and a huge cast of characters, a LOT of characters are extremely boring/underdeveloped, some people in marriage don't have benefits when others do? Extremely minimal dialogue. My favorite NPC was the cat who I'd feed rare fish every chance I got. 

If you are above, like, 13, I would say pass. Look for another indie farm-life sim. There are plenty of those.

But perhaps most importantly, makes not saying ""eeehhhhhh........................one more day"" at 2:30 in the morning (the night before work) damn near impossible. It's got more emphasis on the crafting, and while farming is still a seasonal deal, it's a lot simpler and more hands off.

My Time at Portia (MTAP) is a game that can be enjoyed but this works best if you have a shift in perspectives. I picked this game up wanting to play some sort of farming/life sim game after playing stardew valley multiple times and with mods. But MTAP is very different from Stardew Valley. Initially I couldn't get into the game, but after revisiting it later on with no expectations, I found that it was something that I could enjoy. The following are some of my thoughts on this game.

KEY POINTS

-MTAP is about being a BUILDER. Not a farmer. While there is some aspect of farming/animal care, this actually takes a backseat to the main focus of wanting to become the number 1 builder's workshop in town. You compete against a rival builder in the town (the devs managed to make him annoying enough that you'd want to beat him as a genuine personal goal). 

-Most of the game will involve gathering resources to assemble key items/buildings that improves the town. It's pretty satisfying to see the plot progress through your town upgrades. I was surprised at the amount of areas that I could unlock and the story is longer than what I expected which is nice.

-You can get to know the townspeople, but not all NPCs are created equal. Most NPCs have a few lines they rotate between, only some NPCs get a bit more content than other NPCs. But the townspeople are charming in general, with a few characters which I personally don't like but to be fair, different personalities makes the town more realistic in the sense that not everybody is likeable. There is some voice acting but it isn't consistent between all NPCs. The quality of the English voice acting is variable as well, some voices are a bit more grating than others, but you can get used to it. The graphics initially was a bit uncanny valley, but eventually they became charming. 

-A good chunk of crafting requires processing raw materials into something else (e.g. ore into bars). The processing takes actual time (e.g. 1 bar iron needs x amount of hours in game to process). This isn't too bad though since you're usually spending that time mining/chopping wood/other things. 

-ok combat, need some degree of dodging skills. Otherwise it's mainly just mashing the mouse rapidly in order to slash monsters. But again, this isn't so bad since personally, the aim of this game is to be a builder. The combat isn't so hard that you're playing Elden Ring. But it's not so easy that you just get bored. 

CONCLUSION:

-If you're prepared to let go of the idea that this is a farming sim, and instead want to be a builder, then this is the game for you. Also, by building, I mean gathering the resources needed for a build, then assembling it together in a pre-structured format. 

-Personally, I found it satisfying to gather materials, build/improve the town, unlock more areas, and see how the story unfolds. 

-Becoming friendly with NPCs I like was fun, but don't expect much content in terms of what the NPCs can say. But if you don't mind stretching your imagination a bit, you can try to pretend in your head that they can say more things

-Also ruin diving is kinda addicting. I like history and I like pretending I'm an archeologist. You dig out pieces of relics, eventually assemble these pieces into a larger piece. And then you can donate this to a museum that you help build.",1679617328,1680040514,True,6,0,0.584702849388122559,1,True,False,False

I really like the concept but it was poorly executed and while I was originally planning to push through the annoying bits, I find myself repeatedly getting angry and frustrated and this is not the mood I was looking for from this game. 

Mostly sad to not enjoy this because I thought it would be like Stardew Valley or something of the sort but those games are polished and this one is almost unplayable. With having to repeat days because the game crashes unexpectedly, to glitching up a wall, to hearing the SAME DIALOGUE over and over no matter when you talk to someone, it's just not a well executed game.

Definitely don't pay full price but I guess if you get it for pretty cheap it may be worth it to test it out yourself because I think the concept is there. 

If you do purchase, make sure you Google a guide or something to understand the early game and mechanics because by the time you figure it out on your own, it will be too late to get a refund if you don't like it.

Hah! Just kidding this game is great! It feels very comparable to Stardew Valley but in 3D and with a focus on building the town and your workshop instead of farming.

I originally bought this game when it released in early access. I loved it way back then when it didn't have too much content and was terribly unoptimized. So I shelved it for a very long time and finally came back. And wow, I'm glad I did!

It now has so much to do and runs so much better than what it was before. My three biggest complaints is that combat feels kind of clunky (though there isn't much of a focus on it). Voice acting is decent but missing for some conversations and characters. Also the quality of voice acting is up and down. And thirdly, the washed out haziness of the overall look. This can be tweaked with a mod and made to look so much better than the original (I used Clarity Reshade to fix this).

The good news is that the devs seem aware of this and do a pretty good job of holding your hand through early game play. The bad news is that it's still pretty hard when the 3D town actually has as many buildings in it as an actual rural downtown area, with actual topography instead of a flat plain with only an X & Y axis. Yes, there's a detailed map, but the short days don't allow for much time to reorient yourself if you get a little bit lost or get distracted by exploration when you're supposed to do specific tasks. I wasted half a day wandering around an apple orchard when I was supposed to see the mayor about a certificate. I wasted a whole day just trying to get out of the mines when I needed to make a bench or something idek.

Farm sims are supposed to be easiest at the beginning, but instead I feel like My Time at Portia is the opposite, because it takes a while to get used to an open world walking sim when you're used to side-scrollers. I can understand how, for many players, this vast difference in approach is part of the appeal (it honestly was for me), but it's more trouble than I was willing to put into it.

Portia has a lot of quests, including voiced ones with cutscenes - a rarity in the genre. The town and townspeople change as you progress - you might find a dog for a little girl and the dog becomes an npc for you to interact with. Another time, you might get a commision to build a construction crane and the town will build a museum with it.
But there's downsides - some bugs are still there, especially in pathfinding. The graphics at times feel very uncanny, like i'm looking at a bunch of smooth pinocchios whenever i talk with npcs. Relationships are very slow to develop - a TON of items are viable gifts, including pieces of furniture. Good luck figuring out what people like! At least the animals are easy to figure out - food.

When you open up the game, it takes you to a screen that tells you about how the game is now fully released and will be getting more content in the future.

""This game contains flashing lightning. For those who are sensitive to this, there is an option to turn it off."" 

Let me reiterate this for you: THESE PEOPLE ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT PEOPLE WITH PHOTO-SENSITIVITY. 

I have mild seizures that affect my whole body when exposed to flashing lights, and the fact that these people made a screen page before the title page that lets everyone know there will be flashing effects but those can be turned off in the options is just...AMAZING!! It shows that these people actually hold some care for their consumer base and want this game to reach as many people as possible. There are some games that are literally inaccessible for me to even WATCH because of the flashing effects, so to see them announce their accessibility feature when you load up the game makes this game one of the best games out there for me!

[b]Highlights[/b]
[list]
[*]There's a ton to do. Festivals are interactive, there are 28 available romance options, daily quests to complete, and a huge overarching main plot. By the end of the game, the map is HUGE to the point where the fast travel mechanic is a necessity. The map still doesn't feel empty though, as the large areas are distinct and contain specific monsters/loot that you will need. From what I know, it seems that there is a common challenge to complete the game in 1 year -- which takes a great amount of planning. Personally, it took me about two in-game years to complete most of the story.
[*]There are a ton of quality-of-life improvements that I've wanted in other life sims/farming sims. For example, being able to name chests and go through them by name, rather than color coding. The fishing mini-game is engaging, but not too painful. Characters come with their own social networks, so as you improve your relationship with one character, other characters also get a slight relationship increase. This prevents the whole ""going into town and talking to EVERYBODY all the time"" problem.
[*]One that I personally love the most is that you can automatically sort things from your inventory into ALL chests where there are matching items. So you can have your ""fabric"" chest open, but ores will get sorted into the ore chest as well. Saves so much time, I love it.
[*]The setting, which is a post-apocalyptic society grappling with the re-introduction of ""ancient"" technology, is unique and engaging. The scenery that comes along with it (the pastoral countryside with ruins of an ancient society) is amazing.
[*]The rhythm that you get into by the end-game with upgraded farm/workshop tools is really satisfying. You learn what you need most often, and can kind of prepare for any commissions/quests that come your way.
[/list]
[b]Mixed[/b]
(This is stuff that I personally both like/dislike, OR things that I think will be a love-it-or-hate-it type thing)
[list]
[*]The store system. There are days when the market is up (so it costs more money to buy things, but you also get more money for selling things) and the market is down (the opposite). This can make it frustrating when you have things you want to sell, but it might not be worth it because the market is down. At the same time, it does add a level of strategy that I find fun.
[*]Likewise, instead of one central store, there are different stores/markets that you can shop at, and they sometimes accept different currencies. For example, you can buy furniture from the furniture store, and likewise, you can only sell items that he is willing to buy. He has a set amount of money that he can give you as well, so if you have more to sell, you need to wait for another day. This is a good balancing mechanic imo, but I can also see it annoying some.
[*]Organizing your yard can be annoying. No easy way to rotate things, you need to manually place down some things and place other things via A+G Construction. It makes it kind of frustrating to organize things at times.
[/list]
[b]Drawbacks[/b]
[list]
[*]Some of the graphics are wonky. There are graphics fix mods though, so it's not really that much of a problem, at least to me.
[*]There are some awkward localization moments. As someone who can speak Chinese, I can get what the game was trying to say, but it just comes off awkward in English. Tbf though, it's to be expected on an indie budget, and it doesn't really remove from the charm of the characters or world.
[*]I feel like the beginning of the game feels like a slog. There isn't enough to do, so you end up just kind of wasting time, and some of the directions aren't that clear. It took me looking at a guide to understand how to use the relic scanner in the mines.

If there was a neutral rating, I would give it that. The company in question is known for promising a lot and never delivering. They ride out on the initial presentation and slowly creep away. 

My time at Portia has some addictive qualities to it if you enjoyed the games that inspired it, such as HM/SoS/SV/AC, but you'll also find there are really tedious mechanics that move backwards in terms of game design progress.

Also;

 cut-scenes are janky, animations are janky, things can be ""used"" without getting the effect (i.e. food buffs from the same food source do not stack but will be consumed) Mechanics were never fully fleshed out (i.e. you can feed and pet your horse to maintain its happiness and loyalty, but there is not reward for this nor consequence to not doing so, as they scrapped the idea.) The writing is nice at times, but other times doesn't make sense at all or is abrupt in plot points. The ending was definitely rushed and had more planned that never panned out. The audio of the dialogue sometimes cuts off on its own or overlaps the next line in the dialogue. Achievements can be finicky (I had to use mods to edit some of my game stats negatively and then restore them to get achievements I was robbed of) etc.

This game is not perfect by any means. Theres even enough basis to claim it is not good. I got it on sale for $10 and I'd say thats a fair price to hold out for.

It's a really addictive, casual farming game with a lot of fun elements and a lot to do. You can quite easily lose a lot of time to it, if you aren't careful. The story is surprisingly long too, which is surprising for what I expected from this game. There are also ""hazardous ruins"" that fill a combat dungeon role, so there is a bit of everything for everyone.

Some things that might put some people off though:
1. Time moves fast. Like.. really fast. You will sometimes feel like you have not accomplished enough in a day, especially before you have certain things (a horse, etc). There are mods to correct this but worth noting.

2. The voiced lines seem to be random. You will be having a conversation with an NPC, and sometimes one of their dialogue lines just.. isn't voiced. It's really jarring. I do like that they added an option to disable all voice lines, in case this gets really irritating for some, but it is weird. On the note of voicing too, the dub does not always match the text.

3. There are a few bugs that may or may not annoy you. Nothing game breaking, but things like characters spazzing out on terrain, animation glitches, NPC's using voice but a different NPC is moving their lips to it as if they're the ones saying it.

4. The individual personalities of the characters are awesome, but this is not shown in some areas of the game. Most notably, during Dates/Playing. They will recycle the exact same dialogue as other NPC's for activities, and not really have a preference for any particular ones. Eventually I found myself just spamming seesaw because no one seemed to dislike it and the dialogue was always the same. I was really hoping to see some specific character dialogue for each, and that they like/dislike certain activities. 

5. A minor one, but there are a few grammar errors. One I saw most frequently was the non-western version of the ellipsis. The western version has the ellipsis at the bottom of the words, whereas non-western is in the center.

6. Some achievements are bugged for several people (not all). I have still not been able to trigger the slot machine achievement.

All in all, it's a really solid and fun game that is well worth the money, if you're willing to give it a chance. If you like farming sim and/or casual games, you will probably like this one.",1675031733,1675031733,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So in my days of rebuilding Pa's workshop, I got myself mighty busy expanding things, creating all sorts of devices and other such things.  I socialized with my fellow residents, but mostly just the ones that I came across in my travels rather than going out of the way.  That first summer, the Martial Arts Tournament was held and I signed up eager to strut my stuff, feeling confident that I was able to do well as I was about on par with the fighting skills of some of the other Civil Corps members.  I won the first bout during the preliminary days, made my predictions on who was going to win.  Clearly the young strong men of Portia would dominate this field. I spent the rest of the day fishing as I didn't have another fight until the next day.

I found out in the mail that one of my predictions was wrong.  I couldn't believe Django got defeated in the preliminary round. He spent so much time training outside of his restaurant.  Well, no biggy, time to make predictions for the next set of fights.  I manage to win the semi final against a worthy fight thrown up by Paulie.  I ran off to go fish for a couple hours before the final fight.  I return just as the ring opened up only to find out that my prediction failed.  What? I could've sworn it would've been a shoe in.  Who am I fighting in the final? Russo?  That old guy who helps out the mayor?

This should be easy enough, I thought.  The health bars goes up, Jadey, level 30, vs Russo, level 50!?!  I was shocked.   I tried my best but he absolutely destroyed me.  Championship fight only went 3 of the 5 rounds.  I was utterly devastated.  Russo made some comments about his time in the Military Corps and his past service.  It was at this moment that I realized My Time At Portia was so much deeper than just a casual crafting game.  It's an experience of human interaction, history, and how we struggle to just get to the next day.

The following holiday, the Day of Memories, I chatted to Russo who shared some words about his fallen Comrades.  A lot of the residents had various feelings expressing loss and how each day affects them.  There is just so much personality and depth to these characters that caught me off guard as I was judging a lot of the characters stereotypically based on looks or my experience with them.

I've had similar instances in my own real life of underestimating people or being completely caught off guard from someone's history that they weren't that vocal about.  I'm now more eager than ever to really explore the town and investigate the depths of these characters.  Game is absolutely charming, and despite being friendly and light hearted I'm surprised that it touches upon some more mature themes.  The post cataclysm theme really leaves a lot to uncover about the history and the struggles the people face.

Game can definitely offer some food for thought, if you allow it.  After having this experience I bought My Time At Sandrock, in order to support the devs who are clearly passionate about sharing a story and make excellent characters.",1674483469,1674483469,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

Yes, a bit of an unpopular opinion here. Bear with me.

Characters feel fake and plastic. They are always staring past you like plastic dolls. Shallow interaction system that feels very robotic. One specific qualm I have is that characters generally do the same things/their actions don't really substantially differ from each other -- you know how in Stardew Valley, during festivals, everyone would be doing their own unique thing related to their character? This game barely tries to do anything of the sort. Their words are different, but their actions are generic. Since this is the main point of a game like this, this is also my biggest problem with it.

World isn't as fleshed-out as it seems to be at first glance (or as it should be). 

Integral game mechanics are hard to work with. For instance, it feels very awkward/like I'm banging a cube into a round hole just to build something, which is literally the main point/storyline-driver of the game. Controls/GUI are inconvenient and inhibit enjoyment. Most of the game feels like busywork -- again, just not fulfilling. Hard and irritating to progress/do anything. Days feel simultaneously too short and too long. 

Game just feels... empty. Like it lacks soul or something. There looks like there's a lot to do, but there really isn't, and whatever goal you pursue feels like trying to get mud out of a clogged pipe. It always feels limiting, like your feet are tied together and you're asked to jog in a marathon. 

Not worth $30. I've tried several times to get invested in the game. I love the idea of a 3D Stardew Valley, but there's way too much stuff that prevents me from enjoying this game. I do not recommend getting My Time at Portia.",1647559967,1673920428,False,2,0,0,3,True,False,False

So I would like to start by saying, thank **** they redid the lighting to the point that you aren't going blind from playing it.  That said, the timing is really still an issue. Feels like you have a pitchfork in your back trying to push you forward to do everything with the main story line. There are times where the main story however doesn't have a timer so you can just sit back and relax for a bit and just not do anything with it and hold off the next section. That said, the game itself still feels both slow and fast and not correctly paced. I would say you can try and speed run it but it is more or less about taking your time and trying to chill. Getting 100% in this game is seriously tedious and slow though. You can date a ton of people and each one has some unique form of content but to switch between dating them is just incredibly time consuming. 

Now as for dating as a whole, play dates or actual dates, they are super boring after you do something once, you have experienced all that 'event' has to offer and boom, repeat it another 3 times on that one date with that one person and then repeat that again with the next person the next day and repeat that with the next person the next day all week long to get roughly 1/20th of relationship level. To say that dating is beyond boring after you do it a few times is just not taking in to consideration about how repetitive it is. That said, between gifting, parties and the museum, you can also let it take a really long time to get anywhere but its way better than individual dating.

No way to save the coding though, still slow as anything. Nothing changed there. Still slow loading cutscenes and having them everywhere, still slow interactions. That said, at least there haven't been that many crashes. I think the game only has one crash every in game year now so it feels like its settled a bit more although for a game its size, its still really slow.

So yeah, still unfinished, unpolished, slow, poorly executed game but it can be fun if you are just sitting back and relaxing but holy hell does it lack replayability. 

Original: The game itself is kind of meh. The graphics are well, a certain choice. I don't particularly like them but it is what it is. As for the brightness, I should wear my sunglasses playing this game cause its too bright. They have settings for it but the settings are just deciding if you want to have it super bright outside or super dark in caves, no middle ground. Its either the sun or a black hole.
That said, the game itself isn't exactly thrilling, just something lacking that makes the gameplay just plain tiresome. I can't really motivate myself to do anything in the game. Everything feels like it takes time, is poorly coded and just makes you lose interest.
A good example is the traveling system. You go to a stop, click which stop you want to go to. Then wait 10 seconds for the cutscene to finally come up, click escape for the first cut scene, wait a few seconds for the second one to pop up and then cancel that one and boom you are where you want to be. The time it takes for both cut scenes to load and then the time it takes for it to cancel and fade out is also ugh. By the time you have finished your travel, you could have probably run there in the first place while doing things on the way. 
Everything you do takes time before the next screen is available so you click something and the next screen pops up, but you can't interact with it just yet, wait a second and then you can. So I tend to click something and then have to wait, click it again. This is really bad when you are trying to do 10 things at once, sorting chests or looting furnaces at your base.
This was all things that can get really annoying as it interrupts the games natural flow. 

However this isn't why I gave it a negative review. It is because it crashes. When you get 1 save point in the game - end of the day, go to sleep, start the next day and its all refreshed - the very last thing you want is for crashes. I did a day twice today for it to crash at the same exact place, while entering the mine. Needless to say, the game needs a lot of work.",1633036102,1673094122,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The Negatives:(Really just nitpicky stuff)
 There IS voice-acting, but certain lines are not Voiced over, and certain VO lines that were added late in a later patch are notably different recording quality to the earlier VA lines. 
Level Design is a bit odd, everything feels a bit too spaced out, but it's a stylistic choice that allows for mobility. Buildings DO feel cavernous however.
The ending of the game comes without real announcement, a character that hasn't been built up a lot is the keystone for the end, but it's a satisfying challenge.

The REAL problem I have with the game is that you can 1) only save at going to bed and 2) the game never asks you if you want to quit, a real easy time sink because of how the game is structured, but I have the same problem with Stardew Valley, so if that doesn't bother you, go ahead and get it!",1672929572,1672929572,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

All that being said there are some downsides - this game still feels unfinished. Some areas are quite barren or simply glitchy.  you spend quite some time combating enemies yet the combat system is so broken and barebones it's a joke.

This game does have a number of good traits, mainly the interesting world with some cool NPCs and enemies. Also, tons of customization makes this game quite promising. However, the main issue that plagued the experience was the lack of quality and mindless grind.

Firstly, this game suffers from small but noticeable bugs and other issues in quality that added up. Certain actions (mining comes to mind) results in a lag spike for some reason and I have a decently powerful computer. Also, the voices for some of the NPCs sometimes did not match or just sounded awful. The AI for some of these enemies and NPCs made them look ugly. I'm forgetting some other issues but ultimately the quality just took me out of the experience and made me question the hours I invested.

Additionally, there were some systematic flaws. The main issue was that the game began feeling quite grindy and repetitive. Every in-game day became a cycle of talking to NPCs, mining, farming/foraging/fishing, upgrading/building/smelting. Mining is very boring because it is just digging to gather resources or trying to find some artifact. The issue is that it is literally just ground, no caves or enemies to encounter, just different colors of ground that can give different stones and ores. You could find dungeons but those were not fun because the combat is too simplistic. For the combat, I only remember melee attacks and the enemies were usually way too easy. Fishing was an interesting challenge but that quickly became repetitive because the minigame was too simplistic and never really changed. I do understand that some games are stressful and I like that relaxing games like these exist, but some challenge or danger has to exist to make the experience exciting.

Ultimately, if they fixed some of the quality issues then my opinion of the game would improve significantly. It is very likely that this type of game is just not meant for me. Simply put, if you are looking for a relaxing game with a cool world with a lot of customization and grind with not much combat or challenge and you don't find yourself annoyed at small but numerous bugs or instances of low quality, then yeah you should try this game, but I think most people can make better use of their time.

My Time at Portia is reminiscent of games like Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon. However, Portia is not a farming sim. Instead, you are a builder in the town of Portia. Your job is to build machines for the townsfolk of Portia by completing tasks. These tasks may be small items such as a chair, or larger items like a bus. The one minor annoyance is all tasks have a time limit to them but I do think that the time limit is generous enough. I have only missed the window a couple of times which is frustrating when you have almost all the items gathered for it. To build these you have to gather resources by cutting trees, breaking rocks, mining, and so on. 

Personally, while the mining is fun I find the caves to feel very boring and the mining to look a bit strange. You use a device to detect where items are in the cave, which is a cool effect, and then you can mine towards the items. While mining towards different items you'll also gather rocks. It's a cool idea. However, the graphics in these sections feel like a bit of an afterthought compared to other aspects of the game. Hopefully, they have improved this in the sequel, My Time at Sandrock, which I've yet to play.

Like other games in this genre, you get to know the townsfolk that lives in Portia. I love the characters in Portia. A lot of them have their own goals and aspirations, but also tendencies that hold them back. For example, one character has a chronic illness and while her brother may seem like a bit of a jerk he is very thoughtful and caring when it comes to his sister. You can learn more about her as well. 

There is also marriage. I think what sets this game apart from other marriage systems is that you have a dating phase in this game. First, you have to increase your relationship with a character and then ask them out. You will then have dates and more story content before the marriage phase. It's interesting and I haven't seen anything quite like it yet where I feel like I'm getting to know the character on a deeper level before marriage. 

This game also features seasonal festivals which of course are optional but are fun and present the player with rewards for winning. I'll be honest. I haven't done them all because I may be focused on other missions and tasks but they do repeat with each season so if you miss one then no worries. 

Lastly, I want to talk about the graphics. When running this game on a PC you may or may not experience frame rate drops and stutter depending on your PC's age. I experienced minor drops on the PC but may or may not have optimized the graphics correctly. On PS4 I experienced major slowdowns and frame rate drops in certain areas. Specifically when you head over to the lumberyard or larger areas in the game. However, on PS5 it was very smooth and those moments disappeared. I have a feeling on Switch that the experience will also have frame rate issues. The other major issue I've noticed is when switching to and from cutscenes. The transition is never smooth and almost a jarring experience. The game will stutter or stop and almost randomly cut to a new scene. 

All that being said I still recommend My Time at Portia. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed my experience with it this year.

I went ahead and finally picked up the Steam version after it became clear that the additional content updates were probably never coming to console since it had been literally years and the emphasis had shifted to Sandrock. So, I finally got a chance to try the additions that I never did on Console. 

Let's get the preliminary stuff out of the way. The game is a fun and charming life sim that differentiates itself from things like Stardew and Story of Seasons by taking the emphasis off of farming. Rather than having a farm, you have a workshop, and the main emphasis of the game is building and crafting. There is some farming, but it's a side activity intended to get materials used in crafting. You go out and collect resources by cutting down trees, mining, fighting enemies, etc., and create a production line that can become almost entirely self sufficient. You make money by doing quests, the most consistent of which is taking a daily commission at the Commerce Guild where characters request random items you can craft. The one problem though is that money can be a little slow to generate; there's no ""get rich quick"" solution in this game and most of your big upgrades will be paid for by main story quests. This can cause progression to be slow at times, although the game does give you plenty of time given the life sim format lets you take things at your own pace. 

On that note, yes, this game does in fact have an over-arching story, which tends to be moved along via quests that involve building large-scale objects such as Bridges, Structures, etc., causing the story to progress as Portia develops. The setting is interesting, being a post-apocalyptic world that is recovering and rebuilding, with ruins being able to be explored both for mining and for combat. The combat is passable for a life sim, with simple combo strings depending on your weapon, and dodging with iframes, but it's not super in-depth and a lot of enemies, even bosses, can be beaten down simply by stunlocking them to death with a non-stop assault. 

Characters have some charm, with varying degrees of depth. Some characters have well thought out motivations and backstories, while others just feel like they're there just to be there. I will say though, that character dialogue can be a bit repetitive, given they don't have a ton of variance in the things they say, even at higher levels of friendship. On that note, like most life sims, you can raise your friendship with the characters, and you can romance several of them as well. As a plus, romancing is not gender-locked. You can romance any character who is able to be romanced regardless of your character's gender. Where Portia shines compared to other Life Sims is that you can Play or Date characters, allowing you to engage in activities with them other than scripted events. While some of the activities can be a little repetitive, due to limited outcomes, they still do add a sense of interacting with your friends and significant other in the game. Overall, the social aspect is fine, although it could be better with characters having more dialogue options to prevent them from being as repetitive. 

Now, for the added content in the Steam Version... They definitely added more quests, including several post-game quests that stretch well beyond the credits, giving the game additional value to keep playing after ""beating"" it (although it does go on forever if you want). There's items and equipment that weren't in the console versions, additional floors in the post-game dungeon, and even voice acting that wasn't present in the console version at launch!

I have to say though, the voice acting is EASILY the biggest weakness of the game. It's not to say the voice actors themselves are bad. No, they did a fine job with what they were given. It feels more like the voice direction in this game was just hastily thrown together. Every single character seems to have a different accent to the extent that it feels a little jarring at times. It's like they imagined every single accent they could think of and then gave one to each character. But that's more of a nitpick. The real problem is that the voice acting is unfinished. Some characters and even entire scenes don't have voice acting, while others do. What's even worse is that some scenes have one character be voice acted while another is not. Let me tell you, it is extremely bizarre to listen to one character talking while the other is limited to text. And it's not always consistent, either. Some characters like Aadit and Tody are missing a lot of voice acting pretty consistently, but then you've got central characters like Arlo missing voice acting in scenes as well. It's like they started recording and just said ""Eh, good enough"" and left it a that. There are even a few scenes where the character's voice acting and the in-game text don't match. Does it take away from the game as a whole? No, not at all. But dang, it breaks immersion something fierce. 

Overall, the game is fun if you're a fan of life sims. But it does feel like Pathea cut some corners on this game, leaving it feeling a bit janky and incomplete at times. It's still fully playable, and I did enjoy it for what it was, but it's got enough holding it back to prevent it from ever reaching the greater heights of Life Sims like Stardew or Story of Seasons.",1671739460,1671739460,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't like the farming aspect though you don't have to water your crops and there is no hoe/spade its just adding seeds to pots (hard to make pots!) this game has more of a focus on complicated crafting not farming as it appears when advertised.

Best pros: Mining, cute art/graphics, lots of villagers

cons: not enough farming or fishing. 

This game will not replace my cute farm sim need, disney dreamlight and stardew valley still take the lead there.

But it is it's own kind of game. I do like it. I'd give this a 6 out of 10 only because I think this game isn't clear enough in the ads that it's more a crafting sim not farming. So either the ad needs work, or they need to add more focus on farming/fishing (which I'd prefer)

All these machines require truckloads of materials that must be made using tools, which also require materials and machinesâ¦ And the chain goes forever. Oh, and some materials cannot be crafted, they must be collected. Except you donât have forever to learn where to collect them because quests are time-limited.

(People like me who work with the vulnerable are still in lockdown mode.) The game is completed now and I have to say I dislike it even more. Quality is very uneven. A few things feel detailed and fleshed out. Others feel like the dev teams weren't even talking to each other as they worked. The rest feels like someone quit/got fired/reassigned in mid-project and the remaining staff just cram-jammed some cobbled together sh*t to finish it. Honestly, if my work was at the poor level of this game, I'd get fired. I do not understand how so many people can say positive things about this game. I really do wonder if they were paid to post positively. I will not be buying anymore games from Pathea. I'm very surprised to see such bad quality from China, but here we are. (Dec 3, 022)

(Original review)
I bought My Time at Portia when it was in pre-release and have been playing it into the full release. I hate being negative, but I find I can't recommend it. It's very grindy, but that shouldn't argue against the game because some people like grinding.  But the rewards for all that grinding are pretty underwhelming, if they even work at all. For example, you fight your way through some ruins to be rewarded with a chest containing... wait for it... a piece of wire. That you could have gotten by setting one of your machines to make it while you go off and do something else. Or you save Industrial Engines gotten from clearing ruins and buy a clock. The clock looks like the kind made to sit on a shelf or mantel but in the game it sits on the floor, looking ugly and out of place. And not keeping time. Sigh. You put in months of effort in a relationship with a character to marry them, and they just wander around inside your house, lost. All of the game feels like this. Late in the game you can have a factory that produces things more efficiently if you use it in a certain way, but in order to do that, you spend about ten times as much time working very fiddly controls. It's enough to make you want to scream. I'm about 5/6 of the way through it and I've only gotten this far through sheer willpower; I hate to quit.  I hate to rain on someone else's dream, but the truth is that I have to talk myself into playing this game and i'm only continuing it by forcing myself. I really can't recommend this to others.",1550442388,1670075658,False,4,0,0.516369044780731201,0,True,False,False

[i]My Time at Portia[/i] is perhaps one of the most pleasant post-apocalyptic games out there. Every part of the game overflow with interesting sense of optimism and full of potential.

The premise of this game are fairly similar to [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/]Stardew Valley[/url]â [url= https://store.steampowered.com/app/585900/Harvest_Moon_Light_of_Hope_Special_Edition/]Harvest Moon[/url] or [url= https://animal-crossing.com/]Animal Crossing[/url] where you will be arriving in a strange new town named Portia to inherit your fatherâs old building workshop, and spend your time restoring it to its former glory. 

That of course means that you will end up helping out the good townsfolk of Portia by building everything from waterwheels to lighthouse for harborâ and in no time at all you became one of the significant builder in Portia. Some of your tasks will be obtain through commissions (requests posted in the commerce guild that you or the other competing builders can undertake) or via quests, which are story-heavy. [b]I personally enjoy the main quests and sub quests the most[/b] as you get to learn more about the town and the citizens more in-depth. What moreâ the story quests usually consists of [b]astounding cut scenes[/b] which literally took your breath away.

Having that being saidâ I personally think this is the aspect which most of the crafting simulators games fail but [i]My Time at Portia[/i] done it well: [b]The story[/b]. You do not just plainly build or craft the items for no reason. The inhabitants of Portia will routinely ask you for quest-related help, like crafting a boombox to get rid of some infesting [url=https://mytimeatportia.fandom.com/wiki/Panbat]Panbats[/url] or taking photos to publicize the local newspaper. This make the NPCs not-just-another-blank-face who always only giving you chores, but they became the engaging reasons that gradually involve you to the main storyline that keeps developing around you. By completing the questsâ youâll eventually unlocking new areas and characters while keeping you and your invaluable help at the centre of it all. 

Overallâ it seems that no matter what I do, [i]My Time at Portia[/i] continues to encourage me to keep going for more because it still has more to offer. From mining to taming wild llamas to dating, thereâs a lot to do here, and Iâm still discovering and unlocking new and usually interesting things. By including memorable NPCs and a system that nurtures your every building whim, almost every little thing you tick off feels like a major accomplishment - and no, thatâs not just because things sparkle when you finish building something.

I initially got into this game looking for more farming and life sims, but that would do this title a disservice comparing it to the likes of [i]Stardew Valley[/i]. There is a touch of farming mixed in, and you better believe there are plenty of eligible singles in town to romance. But its RPG elements are really where [i]Portia[/i] shines. Crafting, combat, and questing all around. There are several individual stories woven into a core narrative that guide the player forward, helping to ease into the game mechanics that level up with time. That can make the beginning a bit slow, but before the first in-game year is out, you'll be at a place making steady income and taking on greater challenges. 

At the heart of [i]Portia's[/i] focus is the workshop. You collect materials, accept contracts, and build various items for the townsfolk and story missions. This adds a significant dimension of resource management to the gameplay, which I personally enjoy, but I realize this isn't everyone's cup of tea. You will need to mine, hunt, and collect a lot of different items to advance your progression. Fortunately, these are all tied into the RPG aspects of the game, giving you a lot of little activities to keep resource acquisition fresh and entertaining. And the open world is beautiful to explore as you complete these activities. I was particularly impressed with the mines, which allows you to dig tunnels in a 3D space. 

Admittedly, some of the controls are a little tricky in 3D, and the mines in particular can get you turned around and lost. Sometimes the distances in the overworld take a little longer than I'd like to get from objective to objective. The extended cast has pretty decent voice acting and dialogue options, if somewhat stale at times. But in general, none of these things detracted from the fun I had. The art style is charming, and as mentioned before, the resource management fills a niche I adore in these kinds of games. 

On the whole, [i]My Time At Portia[/i] is a pretty good game. There's enough content to keep you entertained for a long time.",1655049614,1669005928,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love that when I get bored with one element of the game I can shift to another easily and go and do that for a bit. Like I can go mine for hours at a time if I want to or I can go to the Wastelands and farm items from monsters, or even go diving into a dungeon for a run through there. From there I can shift and either work on my farm, work on building things, go fishing, or run around town upping my friendship levels with the fellow townspeople. The back stories on most of them is more in depth than you would think it to be, and they leave hints about their whereabouts throughout the day the more you get to know them to use in quests. It's also a really lenient game in terms of direction which makes it a great game for kids just learning how to play games. My 10 yr old plays it a lot and mostly just enjoys going to the school with the kids every morning and playing with them around town with her character...and the game lets her do that with no real consequences.

I might revisit it in the future, but only if I run out of other titles in similar categories. By comparison, even as I write this, I would rather go play Slime Rancher, Sims 4, or Craft the World.

[b]First impressions[/b]

Right off the bat, it can be quite charming. It's truly wholesome, with a very pleasant and quaint atmosphere. However, I say this with a major caveat: This is one of only a few titles with this kind of overall design, environment, and gameplay that I've ever tried. So from that point of view, it's very a nice change of pace and provides that ""happy place"" kind of immersion.

[b]Things that annoyed or disappointed me the most:[/b]

1. Crafting is either a chore or unsatisfying. There's lots to build, but functionally, they all feel quite pointless and underwhelming despite needing to build and upgrade so many things (not to mention the ridiculous amount of space they take on your lot. Requisitions become annoying and burdensome. There are seemingly endless ""missions"", and some builds get increasingly complex. And yet, the feeling of redundancy is inevitable.

(I actually had more fun with the cooking, as well as experimenting with recipes, even those that turned out... not so palatable xD)

2. If this is supposed to be part dating sim, then the quirky visuals and atmosphere are wasted on, for the most part, drab, cookie-cutter characters who aren't all that charming. I didn't come across any who are actually worth the trouble ""romancing"" unless you're just in it for the sake of completion. (But please bear in mind, when I think of building ""relationships"" and having richer dialogue options between the MC and NPCs, it's way up there with titles like Dragon Age.)

3. Combat and adventure. Oh, wait. That actually exists in this game? Yeah. It's THAT forgettable.

[b]Final thoughts[/b]

There's A LOT to do, but at the same time... NOT. Despite the variety of kinds of tasks available, nothing is done all that well. Farming, animal husbandry, crafting, adventure RPG, all meet a bare minimum in each category. 

I do recommend it for those seeking a very simplistic alternative to other life sims, farming, and crafting games. Just don't expect much. It's as casual as ""casual"" can get. 

Sweet and charming. A worthy and wholesome distraction when you need one. But like bubblegum, it loses its flavour eventually.

it's strange because this game ticks off everything i usually look for in sim games: there's farming, building, romance, crafting, exploring, collection museums, dungeon crawling, etc. and there seems to be a Lot of world building and lore that seems interesting! but i dont know, the way it was executed wasn't satisfying to me. i completed all the main quests, side quests, and some of the villagers' quests (the ones i ended up being close friends with anyway), but i didnt fall in love with this world or its characters. i dont hate them either though. there was a lot of potential i saw while playing, but it just didnt work for me. and usually i rush to romance characters if it's an option in games, but i didnt really feel like it in this game. i ended up romancing aadit because my friend mentioned the idea, but his romance was Unsatisfying to say the least, which was surprising.

you can definitely see they tried to implement mechanics and systems for future efficiency, the more you invested into the game. but ultimately, the game feels very unfinished and unpolished. there's a lot of strange bugs and the game itself would always be in danger of crashing just by booting it up. story and character quest progression is extremely oddly paced. there's a whole end bit after finishing the game that doesn't feel like it Needs to be there. it feels like it should have been Before the end.

It wants to be a story title with combat elements but the animations are uncanny valley, its voice acting mediocre, its combat janky, and its inventory management difficult to predict (sometime you have items with no use suddenly become vitally important on a time crunch). It is difficult to build up to enough land to farm and even have the technology to do so. It is based around building/constructing items so you juggle smelting and hope to prepare while the social system feels slow and punishing. I've tried to reach end-game several times only to loose interest (and my last attempt ended bugging out at a mandatory date).

No pressure, just build, explore, make friends, etc, and lose HOURS of your irl day without realising it. In that respect, it IS quite like Stardew Valley, with farming switched for building. Colourful, appealing graphics, and reasonably simple controls for PC, so a very family friendly game over all. 

Cons: NPCs are kind of limited in expression and dialogue, so sometimes socialising can be a drag. Not entirely sure why beating people up improves a relationship. Could do better at recording likes/dislikes for characters on their social profiles.  Some things could do with better explanation in-game - a help section for game mechanics, rather than having to pause the game and visit the wiki. Furniture placement is an awkward process - why is it so hard to get the bed facing the right way? I got married almost without realising it (seriously, I should have at least been given the option to change my outfit!) and then my spouse did not move in for some time because of issues with the stupid bed. I got stuck in the Haunted Cave and had to quit the game to get out. My real pet peeve is language - 'restitute' only refers to restore in terms of compensation, not repair, and every time Ack says 'I have done a bunch of work, check them out!' I cringe.

#1 each storage box should have two pages for contents as opposed to just one. It makes the farm look horrible having to display dozens of cargo boxes to make up for this shortcoming. 

#2 Item placement needs to be extended by five blocks or so away from your character. This would enable the player to easily put down items from outside of a confined space. Having it one step in front of the character is the most cumbersome thing I've ever had to endure while placing items down in a game. There is no swing and distance between the two.

#3 Why can't we see those big ticket items from the construction store before we purchase them? This by itself is pretty shady or shoddy work in my honest opinion which could easily be fixed.

I wasn't really a fan of the artwork on the cover so I put off playing it for the longest time but I'm glad I decided to one day dive in regardless because this has quickly become my new comfort game. This game takes place in a post apocalyptic world but it's so pleasant about it!

It's important to note that overall this game is fairly different from Stardew and deserves to be played without comparison. I'm a hypocrite, though, so I'm going to compare it regardless. 

In some ways Portia is more relaxing (you don't have to worry about dying and the consequences of staying out late) but in does put more emphasis on crafting, various dungeons, and battling enemies. Farming very much does take a backseat as well but character relationships (which I feel are very well done here and there's plenty of changing dialouge to go through) are very important in this game and are, in my opinion, done a bit better. You'll make friends, find a spouse, have children, etc and build a home. People may also pair up with each other as well which is more realistic than everyone just sitting around waiting for you,the main character of the universe. 

As mentioned above this game has more battles but there's very little stress besides a few time sensitive tasks that need to be done. Unfortunately for completionists here, if you fail a task you fail forever! But, on a positive note, if you die you just regenerate. You don't lose anything or wake up the next day with half of your health/stamina still depleted. 

Something to note is that this game often feels a bit unfinished. It's not as polished as I would like. It can be glitchy and the graphics can get down right weird but I think part of its charm is how wonky it can be. Overall, I've loved the game so far and look forward to playing the next installment in the series.

i had pretty high hopes it could fix the things that made it feel like such a chore. but, given the fact they're making a new game and haven't fixed any of this, i think it's safe to say that's not happening. me, my girlfriend's mom and my sister all tried this game and gave it a chance. for all of us it's remained kind of the pillarstone of what just doesn't work in this genre, which sucks, because we all tried our best giving it a chance. 

this game feels like a chore.  i think judging by the playtime on this i gave it more than a fair chance. it's just not fun. i don't know what anyone sees in it. nothing makes sense and you don't get to decide anything at your own pace. at this point in time, it's hard to see where my old viewpoints of it being able to get better came from. i was trying to be nice, but now i just think i was being inaccurate. there's not a second of the game i felt like i was just having fun. 
this game has the most joyless combat system i've ever played tbh. 






TL;DR  It's not there yet!! but it could be.

Even if I could, I don't think I'd refund it. I think it's valuable to have around. I think it has promise, and I think it can get somewhere it's actually fun to play. I'll continue playing it, and at the very least, check out every update. This review is gonna sound a little harsh, but mostly because I just so so desperately hope these things are fixed. The game does have a very instantaneous charm to it though!
I was really into this as a concept. It has all the aspects of Stardew Valley I loved -- same sex romance, mining, farming, combat, cattle,  story. The thing is that it incorporates all of those things in a way that feels very tedious, and there isn't nearly as much of a choice when it comes to building your lifestyle. A lot of things are confusing or quirky in a way that's hard to parse, and you're often left without explanation.

MONEY:
You can only really make money through commissions. I'm fairly certain any other way you'd just sort of stay in the same place and just lose money every step. 

TRAVEL:
The world is huge, but large parts of it seem unecessary that, if it were at least utilised might be justifiable, but most of it doesn't even have foragables, or when it does it's like, a ton of really small trees that'd take more energy to chop than it'd be worth.  And even when you run, it still takes a very long time to get place to place. It doesn't help that it's very laggy even on a good computer, but it's early access, so I'm a little more lenient for that kind of thing.
They seem to be aware of this and put in a bus system. You have to build all the transport, and most of the stops, often for free (and as I said, making things is the only real means to make any money, so that can be unfortunate.) and sometimes, you'll finally make it to a place after a prolonged crawl and find out you need to place a stop there. 

Note: I would have liked this normally, but again, the travel time and distance is such a complete drag.

Most unfortunately is the cutscene that plays every time you get off the bus, which very quickly gets frustrating. Bus stops are also placed too far apart most of the time. They don't go to places you're likely to stop by, and a lot of places are genuinely hard to find. The church, for example, is placed on top of a mountain. Why do this.
I really like that the character can climb almost anything, and fall tremendous distance. It makes the traveltimes a little more bearable.

MINING & FARMING:
 I thought mining was fun at first, but being dropped in a laggy, very VERY poorly lit mine that has a lot of inexplicable structures in it, some of which are breakable and some just seem to......be there? And serve no purpose? It's just kind of weird. It's not even something you can inquire about. Also, it costs money to go into the mines, so you need to choose carefully about what kind of week your character's about to have or else essentially waste that money. You also have to activate this system to scan for special items and you can't move when it's on. It takes the fun out of it a little.
Farming's also pretty disappointing, but at least you don't need to like, actually watch your plants at all? There's just like a lot of stuff going on at any given time so it's nice not to worry about that. You really only farm for resources to craft for commissions, and so far it seems like a game that would be difficult to stock up on anything in.
I haven't gotten to cattle farming yet.

COMBAT:
Combat is awful. It's kind of just one of those button mashers except it takes like, two seconds every time you hit something. Every hit. Multiple hits to each enemy and so, so many to bosses. Your weapon always feels weak, and mechanics like dodging and running are incredibly faulty and slow to refill, so you're always very vulnerable in battle. Food either takes a long time to craft (gathering, building machinery, waiting for them to be done) or a TON of money and a lot of the effects of food seem kind of overcomplicated. Dungeons are often longwinded and confusing and just not very fun after the first couple enemies. It's just very tedious.


CHARACTER CREATION & STORY:
I can't really say too much about this because honestly, it was so laggy when I made my character I accidentally started the game really quick. I'm not sure if you can adjust things like height or build, but I'd hope so, just because my character kind of looks like a child, and it's hard to tell the ages of other characters in-game, and considering many are romanceable, that's troubling. Also: it genders haircuts and facial shapes, which is pretty silly in my opinion. Anybody can have any hair and facial shape, y'all. 

I'm also not sure if the characters are... exactly human? It gets confusing because they keep talking about this apocalypse, but it's weird, because your character lives on this planet, so wouldn't they already know that? The musings of the churchlings is a bit much, too. 

Charater dialogue is awkard and forced at times, but I might just hate the voice of mine because I didn't actually get to choose. RIP. I keep finding certain things to be overexplained, and other things not to really be touched on at all. It's also very inconsistent. The music is alright, but a lot of sound effects are absolutely unpleasant.
Characters are, for obvious reasons, underdeveloped, and so often they're unlikeable. I'm holding out on romance until the game is a little further along, I think.

Anyways I know this was a bit Much but y'know. Buyer beware.",1532715015,1667052676,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Please note that I have marked this as recommended, however, I do have a LOT of issues with it so please remember that not only is this my opinion but my experience as well. This review also CONTAINS SPOILERS!

So, let's start with the good stuff
- It's not just a farming game. It doesn't compare to the likes of Stardew, Animal Crossing, nothing like that. Farming is not something you need to do, it's a choice. I've gone through 80+ hours of gameplay and not once had a farm or farm animal set up. Never needed to.

-It has an interesting storyline that also gives you a break. So you'll have days where you'll have no missions to do. The day is yours. This was also a negative for me as it got to the point where I HAD nothing to do so I would end up sleeping an entire day away.

- It's a pretty simple game. It's relaxing. For the most part, you can play it at your own pace. Some missions have an expiry time but they're not too bad.

- The game time is adjustable. At default 1 real time second = 1 in game minute, meaning days can pass by super quick, however, there is an option to slow the game time down to half that, which I SUPER appreciated when I had a lot of tasks to do.

- This is more of an amusing point than a positive about the game but... Arlo is probably my favourite Portia resident, however, in some situations, such as playing on the swings etc, his constant bored expression is hilarious. Even if you marry him, he just looks bored! Would've been nice for characters to have some facial expression to make them seem more human but then if they had, this wouldn't have been comical for me

Let's move on to the neutrals
- Weapons... I've managed to get the Obsidian Edge sword, which isn't the most powerful but it's up there. Yet, it still takes me 5 minutes of spam clicking to kill one enemy? Doesn't seem right to me. Unless I'm doing something wrong, the balance is off. Frustrating but I can deal with it.

- Commissions... Why are they always the same every day? I seem to get the same requests from the same people everyday. Again, annoying but it got to the point where I stopped doing them.

- Storage. It's great that you have a lot of inventory slots (though expensive to unlock) however, storage boxes? Whole different story... Barely any space in them, considering how many items you end up collecting... I ended up installing a mod to extend the amount of storage capacity I had and even still, I have about 20 storage boxes taking up a room... That may just be my OCD needing a separate box for every type of item though

Now for the bad stuff... Hold on to your hats... 

- Certain missions asking for items that you couldn't craft yet... I had a couple of missions that I failed because I couldn't make the item the person wanted as I hadn't unlocked the recipe or diagram to do so which seems extremely unfair because once you've failed a mission, there's no way you'd be able to do it again without replaying the game

- The museum... There's multiple spaces in the museum that are empty. Example, I have an empty small relic space but nothing to put there. There's a giant steel framework stand as soon as you enter the museum which is clearly supposed to be placeholder for something but you can't interact with it or anything. I've done extensive research to find a lot of people saying there are items that go there but they're not available in the game without a mod... What's the point in that?! Which leads me to my next point:

-It's not complete, meaning this game is not complete, despite what Pathea/Team 17 say. It's more like they gave up on Portia in favour of Sandrock.

- The Deepest Ruin... Every time I come out of that place, the game gives me a fatal error and crashes, meaning I then lose an entire day of stuff and trust me, it's not my PC.

- Residents have no sense of personality. Every one is the pretty much the same. Their dialogue is the same. You could speak to someone 3-4 times a day and they will just repeat the same dialogue, unless a significant event has happened, in which case, they'll say their piece, then go back to repeating their standard dialogue. They have no facial expression, nothing.

- Leading on to the voice acting... It's... Not great. Sorry. You can tell that the characters have been voiced by the same 3 people and it just doesn't work. It severely breaks the immersion for me so I have it turned off at all times. Arlo, again, is the worst one. His voice does not suit him at all and he just repeats the same word in the same tone when you speak to him. It's... Gross lol

- Pathfinding... Awful. Characters get stuck on things and then end up teleporting to the ether. They sometimes have no sense of direction at all, especially Ack. I've caught him stuck, running in circles, even in t-pose in the middle of the street. I have also removed his Lara model from my farm (it looked horrible...) and yet, he still comes by to where it was and stands there as though the model is still there.

- Glitchy animations. When entering a building, usually either The Round Table or the Church, everyone in there will stand up, glitch around a bit and then sit back down. Same with people on horseback. They're constantly glitching on and off their horses.

- Some of the mini games/season events are... Not good. The snowball fight is the WORST! You can aim to hit people and the game doesn't count it unless you get it EXACTLY where the hitbox is and good luck with that cause you ain't gonna find it!


Don't get me wrong, this game is fine. However, I don't believe it's as complete as Team 17 and Pathea claim it to be and it's pretty obvious. It still needs some work/updating but if you can look passed all that, then of course I recommend it, despite that the bad definitely outweighs the good for me.",1666001315,1666001315,True,50,3,0.834668517112731934,0,True,False,False

They are rather diverse and have very distinct and interesting personalities. The cons of the game is it can be very lag-heavy at times and the player avatar doesn't look as clean as the townsfolk.

Playing a day takes about 15-25 minutes or so, which makes this a game one where you can play it pretty quickly once a day, maybe sometimes playing two days in-game; a slow burn.

And while searching for solutions I noticed too many players are experiencing this. And all they'll do is ask for your crash file. Which doesn't exist. 

If you know your game crashes a lot, I don't know, maybe put a save button or something? Then again, it wouldn't be ""3D Stardew Valley"" if you did, right? News flash though, Stardew Valley actually works, your game doesn't.

It's clear that a tremendous amount of work went into it and the world is complex, open-ended, and has plenty of contentâI'm nowhere near done; I reckon there are a hundred hours in the main storyline alone. It's absolutely worth buying and playing, especially if you pick it up on one of the frequent sales for 75% off. There are hundreds of items, quests, a progression tier... but for a game that was ostensibly released three years ago, it doesn't seem... complete and polished. 


The combat is a little clunkyâbasically, spam attack.  ""Dying"" doesn't do anythingâyou just end up back at your workshop/home base, without having lost any items or anything. Dying in a boss fight or a mine? Just revives you instantaneously a few hundred feet back, same deal. So it ultimately feels a little meaningless.

Also, a lot of the animals are far too cute and mammalian for me to want to kill. I don't want to have to massacre pink llamas that are innocently grazing in their lil field to get fur and be able to participate in the game! Bunnies in hats! Rotund blue creatures in hats and bow ties! Yes, this is irrational, but I'm human; I can't help it. I wish there were a mechanic like ""shearing"" rather than actually... having to kill them. Or they could just be less cute. 

It's clear that whoever wrote many of the scriptsâespecially the loading screen suggestionsâis not a native English speaker and is closer to conversational than fluent; there are several odd errors and grammatical mistakes.

Many of the shopkeepers seem to have odd and inconsistent setupsâwhy is the furniture salesman willing to buy my monster loot and CD's? Surely he should only want to buy my furniture and furniture-adjacent items? That clearly could use further review.

The furniture/home decor items improving stamina, health, attack, etc. is a little distressingâyou're basically incentivized to cram your house full of haphazard items with no open space or cohesive design scheme to maximize your stats. Maybe there could be slots for you to select your favorite couch or bookshelf or so forth, the way the clothing system works. 

And finally, the handbook is a little poorly designedâit would be great if there were a search bar, more detailed entries on the various items in the catalog and where to find them (beyond simply the category of ""loot"" or ""gather""), perhaps entries on the animals/monsters that you've faced in the past...

Don't get me wrong, the mindless task completion (and subsequent sound effects) are great for ""dopamine chainsmoking"", but my patience quickly outpaced the rate of storyline expansion (and therefore new things to do).

When I stopped there was actually a thing I missed and weirdly it was the endless fetch quest - go to this cool area, resource mine this thing and help me build this super cool thing - quests (how very single player of me I know). 

If you're like me and you like to interact and build relationships with NPCs while doing resource mining in interesting places to build cool stuff this is going to be right up your alley.

Initial complaints- the tutorials should continue to pop up until you've completed the action. Flashing, then disappearing, is aggravating. I had to google how to use the mining glasses because I missed the popup. The chests need a quick stack option and when you press ""sort"" it should combine like items from other chests. I'm only 8 hours in and have 4 chests full of crap that I'm trying to organize. I have no idea how to expand the farm yet and it is filling with machines and chests. Time passes too quickly in the game.

Update: I've had to restart the game repeatedly to fix the lag/choppiness that will appear. When I say restart, I mean start an entire new game. Once your game goes choppy, it won't fix itself.

The game very much is trying to jump on the Stardew train, while not having as much depth and charm as Stardew while also having rather weird graphics. Its not quite cel-shading but also not cartoony, having a feeling of generic Unity artwork to it. The game also has the feeling of being a ""mile wide puddle that's all of an inch deep"". I have about 30 hours on my switch version and an hour and a half on my steam copy.

Likes: The game can be a great time waster. You'll be mining, farming, chatting with villagers and you'll easily pass a couple hours of time.
The world has some nice vistas
The music is pretty decent
Story isn't half bad

Dislikes: Everything kinda feels superficial, with the mining being the most. It's just a pit with destructive mesh. Not much detail; you determine what your mining by the color of the mesh. There's a scanner tool to show you artifacts below the mesh and you can mine to them.
Refining ore feels like a lengthy chore, where you will need several forges to refine any meaningful amount in a decent time.
Voice acting is cringy
I, for the life of me cannot make a decent looking male character that doesn't make you want to cringe as well
There never seems to be enough time in a day to do certain stuff, and at other times you're just waiting for materials to refine.

I really wanted to like this game, but I feel like it just missed it's mark trying to hop on the hype Stardew created.
Is it worth the $30 for the game? No.
Is it worth $20 for the game? Yes, for the purpose of wasting time.

The graphics are nothing special, but I actually really enjoyed the story and characters. They all have their own homes and relationships, and routes they take everyday. The more you develop a relationship, you unlock specific side quests and dialog which I really enjoyed. (I hate having to interact with a character that the game forces you to interact with, so having that amount of freedom is nice.) I really did enjoy the lore within the game, and despite other reviews, I actually liked the charterers and thought they were well developed. Yes, there are holes in the story, and it seems a little underdeveloped in some parts, I don't think it takes away from the overall experience. 
Grinding is definitely a large part of the game play, such as workshop missions, farming ect. But I found it rather satisfying. I also like the fact that yes you are a builder, but the game doesn't force you to just farm, or take care of animals. It helps, but its a choice. In my case, I mainly just focused on building, and then had a few plants and a couple ducks and it didn't affect the game/story at all. There are quite a few different ways to get currency, I just went with fishing/fish farming. If your'e looking of a laid back, grinding, story based, relationship building type of game then My Time at Portia is probably a game you'll enjoy.",1662827616,1662827616,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My Time in Portia (pronounced Porche [like people who own Porche's pronounce Porche {not pronounced Port-E-Ah like I thought, since it's an island and you start by landing at the port}]) is in the same style of games such as Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley. This time, however, it's a twist! You don't start out farming. Instead you take over your absent father's workshop and start crafting items for your own progression and to help the townsfolk. 

I like this idea over the farming aspect. It makes you interact and begin building relationships with the townsfolk earlier than later. Usually in Stardew, I spent the whole time trying to farm, clean up my farm and fight monsters. I completely miss the social aspect of that game because I have so much more to do. The idea of taking half a day to walk to town and give a random person a wild onion to see if they like it or not is just something I don't have time for. But in Portia making items for people and building relationships is part of the structure of the game. I actually found myself connecting more with characters in this game and I enjoyed their varied personalities. Time doesn't move as quick (or so it feels like it) and I was able to take time from my quests and tasks and speak with people. Dialogue always felt fresh and I learned more about people and the town the more I interacted with characters. 

Allow me to take a moment and explain why I wish there was a silent protagonist in this game... He sounds very flamboyant... I identify as a straight male. I get the impression the voice actor in this game, does not. It was actually interesting to hear a voice I did not identify with speaking for me, while I tried to swoon a female in the game. It was a stark contrast. BUT, I'm over represented and most males in games are overly manly. I enjoyed the game and the chance to experience a different voice wasn't a bad one, just something I did not expect. 

So do I like Porche? Yes! It's fun, it has a very casual vibe, there's a lot to do, the game progresses very well, exploration is rewarded, there's a social aspect here that I wish other games implemented. I definitely recommend this game!",1662814635,1662814635,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Original Review
Way more content than I expected. Low stress. A lot of the things I've found irritating about other farming/mining/crafting games I didn't find in this game and I appreciate that. Your tools don't break. There are no repetitive cut scenes. Pass out at 3am (in game) and wake up in bed with no stamina penalty. I could pause the game and come back to it a few hours later and it's not hard to pick right back up where I was. The creators are still adding content as of this post. My character just finished her second year and she only has 2/3rds of the skill tree unlocked. There's still more to do. Thank you Pathea.

The story does really well in incorporating all of the characters and different personalities.

I do, however, have some suggestions to implement in My Time at Sandrock (the sequel):
- better graphics, for example smoother character textures and more vegetation so the land doesn't look so flat (already done for the most part I believe) - Zelda, Breath of the Wild would provide a great template in terms of large forests and grassy expanses not looking so flat without being too overwhelming
- more options for pets such as different breeds and color varieties. this can also be applied to mounts and farm animals. for example, different breeds of chickens not only look different, they drop different colored eggs! i personally love horses as well, so only having three colors in this game was a bit underwhelming. there's just SO much potential with animals and farming that can be explored in these games!
- more romance/friendship quests. I LOVE the individual quests the characters in this game have. A Strong Man's Adventure with Arlo is fantastic, as well as some of the side quests. I'd love to see more of that in Sandrock or future installments - more date quests for eligible NPCs, maybe some quests that are similar for platonic NPC relationships. For example, I loved romancing Arlo and Dr. Xu, but I would've loved to have more quests where they suggest dates because I'd get to know them better and it would seem more immersive! I also love Nora and Emily as characters, so having quests where my character can go and hang out with them (not just playdates)  to get to know them as friends would make them really feel like true BFFs with my character!!
- more dialogue. one of my only complaints with this game is the dialogue. when (SPOILER) Aadit leaves Portia, it seems like few NPCs comment on it. There are also no comments if your character gets married, divorces, breaks up with, or starts dating another NPC. Expanding on this to make the NPCs more 'interested' in the characters life would add a whole new layer of depth to the game!",1661827363,1661827363,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

I was looking for something more along the lines of Stardew Valley. Within the first hour of playing, I could tell this was going to be an exercise in tedium. Grind heavy. One of those games with a lot of unnecessary processing steps that eat up way too much time. Rather than easing you in, it throws a lot at you fast, some of it time sensitive, and the day moves quick. By the time I gave up, I had a pile of quests and more crap I didn't know what to do with than I could hold in my limited inventory, and people were still heaping it on. The UI and crafting system is also not at all intuitive. It took me way longer than it should have just to figure out where and how to build a storage box to keep all the junk that was piling up, which I guess is partially on me.

All in all, it's not that the game is too complicated to figure out with enough time and patience, it's just that doing so felt like a boring slog. Progress is slow, way too many unnecessary steps. The game definitely has more depth than Stardew Valley, which isn't a bad thing, but it lacks the charm and relaxing vibe, the straightforward gameplay.",1661806676,1661806676,False,31,0,0.640169680118560791,0,True,False,False

As an autistic person with little to nothing to do during the day, I really need purpose in my life to feel productive and useful, and Portia's constant commissions and quests and a storyline to uncover really caught my attention! 
I've really enjoyed getting to meet the characters and discover more of the world as I play. The whole vibe of a generally very pretty lighthearted post-apocalypse kinda thing really intrigued me too!
It reminds me of games I've played in the past like Harvest Moon and Slime Rancher but with less of an emphasis on farming alone and more on exploration, discovery and even combat! (I love games with combat mechanics!)
Overall, for a game I discovered incredibly recently and owned for less than a week, I give it a stellar review! I mean,  I've played it for over a full day despite owning it for such a short amount of time! And I have the attention span of a gnat when it comes to games, take from that what you will lol

There are some minor issues I've noticed, voiced lines are sparse throughout the game (sometimes they have them, sometimes they don't) and they aren't always consistent with the text boxes on screen. Though that's mostly nitpicking, I'm just happy to hear voiced lines full stop haha.
There's also the occasional glitch or two, but I won't hold it against them, given how massive the game seems to be. Every game has glitches and problems and I would be truly petty to get annoyed. Usually I just quit and restart the day. (I also love that mechanic. Sure it's a little annoying to need to end the day to save and quit sometimes, but it's so much better to start off on a fresh day, I can't count the amount of times that, while playing harvest moon, I would open it up only to find myself in the middle of a day with no idea what I was doing or what I've already done so far. Portia doesn't really have that problem, and I love it! It seems minor, but trust me, it really helps!)

My Time At Portia is officially one of my favorites of the farming genre, though you are a builder instead of a farmer and I love being a builder so much more. You gather materials to make a variety of machines and objects and accessories. Of what you'll need, much of materials will need to sit in machines for a while to create what you need and the quantity of what you need. This opens you up to spend you time however you wish, to go and gather more materials in mining, logging, or fighting monsters/wildlife, or delving into the social aspect of the game. 

Which, for this social system, it's easily my favorite hands down. This is the first one I've played where I did get a sense of community. This game not only has romantic dates, but platonic play dates. You can go dine with friends, sit and chat under the tree, play on the beach, ect. And that's just so refreshing. They also have it set up that as your relationship improves with one character, whoever they're friends with will also like you more. And there are perks to friendships from store discounts to attack bonuses, depending on who you befriend. There's also quite a few nice moments in this game. Why, Dr Xu, who I'm not even that close with, asked me one day how I'm doing, told him I'm struggling to gather up this material and he goes out of his way to gather up a small quantity to help me. I was very touched. 

For cons, aesthetically, it's not going to be for everyone. My sister loved what I told her about this game, but when she saw the design for the game, she just couldn't get into it. If you like what you hear but want something visually improved, I'd recommend My Time At Sandrock; but if you think you can roll with the design, you'll be in for a good time. 

Another thing to forewarn is that there is lag here and there (riding horse or lightning storms) and a few bugs, most I encountered are models glitching out, specifically those who ride horses. I know the devs have plan on updating Portia to include some characters of Sandrock, so hopefully with these updates, these will get fixed. 

For the satisfaction of being a builder and this social system, My Time At Portia I really recommend as I have been having a blast. I'm actually getting close to the finish of the main storyline, and I'll be looking forward to starting Sandrock soon. I've been hearing a lot of good things for it, and it makes me excited to see if they'll do more of this world.",1661132508,1661132508,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It feels incomplete most of the time when you're not doing anything other than doing commissions, mining, chopping, and gathering. I've only done one playthrough and I've already made it to the end of the game within a week or two in real time but all of that could have been done within the week or shorter if I knew what to do which is a little disappointing. I was expecting more content or at least more memorable moments with the love interests. As for the love interests, Gust, Arlo, Dr. Xu, and Oaks are the ones that caught my interest the most at first glance. The rest of the bachelors are just...there. I wouldn't do a playthrough to get those other bachelors which feels like a missed opportunity because I just don't feel anything towards them enough to get me to replay the entire game for them. There's also this one area that leads to the somber marsh ruins...the bridge. I'll never forget the many times my Cotton Llama got stuck on the way back home because of that one part where I always need to jump over it.

The good parts about this game is that I somehow managed to get a Cotton Llama which apparently already had maxed out training on my first try. I was confused why I couldn't train it at first until I searched it up. I could take my time with the game and be as slow as possible if I wanted to. There's a lot of achievements which I like, and would most likely try to get all of those if possible. There's a lot more bachelors than bachelorettes, yay! I get to befriend almost everyone, sadly excluding Higgins. The free swimsuit DLC hat was a nice bonus because I get to have better stats than the meidi hat one. Stronger weapons are a yes near the end of the game. Decorating the house is good enough.

I really enjoy the game actually, the overall mood & tone is super cute and relaxing, the storyline and NPC's dialogues are very interesting and fun, there're many activities we could do from farming, fishing, mining, raising pets, combatting and many more.

HOWEVER, it seems the game itself if pretty unstable for Mac user (and not sure for Window user too or not). Having play this game less than 2 weeks, I found 2 major bugs already (major for me means = you can't really play the game) and after posting in the community - it seems we all shared one common thing that is we're playing on Mac.

I have already raised the issue to the supports and devs team; in which they're very supportive. But anyhow, the issue seems not yet fixed. If the issue still persists, I might consider refunding the products later on (but I'll wait a bit more)

It's got some really endearing animation or sound jank, and all the voice-acting is honestly delightful. Sure, some voice-acting is a little better than others, but the absolute variety is so great and I have a great time listening to all of the characters. I highly appreciate the effort put into making Portia more-or-less fully voice-acted when the characters all have a fair bit of unique dialogue. It really adds to the experience and gives them so much personality.
The characters themselves can be a bit stereotypical, but they're all fun in their own way. I'm only through the first year so far, and still have a lot of lore tidbits to learn, but I absolutely adore them.
The gameplay keeps you constantly busy, and it can be a little challenging at times to get requests finished - not a complaint by any means! It's really great that I can keep finding stuff that I need to do or collect. The resource-collecting and crafting side of things is a lot of fun, with just the right amount of different, diverse materials. I'm not too fussed on the farming side so far, but I haven't needed a reason to delve into it yet! It's easy enough to source that sort of thing around Portia.
I also love that there's two different kinds of dungeons for resource-collection and gameplay variety. The no-enemies mining ones, as well as the no-mining enemies ones. Really nice idea, as I don't feel like it'll get stale for a good while, especially 'cause I don't see a need to go into these dungeons regularly. The fighting isn't the most interesting thing to do in the game, but it's easy enough, and that's fine by me.
---
Just some small things in this game that I appreciate:
[spoiler]The fact that the Hulu brothers all have different accents. Good lads.
The fact that I hear proper Aussie and Kiwi VAs in this game along with the myriad of other accents!
Django's all-round delightful voice-acting.
Alice's really sweet, kind voice.
Emily's really happy, adorable voice.
That Sonia is as extra as a Bratz character.
Just the voice-acting in general, I genuinely think everyone does such a great job.
That Jack looks like a Psychonauts character. Coolest kid.
The way Mei says 'Thanks, buddy!' even when I give her boring stuff.
The fact that I still want to be best friends with Higgins' even when he hasn't given me the slightest respect.
'Data Discs?'
Antoine's outward queerness!
Ack. Ack is just the most precious bean. I'm glad to see him every day. He's so fun to listen to.
You can pet the dog!
The way Gust looks after his sister.
That you can see/find out some characters have a thing for each other.[/spoiler]

But on the other hand, some things are just tedious.  You have to prepare super hard for everything, and it's easy to get behind if you don't have certain machines running at all times, mass-producing certain commonly-used items.  The game doesn't tell you you need to do this, but you certainly do. 

The game also has massive crafting-bloat.  FAR too many items, imo. and it's gets very hard to keep up with. ""Wait, how did I make that again?  Which machine do I use for this?  Crap, which ruin does that drop in? Ugh."" etc. 

I can see new players feeling very overwhelmed because of this.  But if you can mentally prepare yourself for that, it is fun once you learn everything.  

Oh, and as an extra side note: Don't try to complete EVERY commission they throw at you.  That's a straight up route to insanity.  Pick and choose, don't overload yourself.

If this game is on sale, I'd say go ahead and get it.

Pros:
Custom character creator
Open world
Lots to do
Marriage
Pets
You can take in game screenshots and then put those pictures on your wall
Children get the traits of you and your spouse
If you run out of bag space, and you leave items on the ground, they stay there, which is a nice touch.

Cons:
Timed missions
Children were half-assed
Gathering some materials was obnoxious

I've spent, [now] 600+ hours on it over the course of 'I don't know anymore' play-throughs since it was first released in early access.  I can absolutely attest to the progress they have made both in the crafting/gathering progression in the game, and the storyline (which is MUCH more fleshed out than it was previously: GJ GUYS!).  If you're having difficulties getting what you need, try going back a few days and focusing solely on gathering/crafting.  I find myself building/gathering/crafting almost non-stop the entire first season to ensure I can keep up with the demands  of the commerce guild requests, and even with the experience I've got from previous playthroughs, I barely keep ahead of what is needed.  If you focus on your infrastructure initially, it will allow you to build up your furnaces/grinders/skivers/etc. to the point where you can out-pace the demand for goods, and stockpile resources, thus allowing you to focus more on exploration, social activities, etc.  I have managed to get all of the 'date-able' women to max hearts and 'soulmate' status in the first year this run, so as long as you focus on priorities in a decent order, it is very doable to meet all the demands of the game and then some.

ALL THAT BEING SAID: KUDOS to the devs, good job and please keep up the great work.  I look forward to more end-game story and [hopefully] stuff to build/gather/date/befriend/farm/raise/cook/smash/drill/hack/shoot/pickup/gift/explore/investigate/donate/repair/get paid for/expand/selfie/tame/catch/okI'moutofideas. :-D

UPDATE: Now after replaying this again after the release of Sandrock, I find myself having a much easier time managing my days (mainly due to the fact that I now know you can slow down the clock up to 50%... not that I don't think some sense of urgency is better... I keep it at 70-80% speed, to give myself that extra bit of time to use up my stamina and maximize efficiency but still not have a ton of extra time)   The story has been fleshed out more since my last time playing through, however there are still some gaping issues end-game (such as items with absolutely NO PURPOSE....).  Hope they continue to polish these issues and maximize the game's enjoyment factor for others as it truly is a quality game.  :cleancake::cleancake:",1542092385,1658176317,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really love this game that this is what I've been playing whenever I had free time before. This is more of a 'builder' game than a farming game. A lot of grinding on this game and the building game play is really quite an effort, you have to plan everything. I kept notes on paper. 

I also think the mob fighting in this game is more fun and exciting. You can get a NPC to fight with you. There are also sudden story cutscenes you'll discover after just discovering and fighting some mobs.

The main problem is no one went through the game and QA'd it. Things I saw:
-Blue construct environment on several story levels because objects and textures weren't lined up right
-Main story and non-story events weren't in sync, 
-contracts for items you can't make until you progress the story, but you can't progress because you have to wait
-boring social system where you need a wiki pulled up to know what NPCs like. Asked Sam what she liked to eat and she said 'not bitter food' 4 ""play times"" in a row.
- rushed end game. once you get toward the end, the devs gave up trying to balance the fights. they give you NPC buddies to kill for you, but it doesn't really work because both they and the mobs get caught on the doors.
-scuffed dialogue. Sometimes the voice actor fixes the sentence that doesn't have a verb, sometimes they don't. Some of the lines were recorded on a home mic and you can hear the static every time your spouse calls you 'honey'. Other times, they put the wrong inflection on the lines because they weren't given context.
-money making. Hope you like llama taming because it pays better than your 1 contract per day job.
-automation. They kind of blopped the factory in at the end and it removes any need you might have had for outdoor production. Then your spouse does the rest of the work
-combat. They set up a decent system, then put their attention elsewhere. That's why you invulnerable NPC buddies in the story missions, because the weapons and dodge system aren't viable when you're alone and NPCs are 10 levels higher than you. And leveling up isn't viable without missions and milestones.
-cooking. Can't click on the recipe to add to pot. You have to manually add all the ingredients every time and there's a one second interaction cooldown for each one. And you can't produce in bulk
-Loot. Some loot is needed, some is vendor trash. There's no clear indication as to which is which in game.
-recipes/buildings. The sorting needs refined. Some recipes are only used once for a singular quest and never again. But they stay in the furniture or parts tab and end up adding cluttering the list. 

I'm still recommending it because I got 65 hours out of an $8 game. But this game isn't a polished product. It's a ""we need to finish this and move on"" product.",1657426097,1657426097,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Voice acting is pretty good, but there are a few early lines where some of the villagers mispronounce the name of the town, which was rather jarring. The games does get repetitive in some aspects, rather quickly (mostly in the area of resource gathering). And once you finish the story, there isn't much that keeps you in the game, unless you tend to be a completionist.

It would be nice to have conversations in the lobbies you created yourself, if there were foreign servers where people with a foreign language deficiency could join, it could turn into a game that is worth even personal development. After all, the game is a life simulator. Even the thought of experiencing the effective use of a foreign language in daily life in a virtual environment rather than in real life would be a huge PLUS. Hopefully, Pathea Games can bring this feature in the near future. Still, I feel like it will be a game that will be installed on my computer for a long time.

I'd definitely recommend it.

The Switch version is busted, it hasn't received the QOL updates it should, the Xbox one isn't far behind. They're both missing some core updates to make the gameplay smoother and less bugged. The Switch one was prone to crashes. It was, frankly, exhausting.

So why did I buy it on PC? When I already owned it twice?

Because of modding. I bought it with the sole intention of modding the game to make it playable. But after loading in, running around doing commissions for 7hrs, I noticed that there were some differences. More voices. Voices that were previously missing. I was hearing some characters for the first time & was taken aback.

The PC version isn't perfect. I've had some crashes happen still, which I am confused about. I should really send the logs off but I dunno, I'm forgetful. As broken as other versions are, as much as this one crashes I am actually having fun.

I'm having a lot of fun! To the point that I've neglected other games I bought in the Summer Sale. I'm a big SMT fan and I'm completely ignoring Nocturne in favour of Portia. The world still feels empty at times, and the mechanics are still a bit janky (Switch has a move-to-back quick button, PC does not) and I sometimes press the wrong button assuming it does what a different version does but...

I hit a block during first winter (around 45h) where I really started to lose interest. A lot of the time the pace just isn't right; sometimes you'll have up to 4 big quests on the go and others there will be barely one quest to go on. There are other things that aren't quite finessed like combat, and what irks me a lot is how often the subtitles do not match up with the character's speech. I never felt any connection whatsoever with any NPCs due to their boring, two-dimensional personalities and therefore never married or even befriended anyone. 
While playing I had no idea how or when the game was going to end, which I find extremely uninspiring (much like the main story itself), even more so when the process is often quite grindy and monotonous.
When you reach the end of a game, there's usually still plenty to have fun with in most games, and I love spending that extra time really perfecting a playthrough, but I was just playing to finish this quite painful journey by the end.

At it's heart, Portia is: 

An Open World City (and later County) Builder game, that takes place in a Post-Apocalyptic Science Fantasy world. You play a new builder, who's tasks help develop the city and countryside.  

In between projects, you also have the ability to enjoy several other playstyles:
â¢ Make strong bonds with a wide cast of characters.
â¢ Delve into ancient dungeons, in search of scrap and loot.
â¢ Harvest ore, junk and rare tech in instanced areas.
â¢ Play mini-games for arcade style prizes.

My only minor gripes: 
â¢ It can be tedious to get materials for some quests/commissions, so make sure you read guides.
â¢ The instanced areas loot is incredibly repetitive. They fixed this in Sandrock!
â¢ Inventory management improves once you build a Factory. A more direct nudge to upgrading to a Factory would have saved me hours of time.

It's a great game. I am in love with the world. And I can't wait to try My Time At Sandrock, once I've completed Portia's story.

There are issues with the subtitles not matching the voice actors or having poor English, including English mistakes in the game interface (""NPC became your Close!""), and the voice actors reading lines that make no sense in English. The voice actors do things like refer to female NPCs as ""he"", then call them ""she"" again later; say lines like ""I just want to be nice to you for a little longer"" when the subtitle says ""I just wanted to be with you a little longer."" Your character will say completely different lines than the subtitled ones. It's pretty bad, and you don't know which you're supposed to be listening to or reading. There's never a cutscene that has no issues. Every single one has a problem or multiple problems.

I think the most annoying aspect of the gameplay, other than the above, is the fact that the side quests are one time only. If you fail to pick them up when they pop up (some quests only appear on one day and that's it), or of you don't finish them within the time frame (sometimes less than one in-game day), then you fail or lose the quest and it will never appear again. Even if you make an effort to be perfect and pick up and finish every quest, there are bugged side quests that will not spawn for you if you somehow play the game order ""wrong."" I played completely normally and never received the cutscene and quest for Phyllis's Remedy. There's also a quest from Aadit that spawns randomly that requests ingredients from a specific area that sometimes players have not unlocked. That quest has only one in-game day to finish it before it fails. There's also a quest to deliver milk within one day, but it doesn't make it obvious until the NPC you need to deliver to is asleep and you fail the quest the next morning. Another NPC Alice's quest showed up the day of a festival where there were events I had to attend and I had absolutely no time to do her quest. It disappeared forever after that. It makes a player feel badly about their game and they cannot fix it in any way. The game should have have been made to cycle the side quests until they are finished.

The game is entertaining and has a lot to do, and I played it a lot. I will play the next one (Sandrock) once it's out of Early Access. I hope that in the new game, they hire native English speakers to quality check the writing before hiring voice actors to read poor English, and improves upon the quest system.",1652540465,1655827070,True,3,2,0.551002025604248047,0,True,False,False

The little details make this game. I'll give a single example, but I want to be very clear: stuff like this is EVERYWHERE in this game.

There's a bus. The bus has a route, and two ends. On one end it disappears into a tunnel (it is going to another place, as a bus would). On the OTHER end, it stops and turns around, then gets back on the road. No fade out / blip / reload, no magical flip the bus, no, it slows down a little, pulls into the grass, and turns around. If you are running to catch up to the bus to get on, once you get close enough, it will stop for you.

Biggest Pros:
- The world is really cool. I think it's quite unique in this genre with a dystopian setting hidden behind a cute small town aethetic. There's old skyscapers and futuristic buildings falling apart in the background and I love it.
- This game focuses on you being a builder and completing quests actually affects the world. It's satisfying running around and seeing all the things you've built (bridges, bus stops, aqueducts, etc.) which often have practical uses for the player. It's interesting that you make your own bus stops/fast travel points.
Honorable mention that when crafting bigger items you can add one crafting material at a time and see the item slowly being built. It's a nice touch. 

Biggest Cons:
-  Combat is really boring, especially after playing it for 40+ hours. However since it's not entirely central to the game it's acceptable. Mid-late game you can commission people to gather creature drops and run through dungeons for you anyways. 
- The Voice-Lines are garbage. Many lines from characters do not have audio and sometimes the audio quality is noticeably bad. Some characters have voices that really don't match them. For example, Aadit is literally described as ""soft-spoken"" but sounds like your average white brit (despite being middle eastern). It honestly breaks my immersion and it would've been better if they went the route of games like undertale or animal crossing with just noises.
- Weird nitpick, but I really hate how the models have huge heads. They look like bobble heads to me. I'm glad they toned that down in the new sequel.

The biggest issue, is that there are game breaking bugs that you can't come back from, i.e., missing or not completing a quest 2 hours into the game will mean that you can't progress in the story line to completion, but you won't find that out until you've already put 40+ hours into the game. Forums are riddled with these issues that I wouldn't call bugs... the game is simply broken. Nothing is more maddening than putting that much time into a game only to find out you can't progress any further unless you start over (and the game is a bit of a grind.) 

Needless to say, no full release should have game breaking scenarios that can only be fixed by starting over from scratch. I've emailed the developer support and posted on Steam discussions and have yet to get a reply.

This game should be moved back to Early Access until it is fixed. I purchased it expecting a full game, only to find out that I paid $30, and have wasted about 90 hours of my time to be an alpha/beta tester.

In addition to being broken, there are also a number of bugs with audio, missing voice-overs, inventory, crashes, characters getting stuck, etc.

I would not recommend purchase of this game right now. When all the issues have been ironed out, it should be a pretty good game with elements of Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing and Zelda all combined. I may change this review at that time, but this developer has lost a lot of points with me by releasing an incomplete and broken game.",1548397546,1654785047,True,0,0,0.708706378936767578,6,True,False,False

I like the fact that it does have a storyline, where you solve some mysteries. It also has some background lore regarding a war and how some of the Portians are connected. I do wish it delve into this more, but I'm honestly good with it popping up every so often. It does pretty well with keeping things kind of realistic, like crafting some things actually take days (In-game days, not actual), making friends with others take time, saving up money to buy certain supplies, characters commenting on related missions or events, etc. I love the scenery! It is so beautiful. I like getting up high places just so I can look around. 

Though I love building and crafting, I am more of an adventure storyline kind of person with puzzles in between. So after a while (like a pretty good long while) into the game, it feels like it is just getting into building/crafting storyline and I've gotten bored with it. I like the side quests which keep me occupied and interested, but also you can burn through them quickly.  Some of the voiceacting is missing. Like Aadit is missing a lot. I also noticed Arlo starts missing some voiceacting. It kind of pulls from the game. There are a few glitches, like an adventure with Sam is a big glitch. She ran into the walls and such. I would love it if the characters who follow like could jump at the same time as you or knew when to jump. Teleportation helps in this area, but not when the character is still able to follow glitching through the walls.

There's a heavy emphasis on crafting and materials gathering, which is my personal preference for any game, there's mining, enemy fighting, even dungeons with boss monsters as you progress into the game, and there are hidden secrets all over the place in the form of hidden chests for all the adventurers out there. There's tons of stuff to do, the respawn rate for resources is actually pretty good, and the in-game prices are well thought out too. There's even a social aspect that rewards you with discounts at the shops and with story bits the more you interact with the townspeople too. I haven't gotten to the point of being able to marry anyone yet, as that's late-game, but I'd say that my top 5 choices, in order, are Petra, Emily, Mei, Nora, then Lucy. And while that's half the bachelorettes as I understand, there's 18 bachelors if you want to play a female, and a total of 28 romance options for a bisexual main!

But there is one major catch. This game is WAY too fast. And I don't mean the storyline or anything, I mean that the in-game days progress far too quickly and it's literally impossible to get anything done unless you know exactly what you plan to do the day prior and you go straight there to do it without talking to anyone, getting sidetracked, or similar. You feel very rushed at the game's base day speed. And the in-game option to change daytime speed does next to nothing since the options are 30-40 minutes per in-game day even though it takes the player roughly 5 irl minutes to go from their workshop to the mysterious trader's shop while running.

So while I highly recommend this game, I recommend that you make sure to get a mod that doubles the day's time. 60-80 minutes per in-game day is a LOT more doable and is a lot more relaxed, and even lets you talk to everyone in town once per day too. You're even able to get everything done most in-game days and still have about 5-10 irl minutes before your character would collapse in-game if you set it to 80 minute days, which I assure you you will need at all stages of the game.

I find the NPC characterization is no longer a major distraction, leaving me to enjoy the game for its virtues. There are still weird translation issues, mispronunciations, a misplaced conviction that real English speakers use the word ""telesis"" in conversation, and repetitive dialog, but overall the dialog is more varied and contextual than in most similar games. Characters will often discuss their feelings about recent in-game events, lending variety to interactions.

But, if the NPC interaction were the whole game, I'd have no interest. And it is a cute game. The story is well structured, with a lot of guidance but also the freedom to ignore the structure and go fishing. The mines are a discombobulating three-dimensional experience. (Physics is not much of a thing.) The focus of the play tends toward resource acquisition and product building, through the lens of various quests and contracts. I admit I've been using the wiki during play when deciding if I can handle a contract to produce something to see what machinery and materials it requires to make in order to judge the practicality of fulfilling the potential contract. (This feels less like cheating because running back to my machines to check their recipes would only cost game time, but ""time is money"", so I'm still cheating.)

Giving quests to retrieve or create items without any clue to how or where to find them is an immersive choice, but it does mean a lot of less immersive time waste figuring it out. My worst example was when a quest required a [spoiler]broom[/spoiler]. I didn't know how to find, make or buy one, so spent a lot of time. If this were real, I'd ask people where to find one, but the NPC interactions didn't allow that, and it took a very long time for me to find that it was just sitting on the floor in the same room as the quest giver.

I'm probably mid-game currently, and I have noticed a very definite pattern of pushing player progress by requiring more ""advanced"" materials for projects introduced later. It's a simplistic way of enforcing progress in order to continue to progress the main quest, but there's a good effort here to make the increased requirements make sense in the story. For example, I've been involved in the building of two bridges at my point in the game, and while the second required much more advanced materials, it was also an intercity bridge, not just a foot bridge, and could be expected to handle more weight.

[h1]Original Review[/h1]
[h1]tl;dr[/h1]
In the late 1980's, when the AIDS crisis was killing tens of thousands of Americans a year, and the U.S. government was actively resisting any serious response to save lives, one of the popular protest chants was, ""Heath care is a right!""  Leaving aside the modern health care controversies, this chant was strongly associated with the gay community because those infected and killed by the AIDS virus at the time were disproportionately gay men. When the heavily stereotypical gay NPC in the game told me that ""Skin care is a basic right,"" it was too on the nose to be an accident. Were the game writers trying to mock the deaths from a modern plague? This was the NPC that I spoke to most because so many of the shop contracts needed to be completed through him. He had almost no other lines and said this to me nearly every in-game day, making it harder to ignore as time went by, and underlined the fact that there were no likable characters in the community-centric game.

[h1]Full story[/h1]
[b]The good[/b]
This game had a lot going for it, and I tried and almost managed to get really into it. The mines are easy to get disoriented in at first, but are pretty fun once you get used to them. The trees are nice and realistic, while the wild animals are not at all realistic, but in a fun way. I love the fact that I can collect manure from fields populated by wild herds, and use it to fertilize my own plants. I really like the recipe book for the assembly station (see the Dee-Dee transport recipe in the still shots at the top of the store page). It shows all of the materials needed for components and subcomponents in a very organic format that almost looks like how a human person might keep notes on what they need for a planned construction. (It's worth noting that this notebook format only applies to the assembly station, which is one of several types of work stations in your shop.) Also, the post-apocalyptic framing is an interesting twist on the agricultural, laid-back genre, and is heavily influential in the game play, where artifacts of the old world play a major role.

[b]The problematic[/b]
The game play issues aren't deal breakers. The management of the player's own property is clunky, with limited space, and placing structures and units where you want them is oddly difficult. For some reason, the player needs to grow plants in plant boxes (small boxes for most crops, large boxes for trees), while the across-the-street neighbor can apparently grow things directly in the ground. This isn't terrible, since farming isn't the focus of the game, but I still felt cheated.

[b]The deal breaker[/b]
In the end, the breaking issue for me was the NPC characterization. This isn't something I care about much in most games, but this genre is very much about creating a sence of community, and the play pushes repeated interaction with the same characters - a model where players develop relationships with their neighbors. The NPC dialog has the expected translation issues, ranging from actually incorrect, to grammatically correct but incomprehensible, to the use of obscure English words someone found in a dictionary but didn't realize most English-speakers don't actually know. The translation issues are not unexpected, and can even be endearing if the characters have other virtues. But they don't. Quite a few seem more like unkind parodies than characters in their own right.

The stereotype of the valley girl is famous for expressing scorn. But the valley girl NPC uses her scornful tone when saying positive things, as though the scorn has gone from being a problem of negative attitude to just a built-in part of the accent, coming out in positive statements.

The stereotypical gay guy is often portrayed as young and waifish. The gay NPC in the game reflects this to the degree that when I first saw the character I wondered why there was a kid behind a desk in a government office. That lasted until I spoke to him and realized that he was an adult, apparently designed to hit as many gay stereotypes as possible in a brief conversation. Later, you can find him outside of office hours, lurking in the bushes to moon over his crush. Creepy.

Other than offensive characters, a lot are just confusing. Is the guy who calls himself ""simple"" trying to call himself ""stupid,"" or did the writer not realize that was the default, modern meaning of the word when applied to a single individual? For the restaurant-owner who says, ""A knight's sword is his justice and loyalty, the rest is just for show. Knights can always eat for free in my restaurant,"" I have no idea what that means. Is a knight supposedly only loyal to his sword, or does he only express loyalty when he can do so with his sword? As far as I could determine, carrying a sword into his restaurant doesn't get me free food. Another guy uses dialogue that assumes he's in his place of business without regard to where he is, which shatters the illusion of personhood even more than the limited set of total comments. A number of other characters keep trying to work the word ""telesis"" into their conversation, and boy is that skippable!

In the end, while there was a lot I liked about My Time at Portia, the NPC's were a drain on my enjoyment, until I decided I'd had enough of the whole game.",1529679838,1653717587,True,0,0,0.295474410057067871,1,True,False,True

Are you? Do you love tedious grinding for materials? Do you tolerate it because the thrill of completing a project is worth it? You're not right in the brain and should absolutely get this game. You will love it, trust me. It's everything we wrong brained people want.

If you're normal, just skip it. You can get a wife/husband in this game but you won't survive the repetitive grind. Just stick to that in irl (where I can't handle it).",1653228834,1653228834,True,33,10,0.745722770690917969,2,True,False,False

Up until now I enjoyed the game a lot, but since the event start of Day Of The Bright Sun the game keeps crashing on me and I cannot finish the 19th day of the first month, even when I am not attending the event and went ruin diving instead. It is really annoying. I already started day 19 like 5 times and it keeps crashing around that time when the event ends. Is there a way to fix the crash?

EDIT: A way to get around the crash is to go back to bed before the event ends, so it skips to the next day. At least I can avoid the crash and get on with my game, because apart from the  not yet best way to navigate the ruins, it is a really enjoyable game :)

EDIT 2: I got through the first year and noticed the same crash bug for the Day Of the Memories and the ""Christmas""-event. A similar problem now occured after I assigned the bed to my partner as well. The next day started and they told me about someone from the adventurers guild visiting the city and how exciting this is for Arlo. And right after that the game just crashed. Question now: Is the problem the assigning to the bed or is this a special event that crashes my game once again?

Played on linuxmint via proton: a few stutters, both a and v, but ok-ish. Restart of game usually sorts them out - mostly. No crashes.
The setting is charming, as are the characters. Get little quests in the form of events and crafting items for npcs. I know these types of games are grindy time sinks - that is par for the course. I mean I put a couple hundred hours into Stardew Valley. 
The thing that grinds my taint is inventory. Go to the assembly area, forgot to get planks. Return. Get planks. Go to assembly area. Got wrong planks. Return to storage. Try to assemble. Wont. have to mount plants on quick bar. Go to shop. forgot items or have one too few or wrong type.... return to storage. Search the storage chests.... at least you can scroll between chests without having to close one and open another. A totally combined window with all the items in all the chests would be nice - with a search bar.
To my mind if you have the item, just let the player access it. Go to the shop and it isn't on you - no problem - you left it in a chest but it'll teleport to you. Why? Video game. ""that's not real life-ish."" It's a video game. It's not RL. teleporting items are fine. 
It is these little things that developers copy between themselves that just - I don't know - are they conventions that developers think ""should be like that..."" Because? ""Just because.""
Like I said - I quite like farming resources and waiting for items to complete forging etc. It's this non-essential busy-work that just.... ahhhhhhhh!

I have still not finished everything this game offers, but that's more so due to my casual play style than because it's not possible or anything.

So rather than waiting for crops to grow, you're usually waiting on furnaces or other machines. There's plenty of other things to do while you wait though! Enough that I'll even completely forget to go back and check the furnaces sometimes. I often get addicted to the mining areas searching for artifacts or spend a lot of time in the dungeons.

My favorite thing about the game is that you can become friends, partners and eventually marry so many different characters. Each character has their own story that can be experienced when you have a relationship with them. The downside with this is that you would need to make multiple playthroughs  and establish many different relations to experience all the stories, which both can be very tedious.

I encountered several bugs while playing the game and there are plenty of forum posts that can confirm that the game still has some severe bugs.

My first impression was that it looked like a cheap  Chinese knockoff of some popular mobile games, but I decided to give it a try anway, because it was one of the only games on that service that fit what I was looking for at the time. Well, I'm so glad that I gave it a chance, because I found that my initial impression of the game was dead wrong. This is one of the most charming, pleasant crafting games/ life sims I've ever encountered. 

Far from being soulless, My Time at Portia is absolutely packed with personality. Portia feels like an actual community, and it's an absolute joy to become an integral part of it. The NPCs feel like actual neighbors who you befriend and get to know better. When it comes to who you choose to befriend or romance, there are a large variety of options available to suit all types of players. Some NPC backstories are inspiring, others are bittersweet, but nearly all of them absolutely ooze personality. It never feels like characters are reduced to simple tropes, they're all complex individuals in their own right who are far more than meets the eye.

The stakes can at time get high during the main storyline, but the game mechanics are forgiving enough to not make this a lesson in suffering for the player. You will have many, many chances to make things right, even if you accidentally goof up at first. And other than a few timed missions whose time limits are clearly noted when you first get them, for the most part it's your own choice as to what pace to proceed at for most of the game. You progress through the game and its stories as fast or as slow as you wish too, for the most part. Sometimes, I found myself burnt out from a crunch of difficult-to-fill orders, so after I had taken care of them, I literally spent the next week in-game simply chopping trees, mining rocks, and fishing, because I could. 

If I had to give one even minor criticism of the game, it would be that the crafting progression isn't always self-evident, so the first time I ever played the game, I wound up taking on commissions that I couldn't possibly fulfill, because they seemed similar to items I could craft at the time, but I was actually still several in-game weeks away from being at the point where I'd be able to craft this seemingly similar item. I highly recommend using the Wiki for this game whenever you come across something that you're not entirely sure you can make right now. So if you're unsure of what a specific commission actually requires, take a look on the Wiki and see what its supply and machinery requirements are. 

In the end, I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who is even slightly interested in this type of game. If you wanna craft a bunch of stuff, source your own supplies for it, and form a valuable web of friendships (and sometimes even romance) with a wonderful town full of great personalities, My time at Portia is a can't-miss game.

You can farm and raise animals if you wish. And there is plenty of combat and progression both on the landscape as well as instanced. Players can choose to be non-combatants or hire others to do the work. In addition, there are voxelized ruins where you can dig for relics from the past. Perhaps more interesting, this isn't SDV where relationship tracks are on rails as long as you provide interaction and gifts, and not everyone lives happily ever after.

I'm sure you can speedplay your way through the game way faster than I'm doing, but I enjoy the slower pace I've choosen.

I really REALLy like this game.
The graphics are gorgeous, the landscape is simply stunning, the music nice and calming.
The animation is very very crisp and nice!

The characters are cartoonish/cutish and I had my doubts going on bord with this game. I usually avoid games that use this kind of style on the characters. 
Then it came on sale - so happy I decided to try it out.

I've read that some players find it annoying, that the game takes time to load. It also takes time, when you switch from one senario to the other.
Annoyed me at first as well. But if you do buy the game, do not let the loading times put you off. Patience grasshopper is key here.
The fact that the devs still release updates and patches, is another big plus for me.

Be warned though, the hours vanish into thin air, once you get hooked by this game. The world is massive, and there are so many things to explore, so many quests, various bosses, ""dungeons"", townies asking for your help, animals to discover etc.

If you do  not like to collect, craft, gather, and use a TON of time exploring, this game is not for you.

It requires patience, loads of patience collecting reasources, building, trying to get good relations with the people living in Portia and what not.
AND maybe you decide to date one of the characters, even marry one.

I'm not a date sim player so was rather meh towards that part of the game.
If you do not want to go there dating wise - just opt out.

I found mysef laughing hysterically when the leader of the research center asked me on a date. It was hillarious. And the letter she send to me after our date, made me laugh even louder.

Take your time and get to know some of the people in the town. You will learn more about them along the way ;)

The game has some serious humour - and I love it!

You can own livestock and even horses.
You'll do a lot of running around, so getting transport is key.

The core gameplay is pretty good - you craft items to improve the town and help out your friends. Very similar to Animal Crossings in that regard. However there's just too many ""small annoyances"" that build up to an overall frustrating experience. For me at least, the frustration outweighed the fun in the end. Very similar to Animal Crossing: New Horizons in that regard. This is going to be long because as I said I REALLY want to love this game and I hope the developers improve it.

* First thing you will notice: Everything is *really* far apart. And you run really slowly. And you need to cross the entire map a lot, with no transportation. Peach help you if you choose not to upgrade running stamina. I suggest either redesigning the entire map so things are closer together (not possible I'd assume), or start with a donkey / mule / horse to ride around.

* Second thing you will notice: Everyone is really ugly. Well, not everyone, but I'd say 75% of the population seems to have a bit of Innsmouth genetics. Which is understandable for an indie game but makes it hard to me motivated to romance them. I suggest improving the models, at least for the romancable adults.

* Speaking of romancing: It takes forever to become friends. I spoke to the damn bear every day for a week, and gave him so much honey, and I barely got half way ONE STAR. I've been completing quests and talking to people every day, and I was devastated when they still completely hate me after all that work. How many years does it take to get a hug? The wiki says you need 100 relationship points per star, which is insane. Giving a ""great gift"" gives like 5~9, and is usually expensive and hard to acquire (other than dopey pooh bears). It would take over 30 days to earn 1 star giving ""ok"" gifts (2 points) and talking to them every day... Suggestion: The wiki says you unlock more stuff you can do with them, which to me seems like a perfect ""sliding scale"" approach. Each tier gives you a new thing you can do with them for 10 points (~10 days seems like a reasonable amount of time!), and all the previous tier's interactions give fewer points to compensate. You know, like in real life. You start by talking to them, then you play a simple game with them (rock paper scissors), then you give them crap to fill their house with and get mad if they throw any of it away, then you beat them to unconsciousness, then you take photos, then you hug them. Also can we talk about how beating the shit out of strangers in a street fight makes them like you more? Because that's a really weird mechanic bro.

* It takes forever to craft anything, which is what you will mostly be doing. Crafting something takes multiple in-game days in most cases, as you need to: smelt the ore into bars (3-10 hours ingame), then craft the ore into the relevant shape (3-10 hours ingame) and that is for ONE part of the end product. Most often you will need to repeat this process multiple times to reach the final product. There is no way to speed up time, other than going to sleep, time just plods along at 1 real life minute = 1 in-game hour, and I ain't got time for that. I ended up sleeping 10 days away just so I could make the stupid bridge. Really needs to have a way to ""skip to completion"" or even just make crafting instant like for the workbench.

* Unlocking new technologies takes forever. You need to go to the mines, find DVDs, give those DVDs to the technology guys, wait 2~5 days(!), and then you get a RANDOM blueprint. Suggestion: Just make it that you can buy technologies with DVDs rather than this awkward gatcha summon blueprint system. Especially since some unlocks are required for story purposes. How hard is it to make a wooden box to hold water? Apparently you need ancient technology from the future. Although it is funny imagining them watching a 5 part DVD on how to screw 5 pieces of wood together like they're indecipherable IKEA instructions. (TrÃ³Ã¼gh)

* Selling raw materials (as opposed to completing quests) is annoying, because there is no ""sell box"" outside your house. You need to sprint your ass down to old lady Susie (where's Howl?) and sell your shit there. Not only that, but like in real life she only makes so much money per week, so you actually have to liquidate your assets at every store in town just to make money. Like a fucking crime boss laundering their money. Please just add a ""sell your stuff here"" to your farm for convenience. Or at least give each vendor infinite buying money. Or at least give the town hall infinite money. Just something.

* People don't feel fully ""fleshed out"". Every day you talk to them they say the same thing in the same voice. They never have anything interesting to say. And if you want to romance them or just be friends, you will be hearing them A LOT. Even on festival days, I tried talking to someone on Sun God day or Peach Day or whatever, and they were just like. Hi. That's it? You don't have an opinion on the Black Friday on crack? You're not hoping for a hard hat for Christmas? Just Hi? Ok then. Look at Stardew Valley etc games that have very interesting unique characters, because they have more than 10 lines in their daily dialog.

* Combat is awkward and, you guessed it, takes forever. You do no damage, they do no damage, it's like two tanks in a MOBA game having a wet noodle fight. The combat boils down to, who can stun lock the other into the corner first dies. Mostly that will be the enemy because their attack wind ups seem to be much worse. But it's definitely possible to get locked down by 2-3 enemies that have the perfect interval between attacking, and you are forced to watch your character slowly die by being stoned to death (or shit on by birds in my cases). Dodge rolling does nothing as it has no invincibility frames and you can't use it for 1 second after attacking. Also dying seems to have no consequences. Suggestion: remove ALL hit recoil from any attacks, except maybe critical hits or heavy attacks or something so people don't get stun locked. Make dodge rolling ""interrupt"" your action and take priority so you can actually dodge attacks. Give it i-frames for Peach's sake. Double or even triple everyone's damage because big numbers feel good. On death you should drop some / all of your money on person (add a bank?). Basically copy Elden Ring.

* Item space. Each thing you do gives you like 5 types of resources, which means your entire inventory will be clogged once you do 4 different things. Please Peach just give me a way to make a bag. Buy a bag, I just need a bag. First thing I bought in Stardew Valley was a bag. This game needs one even worse because carting your shit around town takes way longer.

* Placing objects is extremely awkward. It seems like the ""aiming"" was designed for console, as it's based on what your character is facing rather than where your mouse is. But it's also kind of half influenced by your mouse position since that controls the camera. This needs some serious work to feel good on PC.

* The fishing minigame requires spastically moving your mouse around REALLY FAST and REALLY ACCURATELY to keep up with the fish, with no room for error. It's like trying to track a Tracer in Overwatch with a beam weapon. I have musculoskeletal issues, so the harder fish were just straight up impossible for me to catch.

* Chest storage. There's no way to ""quick stack"" like Stardew Valley.

* It's almost impossible to tell the difference between copper veins and normal rocks/dirt/sand in the mines.

* Loading times are annoyingly long, especially if you need to hop in and out of multiple stores. I feel like at least the main world should remain loaded for a quick exit?",1649430334,1649430334,False,6,1,0.497163981199264526,18,True,False,False

After seeing a lot of positive reviews, decided to get this game and was immediately disappointed in-game when the game indicates that you are a 'builder' and not that you are a 'farmer'. How is it that the game's description has for so long been that you need to build up your neglected workshop, grow crops, raise animals etc. but in reality the primary theme is all about construction and build wait times?? This is the most annoying form of false advertisement that makes you believe the game is all about farming when its nothing more than a huge waste of time sunk into trying to build components and waiting real hours to complete.

Cons:

1. Cannot make components in large batches and therefore like mobile games, this game coaxes players to stay in-game and forever focused on initiating the next small batch of parts instead of focusing on other aspects of the game

2. Most of the good parts of the game come from Quality of Life (QoL) mods which cannot do their job well because of small updates that keep breaking the mods

3. If you played Stardew Valley and like farming, stay away cause this game does not grab your attention at the beginning. Feels like you need to sink in several hours into this game before your even capable of focusing on farming etc. So this is nowhere as leisurely fun a game as the description tries to indicate

4. While I like playing female characters, when there is marriage options etc., I revert to male characters for games.... However, the males look like such dorky morons that I dont know if the devs ever wanted people to choose male characters unless they dont give a shit about looks but only cosmetic clothing change. They could've atleast made them chibi/Childlike like in animal crossing etc. instead the guy looks like a sugar cane with a vertically placed watermelon for a head

Conclusion: A thoroughly enjoyable farming / life/ dating sim with lots of fun things to do, things to build. I wouldn't change anything. 



I love  how this game does things!  It;s way better than a certain famous franchise, and a lot more fun and interesting!

The atmpsphere does make me feel like in in a Miyazaki movie, it's very good. 

The art and settings are wonderful, gorgeous world with lots of  scenic places to explore. The world is vast. Sometimes, all i do during a game day is just ride round on a horse, enjoying the views and the music. 

You're a builder in this game and there are lots of  fun tasks to complete, wonderful creatures to meet and dungeons to get materials from, with some combat. The plot is considerably longer  and more satisfying than in most similar games.  Most harvest moon plots end too soon. In this respect, I think the pacing in this game is  absolutely wonderful. 


The OST is beautiful.

Lots of fun activities and tasks 

- mine diving is really nice and fresh and I love it.  

-The late game factory sytstem is fantastic/ I love how it charts the progress of both Portia and the builder - from zero to hero, from mostly empty spaces on the map to  interesting new places to visit. The pacing is really spot on. 

Fun, likeable characters 
The characters are a really likeable bunch and they are very varied.  There is an innocent guy brought up by a bear, a skilled  but flirty businessman, a strong leader of the local corps, an entusiastic doctor, a charming and driven architect Gust and many others.  I love them. 


elaborate relationship system with fun things to do - I absolutely love it!  I love the fact you schedule a date for the next time - gives time to prepare. 
developing relationships brings perks. There are dates, and dates have tons of diverse fun activities to raise the relationship meter. It keeps things engaging!  You can marry - some characters have reverse proposals, others will invite you out, and different spouses will help you in a different way after marriage.  There's such fun, refreshing variety here! Everyone is different - and that really adds to the fun.  I really feel like a girl too even though relationships are open to all genders but the way Portia builds events still makes me feel included as a straight girl who wants to feel like a girl, be a wife. That's a very important thing. I'm a straight girl and want  my character to feel that way while on dates / building relationships.  The wedding was also well done and is one of my favourites in games of this type. 

Reverse proposals for several characters! I need that!  My favourite character to marry is Gust (his reverse proposal is wonderful as are all his quests, the're  absolutely lovely. I prefer reverse proposals as a girl) Also, Gust has a family, a father and sister. As a girl, I also like strong and competent  male characters. Gust is driven,  ambitious, charming and can help you clear out some dungeons. He and his sister Ginger are really beautiful as far as I'm concerned. Plus, he's got QQ - a cute little piglet. 

i also like Arlo, Xu, and possibly Django, but I'll check them out in different playthroughs. There is a divorce system in this game - but I never use them. I hate divorces. But the game gives you a lot of freedom in how you play, you can even  date multiple people with a  jealousy system in place  - I don't like it myself, but it's there. 

Therer are a few things that could still be tweaked or developed. For instance your husbanbd/wife's post-festival dialogue - if you win or lose a race / event. 
There's still room for more quests in all those wonderful places like Starlight Island

It's a wonderful, relaxing game in a beautiful , charming world with a satisfyingly long plot and lots of fun things to do. Super enjoyable. Wouldn't want it any other way than it is. I can spend hours in this game

The game's really fun, a lot of story quests so a lot of content but it lets you play it at your own pace, sometimes setting no deadline for a quest so you can stack up on resources before starting the next or just take it easy. I also enjoy the character quests that trigger when you are close to them allowing for you to get to know them. The game's good when you want to be busy in game or when you just want to relax and work on your own things. I also really like how you get benefits from befriending characters considering in most games you don't really get things other than dialogue and occasional gifts. Another thing I like about the social system is that because character relations are interconnected when you befriend one character you also get points with their social circle which helps a lot with the befriending process.

I've played Stardew, and found Stardew's UI easier to understand and adapt to.  But My Time at Portia grew on me. In particular, the inventory management  for My Time is much better - gone is the need to have everything in your inventory to use the furnace or cheese machine, or whatever. My Time lets you open all your storage at once, albeit only while you are at home.  I also really like the mining better - it's fun to see what the ""prize"" is at the end of a 12m drop to the glowing beacon, plus you pick up many surprise items along the way.  (Pro tip: turn the scanner back on while still in the hole you made for the last beacon, rather than heading back to the main level every time.) Fishing is also much easier than Stardew.  I'm only 36 hours in - giving it an 8/10.

Have had a ball these past few weeks playing this but have missed out on some important quests along the way running out of time to learn some skills required to complete them. First off make sure you upgrade your equipment such as axe,weapons,pickax which will help you to get further into the game. I didn't do this first off as I was enjoying exploring everything and having fun while learning out the town folk. But it has a somewhat of a downside of not doing what I said.
Fishing is fun people so learn how to do it so you can get special tasks done and even make yourself an awesome interactive fish tank.
Main part of this game is you come into a town called Portia looking for your father who owns and runs a workshop to help out the town folk living there. It becomes a race against time having to compete against a few others who also have workshops with the town's community to make up special items asked by them and the Major. Upgrades of workbenches are a must so keep on collecting stones and mining for relics and other awesome items you can sell to the tools man at the market store.
When you have finished repairing the horse stable on the old bloke's farm (McDonald) so original lol you can hire a horse to help you get around town quicker,which I found to be so much easier but can be expensive to buy so keep on working,crafting,collecting and selling and have fun.
 So worth the money I spent to get this game.
The calendar is a tricky thing to figure out but I Googled and used You Tube when I got stuck and it helped me greatly. I really love these types of games where you can custom your character to be how you want.

The long answer:

I first caught on to the existence of My Time at Portia through my 12 year old who was playing it as part of the cache of games included in the Xbox Gamepass. She kept coming to me with these different experiences she was having and I was surprised that it was consistent for so long.

I decided during a week of boredom to start playing the game on my phone as a means to pass the time when it suited me.

The following two weeks of dead phone batteries was reason enough for me to jump to Steam and start over. 

The building mechanic in this game is well assembled on both the cell phone version of the game as well as the PC version. It's almost like you get the lesser version on the PC but when you progress in the game the reason makes plenty of sense.

You start out with some really basic tasks, and in the process you start to develop both your character, and the understanding of the characters in Portia. The more you grow into what you can do in the game, the more the game world expands, your abilities progress, and the kinds of activities you can do increase. You can almost overwhelm yourself if you pick too many fires to attend at one time.

You go from being able to harvest basic materials:

-Building machines, furniture and advanced materials.
-Building commissions for other characters.
-Harvesting materials from several sources which progress along with the story.
-Dungeon crawling stand alone or with NPC character accompanyment.
-Storyline boss fight experiences. (The boss fights are not as difficult as they could be. A hard mode would be a great addition to this game.)
-Player facility and space expansion progression.
-Character relationship progression including romantic pursuit which also provides very desirable benefits after attained.
-Mini-Game challenges which yeild unique rewards that can be beneficial to the player.
-110 floor depth dive dungeon which yields special materials and harder challenges as you progress.
-Mounts which can be raised for use or to sell for profit.
-Farming mechanic that could use a bit of refinement but yields both money and function to expand your property and fortune. 
-More that I haven't listed.

This game can keep you busy and satisfied for a good while. I have praised it a lot here and I will mention a few things I could see improve or that are problematic. If you don't want to know too much about the game, and want to enjoy a great experience. I would stop here and buy the game. If you are the kind of person who has issues with some imperfect game issues, this may be where you figure out if the game isn't right for you.

Medicine: Could be implemented in a way that is unique and necessary for the player to use. It's almost an afterthought to food that takes up space in your inventory.

Cooking: There is a random exploration method to discovering recipes but no structure to doing so that appears to be present in the game.

The AI bot Ack must have a way to use all the dungeon find AI chips but there is no implemented story where you can pursue this in an obvious way. Forums and Wiki pages provide some clues but his story and use could be expanded greatly.

The All Source: There is so much room to grow the story with Wendy where you could implement upgrades to the town, your abilities, the devices and crafts you make, etc where the All Source would have been a huge plus in the story. Her part was great, but it was not without being too brief. 

The Starlight Isle: The potential for more material diving and story there as well as activities for relationships, etc was lost on the isle. You build a boat that can go there, but nothing comes of it except for the endangered species story with an arsonist who tries to redeem himself through humanitarian projects.

The Island with a fishing hole and a small story line has no Dee Dee Stop and contributes almost nothing to the experience aside from the brief story arc that takes you there with the pirates.

The outfit upgrade system is too lengthy and lacks description. One article of clothing to upgrade per day with the way things come up throughout the first 3 years of storyline makes it nearly unbeneficial. 

The Forge literally gave me zero benefit to anything by the time I received the recipe. Having the ability to augment and upgrade weapons and outfits would be a great decision. 

The outfit closet you can buy in the game lets you hang shirts and pants but doesn't include hats even though the sets obviously include them. This should be fixed.

As a long time gamer I could go on and on with the things people could do to upgrade any game. The point here is this game has longevity if the developer listens to feedback and follows through with the growth.

Conclusion:

My Time at Portia is a great game, has a lot to offer, and is an enjoyable break from much of the battle royale, multiplayer madness that has become the present gaming scene. This game is worth the hours. I have almost 150 hours myself and I will probably chase down the achievements because I enjoyed it as much as I have. I wish you the best and I hope you enjoy it how I did.

When I played Stardew Valley, there are some different potential spouses to date. . . I liked that they felt so different, but there is more to it when it comes to Portia's potential spouses. There are different ways to get to know them through individual scenes but also through Play or Date, which is a great addition! There's also so much to do!

You WILL have to do battles! You have to be strong enough to gain entry to places, so battling adorable creatures, people, and robots are all things that do come up Heck, even sparing with people is a way to get them to like you. 

I wish there was more space between missions! It feels like it's one after another, after another for a while, and having a few weeks between them might have let me breathe and do other things, but I like it!

My Time at Portia is a farming/crafting life simulating game. You are a new builder coming in town, taking over your pop's workshop trying to establish your reputation by crafting and contributing to the town.
It is very fun and addictive game. It's a game that will suck up your time. You will be surprise when you look at the time after playing.

Bad things about the game
- The audio of this game is kinda terrible, buggy, sometimes missing audio or the sounds are too loud in some part of the game.
- The combat system, not bad but the animation will make you stuck at one place. There're also some buggy places that you can spamming jump to get over some places which is fine.

Good things about the game
- Can be play with people at any age
- The price is good even though there's some bugs
- The graphic is nice and cute.
- There is also an option for people who has motion sickness too.
- You can customize your character to your own like.
- The story is pretty solid, some side quests story are interesting especially the relationship quests.
- You can become friends with NPCs to get discounts or gifts. If your relationships with the NPCs are high you can marry them.

To Conclude, pretty awesome game. Would recommended it to anyone!!!

He showed up, and I went to meet him for the date. But as I went to start the play, he suddenly seemed down, and wanted to cancel the play-date. Instead, he wanted to talk. I saw from my Calendar that he apparently wanted to talk about Nora. He wanted to meet me at Central plaza, and he had a couple of things to do first. Okay, sure. So I started toward Central. But he didn't leave. He followed me there. Then he stood around doing nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him, he told me how wonderful the Flying Pigs were.  I tried to cancel the play-date, but it was grayed out, showing that we definitely were not on a play-date, and there was nothing I could do except listen to him talk about the Flying Pigs. It was afternoon now, and he was still following me everywhere, so I quit the game. I started it again. It was exactly the same thing. This time I allowed him to follow me everywhere, but he got on my nerves, so I went to bed early, around midnight. He even FOLLOWED ME INTO MY HOUSE AND WATCHED ME SLEEP. When I woke up, a notice said that I had failed the invitation! But I was very relieved to find him gone.

26 hours in at the time of this review.
The game is cute, a nice refresh of Harvest Moon/Stardew Valley. I honestly prefer the cartoonish graphics over pixel graphics, but that's a personal preference.

You'll never run out of things to do, it seems. But that may be part of the problem- the game is a never-ending grind, that can get really boring at times. There is a ton of repetitive clicking involved for some things- if you have a gaming mouse- set a macro to save your poor finger joints and fingertips. For Deaf and HoH players- all dialogues are both voiced and in text- but if you click too soon, the dialogue will progress or disappear, with no way to call it back up. The fonts used in the game are somewhat tiny, with no scaling available that I can find. The font used in the workbook is flowery cursive type font- if you have dyslexia like I do- you may struggle with reading some of it.

The game isbuggy- looking at the forums, some of these seem to be long-standing bugs that have never been addressed. so that's a bummer. Most are minor, with workarounds available. But my first character did bug out completely with a build stuck on the assembly platform, with no Retrieve/Cancel buttons appearing to cancel the build. Which left me unable to build other things i needed to progress in the story. Verification of game files was fine- no missing or corrupt files, no mods being used. So, yeah. There is that issue that may pop up and softlock your game.
Also a bit annoying- no matter what you are doing, how much stamina and HP you have left- you will pass out at 3am, and the game will forcefully retire you to bed. The game only saves when you sleep, and you can apparently only sleep in your own home. Not liking the save system- make manual saves if you know how to, and tuck them away somewhere safe- in case you want a do-over or in case the game bugs out on you.

The game is not well optimized. Lots of fps spiking and micro-hitching going on, plus fan speeds whirring up. It runs a bit hot, but not at near-overheat temps, on both my gaming laptop(i7-9750H/ NVIDIA RTX 2070 Max-Q/ 16 GB DDR4/Win 10 v.21H1 and my desktop (i9 9900K/ NVIDIA 2070 RTX Super/ 32 GB DDR4/ Win 10 v.20H2). 
Lots of clipping into terrain (no stuck in terrain yet...), lots of solid things becoming translucent if you are too close to them, your character and NPCs have a tendency to float above surfaces instead of actually touching them- but you can jump from great heights without taking fall damage- so jump off the top of the windmill for sheets and giggles. But don't touch the river or sea- instant unconsciousness (go splash in the fountain- the only water that seem to not make you faint immediately).

It's a farming/building/mining/crafting/harvesting/fetch questing game, with a rather simple story.
Interesting characters with their own stories, large map to explore and discover hidden secrets and nice views on. 
Battles and killing local wildlife for supplies is a bit meh. The tutorial is vague and lacking in much real help. You'll either need to read guides, visit the Wiki, or watch a ton of videos- or figure stuff out for yourself through trial and error.

It is a heavy grind game- know that before you go in. It's a time-killer. I can;t say i love it, I can't say I hate it. 
I am enjoying it enough to keep playing, but it isn't a game I would have felt good buying at full price,  It has some good things, and it has some not-so-good things. The good slightly outweigh the bad right now, but it appears the bad will never be patched by the devs at this point. So- you are going to be buying a bit of a hot mess that will always be a bit of a hot mess. It's still fun enough, but I don't recommend buying this at full price- wait for a really deep discount.

666140,39592098,76561197997819311,0,55,7314,0,486,1646507359,"I bought this game in Early Access and thought it had a ton of potential. So i was super excited to finally play the game once it left EA, and I didn't like it. From the myriad of QA issues and the game's lack of polish, as well as a perceived lack of gameplay, I was very disappointed.

Fast forward 4 years and I see Portia for sale on the Switch for 3$ and said fudge-it, why not. Maybe I'll like it more with the video game equivalent of beer-goggles that portability brings. Much to my surprise... I had a blast with the game. Despite the aforementioned lack of polish, I was finally able to let myself get into the game and get past the initial bad first impression and was floored by how unique and great Portia was. A true diamond in the rough.

I enjoyed it so much that I stopped playing it on the Switch (as it frankly doesn't play super well on it) and reinstalled the game on Steam to start a new playthrough. While I am frustrated Pathea never polished the game in a way it deserved, if one can look past it, then they'll find an interesting cross between Animal Crossing and Dark Cloud with an excellent social system and addictive mobile/MMO style resource grind (minus the grind and cash-vampire aspects that make those games unbearable)

It does feel like My Time At Portia was a proof of concept, a good PoC, but a PoC nevertheless. It had the soul but it felt like the team lacked the experience or resources to really make what they wanted. I hope/expect the lessons learned making Portia can be applied to the sequel Sandrock and make that game all I think Portia could have been. 

That last bit makes it sound like I don't like the game, but that's not true, it's more that I feel like Portia could very easily have been made much better, but they just stopped. It honestly feels like they got shiny ball syndrome or something the moment the game was finished and were in maybe too much of a hurry to move on. Hopefully as I said they follow-through with My Time in Sandrock and don't just give up and move onto something else when there is still a mountain of untapped potential in front of them.  It feels as if the people making the game cared, but the money-suits/project lead over at Pathea told them to cut that shit out! Time is money and papa needs a sportscar! Chop chop!

A worrying sign for the sequel if that is the case... But it is certainly the impression I was left with.

Story and writing: 8/10 - very interesting setting and main story. The townsfolk are surprisingly well written and colorful, and the world's lore did a great job of grabbing my attention.

Gameplay, Core: 8/10 - satisfying crafting loop with a really good sense of progression, as well as a decent social system.

Gameplay, Combat: 5/10 - while not terrible, it's mostly just spamming clicks while being locked into stiff animations that jerk control away of your character. This isn't as important as the rest of the gameplay loop, as it's only one fragment of the gameplay.

Visuals: 6/10 - childish looking UI and an artstyle that might be more an acquired taste, but doesn't look terrible and does what it needs to.

Sound: 3/10 - weird mixing on sound effects. Some combat sounds can be unnecessarily loud. Cutscenes often just lack sound effects but might still have dialog, which plays out kinda funny.


The Good:
The basic gist, it's similar to what you'd see in Stardew Valley or Harvest Moon, except you're a crafter / builder instead of a farmer. For the story, instead of taking on a element of magic or fantasy, it's set in a post-apocalyptic world where, ages ago, technology went rogue and plunged humanity into another dark ages. Society's recovered, albeit to a more humble means, but it creates an interesting backdrop where there's a conflict between using old technology to improve lives and fear of it causing problems like years ago.

The story is honestly really solid and interesting, involving you being commissioned to help expand the town as well as restore relics gathered from the ruins (for better or worse).

The core game loop of crafting items and structures to fulfill jobs is interesting. You need to learn where you can acquire certain resources, or build machines to process materials to fulfill jobs; basic crafting stuff. As you expand your workshop, you'll have more space for more tools and machines, and the feeling of growth and progress, guided by the story jobs and events you take on, all feels well-paced.

The townsfolk stories and personalities also feel well fleshed out, and they felt pretty colorful. The only thing that felt unnatural to me, was when one character did something very bad, but was basically immediately forgiven by the town. Beyond that, everyone has their quirks and don't really feel like ""I just exist to sell you a few items.""

One great aspect in progression, when I felt like I really needed some kind of upgrade to make the repetition less annoying, the game soon introduced something that addressed my problem. Gathering wood was getting frustrating--I soon unlocked the tree farm. Mining was starting to get tiring--I unlocked the quarry. Refueling furnaces manually was getting tedious--I unlocked the Fire-powered Generator. These upgrades always felt like they came in just at the right moment.


The bad:
This game clearly did run into some budget constraints. Animations are abrupt with no easing between them. There's no acceleration on your movement so it can be hard to make precise jumps or line yourself up for placing buildings down. The UI is rather childish and simple, with some temporary visual bugs that pop up (items being invisible when removed from your hotbar until you close and reopen your inventory.) Paging through your Assembly Station workbook takes forever.

Combat is also clunky, though serviceable. It feels like the game wants you to dodge roll and animation cancel, but then locks you into awkward animations. I'd say I'd rather the game didn't have combat at all, but the story would be very different without it, all things considered.

Where the budget issues really show is the cutscenes and voice acting. Voices can be a hit or miss, but sometimes dialog doesn't match what's on screen or there are localization / translation issues. During cutscenes, it's rare for there to be sound effects, and voice over is only present in maybe half of the cutscenes (seemingly arbitrarily at that). It's kinda funny to watch characters get into a fight, make grunts or say things as they get knocked around, but everything else other than the background music is silent.

The most egregious (and funny) example: In one cutscene, a lot happens very quickly, and one character had a few lines, however the animation wasn't long enough to fit them all in. Instead of having him re-record his lines or slowing down the animation, they just sped up his lines by 50%. It feels like almost every bit of dialog was done in a single take.

Fortunately, this mostly just comes off as humorous and didn't impact my enjoyment of the game.

I have played Harvest Moon games since I was a kid, as well as Stardew Valley, Sun Haven, and other games along the same vein.  Here are my thoughts on this game compared with other games like it.

Pros:
-The characters actually have a voice, which gives them more character and makes the game feel more realistic.  This is actually a huge selling point to me.  The characters also have unique, realistic characteristics that make them feel more lifelike.  The characters have a backstory that's revealed as you get to know them.  I've actually wound up conflicted on who to marry because each character has upsides and downsides.  Did I mention they each have separate perks for relationship levels?  You can actually view all of these in the social tab, and those perks weigh into your marriage decision as well. 
-Not just another farming sim.  In this game, farming is almost entirely optional and isn't the focus of the game by any means.  Gathering is essential in this game, because as a builder you have to get raw materials, but farming?  Optional.  Don't need to waste your time watering crops every day either, because even if you do farm, the crops don't need to be watered.
-Dating isn't just a game of 'give someone presents until they marry you.'  Giving presents is a great way to raise affection levels, but you can also raise affection via quests, playdates (unlocked after 2 hearts), or just talking to them.  There's actually a bit of a complex affection system, which I appreciate.
-I have found literally no downsides to passing out wherever the hell I want to at 3 am.

Cons:
-The game still has glitches, and I assume it's already as polished as it's going to get.  They're all fairly minor and easy enough to work around, but once or twice I've talked to a villager who has stood up while we're chatting and suddenly the option screen for dialogue moves and may even make the option to 'leave' unavailable.
-The most annoying thing about this game is that the verbal dialogue and the text dialogue often differ from one another.  This is most noticeable for Doctor Xu.  It just confuses my brain, which now has to process what I'm seeing and what I'm hearing and choose one of those things to pay attention to.",1645553744,1645553744,True,6,0,0.6114044189453125,0,True,False,False

As a big fan of Rune Factory 4 & Stardew Valley, I struggled to find games that can scratch the itch for me. I stumbled into My Time At Portia, and even though at first I have troubles with motion sickness, I managed to play it by tweaking the settings.

Then, I found out how charming My Time at Portia can be. The graphic is beautiful, the characters are diverse, with charming voices & designs, plus I love all the cut scenes. Doing quests can be fulfilling (especially relationship/friendship quests). For me, it really fills the gap that I have after finishing RF4 & Stardew Valley. I'm not saying they are the same game, each of the games have their own unique characteristics, and I love My Time At Portia as much as I love the other games.

There are only a minor downside though, for me it's the inventory management and the main story development that feels way too rushed at the end of the story. But so far, so good.

The combat can be a little janky, and so can the movement in general (like when you're on a mount or trying to place an object), but it's nothing game-breaking. The seasons, missions and events are all pretty fun to be involved in, and I like how the game kind of naturally progresses your relationships with the townspeople because I don't particularly enjoy focusing on the social side of games like this.

I liked the art style and chill farming / crafting vibe this game was giving when I got it. A few hours in, I was enjoying crafting, establishing my workshop, and interacting with a town full of characters set in a visually pleasing environment. 
Combat has an unfinished lack of depth. There's attack and dodge (roll). I never really had to heal myself. There's no skill needed for its mechanics, just spam attack and dodge. If you die, the bosses and mobs don't heal, and you get respawned to the beginning of the room. Ultimately it's just a method of farming crafting materials. The difficulty in combat is carried over to all the events - the martial arts contest is too easy, the horse race is too easy, it's just not fun when there's no challenge to it. They're all bogged down by simplicity - spam a button until you win.
Crafting starts out as fun but eventually gets to a point of ridiculous item farming and waiting. It's common to start crafting materials for a build and having to wait a day or two for the materials to be ready for crafting. Just to get to that point there's a significant level of grinding for materials.
Items are plentiful which isn't an inherently bad feature, but inventory and storage are messy at best. Coordinating 5-10 chests full of random items you don't know whether you'll need for some rare crafting item later in game is a headache. There's not much in the way of a sorting mechanic either. No items are marked as ""this is useless and should be sold"". You just have to guess. 
Quests for the most part are just crafting a new item for someone. Farm materials, turn ores into bars, etc. then craft an item, give it over, and done. They're few and far between and several times I'd finish a quest, have no quests left in my list, and just go to bed in the middle of the afternoon to skip to the next day. 
Fishing is typically a useful mechanic in these types of games that includes some kind of minigame. The minigame featured here isn't particularly fun - hover over the fish and hold click until it turns red, then repeat until caught. Fishing doesn't seem to serve any purpose besides making money. 
The world is big but mostly empty. The town is full of shops and people to talk to, but most of the remaining parts of the map are almost entirely empty. There's a whole location I went to and spent a good half hour in and only found trees. Why even bother adding this to the game? I completed a few quests and was excited to open a new area, but it's empty. 
In summary, Portia is an unfinished game with way too much emphasis on crafting and grinding. Most mechanics aren't fun, and you're left with not much to do. Once you get some things done, you're not rewarded with anything but another quest or an empty area. Combat is laughably easy. Fishing isn't rewarding or challenging. There just isn't really any redeeming qualities to this game. The fully voiced characters, art style, and large world seems like a disservice to the lack of any fun mechanics or rewarding features.",1644447689,1644447689,False,3,0,0.482789665460586548,0,True,False,False

Your main job is to build things to order for the townsfolk for cash, experience, but more importantly to get above your rival builder Higgins on the commerce guild scoreboard (although that's not too difficult as the mayor keeps giving you special treatment by letting you build all the transportation vehicles/windmills/bridges before Higgins gets a chance).

 The game is often compared to stardew valley which, I mean, in some senses yes, but in practice it's worlds apart in terms of core gameplay loop. Sure, you can farm, there's no real reason to do so apart from one side mission and to save you a fairly insignificant amount of money in the long run compared to using the space for more machines to do building commissions with, and yes, there are dungeons, although it's a choice between boring resource mining with deforming terrain or a series of levels with somehow even worse combat than stardew (almost all enemies can be stunlocked out of their attack animation so it becomes a slog of just mashing  attack on them while they're stuck in a corner, If you need to dodge most of the time the movement system will kindly make you roll towards the enemy you're trying to avoid and get hit anyway)

And yes there are NPCs you can befriend or marry, but the feel of the game is completely different from stardew, not just in the sense that it's 3D versus top-down 2D. If I were to compare it to something it would be the Mysims games, which is not an insult, I loved those games as a kid, but it has a similar feel of community, not to mention the artstyles are kind of similar. My Time At Portia is a nicely stylised and good looking game until you get to the character models which are kinda grotesque, but you get used to them eventually. The grass sways nicely in the wind, the sunsets are always pretty, and the music is pleasant.

The characters are fairly uninteresting and 2 Dimensional, the only characters I really wanted to befriend were the Grizzly Bear who lives just outside the town and doesn't speak, and the mayor, who has a pretty good voice actor.. Oh yes, I haven't talked about the voice acting yet. I think originally this game didn't have any voice acting, and it was added after a few updates, so the actors had hundreds and hundreds of lines to voice, and it is my opinion that (for the english version at least), The publisher brought in a bunch of acting students and made them record hundreds of lines in more or less one day, with no context, for presumably no pay. This is the reason that seems most likely to me for why the voice acting is so dire. It makes pretty much every character interaction lose all impact to be replaced with laughter about how wooden and stilted the voice acting is. Some voicelines are recorded in a completely different quality, one in particular sounding like it was recorded on someone's phone at the train station. I believe this game was made in China (Taiwan maybe??) so perhaps the voice acting is better in Mandarin. 

The writing is pretty good in my opinion, the setting at least is very interesting and the main questline has intrigue, betrayal, a little political drama, a sideplot about religion versus technology, and big rat men. Some of the localisation is just horrible but that's mainly kept to minor missions. I've talked a lot about the shortcomings of this game but I do really enjoy it and it was definitely a good way for me to drain several hours of my life, I definitely recommend it if you want a nice semi-relaxing game to chip away at for a while.

However, I gotta say, I don't recommend buying it at the moment, as its publisher Team17 is involved with NFTs at the moment, and that's not really something I wanna support (I found out about this a little after I passed the point of no return for refunding sadly) so all I can say is be aware of this before you buy.",1644238981,1644238981,True,1,0,0.509333372116088867,0,True,False,False

You can grow crops (and use them to cook), raise animals, ride horses etc but it's more focused on community quests, mining, fishing, building various machines and structures as well as gathering resources.

I get some quests to, you know, upgrade my granddad's forging table or whatever, maybe pick up some rocks and make an axe or something; you know, the usual ""fetch it and/or build it"" quests.  Then I run around the town and talk to people who seem happy to -- among other things -- play rock/paper/scissors or actually duel me in a fistfight for some reason.  Mind you, they kick the crap out of me, because they are all a gazillion levels higher than me.

But after some time in the game -- wow, has it really been less than an hour?  It felt like about 10 hours -- anyway, yeah... I got bored and confused and unmotivated.  There's a town with shops and a merchant guy to give you quests, a river, some kind of farm, a lot of weird animals hopping around that I can't really seem to interact with, a kid in a bear suit and a real bear who claims to be his dad... I mean, it's cute and all, but what the heck am I supposed to be doing?  Fixing the floor around my bed?  Having dinner with that old farmer lady?

No, don't answer that; I have comments turned off because I don't really care anymore.  You're right: it IS my fault.  I don't remember buying this game and therefore don't know what motivated me to do so.  I may have been drunk.  Maybe I should drink a lot before the next time I play it -- if I ever do again.

Mostly managerial with crafting, timing, and schedules but also has a simple and somewhat fun combat system.  This game; however, takes so long.  It takes long because the crafting was designed to do so.  There is no powering through.  Let me give you an example:
Someone requests something somewhat complicated, you need to go to the research center and ask them to give you a diagram of it.  First you need data discs which you need to mine for.  Get that and give them to the research center.  Then wait 1-5 days for the diagram.  You're given the diagram which has a list of components.  Say you have something that requires a steel shell; which requires a steel plate, which requires carbon steel bars, which requires charcoal.  The charcoal takes hours to create, the carbon steel bars takes even more hours to create, and the steel plate takes hours to create for just one shell.  It's a couple days just waiting around and refueling.  So after 75+ hours, I was waning on the game, hoping to push through, but the push through is kind of a slog as well.

But if doing those kind of things in a relaxing environment where combat and social interaction intermingle in the days long wait for items to be created sounds like fun, then it's a game for you.  It's a fun game, just wish the items would take less time so to be balanced with the time it takes to enjoy the combat and social parts of it.",1643629048,1643629048,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is designed to be enjoyable for first hours and once you are committed you find yourself grinding it. There are TOO MANY BUGS, they never bothered fixing despite googling and seeing many people have complained. Bugs that make you either completely restart game - not resetting the day but you have to completely close the game-  or in instances for example when you get stuck, you gotta afk until day ends and you get respawned at home. Seeing how despite constant complains of repepetitive bugs, they are developing a new game instead of polishing the first one - big bruh moment.

The plot is poorly done and not executed well. One character disappears and you are left to ""assume"" what happened to him. The character development is horrible and I am really disappointed to see ""My time at Sandrock"" is being made instead of twerking the character development and story more? My dad shows up and bam leaves again, all while the game makes you act like a dck to him. 
There are tons of items you gather/pick up that have 0 use and you can only sell despite assuming at some point they are used for crafting or even used for meal ingredients?! Seems the creators got lazy and just cba to finish it. The map is huge but some areas you NEVER go to besides 1 cutscene which is wtf.  The designing of the workshop and the property is really badly done. You can't customize and move stuff and then save your choice unless you buy more property space to temporarily place while you rearrange everything.
Farming is not necessary  at all in this game. I played through whole game and nearly have all achievements after 153 hrs and never farmed. Label ""Farming Sim"" is incorrect. 
I enjoyed Stardew Valley and how the creator even after release kept patching and expanding the game - maybe that indie creator spoiled me- as Portia is a huge flop. It is a Workshop simulator with lovely graphics. I played this game to the end because I wanted to make sure I finished it 1 time and don't have to force myself to return unlike with Stardew Valley, which I have restarted and replayed a few times and love and recommend so much! 

I really hope they make an effort to fix the bugs and make the games more enjoyable to players.

I had friend recommend this one, so I decided to trust them and give it a shot. As someone who likes the idea of Stardew Valley but was neutral on the execution, I'm glad I tried this.

The story in Portia takes place sometime in the future, during a rebuilding of society brought about by the abuse of technology. The player's character arrives at Portia to take over the small workshop left by their father and things proceed from there. The player can customize their avatar by gender and select one of several voices for their spoken lines. The graphics are simple but clean, and the bright color palette is only matched by the cheery voice acting and light, upbeat music. It's a happy game, no doubt about it, and I found it an excellent break from some of the darker, forboding stuff I usually play.

There is a central storyline to Portia that will develop as the player progresses. Unlike some other games of this genre, farming here is minor facet and one that can actually be ignored if the player wishes. Much more of the content is centered around constructing one's workshop, with machines and improvements, and filling consignments (production jobs). There are lots of machines and structures to research, build, and upgrade, and for much of the material and resources needed (especially the basic ones), there is usually more than one way to obtain them.

And there always feels like something to do. The story questline is always there and with a few exceptions, isn't on any timer. Other (timed) quests pop up to help the citizens of Portia with their personal troubles or with big projects for the town. There are daily commissions to build items for the townsfolk. Almost every citizen of Portia can be interacted with, with unique voices and dialogue, and there are tangible rewards as players build their relationships with those citizens, spar with them, play games with them, or (with some) date and marry them. Players can fish, harvest trees, mine for ore and artifacts, dungeon-dive and fight monsters for loot and experience, or enjoy a host of mini-games and other activities. There are holiday events that rotate with the season, that the player can partake in or ignore as they choose. The player has simple stats, which can be boosted by clothes/equipment, items in their house, or temporarily buffed by food items and such. Stamina is used up  activities such as mining and tree-chopping, and fighting, but is replenished with every night of sleep (as long as the player makes early repairs to the house).

The game's strength is also its weakness. It can get repetitive and tedious to keep the forges reloaded with fuel, fertilizer on the plants, and running around to collect that one resource you're short on, since that's holding up your production. There are ways to automate much of the production, though the automation can be expensive (at least until late game) but daily production still requires a lot of player interaction and maintenance. I would encourage players to build a Factory as soon as possible. And even in the best of circumstances, this game is long as hell to complete a playthrough. From what I've read, most players take about 50-60 hours just for quick run at the main quest line, or twice that if they take their time and do other stuff. I logged 150 hours without trying and I didn't do every single thing I could have.

The player will end up fighting through underground ruins for the story and for fun and profit. Combat is simple, with left clicking to attack with the equipped weapon and right clicking to roll (evade). There are melee weapons and guns the player can build mid-late game but I found firearms somewhat underpowered. Combat isn't anything earthshaking but it's adequate. Barely. Monsters deplete health but ""dying"" merely resets the character at the edge of the monster's area. The evade technique is not very responsive, especially in boss fights, and the game has an annoying habit of letting you clear a space, then spawning another wave of monsters that already have you surrounded. There are also significant upticks in monster difficulty at certain cutoffs and it was not a smooth progression. All in all, I found the combat more an obstacle than something enjoyable, so rather than try to finesse my way through, I mostly just buffed up with food (cooking the right meals can give significant bonuses), powered through the dungeons, and used heal items. Walk into the story quests with lots of these buffs/heals in your pack.

The game felt stable for the most part. I noted some minor stuttering when interacting with NPCs who were sitting when you spoke to them (they'd stand and shift five feet over). On occasion, lines of dialogue in the middle of a conversation were only partially spoken or not at all, and characters sometimes spoke mistimed lines, such as talking about chasing girls when they had already married another character or referencing a holiday event that had already passed. Some nights, my spouse never came home. These errors felt more like a lack of polish than a stability problem, as the game never crashed or glitched to the point of being unplayable.

As far as Steam Achievements go, this one is a slog. Maxing achievements will take a LONG time and because so many of them involve romancing different characters, unless someone follows a guide, cleaning up achievements will require multiple playthroughs. Some achievements are reliant on a ridiculous, unreasonable amount of luck (Rock, Paper, Victory, I am looking at you), so even though I admit to chasing achievements, I resigned myself to not getting them all here.

Despite some of the drawbacks, I did enjoy the game. My Time at Portia is relaxed fun that is intended as a marathon and not a sprint. If you're looking for something easy-going and cheery, this might be the ticket.

Pros
- Involved story, always something to do
- Casual, bright, and happy gameplay

Cons
- Playthrough requires significant time investment
- Lackluster combat

This game gets a very, very, tentative recommendation, but only if you have already played Stardew Valley and want more like that. Play that first, because it knows what it wanted to be, and went for it. My Time at Portia is fun, and i want more world building, but has several bugbears i can't ignore, and the tone and pacing is all over the place. Buyer beware.

It wants to pull off slow, relaxed progression, but many of the other mechanics emphasise speed and timing. Sometimes quests/events are timed, sometimes they aren't. Some quests and have due dates and require equipment/RNG you don't have or can't get it time. Either have things go at my pace as a completionist, or go at the game's pace, and incentivize multiple playthoughs. Combine that with what feel like incomplete tutorials (i had to google several things) and you get a game that feels technically complete, but needs just a little more polish. None of these things were a dealbreaker, but I can see the potential for a great game, not just a decent one and that always sucks. If they did, it would be an immediate recommend.

Speaking of, during my googling, it seems like this was released in early access, and after release, a planned DLC got fleshed out into a full game. this reinforces that feeling that this game isn't quite* done, and it was from this kind of meddling. I hope they learn their mistakes for the sequel. If my frustrations haven't warded you away, then you will have a good time, i think. it's still all the simple joys of a harvest moon/animal crossing style game.",1642626478,1642626580,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-The mining just feels like another arbitrary waste of time to stop you from completing the game too quickly

After we said that, let me talk about all the good things this game does.
You are a builder/farmer/animal raiser/factory manager/fisherman/fighter/lover and much more.
There are so many things you can spend your time doing; this game lets you have the freedom to do whatever you want! And while other games try to do an excellent job in only one section and fail, My Time At Portia succeeds in every area.

The game is enjoyable, the story well made, and you really become one of the town people.

I bought this game a week ago and already made 100h+- in it, finished every quest that was thrown to me (including the main story).

So .... should you buy it for the low price of 10$+-? Definitely YES! 
Will you enjoy it? Probably Yes
Would I recommend it if it had cost double the price? YES!

Long(ish) Review: I was eager to find a game with traits of Stardew Valley, that -wasn't- Stardew Valley. The big difference for me with these two games (because they seem most often compared) is that My Time at Portia is much more entertaining to put hours into. I've never been much for farming crops, running around the entire map to find one thing, etc etc... with My Time at Portia... I end up doing one things that helps me with five things I have on the go, so I never feel like I'm wasting any time! I do have to take advantage of the internet every so often when I'm stuck/confused, but it's not nearly as often as when I attempted to play Stardew and had no idea where/what to do next. 

Overall, I'm in love with this game, and I can't wait for ""My Time at Sandrock"" to drop because I'll be sinking hours into that one as well! very happy I purchased this during the Winter Sale.",1642019719,1642019719,True,7,0,0.59509199857711792,0,True,False,False

1. Open the game's folder

3. Delete or rename EOSSDK-Win64-Shipping.dll.  Myself I just added a .bak to the end, which keeps it there in case something breaks and I need it again, but makes the game unable to utilise it, if it's even used.

The early game is just fantastic, as the player gets to know the city and its people, as the main story progresses the player just runs from task to task, racing to complete them faster than they keep popping up.
But at some point things start to get stale, after completing South Block the story starts to get dragged out, the new additions feel wasted. New things are unlocked, but they are not developed properly, kind of useless. While the original area is extremely dense with content, the new zones are practically empty.
Same goes for many of the systems: farming isn't really rewarding, and don't get me started on keeping animals. I don't think the latter should have been included in the game in its present form...

Oh, and combat. Mother of all issues. It's a mess, really. Hitboxes, hit registration, dodging, everything is off. The player should just pack a ton of healing items and tank everything, as the late game enemies are impossible to dodge. And crit chance is a must, because everything just takes way to much damage to go down. Thankfully platforming isn't really part of the game, because jumps can barely be aimed properly. And there is a returning sound issue in dungeons, where certain sounds just don't render, and footsteps, enemies, etc just go completely silent.

Sadly there are other bugs, the sound issue affects certain dialogues, where only the player is voiced, but the NPC does not say anything, just plays the animation. The cursor sometimes turns transparent and sometimes loadscreens trigger the Windows ""Appication not responding"" warning, though given enough time, it will load.

The game has lots of content, it takes a good 60-80 hours to work through the main story line if the player is new to the game. But many things on the sides feel unfinished.

Sure, the title of this game sounds like a book Ellen Degeneres might write if her marriage broke down, but donât let that discourage you, itâs a great game.

Personally, I love this game, itâs a nice break from shooting people and zombies over and over in other more popular games, so peaceful and relaxing.

My wife and her boyfriend are huge fans of Stardew Valley. I think that my wife alone has spent over 200 hours playing Stardew with her boyfriend. Though similar, I prefer My time at Portia. If you love farming sims, My time at Portia is a must. :) 

While itâs not a farming game primarily, itâs more a mining and crafting game, in essence itâs the same type of game Stardew  Valley is. The crafting is pretty deep, and the story, mostly mission based, is spanned over several years. It has given me one of the most relaxing, rewarding and plain nice experiences I have ever gotten out of a game in years.  

Iâm also so glad more and more games like these have same sex marriage as an option. I somehow no longer want to play these kinds of games if they donât, makes me feel weird to be forced to marry straight when role playing as a flamboyant homosexual looking to have the time of his life. 

If you enjoyed how open-ended Stardew Valley wasâ¦ if you played Stardew to unwindâ¦ this is a game for you.

666140,107026817,76561198373027097,0,1,2556,0,2556,1640974916,"I love everything about the game except the photo missions. The beginning plays similarly to a more intuitive Stardew Valley. However, this game gives a lot more direction in the form of quests. While you can ignore them if you so choose, quests are the best way to earn money and gain relationships with the character. Unlike Stardew Valley, this game has given me very few ""now how was I supposed to know that?"" moments.

The only things in the game that I have issues with are the cooking mechanic, the photo missions (as previously mentioned), and some limited dialouge options.

The cooking mechanic feels needlessly punishing. The game seems to encourage you to throw things in the pot, however, in my experience, that generally results in wasted food. I understand the developers can't program in every combination of ingredients, but really? Me trying to roast an apple makes it worse? what does my character do? Plus, many recipes have two of one ingredient, making it even harder to guess the recipe. Oh? I only put one shaker of salt into the pot, rather than two? so instead of being slightly under-salted it's obviously completely ruined.

The photo quests seem fun on the surface, but it can take minutes of angling around, struggling to figure out what angle the game wants you to take the picture from, until it finally counts. I can understand this with the people, but stationary objects? Did no one test the camera? I spent what felt like forever trying to take a picture of the machine inside of the research stations, and the one shot that worked was getting it from behind! I had so many better photos, but none of them counted. This also ruined the rest of the photo missions for me because I didn't have fun trying to get a good photo, I just floundered around looking for an angle the game would accept so I could progress. This is so disappointing because I would really like running around taking pictures for the quest if it wasn't so frustrating to get it to register objects as being in the frame.

For the dialouge options, once again, I'm ok for the majority of the game. However. There is a quest that Higgins gives you mid-autumn of your first year (at least for me) where it's a pretty basic ""fetch these materials"" situation, However, The way you recieve this quest annoys me. I know the pc is rivals with Higgins, but there is no response that is not suspicious upon him being nice. I want to be nice to Higgins up until he asks me to get stuff for him for a vague ""project"" and then I want to ask a few follow-up questions. Afterwords, instead of him giving me money, I would've loved to explain to just ask if he needs anything else, that he didn't have to be sneaky about it. Obviously Higgins is a stuck-up jerk but I don't like the game assuming I hate him at every turn. There are also options to blame Higgins for the pipe leaking sewage and threats delivered to your doorstep. I wouldn't mind if the pc chose these options on their own, giving them more characterization, but if it's my blank slate protagnist I hate acting like Higgins is some cosmic threat he's not. He's a childhood bully, and I wish the game either did more to make me genuinely suspect he had any motive to hurt the town, or stopped expecting me to suspect him of being anything but a red herring.

That being said, I hope it's clear that my critisms come from overabunding love from this game. The combat feels smooth and I really like needing to wait a certain number of in-game hours for vital crafting components because it allows me time to explore and have a day just for fishing, or mining, or cutting down trees. This review was mostly just an excuse to ramble about the few parts of the game that really bother me, but it's a really good game.

I like almost all the main characters, They're nice and lively than people in real life.
Cutscenes and the details in the game is great too! At the full price of the game so worth it.

I don't have consecutive days off. But on New Year's holidays, I'm sure I made the right choice.
Both kids and adults will have fun.

------------------------------------------------
im having a 2nd thought with this game and not just this game the pathea studio itself, hell even china game devs in general (this isnt my 1st taste of china games devs)
this game is grindy...very grindy either for gathering materials or the amount of exp to reach max level is insane, even that you still won't get all the skill points, you just cant max every skills period.
later on i discover how much mess they create during mid game and nearing end game, missing hit/dmg sound, missing character voice, etc. this is matp v2 not the v1
the absolute hatred i got for this game is their grindy nature, idk what are inside the dev heads having tortured players like this. yes people out there not going to enjoy this game at all despite its being goodish game, dont believe me?
the statistics dont lie only 15% people get the near end game achievement, out of what? thousands? hundreds thousands copies? my friend didnt even bother after 50 hours, this tell something wrong already with your game.

i still keep recommend it, if wasnt for the sake of the story, the npcs, and you will need 150-200 hours gameplay at minimum to finish this, believe me, you WILL BLEED like me.

I will be comparing this game to Stardew Valley -- I love Stardew as well, but I think MTaP makes a couple of points that even Stardew is lacking :o

[h1]Pros[/h1]
There are some mechanics in the game that absolutely made it for me:
[list]
[*] You are not alone doing things. Like, in Stardew, you are the one and only person farming, riding a horse, fighting monsters etc. There's nobody to share it with. In MTaP you have your fellow industry professional that has beef with you because you're his competitor, or the local ""law enforcement"" folks that take part in fighting baddies together with you. In fact, you have quite a few main story missions where another character accompanies and assists you. It's nice to have a company.
[*] NPC interactions go beyond dialogues and cutscenes. You can have playdates, ride a horse together, enjoy recurring side quests from your spouse, emote with them, take people into dungeons to help etc. I think that adds depth and gives something to do outside of the missions. After a certain event you also get a camera and can take photos of the beautiful things around you, as well as selfies on your own or with someone. You can frame your pictures or cutscene shots and put in your house to remind of the adventures you had together with your BFFs. There aren't that many long cutscenes by the way -- most events happen interactively and you get to act through them however you wish.
[*] I did not feel rushed playing MTaP. The only time-sensitive missions are NPC's side quests, but the main story can be done at your own pace. The farming aspect is very minimal and you don't depend on seasonal changes affecting your crops that much. To take it easy, just unpin the current main story mission from the quest list, and enjoy doing other things for a while.
[*] Grinding for basic resources is relieved by some forms of automation, which is neat. I did not need to chop trees like a maniac in the late game. The relics grind is real, however it isn't necessary to finish the game. Storage and inventory management is very simple as you can access all your chests by opening any of them, and you can also name and color your chests to simplify the search. Late-game crafting and building is a breeze too. It's nice to not have to rummage through ALL the chests in the house like mad. I appreciate that I don't have to take away from my in-game experience to manage my storage.
[/list]

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list]
[*] The game does have a bit of an unfinished feel to it. There are things like useless items, missing voiceovers, standard ""canned"" lines that were not customized for characters, lack of dialogue options etc. I think I read on wiki that some of these issues stem from the fact that developers are currently focusing on My Time at Sandrock, which was originally planned as DLC but then evolved into a standalone game. As much as I appreciate having a second game developed by the same team, I do wish that they can find some time to polish MTaP.
[*] The main story grand finale was somewhat unsatisfactory to be honest. The game ends up having more cliffhangers than I'd want. [spoiler]One of the townfolk guys mysteriously leaves, the leader of bad guys escapes, and the BBEG escapes too. The relationship between the last two characters that was heavily suggested remains a mystery.[/spoiler] 
[*] Absolutely did not enjoy the mining experience. Unlike the rest of the game with bright colors, things in motion and nice music, mines are... depressing. You're presented with a solid slab of muddy soil/ore mix, and you gotta repeatedly whack it with your pickaxe. Very monotone and boring IMO. Wildly different experience from the rest of the game for me, I did not like mining a single bit. They did try to spice it up with the relic search but that wasn't crazy exciting due to how dispersed the relics are.
[/list]

[h1]Final thoughts[/h1]
The humor and storyline are quite mild comparing to Stardew, which is more brutal and edgy. You know, Stardew has [spoiler]a homeless guy, a veteran with PTSD, a cheating wife, use of smoking and alcohol etc[/spoiler], while in MTaP most of the ""background"" drama is limited to some character being deceased (although I'll have to say that this kind of drama is used quite a lot for families -- [spoiler]there's only one family with both mom and dad alive, the rest are missing either mother or father or both, there's also an orphan and someone abandoned as a baby[/spoiler]). I guess that makes it more friendly for a broader and younger audience? :)

You can get a lot of fun hours out of this game if it's up your alley. It isn't difficult, it isn't grindy, you can really enjoy your time at the beautiful town of Portia. It definitely has a place in my heart. I sincerely hope this game will see an update to address some of the issues, and then I'll gladly play it all over again from the start. I do think that some of the mechanics explored in this game are a welcome addition to this genre, and I'm definitely looking forward to My Time at Sandrock.",1640397386,1640459991,True,65,1,0.8610115647315979,1,True,False,False

I expected your standard atmospheric farming resource management game without much direction or story and was instantly proven wrong. Even as a jaded casual gamer I fell hard for this game. 

The world sucks you in, the rich lore is written in the world and people, not in exposition dumps. The character's have depth, you feel like there is an actual community and past between them and your relationships actually effect more than dialogue. The story is interesting, complex, and you really feel like a part of it. I was surprised by how much there was as it just seemed to keep coming. The pacing felt great, each goal/stage taking enough effort to create satisfaction but not enough time for the tedium of grinding to set in. While gamers who crave difficulty may find it too easy I really liked that even as a casual gamer I could succeed at the harder levels and didn't feel locked out of the story or penalized by my skill level.

There is so much more I could praise but it would take to long and have too many spoilers.

There is a bit of a learning curve especially with fishing since the mechanics aren't explained that well in game but, once you get the hang of it this game is so relaxing. With fun events where you usually have to beat the other characters at something and the builder rankings every month/year you could be more competitive if you want though.

The art style is so whimsical there are times I discover a new creature and just giggle at it. The characters are all deeper than what they appear to be on the surface and befriending or romancing them gives you perks as well so it's worth all of the effort it takes to get to know them. The economy of the game is always changing and it feels great to buy on a low day and sell on a high one.  Building, farming, tending to animals, monster hunting, mining, playing mini games, all of it is so fun! I haven't gotten very far yet but I discover something new every day I play.

I recommend this game to people who like everything I said above however, it is not a perfect game. It has some confusing aspects to it and, some weird parts I don't get(like passing out will not penalize you but you will be forced to save and wake up the next day in your bed). Overall I'd rate it a 8.5/10 so far only because I haven't experienced enough of it to rate it any higher.

I also want to add on that I did buy this game on sale however, I would've been just as happy if I had paid full price for it due to it's quality. If you see it on sale it's an absolute steal so if you're considering buying it then and you have the money to spare I'd say go for it!

The combat system mostly boils down to button mashing, the crafting is slow and tedious, there's a few mini games that aren't engaging, improving relationships is extremely slow, the writing is poor and the world is not always internally consistent. It seems the devs were dreaming of having a much bigger game than they ended up creating as there are some systems in the game that are half implemented, for instance there is mount happiness but it does nothing.
Despite all the negatives, it can be alright. One thing worth highlighting is all the voice acting in the game.

Upon starting the game up, it hitched at the initial loading screen for about 2 minutes. Clicking the screen brought up a ""not responding"" prompt. Once I actually got to the game's main menu and into character creation, things were pretty good. Character models looked a bit rough, but after some time I made something I was pretty happy with. So I clicked confirm, and the game froze. After another minute of waiting, I got to the date of birth. Chose one, clicked confirm, and the game froze. But this time, the game froze for over 5 minutes with frozen loading icons. I had to force close the game. Once I booted it up, it again froze at the start up before I even got to the main menu.

The game looked genuinely charming and I'm always a sucker for these kind of life-sim experiences.

I expect I will play this game just to enjoy the tip early game just to try most of the game mechanics. But nope. I stayed in this game longer than other game with similar trope (Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, etc)

What I really like about My Time At Portia, there is a storyline you can enjoy but you also could chilling take your sweet time to do a lot of things. The most remarkable feature that I really love is that I could setting how fast in-game times moves. When I want to farm and explore longer, I make the in-game time moves slower, but when I want crafting time shorter and I don't have a lot task to do I just make the in-game time moves faster.

This game really good for people who loves a middle ground of farming-crafting games. Not too restrictive, but you still have something that restrict you so you need allocate your time and resource better. Not too grindy, but If you want to have abundance resource you can go crazy grindy but to complete the game you don't need to go to grind hell.

It's like the devs had a plan for a second season or an expansion but never followed through with it. But that's just me guessing, not truth. 

With that aside, the game is very enjoyable. It gives you almost everything you can want from a farming/crafting life sim: crafting, farming, dating, marriage, children, and you even get some action mixed in by going into Hazardous Ruins to defeat monsters for rare/specific loot that you can't find elsewhere. 

The graphics in this game are insane. You can see every blade of grass on the ground and every speck of snow when it snows in-game.

But farming is more of a late game activity. It's about crafting. Think of a survival game without the survive part. 

It's a semi casual game. I say that because I didn't know some quests are timed and failed 2. Which isn't a big deal. But you don't gain money or rep which is the point of the game.

It's like stardew valley because they, how you say, borrowed a lot. You build a museum and find artifacts among other things to fill it and get stuff for it. They have a skull cavern called deepest ruin. There's farming crafting raising animals and combat. And you can travel to another island but you can't build a farm there. So if you want another stardew fix this is the closest thing to it.

And wow that is not a bad thing. You build up the town. People will move in and tourists visit. And the scenery changes when you build up the town is incredible. 

The amount of people you can date marry and divorce is really big. Not too mention others date and get married too. 

My complaints are nit picks. There's some long load times logging in and loggin out. I play Fallout 4 on high graphics and those load times are as bad but this is not FO4. 

Theres this weird bug or feature I'm not sure. But sometimes it will reset your talent points and you'll have to reallocate them. I was in a hazardous dungeon wondering why I was doing a lot more damage. It was I had my points reset. This has happen 5 times so far. 

But on the bright side I can change my talent tree up if I didn't like something. So it's kinda a feature?

Another nit pick the subtitles are not always right. Apparently Martha isn't her name when they say it. Just one example. 

Also when you're in the hot spring why doesn't anyone wear bathing suits? It's so jarring they lay in it in their clothes.

Also no one can swim. I don't understand that. There is water everywhere but no one can swim. I get it's to be borders so you can't go into areas you're not yet really for but still. The game is supposed to be somewhat immersive. 

Other than that the crafting is not tedious as some games. You can eventually get it automated. You can change clothes and hairstyles. They actually will wear accessories. The combat is balanced and even the mining is fun when you get more powerful.

The following is an estimation from my own experience with it:

[h1] Pros: [/h1]
[list]
    [*]Fun and intuitive gameplay that you can easily spend hours enjoying.
    [*]While the main idea of the game is directed at the MC being a builder, youâre not stuck to doing just that throughout your play-through. You can go and be a fisher person, or perhaps youâre more of a combat player, either way, the choice is yours and you can balance your time between these activities should you want to.
    [*]An amazing soundtrack!
    [*]The storyline itself (at least, in my opinion) never gets old and has a lot of re-playability (Iâve played through the game at least 3 times at this point).
    [*]The combat is simple and easy to learn, itâs not an action game but these mechanics are well balanced.
    [*]Townies are voice-acted and each have their own unique stories (this applies to both marriageable and non-marriageable NPCs)
[/list]
[h1] Cons: [/h1]
[list]
    [*]A few bugs here and there. None that are game breaking, more along the lines of interesting visual effects or a crash. These are by no means frequent, however.
    [*]Some of the characters (particularly some of the less popular marriage candidates) have fairly generic quests. Itâs relatively easy to see who were the favourite characters by how much attention was given to their story.
    [*]In a similar vein to the above, not all lines are voice-acted. Most of the dialogue that was in the original sections of the game is completely voice-acted, but more recent content is just text. (They may be adding to this but Iâm not sure).
[/list]

Overall, I would 100% recommend getting My Time At Portia. Itâs an amazing game and I canât say enough about it. All I can say is: You wonât regret buying it.
Also! If youâve found that you liked this game or are interested in the My Time series, the sequel to My Time At Portia (My Time At Sandrock) is an awesome game as well even though itâs only in its early stages at this point in time.",1638154573,1638154594,True,15,0,0.689971029758453369,0,True,False,False

It's cute, bright, fun, and friendly. Even the combat is not aimed at making you feel like you're never going to get through a level.

- variation of things to build and that its not super easy to get everything

If I had to really sum up the game I would say it's an underrated 3D stardew valley. The preview images on the store page really don't do the game justice, as it can be really beautiful and nice to explore. The sunset and colors are especially beautiful. 

While you can also farm, the main focus and storyline of the game has to do with building, as you are a builder that comes to the town and opens up new areas while you progress through the story. The storyline and world are very interesting, set in a post-apocalyptic setting (something you wouldn't get at first glance). There are hints and legends of what happened to the world before, and it's nice to see the extra creativity here instead of just settling for being another game where you're just a farmer in a new town. There are dungeons to explore, mining to be done, and other activities to pass the day. Combat is not the best for sure, but it's serviceable and it's cool to pass a few game evenings clearing out dungeons. 

'Leveling' up relationships and seeing the storylines of the characters in the town is another strong point (some get more story than others). There are also special events and missions that happen if you are romancing certain characters. You can start a family if you wish, go on play dates, etc. There are cool events that happen throughout the year, and lots of fun surprises as you continue playing. 

I highly recommend this game to anyone that like building relationships, life-sim games, etc. It's a must-have honestly, especially at a discount. Just only buy it on steam, it is practically abandoned on certain other storefronts. Not a good look honestly but it's hardly the first game that gives steam special treatment. 

Make sure to keep an eye out for the sequel, My time at Sandrock as well. They have improved on a ton of things over the original and it's looking to be an even better time.",1637038880,1637039622,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In terms of charm, there is a lot of charm to be had playing My Time At Portia.
However it can become very tedious very fast.
What I mean is in order for you to actually 'find a dame' that has a high affinity for you, you will spend days upon days just spamming gifts to your person of interest. This Harvest Moon style of working an affinity system sadly is very tiring and boring. It's a mechanism, but it's still very outdated and you'll find it more of a chore grind then actual gameplay.

In terms of combat, it's pretty lack luster, and the logic of having lv. 20 monsters in the same exact area as lv. 1 monsters is strange. With that being said, most of the monsters I've encountered don't even attack you, they're too cute to attack, so what's the point of beating them up? 

I've had several frame rate drops for some unknown reason on a good computer running a 1060 NVIDA, should not be getting drops at certain moments like this.
But what's the worst out of even the affinity grind, is the save system; you must sleep in a bed  in order to save. What if I want to save on the fly, which I should be able to do.

I would need to end the entire day, just to save, which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, it's true madness. Please implement a manual save system, or at least an autosave. This can be created for the game by the devs at any time, please consider.

All in all, the game I can see being pretty fun and decent, for a 10 year old, but not for you 18+ players, or Skyrim modders, no. You'll find it too dumbed down, and tedious feeling. You'll have fun for the small moment, but like me just literally 0.8 hours in you'll get bored and move on. Buy this game if you have the time and patience to fiddle with it for awhile, and wanna settle down with a relaxing charming soft game.

If you've played Harvestmoon/Stardew Valley (Skip if you haven't): Did you ever feel like there wasn't enough time, and that you needed to optimize every moment because you felt as though you had an encroaching deadline of the seasons changing or an upcoming festival you have to be ready for?

It's like that, without the stress. Just go at your own pace, do what you've got to do, the game isn't in a rush, and you shouldn't be either.

If you haven't played Harvestmoon/Stardew Valley: It's a simplish building/community/light fighting game that emphasizes a relaxed environment. You'll get commissions to build various things, some pertaining to the general progression of the community you become a part of at the start of the game.

In fact, the toons are refreshingly cute. Even the music is happy. Overall, the interface is well designed. There is tons to do and lots to see. On the support side, the wiki for this game is a superior tool, in fact one of the best I've ever seen. My first impression of the game was nothing short of bombastic. 

Unfortuantely, there are six issues, which wittled me down to the point, that I stopped playing after two realtime days.

The first is a straight deal breaker. The game can only be saved sleeping in your own bed. Worse, that ends the in-game day. Any glitch, be it in-game or Windows-typical, means one has to redo the day. Since foraging and, more to the point ruin-diving, is random, losing a day of good luck finds hurts. Losing the same day three times is Groundhog Day. Without the happy ending. Why in all the blue blazes would a developer insist on ruining such a fine game?!?

The second through fifth are creating unnecessary stress in a game expressively trying to be relaxing.

The second is the inability to push out or restart a mission. Why do several core missions have time limits to be picked up?

The third is that it is impossible to pre-determine, whether a mission is timed. Why exactly is there a time-pressure at all?

The fourth is that it is impossible to pre-determine, whether a mission is even doable. One may not even have access to a non-craftable item yet. This is about more than just the harrowinhg question, why there is a time pressure to begin with. This issue sucks the life out of the fun of having a plethora of items to dabble with. Wasting all that variety by forcing the player on the narrow path seems counter-intuitive.

The fifth is that picking up commissions is a major pain. A toon named Higgins is so hot on one's heels, that one doesn't even have the time to read the three or four offers at the beginning of the day. This is not only not relaxing, it effectively kills commissions as a tool to make good with choice NPCs. And one only has one single chance a day. This chance should be more than a blind click ""Looks doable"".

The sixth is the one UI bust. I could not find a way to pin single slots of the fast access bar. Constantly having to replace quick slots manually beats the very idea of the bar.

I am fully aware, that none of these issues will be addressed in MTAP. However, I truly hope the upcoming My Time At Sandrock comes without all that nonsense. Especially the saving option. Or lack thereof.",1635717441,1635717441,False,105,10,0.664808809757232666,0,True,False,False

Yes it would be easier if they had a sales box like harvest moon, but to each their own. From gathering and harvesting, all the way to mining and combat this game has a taste for it all. The story was amazing and if you know how the game rolls, you will excel so quickly. And the combat form is amazing with sword combos and hammer as well. From light to heavy weapons. Or if you are up for it you can even craft a venom gun and shoot from range, if you like close combat their are gloves for that. As for creatures and different boss characters, the design and characteristics that they all present is very unique and very intriguing. As for the rest of the NPC's they make it to where if you really want to get perks for certain things then you need to gain their friendship. Rather than just talk to them you can gift, play, or on the day of memories present a ghost lanterns and release them. You can gain friendship points that way as well. You dont have time to tend to your garden or maybe your forgetful? Ack is the perfect person to tend to it as well as harvest and regrow. I've gotten so close with this game for almost a full year now. Definitely cant wait for the release of Sandrock, the My time series would definitely be really interesting if they decide to do all the free cities and Duvos. Now my only suggestion for the my time series, is make it to where we can transfer our character and skills to Sandrock. Whether they do it or not I'd still be fine with the final outcome.

You gather resources, help the townsfolk of Portia, get commission, occasionally fights monsters, brawl against friendly folk and ...and...and...and, the list is never ending, as the developers keep optimizing and including more content for this game for a long time, which is absolutely great. 
The voice acting is very well done, considering the many characters it features with so much script! I enjoy every character I came across so far, even the mean ones. 
The music, very relaxing (more upbeat in battles) , the 3D world of Portia is very beautiful and a player can really see the improvements when taking part in shaping Portia in a way that feels organic. I sometimes stumbled upon problems I had in the game, like where to buy caterpillars to fish or feeling taht I have to always be ""running""around from A to B, but gladly the help and discussion forums are there to tell me that I don't need to worry, as there is a horse that I can rent or purchase after building a shed. 
Even after 30h+ I still did not turn a frown or curs the game for being too difficult as there is so much to discover, create, see and be part of. This game is your absolute, if not perfect getaway for lock-down scenarios, being snowed in for a few days or time alone, instead of traveling. In any case, this game has left me wanting more and I feel absolutely happy inside playing it.

For a final version, there are so many issues still existing (I am talking to YOU, stupid grammar mistakes). The studio didn't seem to care about details, or contents, at all. The mechanism is decent, I actually like how you can choose your sub-quests without missing plots. However, days get repetitive, especially with only several lines of NPC dialogues to entertain yourself. 
I will just write down as many problems as I remember now:

1)Post-event special dialogue is missing. Or everyone just doesn't have enough dialogues. i.e. The town school was DESTROYED and no one talked about it? Yes there are restoration requests but the citizens just keep speaking their daily regulars. 
2)Why are my freshly bought/crafted carpets/furniture dirty by default?? What an eyesore.
3)I want different music for different abandoned ruins. Just change the beat/tune and you will get variations, it's not so difficult!
4) Late-stage weapons missing. You get nicer armour by quests but where are the weapons? I got my Nova sword mid-stage and was stuck with it through the rest of the game. Forge doesn't even help because you need to get the high-tier weapon first so you can upgrade your poor one.
5)I can see the podium over there and I won the competition. I don't get to be on the podium. My rewards are mailed to me (wtf?) and people don't say congrats to me.
6)I put a decoration on the floor, I get boosts. I put the same decoration into a cabinet, I don't get boost. Why? Why do I have to suffer the ugly interior design? They are placed at home anyway!

A few things I love about it is:

- Fast travel/mounts - Had to work at getting them but when you do it makes the game so much better!
- Friendship points - I was worried at how slowly befriending people was going to be but as you level up with one person points are given to whomever is closest to them so you level up with others easily. I really really like that as it makes making friends not a chore.
- I love that there is always something to do. Everyday my character gets up I have a plan for that day, whether it's fishing to make money, going in to the ruins for resources, or working on a mission. I look forward to everyday, theres always something to do and it doesn't feel like a chore or boring. I don't dread having to do it like in some games from the genre.

There's more but seriously, if you like games like this you will definitely enjoy this one, it's well worth the $30.


I'm not finished with it though, I'm only in the fall of my first year.

And you can choose to focus on one of those, or even change your focus over time. I do wish it was possible to completely ignore an element (for example, not delving into ruins at all and getting everything you need through trade), but I can overlook this.

The crafting is well thought out and fun. And the storyline is actually surprisingly long and involved. I've put a ton of time into this game and I'm still having fun.

I will say it's a little too easy to make money through fishing, such that it kind of defeats the purpose of crafting to make money. If I spend a day fishing for wise fish and gladiator fish, I can easily make 15,000+ gold. If I get lucky and get a wiser fish or two that number can easily reach 25,000. Why mess around crafting and selling things at that point?

I think the game has nice quality of life features which is always good in these sort of games. The gameplay loop early and mid on is good; it has a nice mix of pacing and pushing the player forward but all the missions are reasonably placed. Building/moving items is a weak point for this game, when you are running out of space it feels really really bad.

I think the game is really missing fun, entertaining, village characters with quality side quests and background stories. It's really missing the 'heart' element to a peaceful game like this. The season have little impact on what gameplay you are doing and there are lacking in-game guides such as fish breeding and where to get certain items. 

I will also say that the voice lines and then the lack of voice lines is very jarring, its missing content definitely and then a lot of later game dialogues sound completely phoned in with poor quality.

I think this game is very average, 5/10, it's got a lot of potnetial, a lot of entertaining mini games, but it heart. I'm looking forward to My time in Sandrock, hopefully the multiplayer and some of the lessons they learned mean a better game.",1632628678,1632856695,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Notes:
- The game is not very forward on highlighting important mechanic. (Have to google on how to unlock the cook station at season 3, and in turn, realize the important of investing in research center).
- Combat is pretty janky, mobs have a lot of hitscan, MC have excessive i-frame on dodge, one certain type of weapon have excessive stun power that render boss fights trivial. It is a very primitive implementation, but by no mean one that is too bad to play, try to remember your MC is naught but a farmer (thus, enemies supposed to have the same or higher combat capability) and a lot of minor flaws will become understandable.
- NPC are very competitive, but during Memorial Day ghost hunt, they cooperate with each other to oppose MC which make the competitiveness of them a minus point. Other than that, every other minigames are very well designed.
- Can definitely use some more fashion (I had total of 12 sets at the time of writing this review, still working toward the snowball fight event's one. It's so cute but so expensive... I don't think seasonal clothes are obtainable during the first year.)

Overall, this is a game very worth playing if you like country retreat genre. It is not necessarily a farming game, there are many ways to make money: crafting, commission, mining, dungeon diving, fishing, fish breeding, Alpaca taming and of course farming with both planting and growing animals, choose one that fit the story you write for your character.

Always plenty of things to do at least this early into the game. Most of the game mechanics feel intuitive and smooth to play although some people may find the crafting tedious. Occasionally things might get a little odd with other characters glitching on and off a horse over and over for example or some clipping but nothing has effected game play.

When I first started playing, I remember thinking ""This is it, I've found the perfect crafting game. I can play it forever and die happy."" The systems and synergies came on fast, there was tons to learn and do, I was putting up new machines and hitting interesting bottlenecks all the time. Everyone I talked to seemed to unlock something.

After a while, the steam just ran out. Each successive furnace unlocks a new smelted bar, which is just like the ones that came before it. Each new bridge or lift to a new zone unlocks a new kind of wood, and a new ore, which are just like the ones before them. The blender and skiver basically make everything that isn't an ore or a wood product, and the 'worktable' makes everything that's so idiosyncratic (a chandelier? A riverboat paddlewheel?) that they couldn't think of any other way to categorize it.

The social game seems interesting at first, but it never gets off the ground. Most characters have a few missions, 2-3 canned comments that they make every time you speak to them, then one additional comment about each major game event. Having just finished Hades, this strikes me as incomplete to the point of intentional cruelty. Characters never tell you what gifts they're interested in - you find out at the wiki. There's no penalty for giving them the most cost-effective gift every day for a year.

This game could have been dramatically improved by better balancing choices (making a single axe stroke in a tree gives more XP than completing a building commission), better system integration (90% of the cooking recipes will never get made because nobody in town eats it, and it doesn't give a strong buff), and faction exclusion (it's virtually impossible to make a choice that offends anyone). Greater variety between subsystems, more difficult tasks, and better economic sinks than just ""this plot commission requires a *lot* of steel"" are at the top of my wish list.

Having said all that, I still play it all the time, and I still want to see everything the game has to offer. If you liked Stardew Valley, or crafting games generally, you will probably love this. It just could have been so much more.",1631845010,1631845010,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Set in a post-apocalyptic valley, My Time at Portia is a stunning, refreshing twist on the Farm Adventure Sim with a lot to offer. You can do many things in your day-by-day life as a Builder without feeling overwhelmed or rushed. Fight mobs, mine for treasure, fish, complete quests, forage, craft, sell, befriend and woo locals. The storyline is quite interesting and there are many sides to each tale that you can explore. 

I prefer to play this with a controller as the controls work perfectly with one!

The crafting system is detailed and provides satisfaction in your completed works, although making bulk materials is time consuming. The relationship sim system is nuanced and your relationship with one character can be affected or affect other NPCS.

I am early into the game so I have not farmed crops much, but so far it is not a time-consuming process. I hope it becomes more advanced and rewarding experience as I progress in the game. I do enjoy how it doesn't take up too much of your time.

This is my personal experience and only for 10h or less

This game used to be fun, i bought and played it when it was still in early access years ago. It was nice, the pace not too slow neither too fast, always with things to do, etc. Speaking about farm games it is decent, can be played and enjoyed and with the updates each time more and more
As far as i remember you have the guild, your house and terrain which is smol but soon you can buy more field to do stuff, a mining side (Yes, mining site, stuff to mine in the world can be counted with one hand), fishing, building vehicles and... i think a dungeon. Sounds good overall, right?

Now, lets talk about what it was to come back after years and once the game updated to 1.0 (a week ago)
I have a decent pc, yet the game has CONSTANT slows and suddenly stops for a second or two, again, not my computer and even playing with the minimum graphics it still happens, it annoyed me so much i refused to play a minute more
I read its cause for some reason it has epic spyware question mark, even being in steam, idk, this is the main reason i do not recommend it.

This game lacks a certain polish that Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley have.

The crafting system feels unimaginative, there's pretty much only one way to get things done so it doesn't feel like you have a ton of control in the outcome. There are really stupid audio issues, for example: the trees have this bird tweeting loop that's only one second and is pretty annoying. If you go near a couple trees they all play the exact same loop and turns into a flanging cacophony. The same thing happens with the fishing.

Despite the emphasis on combat in some parts of the game, once you easily overcome low attack/defense numbers it's usually just a ""spam attack until win"" scenario. The controls are responsive, sure, but combat just isn't fun or fulfilling.

Frames drop randomly during gameplay which normally I can deal with, except when I'm platforming.

Audio sync issues appear a lot during combat, certain sounds either won't play or will be delayed.

I was hoping for another game to add to my collection of collect 'n' craft type of games I know and love. However, there's too much restriction for me to enjoy my normal casual play style. Some of the things you should be wary of before playing:

There's a stamina bar. 
Not to unusual, eh? Well, every hit of a tree, rock, or other resource takes stamina.  Stamina does not recover over time. The two ways to recover stamina are to eat and sleep. No biggie, right? Well, only some foods recover stamina. In the hour and a half I played I found two pieces of food that restore 10% of max stamina. Oh, cool. I can chop down... one more tree. The way stamina was implemented in this game just makes it feel like they were going to add micro transactions for stamina potions and forgot to at the last minute.

Resource Requirements:
As per most games the resource requirements for different upgrades starts small and gets bigger. But unlike other games, this one doesn't choose to ease into it. The FIRST real thing the game asks you to build requires you to build 4 crafting stations, and a tool upgrade. And those upgrades aren't cheap. The resources needed to build each of them grow VERY quickly in terms of quantity AND quality. Combine this with the restrictive stamina bar, and it just feels like a slog of a grind, even compared to other games of similar genre.

I love grindy games, truly I do. But not when they make it grindy and inconvenient to grind right from the get-go. I just couldn't get behind this game. I'm very glad I purchased it at a 75% discount.",1631306526,1631306526,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. I wish the voice acting was more fine tuned, or at least not used since it wasn't polished enough to be implemented. I noticed different characters pronounce the same word (for example ""Corps"") differently. This instantly pulled me out of being immersed in the game, because being a small community with their own culture, I don't really understand how words can be pronounced differently amongst them. There are also instances where what the character speaks is not what is written in the dialogue box. For example, I noticed Sam say ""distractors"" instead of the written ""detractors"" in the dialogue box, which actually made be laugh at the time.

2. The tutorial mechanics could have had more added to them. I had no idea where to get some things that were being talked about early in the game, such as the Blender and Cooking Set (I still don't have the Cooking Set, and I've had the Fish Stew quest in my log for the past 2 in-game months). I also did not realize the ""For Sale"" signs next to your house are for you to expand your yard - I thought they were there because you are living in your dirtbag dad's abandoned workshop. Another example is how I did not realize there were specific side quests that are not commission quests, which have a time limit. I took a quest from Mr. Ack to put flowers on his friends' graves, and then the Harvest Festival took place the next day. I participated in the festival, but the day after I was notified that I failed the quest. Having only two days for that, which I was not immediately told about anywhere in the game, seemed a bit much.

There are other smaller issues with the game that I've come to forgive because I really love the gameplay. One I can think of off the top of my head is object boundary boxes being janky pretty much everywhere. I can also forgive what I already listed. I just felt like I should call it out because those issues can be a deal breaker for some players, and they were very frustrating for me to play through. They are also things developers need to be conscious of. Like, it's okay to take out that one feature even if you put so much work into it, because it's just not working the way it needs to for the game to make sense. Anyway, I'm going to keep playing the game because I still thoroughly enjoy it, and Pinky is the best NPC cat.",1631298906,1631305235,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

###
Graphic : 90/100 
if you are into cartoon-like graphic. Why not 100? I, definitely love cartoon-like graphic, but well the graphic in this game is good but the character seems a bit rigid (or stiff is the right word?) but that will not hinder you guys from getting on the fun.
###
Story : 95/100 
Yes the story is good with a lot of character you can affectionate with (I Love Ginger btw).
###
Gameplay : 99/100 
From early on, you cant do much but gathering stone and wood. But as you progress further through the game's story, there's ton of things you can do and every mechanic of the game is quite enjoyable (fishing, mining, exploring, socializing, crafting, building, upgrading, etc), and later, you can ease your work by upgrading your tool and machine to produce things, so you don't have to worry about doing heavy chores everyday. The map is vast, so exploring is the good way to enjoy this game, but you need to progress through the main story first (but don't rush the main story too much) to explore more areas.

What I liked most about SDV wasn't the farming, I enjoyed the crafting and exploring and this is where MTAP shines. Farming is part of the game but your primary goals are crafting-based because you run a workshop, not a farm. 
There is also a slightly darker, post-apocalyptic element to MTAP. In the ruins you find artifacts from the past and the local church is deeply suspicious of the world that was before. These are the aspects that set MTASP apart from average farm & friends sims. 
The art-style is lovely and they've updated and added content since I first picked it up.

If you liked Stardew Valley (farming in this sucks) but thought, "" I wish the townsfolk felt more alive"" then this will take care of that need. More of a carpenter in this, than a farmer. You can farm but it's more like a mini-game/tedious time consuming task that's not related to the main focus of the game. 

Some shit you'll need to hand wave or overlook
    The combat is pretty shallow. The farther you get in the game the more janky it all becomes as well. Sound and animations not syncing, at least one enemy type has no slow/walking animation at all. It's pretty braindead easy combat though, and you can just watch something on a second monitor while you do it. 
    
    You can get request for tasks/quests/whatever that you can't complete. Basically, you need a material that is locked behind an area you don't have access to yet. Because you haven't advanced the main quest far enough. There are workarounds of course, pause the game and google when at the job board (before accepting). Or restart the day (game only saves when you sleep). 

That's about it for cons, if you like these types of games. This does passable to fairly well in all other areas. This game is a vast improvement over their previous game (Planet Explorers - they got in over their heads on that one). And their next game Sandrock is looking to be an improvement over this one.

I won't shitpost though. I like this game, it does have a vague semblance to Stardew Valley, but many significant differences too. I don't know if the game forces you to 'finish' by a certain point like SV, but it doesn't feel that way and does feel a bit more balanced towards doing what you feel like doing with your in-game time with a bit less stress. It's peaceful, there's no obligation to talk to the townspeople (and there are a LOT of townspeople), and you can stay out of the way if you like. If you need a game to just lose yourself in then this is it. I wouldn't call it a farming sim either, it's more of a building sim with a lot of different components.

I'll look at the different systems the game comprises:
Farming and cooking: I've combined these two because they intertwine. Farming is functional, not as many crops as Stardew and the farm space can feel really cluttered with having to place boxes for crops and trees. Cooking feels unfinished and the 'minigame' is really slow to respond at times. Djanga (cafe owner) never really provides a variety of recipes and you're kinda left to guess and throw things in the cooking set and hope something comes out. Or look at the wiki. I don't really agree that guesswork is the best response in systems like this. The food buffs are also quite weak compared to your stats, so you have to cook lots.

Mining: Feels unfinished, hunting relics is ok but you're just digging holes in a big square of dirt and that's it.

Dungeons: Combat is really unpolished and floaty. It's the lowest quality section of the game. Dungeon rooms aren't varied enough to warrant this being a major component of material gathering. Needed way more love than it got. Physics are awful, projectiles pass through walls, in the overworld the invisible walls are super lazy and glitchy.

Relationships: Either you can figure out what people like or brute force the relationships with universal items... ehhhh.

Crafting: Fun but expect to spend a lot of time balancing your available space out to machines. Wish there were descriptions for what some machines do as well (like do they craft stuff or not)

Overall, nice game despite some glaring flaws. In lockdown right now and since Doom Eternal disappointed me last time I bought a game in lockdown last year I thought I'd traverse the other end of the spectrum and chill out. I do wish they had spent a bit more time polishing the systems here to something special instead of kickstarting a sequel.

I just put it on my wishlist yesterday as I share it from my S.O.'s library and I'm almost down on achievements, but I still wanted to encourage the devs a bit by purchasing it on sale (which happened within 24h from wishlisting, thanks Steam! ^^) and be able to play while he plays his own games too. It's the perfect mix of a little action (for him) and cutesy everything plus lots of grinding and crafting mechs of all kinds (for me). Only downside is dialogues are a bit repetitive and NOT history/quest-updated at all sometimes (spoilerless examples: achieve X huge favor for character A you're dating, yet he/she still says ""one day I might have that"" every now and then, doing exactly that already; finish many quests in a row that are related, characters dialogues sometimes get mixed up and make no sense anymore).

You are a simple person who inherited your father's workshop. Your main story is of you rebuilding the workshop and helping the town. Maybe fall in love with the farm girl down the road. This game focus more on crafting and combat than farming. You need to gather materials yourself to craft anything and to go into town every morning to make sure you get the highest paid commissions on the board before your ugly rival Higgins gets to them. There is also several ""abandon ruins"" you can explore and get your raw materials but also to try to find pieces of relics that you can put together for other parts of the game. It can be hard in the beginning of game play due to being limited by your early game stamina but there is a leveling system in place and a skill tree to help. Positives that I liked was that you can find gear to give you better stats and leveling system with skill tree. The game allows you to slowly open the map up to unlock and explore new areas with new creatures to fight and items to gather. Art style is cute and most everyone in town have their own story lines you can explore and they treat you as well as you treat them. 

Biggest/niche drawbacks of the game:
-Whenever you go into combat, your game can lag SEVERELY. Turning off battle effects can help but the game seems to not be 100% optimized for this even though it a major feature. Fixes around this can be lowering settings, turning off battle effects or downloading the game into an SSD. My luck was just turning off battle settings, load into an SSD and I still had lag points while in combat but not as severe. This is my biggest grip of the game is the severe lag I get whenever I enter combat. 
-Sometimes the dialogue box subtitles don't match up with the npc's voice lines. Could be a oversight in clean up here.
-Cut scenes have no sound and the voice lines don't match up. With janky animation from the characters. 
-When building items for commissions, your character won't highlight the item you need to put in. So you constantly  have to do a weird jump dance to get the character to highlight the piece. 
-Some skills in the the skill tree seem to be pointless or not even worth putting points in but you need 5 points per ""line"" in order to unlock the next line so sometimes have to put points into that useless skill. 

TL;DR
great game with many hours of fun. Combat can create lag terribly. Glitches and lags in places but if you can ignore the minor stuff you will enjoy your time here in Portia.",1630967540,1630967540,True,2,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I only have a few issues with it which i hope are fixed with the new game coming out.

1. we need a lot more customization to the character and clothing options.
        
  - No matter what i did my character always looked like he had downs.  his head was way too big or the facial features were way too small idk what it is but it needs to be fixed. the lack of facial features didn't help either
        
  - The lack of hair and beard styles was really disappointing and most if not all of them never fit or looked right on the character.
          
- Voices we got three and it ranges for guys from high higher and one decent sounding voice. thou that voice doesn't match up with anything you create giving you a teenager with the voice of a scruffy 30 something yr old.
          
- Different body and head types would be AMAZING in the new game.
          
- Clothing we have the starter clothing and then a few clothing sets at the store. then special clothing you can get at events or are unlocked at later lvls. when i look at their sprites they look good then i put them on and they look like trash. for example the gala outfit its black on sprite but when you put it on its this god awful shade of purple. a lot of clothing sets dont match, or they dont blend well with other outfits.  in the new game i hope they add a shit ton of more clothing options as well as a way to dye the clothing.


2.  Furnaces... WHY the hell do all the furnaces burn wood? i know theirs a generator at later lvls that fixes it but my god the amount of wood i have to farm to keep these furnaces running is ridiculous. let me use charcoal let me use hard/iron wood, propane, or the power crystals anything to give me better cooktimes XD

3. ease up on the expansion cost holy shit. 15000, 30000, break up your chunks please id rather slowly buy small chunks at easier to manage prices then massive chunks that take me forever to reach.

So far thats all the issues ive come across

will update later.

I've played many games over the years with none keeping the player as poor as this one does financially in game play. Usually a game has an item or two which will help the beginner afford the basic necessities.  I found this to be a constant struggle.  In options I found a setting to make the colors more pleasing to the eye which was better than eye strain. The town folk here nice to see but far too many senseless short conversations.  It is not obvious to the player how to level them up other than listening to them each day.  The research center was found to be very, very slow.  One poor guy was waiting a couple weeks for me to get him a certain sword and I finally gave up. I'm sure I needed a copy of it in battle on my next mission.  Also incurred a fatal error causing my game to crash and my computer. So a report could not even be sent to the team.  After that I had to start, quit and reload many times just to be able to mine for a pray of copper to land in my inventory. A lot of thought went into this game but truly you need a guide or wiki/internet search to answer your questions all day.

They want me to revise this.... I'll add to it, the hazardous ruins is bugged.  Clearing levels is about impossible because the game says I cleared the level but upon exiting it says I did not, not awarded the prizes to move on.  Without completing this I can not ask the Civil Corps to go fetch me items if I pay their fee.  I have done levels over and over again without clearing the level.  I only play for the challenge, I would not call this fun.

I continued on to see if anything got better but it did not. I've put in over 50 hrs now.  Guess I'll throw in the towel.  If I do the main missions, I'd have to mine for ore all day for weeks and not have any time to go to meetings, do any events, go fish to make some money to buy property and a decent house which would cost total hundreds of thousands of coins. This game does not give the player a break to enjoy themselves, it's more like a job that is disliked.  Good luck",1629910488,1630280972,False,5,1,0.465497523546218872,0,True,False,False

All the ingredients are there, but it's just a sloppy execution with lots of odd design choices that hobbled its ability to be anything more than a lacklustre Stardew-like.

I put 120 hours in and cleared the main storyline for the sake of it, and the whole time my thought was ""okay, this is bland, but maybe it gets better and I just need to give it some more time"".  It never gets better.  By the end, the only thing keeping me going was the voice in the back of my head telling me ""you might as well, since you've already come this far"".

None of the characters are interesting, several side plots get abandoned or suddenly resolved when they no longer matter, the skill tree is lackluster, the sound design is confusing at times almost satirical, and the pacing of shop upgrades is uneven.  The town development is interesting in theory, but most of the ""development"" is building things that you never use or see, and are basically not even acknowledged by townsfolk, making it a pointless task.  I'd be inclined to think ""maybe I just can't appreciate what they were going for"" if not for the lack of polish apparent in things like spelling mistakes and mismatched audio showing it was the result of messy production.

Everything is there to make a good game, but it was mashed together in a way that fights you from enjoying what it might have been able to offer.

I don't regret playing it, but if someone else is considering buying it, I'd say just play Stardew again with a different farm type.",1630112781,1630112781,False,21,0,0.659625887870788574,0,True,False,False

Ah man, this game is truly lovely. It's an adventurous, builder based, relationship driven extravaganza. Craft your heart out, give gifts and form game changing friendships, fight baddies and mine for goodies. If that stuff is up your alley then there really isn't a way to find this game boring. There are regular calendar events, birthdays, progression based occurrences, and a wonderful main story on top of all the aforementioned activities. Decorate your house, expand your land, buy animals, catch llamas, upgrade your workshop... they've really put effort into making this an immersive experience.

Enjoy if you decide you purchase.",1607295090,1630067261,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has, however, some flaws, such as minor bugs or not well planned progression. If you concentrate too much on side quests, you won't have necessary engrams to continue your journey.

Im will not even try to finish this game because its just not worth it, so many problems, first off, this is not a farming simulator, is more like a deliver guy/chore simulator, you are a ""Builder"" tasked with ""Build"" stuff that people want in order to earn money and rebuild your old grandpa house?
in the meanwhile you will meet the most boring and uninteresting cast of characters along the way. 

The world?:

okay now first, my biggest grip with this game is the world building, or lack off, in games like this you want to feel like you are part of the World, not the World itself, NPC will just teleport whenever they need to be, dissolved and reappear in locations, they have some sense of a schedule but it doesn't matter, you will never, see them go to the place they are supposed to be, for example, you enter the city hall at 8:00 you can be at the entrance, enter and npcs will be already there once you open that door , this happen everywhere, the moment you enter a building you can clearly see how NPC just spawn and start moving, this is a huge issue because it break the immersion of the game.

NPCs:

second, the extremely discrepancy on NPC development, they have perks tied to them, some npcs have 6 others have none, the utility of the perks is incredibly abysmal when it comes to the romance options, some npcs have extremely long quest chains, some others are lucky to even have two quests, it's just horrible, they are already boring characters as it is, spouting the same lines of dialogue, but having this huge discrepancy on their quest, just make them feel like they are not important at all.

The gimick:

Now, the ""building"" part of the game, is nothing but an excuse to complement the ""story"" events, you are basically on a leash, with time limit quest, juggling the crafting aspect of the game with fishing time, because you wont be making any money with the ""building"" part, you will be fishing 95% of the time whenever you want to make money, fishing is incredible profitable out right broken, which is a problem when this game is spouse to be focused on the Building part.

The rest:

The combat, is garbage, the most chunky ass combat, hit boxes are a joke, the visual feed back is the worst I have ever seen, The character perks go from get this first to absolutely useless, very little character costumisation, the voice acting is down right bad, some NPCs sound clear some others sound like in a vaccum, the character models are way off to what they are suppouse to look on the art, I can go on but this too long already, in summary, not a very fun game, very unpolished, and the dev team literally abandon it to move on to their second game, which is incredible considering how much of a shit show this game is, very disappointing.

Do I recommend this game? Yes. Is it the best game ever? No. If you're like me and obsessively play these types of games then this will keep you entertained for hours upon hours. However, with My Time At Sandrock in development, I would recommend putting your cash towards that instead. Portia is a 'finished' game, but there are so many aspects that still feel like Early Access, combat and voice acting being the more obvious ones. 

The combat is easily my least favorite part of this game. It's terribly clunky, it lags in weird places and I don't think it's ever heard of a hit box. 

Audio mixing is questionable, with some sounds being eardrum busting and others being entirely absent. Add this to a poor combat system and the desync of audio cues feels bland. 

Speaking of bland, let's talk story. Main story is... Good to a point. I'll be honest, the majority of it is forgettable after a certain point, and after my third or fourth time through I just stopped actually finishing the main quest. But I get more enjoyment out of doing all the side quests and interacting with the NPC's around Portia, and most friends I know who play say the same. Main story is mediocre, but if you like wholesome and feeling-inducing character stories then you'll enjoy the side quests and developing relationships with them. 

Except for the Hulu brothers. I don't care that they're a reference to a TV show or whatever, their existence just feels like the devs got lazy with creating unique characters so they copy and pasted the same character model with a different color shirt. Two or three would have been fine but there are SEVEN of them. Throw in a pale lady who doesn't know not to accept food from strangers and there you go. Like I said, I was going to be more critical in this update so I'll be blunt: The Hulu brothers concept was funny as a meme, but now it just makes the game look unfinished because they feel like they should be placeholder for better and more unique characters. 

But I don't want to end off on a negative note so I'll say this. Arlo and Gust are my absolute favorites to romance/marry, Ginger is a sweetheart and forever my in game BFF and Remington's voice makes me swoon. 

=====================================================================

Alright, so I've sunk 120+ hours into this game and for good reason. It's good. I enjoyed playing it and genuinely was disappointed when I reached the end of the available story for Early Access. I'll keep this quick and honest if I can.

The world is colourful, the characters are a little weird and endearing and it's funny as hell to watch Arlo bolt out of my house like his pants are on fire to go training with the rest of the Civil Corps in the mornings.

The combat's a bit finicky in tight spaces, especially when you're trying to focus down one enemy and your character is determined that the other one across the room needs a good kick in the teeth, and the dungeon bosses are repetitive. Oh, and it lags. A lot. Thankfully you can eventually commission the Civil Corps to go farming for you, though it takes longer and is pretty expensive, and they don't have access to all the materials I wish they did. 

The game favors certain spouses over others for relationship benefits (and the quintuplets are just the same person and feel more like they're meant to pad out the bachelor numbers). 

You eventually get the ""set it and forget it"" building, aka the factory. While handy for those long lists of materials you just can't be bothered to smelt and cut yourself, at the time of my last playthrough (a few weeks ago) you did not get any crafting EXP from anything made in the factory. Also, it cannot access chests in your farm, and you cannot access materials in the factory via any of the external chests or the Work Table in the yard. It makes using the Work Table a bit of a pain when you have to go fetch materials from your factory to fill simple commissions instantly instead of having to wait a few hours to craft it via the factory.

So do I recommend this game? Yes. Absolutely. Like I said at the beginning, it's good. It has room to grow. I like the vibe, I like (most of) the voice acting. You have a rival you can actually punch, and every morning you can run to his shop to see if there's smelted bars of copper or bronze for you to steal while he's at the Commission Office.",1547561027,1628576681,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

One of my only criticisms of the game is the romance system. There is one character that proposed to me and we got married. Before we had even left the church they were telling me about how terrible of a spouse I was. This baffled me completely. NPCs should not be able to propose until they have enough hearts to not be an unhappy spouse in my opinion. I was so upset by this that I have stopped playing.

This game is not perfect. There are a lot of confusing development choices that I'm sure could have been ironed out if they simply worked on the game a bit longer - it's definitely something that could have spent more time in the oven and that wasted potential will nag at you slightly as you play but there is just, [i]so much to do[/i]. I'm writing this review at 200hrs played and there have been very few days where I was not rushing around with some new goal in mind.

Even now, after beating the game, I am still getting new quests regularly. [spoiler] I was kind of disappointed with how quickly I beat the penultimate quest in the game - but I completed nearly every quest the day that I got it, so I should have expected it. There is a wonderful little photo album sequence at the end which I loved. It uses screenshots taken during gameplay so it even captured a shot from one glitched mission where the lighting bugged and everything was pitch black. [/spoiler]

Should you play the game? Well, the romance isn't that great. [spoiler] The only real romantic story you get you can only get from romancing Emily. [/spoiler] The mount system was lackluster, but there [i]are[/i] a few different mounts. MAJOR SPOILER [spoiler] At the end of the game you get a flying mount which is constantly impeded by the invisible walls which should have been removed as you unlocked each new area. Like, jesus christ, they give you the best thing it the game and you can barely use it (still fun tho). [/spoiler] The game never tells you how to breed fish afaik and the mechanic, like many others in this game, feels incomplete and tacked on. Many of the characters have no personality at all and you barely interact with them. You will never have a reason to tell the 7 brothers apart because maybe 2 of them matter or even have a quest. Was it even seven? Maybe it was six. I can't even tell you.

On the other hand, the mining in this game is so much fun for me. The scanning and terrain deformation mechanic makes it a lot more interesting than mining in most other games like this, and each upgrade to your pickaxe feels like it makes a considerable difference. The fishing mini-game is unique and enjoyable and a perk will allow you to see what you are fishing up so you don't clutter your inventory with junk. The leveling seems fair and the perk system allows you to specialize, and for a fee you can re-spec and focus on something else. The fighting is a bit rough, but there is some strategy involved against the bosses. The game [i]will[/i] present a challenge to you, and you can decide whether to dunk consumables, learn to dodge enemy attacks, or just wait until you're tanky enough to power through.

Many of the characters in town do have great personalities and I've become endeared to several. The town events are great and it actually feels like people are participating and enjoying themselves. The mayor will occasionally give little cutscene speeches during his weekly town halls, the game seems to emphasize taking photos with characters as part of events and play dates and those photos gather in a photo album you can check later. There are tons of great little ideas like this throughout the game; photo frames in your house that can hold screenshots, a billboard that you can put any photo into, and a buff system that encourages you to decorate your house.

You can feel the love in this game. You can also feel the ""crunch"" that the game industry is known for. I am hoping they iron out these things in the next game. If you want a perfect game, stick with Stardew Valley.

If you are a fan of cozy life sim type games (like Story of Seasons, Animal Crossing) then you will love My Time at Portia. It's pretty much like a farming game, but instead of farming you are a mechanical engineer crafting and building new machines for the town. And holy heck the linear story in this is long. It's a grind to get the story to progress, but I do appreciate that the linear story is long. I mean like it just keeps going anf going. My only complaints are that the characters are kind of bland, which makes me not enthusiastic to romance any of them, and the combat isn't very interesting. I love cooking in games, but I was disappointed that the cooking is mainly related to combat buffs instead of stamina boosts, and I largely ignored the combat unless the game requires it for story progression. However, it's only a few small things I didn't like about the game that didn't take away from the overall experience.

Multiple web searches recommended My Time at Portia when I was searching for a new game to lose myself in, but being a fan of Stardew Valley, I thought this was just a 3D rip off of one of my favorite games. I was wrong. While there are definitely similarities to Stardew Valley, My Time at Portia stands apart. 
Here are some of the key differences: 
   MTaP focuses heavily on crafting (you come to town as a new Builder taking over your Pa's old workshop) while SV encourages customized playstyles. Some of my playthroughs I focused on farming crops, other times I went mining all the time, and another one I decided I was a fisherman. In both games players can farm, mine, fish, and craft; however, MTaP uses farming, mining, and fishing as the means to accomplish crafting. This leads me to the next big difference. 
   MTaP is more story driven with deeper characters and more quests. The whole reason for crafting in MTaP is to progress the story. While SV lets you decide your playstyle and how you want your game to go, the open ended nature of the game tends to cause burn-out after a couple in-game years. I have played over 450 hours of SV over about 6 different characters, but the furthest I have gone in-game is Summer of Year 3. Meanwhile, I am currently on my first playthrough of MTaP, I have played 162 hours, but I am only in Fall of Year 2, and there is still an entire section of the map I haven't discovered yet. There are characters I have yet to meet. There is still more story. And I can see myself playing this game over and over again.
   I still love Stardew Valley. It has a simplicity and flexibility that makes each playthrough unique. I have even enjoyed introducing it to my 8 year old. But I am so glad I finally decided to give My Time at Portia a try. The story is engaging, the pacing keeps you motivated, the characters are intriguing, and overall, I highly recommend this game.",1628098796,1628098796,True,57,0,0.860575079917907715,0,True,False,False

I can only assume that is because it only runs about 1/3 of the time I'm ""playing it"". It is only my supremely stupid mulishness that has prevented me from requesting a refund.

That said, it's a pretty fun game. It's still early, so I don't know if I will be penalized for less social interaction, but it has a lot of open world rambling around that I like. And the crafting is wide and rich. I'm not big into fighting, so I haven't even ventured in that direction, but I believe I read it becomes more necessary later. Meh for me, but a boon for you warrior types.

Now, initially, this game was ""sold"" to me as a Harvest Moon/Stardew fan's pick. Turns out, not so much. A lot of burdens are placed on you in this game that take away your individuality and forces you into the specific narrative. Again, it's early (especially considering the crash delays), so I don't know if that eases off, but I would have liked a little more freedom of design and roaming.

The graphics are nicely done, with cute character designs for both humans and creatures. Learning the functionality of the tools and equipment hasn't been too bad so far, with fishing, naturally, being the most sensitive. For some reason, every game wants to turn fishing into a crying game. Have none of these developers ever fished for real? Finding fish is the tough part, not the actual hooking/reeling them in!

I think I have to recommend the game based on my impression that it could be fun if you got to play it, say, for an hour or two continuously. My personal experience would be a ""not recommended"", but I don't think the game crashes are the majority of the purchases, so I'll not skew the ratings.

But, boy, if only I could actually play this game for an uninterrupted length of time. Sigh.

EDIT! And then it worked. Nothing changed in my settings (after changing everything and then changing it back). It just stopped crashing all the time. Still crashes, but now maybe only once a day or even (gasp) once every other day. In any case, playing it more has strengthened my positive feeling about the game (as one could probably guess by my ever increasing hours spent in the game).",1626628298,1627607411,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The real enjoyment comes when you stop worrying so much about rushing through everything.

If you're coming from Stardew Valley, I will say that this is not a farming game. You can plant crops, but it's a very minor part of the game in comparison to everything else.

Not much else to say, if you like life-sim style of games where you craft/mine/explore/fight/build relationships with npcs, there's a good chance you'll enjoy this.

Honestly the mechanics are very similar to stardew valley, but with all of the usual mechanics translated to 3d space, and with wildly different and very fun lore.

[b]TL;DR: If you like unfathomable amounts of resource gathering, this is the game for you. That is all this game offers. There is no engaging story, combat is a joke, animation is very basic, the sound design is terrible, the characters are forgettable, crafting is tedious, decorating is clumsy, and the game crashes an unacceptable amount of times.[/b]

Under no circumstances should you pay full price for this game. I purchased it during the Summer Sale for $10 and I wouldnât recommend paying a penny more. When you load up the game, it says that this is the release state. I assumed that meant it was polished, fully functional, and free of alpha and beta issues one might run into. I assumed incorrectly. The list of the most egregious shortcomings is below.

1) The sound design is remarkably bad. There is no consistency in volume at all. Bird chirp sound clips repeat so quickly and annoyingly that I refused to go into a wooded area after a while. There is a turkey gobble sound effect inside dungeons that plays at 600% volume. Crafting machine sound effects often get stuck on an infinite loop. Voice lines are regularly inconsistent with the text, with some voice actors blatantly saying the wrong words at times.

2) All but a few voice actors are painfully amateur. They sound like theyâre reading from a textbook. Iâm pretty sure none of them were paid. I donât mind the devs giving fledgling voice actors a chance, but almost every single line sounds like it had absolutely no direction and the devs used the very first take of each one. Itâs sloppy. And thatâs when the text is even voiced at all. Half the dialogue doesnât have voice acting for it. Also, Iâm convinced the voice actor for Petra has never experienced an actual emotion in their life.

3) The typos. So. Many. Typos. I cannot fathom how the game got to this stage with this many typos. The first one I ran into I thought was an oversight, so I started a report to drop into their Discord channel. I planned on submitting it once I was done with the main story. But, as the game went on, the typos appeared at an alarming rate. I figured if the devs were fine with publishing their game in this condition, they wouldnât take the time to correct the typos anyway.

4) The main quests are uninspired and derivative, and the pacing of the main story is mind-numbingly slow. Get schematic. Get discs to learn schematic. Wait one to four days to receive mail saying you can make the thing in the schematic. Farm resources. Make the thing. Turn in the thing. Repeat ad nauseum. I spent probably 3 hours playing the vanilla game before I broke down and modded the hell out of it just to see if I could make it to the end. Even then, with over 30 mods, it took 82 hours to finish. And I was rushing it really hard. I know some people might see the length as a positive, but itâs utter torture when the gameplay is this hollow and unrewarding. I honestly thought the game would hit its stride somewhere along the way, but it never did.

5) Every single one of the characters is forgettable. I just finished the game and I could not, for the life of me, tell you what the Mayor's name is. None of them have any endearing qualities, and the game never gives you a reason to bond with any of them. Their identities and backstories are incredibly stale and trite, and I found myself smashing my space bar through any interactions with them. Dates are incredibly mundane and offer nothing but relationship points on subsequent occurrences. There are probably four voice lines total for each character to say on a date, so you can imagine how irritating it is to subject yourself to more than one of them.

6) The combat is clumsy and monotonous. There is no real challenge or sense of danger, which leaves you feeling like youâre deliberately having your time wasted.

7) The crafting is repetitive and unnecessarily convoluted. You need about seven machines scattered across your property just to make one thing. Storage chests are entirely too small. Nothing can be searched for because a search bar doesnât exist. The list of craftable items is not alphabetized, so you have to manually scan the entire thing any time you want to make something. Each item requires subcomponents that have to be made, which are composed of even more subcomponents.

8) [spoiler]You get the most powerful weapon towards the end of the game when you no longer need it. You unlock the factory towards the end of the game when you no longer need it. You can buy the best gear towards the end of the game when you no longer need it. There is zero replayability, so receiving access to these items when you do just feels like a slap in the face.[/spoiler]

9) [spoiler]Pa is an inconsequential skidmark. I thought he was simply going to be used as a contrived way of explaining how you inherited the property in Portia. I did not foresee him coming back at the end just to piss you off, spend zero time with you, and then leave again. I have no idea why he was the crux of the ending. The whole experience with Pa was pointless and his presence in the game only serves to antagonize you. There was no redemption, so  I utterly fail to see the point in him even existing in the game. Seriously, why was he there? The entire main storyline felt aimless as it is. Shoehorning Pa in there at the end was completely asinine.[/spoiler]

If you got this far and youâre wondering why I gave this game two stars instead of one after such a scathing review, itâs because this game has an absurd amount of content for how terrible it is.

 I've changed my review to negative. I've had a lot of fun playing this game in early access, but then it released 
 in a state where I can't give it a positive review. It needed to be optimised a lot better, it still needed balancing to make the grind more enjoyable. (For reference, I don't mind a good grind, I play Runescape...)

They absolutely didn't properly finish the game before moving on to their new ""My time at..."" project. 
Most notably the game is not optimised and lacks voices here and there.

If you like Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon like games, you'll absolutely enjoy this game anyways, so If you can get this game on sale, I'd say do it.",1545380989,1626936059,False,0,0,0.528795838356018066,0,True,False,True

The mechanics aren't exactly straightforward if you're playing it for the first time.

Pros:
1. Structures that you built can be seen throughout the game, and are usable to the player.
2. Interesting NPCs with their own backstory
3. Progressive main story
4. Character customisation
5. Relationships

Cons:
1. You can't save the game until you go to bed (similar with games like Harvest Moon. It can get annoying if you did all the work and there's a sudden crash).
2. Minor bugs, nothing game-breaking

Music: 
[ ] Mute it
[ ] Annoying but can live with it
[â] Soothing and friendly
[ ] Smash the repeat button!

Difficulty:
[ ] excruciatingly hard like Dark Souls

Graphics:
[ ] Eyesore
[ ] Not bad 
[â] Good (more detail would be nice)

Fun:

I will say that I feel somewhat influenced by getting this game for 10$. However I am very much enjoying myself and feel that this is a very nicely made game. 

I will by honest in that there is some minor issues, such as tiny pathing issues with NPCs, dialog that doesn't match the written text, and slightly weird invisible walls.

That being said it has a TON of features I really love. I really like the voice acting, the story stuff is actually pretty interesting,  and the calendar is everything I've ever wanted in a game like this. The game's calendar let's you create reminders and a little alarm goes off to help you remember where you're supposed to be. It's so easy to get tunnel vision (not pun intended) when you off exploring so this feature really helps.

Speaking of tunnels, I really love the Ancient Ruins exploration. It's simple but I really enjoy how I am able to dig any where, and finding relics is actually really fun. It's a good balance of working to get materials and working to find new and exciting things. 

I also do appreciate tho that when I don't want to farm things myself the Civil Corps request feature is really nice. It gives me more time for fishing, which is one of the best fishing mini games I've ever played.

For one, its being sold as a game like stardew valley or harvest moon, but its really not. its way too grindy for that. secondly alot in the game just doesn't make sense. for instance smelting some copper will tell you it takes 5 hours but it means 5 minutes. thats enough to scare any new player off. if its going to take 5 minutes, say 5 minutes. although, I still think smelting 2 copper bars for 5 minutes is too long for a singleplayer game.

my main thing though is how bad the artstyle is. its clunky and ugly and just weird. like they where trying to mix several styles that just don't go together and it all ended up just being stupid and strange looking. the screencaps don't do any justice to how bad it actually looks ingame. along with the character creator options all being mostly terrible. its one of those games where you'll just end up purposefully making the stupidest looking character possible because theres no real way to get a decent one.

I really enjoy being a ""builder"" as the main driving force for gameplay over being a farmer. You can still do farming and raise livestock, but they are a bit more tertiary than building/constructing various machines for the folk around Portia. 

I still find the need to use wiki pages for some things to figure out the progression of gaining recipes/diagrams, but for the most part much less so than I felt I needed to in SDV. 

The world is interesting, the reason for the lower-tech society is pretty neat, and the world is really interesting visually. It's definitely cute and campy, but in a great way that I can appreciate.

** This game can cause motion sickness, due to the lighting and camera speed, i cannot recommend this game be bought for anything other than the PC version, as other console versions do not allow as much ability to change those settings. on the PC version, I was able to toggle the lighting, effects and camera speed so that it no longer caused motion sickness.***

with that out of the way, this game is super fun to play, i went into it not expecting much and im not a fan of some of the models in the game, but overall its a great experience, there is a lot to do, you can farm, build, make friends, date etc. it is also an interesting setting as well (post apocalyptic farming simulator basically)

However, I rate it way below both Stardew Valley and Graveyard Keeper.
To build anything you need to go through many many different lengthy time wasting types of material refinements. The timers are too long and the cost is often too high, which leads to going back and forth between grinding, waiting, searching and time skipping by sleeping. 
You're not free to do whatever you want, since the game pushes timed missions. You're always on a timer and most the things you build are just tools that help you build bigger and better things. I'm not sure about calling the game loops all that fun or rewarding. 
The combat is simple, but okay.
Mining is also fine, but it gets tedious when you start looking for relics for your museum. 
Can't say much about the characters. Aside from looking cute they don't do or say much.
Not much happens story wise, it's merely a string of reasons for you to build new things. Some times these things open up new locations or allow for fast travel, which is pretty good. 
Dungeons are nothing to write home about. They exist so you can obtain rare resources to build new things. 
Music is okay.
Grinding relationship with the townspeople takes way too long and the reward is barely worth it anyway.

It's a decent game to kill time because there are many things you can do, but there are still many very bothersome details.

The game feels unfinished with many technical problems, but that aside, let's discuss other than that.

For example, the eye's highlight on some characters appears as if the artist flipped it, makes the characters look lifeless, and at first, I thought it's alright, it might be the artist's choice, BUT it's NOT, because some character's eyes are not flipped and look so much better. Now I can't play this game without questioning why not do that to all of their eyes then?

You can't swim, so when you walk into the water there will be a black screen, which is okay, but what's not is that you can WALK on the water in the fountain at the center of the city. Why can't there be an invisible wall preventing me from doing so?

My biggest complaints were that it is not user friendly at all, and I felt rushed.  I had to pause the game and look up on the Steam discussion section and/or the Portia wikia to figure out how to do and how to find practically everything.  This is not a game you can play without outside help.  Many times I found myself confused and rushed, suddenly in the middle of a quest I didn't have the needed materials or machinery for.  The game could use a lot more guidance and clarity.  I'm sure I missed a lot of stuff, clueless of what was going on and what I was doing, boggled down and rushed and thus forced to let Higgins have the majority of commissions.
And when the last main quest was complete and I got the credits and overall statistics, I hadn't had a chance to do a lot of basic things yet, like completely upgrade my house and yard, explore all the ruins, and make BFFs.  I know you can continue playing, but with the overall statistics, it's like you were supposed to have accomplished more by that time.  And I rushed as it was.
Anyway, it was a very fun game, and the second playthrough should be better now that I have done tons of research thanks to the helpfulness of others.  Still gonna play at my own pace, though.  And I still have a lot to complete in this first one even though the main quest storyline is ended.

I really enjoy the mining mechanics (3D mining! Jetpacks!) and the fact that there is some personalization of NPC interactions, like being able to play rock paper scissors or spar with them depending on their personalities. And the character designs are so, so fun. 

A few qualms:
* The animals you need to kill to get resources are TOO cute, it's hard to want to kill them
* I had to turn down my settings quite a lot on my laptop to get the game to play. It's still a beautiful game, but runs sluggishly on my system at times and has crashed a couple times, which is frustrating in a game where you can only save by ending the day and going to sleep!

I see it most often recommended as being similar to those games and aesthetically it is, as far as socializing w/ the villagers it is, but the overall flow of the game is radically different imo. Note: If you are coming at this because you really like heavy crafting focus, disregard the rest of the review bc you'll probably enjoy this.

The biggest issue for me is that whereas other games in the subgenre are more ""relaxation games,"" Portia is much more heavily story driven, constantly presenting you with new missions that involve grinding materials and putting them through multi-step, time consuming refinement processes. Where the farming sims are much more about open ended seasonal flow and flexibility, Portia is regularly springing new tasks on you that you can't necessarily prepare for in advance unless you read the wiki to know what missions are coming up. Not all of these missions are time sensitive (although some are or some begin to be after you have started them) but they do often create narrative pressures to complete them, ie. a relatively early game mission involves the town water being polluted and NPC dialogue all focuses on that, people mention being sick, etc. which contrasts with the ""at your own pace"" nature these games normally take. The crafting itself is a matter of tastes mechanically; I feel that the long timers on material refinement generally disrespect the player's time, the limitation of one large project at a time keeps you from expanding your refinement (furnaces, etc) at the same time you're working on the bigger mission projects, and most of the crafted objects themselves feel as though they have just a few more components beyond what is reasonable. If you do focus on completing the missions it will also frequently be difficult or impractical to actually engage in the socializing aspects of the game, and many villagers will also require crafted gifts to befriend which gets in the way of crafting for the main missions.

All that is to say, if you come into the game expecting a relaxing flow of the games this is most often compared to, it may disappoint you. If a heavy crafting focus sounds good then you may enjoy it. I do have a few other issues with the game, though.

The more egregious mechanical issue is the mini game fascination the game has, especially in socializing. To optimally increase relations with someone in town, you will have to talk to them and give them gifts as expected from a game of this sort, but also included are the option to play Rock Paper Scissors, a rather tedious and time consuming game that of course is entirely RNG. There's also a ""spar"" option that you can do up to three times a day, with each match taking about a minute with loading times and all, for a small number of relationship points. The dates that you can go on with the villagers are also minigame-heavy but at least feel like distinct events and happen less frequently; the socializing minigames feel completely superfluous and disrespectful of the player's time, like something you'd see in a mobile game.

The game's systems emphasize combat a fair bit, but mechanically, the combat is very poor. Hit detection is pretty dodgy at times, and attacks will either stun or not stun enemies (or the player) seemingly at random. Dodging feels inconsistent, and the dungeons also have some platforming challenges that the controls are not really suited to. I don't blame a game like this for not having super tight controls or hit detection but I do think the degree to which combat factors into the game is strange given how mechanically weak the combat systems are.

The last issue I have is less mechanical than experiential; the sound design for the game is all over the place. For the most part, sound is pretty good for a game with this budget and I definitely won't hold against them the fact that some of the voice acting has issues with audio quality or poor direction- it's better as a whole than some AAA games like Oblivion. What I do think is a bit of an issue is the instances of random times where there is no audio dialogue in the midst of an otherwise voiced scene, which is quite a bit more jarring and seems to largely be random. 

By far the worst aspect of the sound design, though, occurs in the dungeon areas of the game. As what I can generously call a clumsy way of increasing difficulty, certain rooms will spawn a new set of enemies on top of (or behind you) immediately after clearing them of their initially spawned mobs. As a design decision I find that annoying, but what's much worse is the truly inexplicable decision to have these new monster spawns announced by a stock turkey gobble sound effect (you know the one; you're hearing it in your head right now), turned up to the point you can hear the wav form clipping, played at 2-3x the volume of the rest of the game. 

Like, seriously. Why would you do that? Why a turkey gobble? Why so loud? Why clipped out when the stock sound effect isn't clipped (and it is definitely a stock, freebie sound)? I simply do not understand. 

All told, I've got about 30 hours in the game, which got me about 3/4 of the way through Year One. I've spent most of that time (and to be fair to the developers, it is a significant chunk of time to stay engaged with a game even if it was very frustrating) hoping it would get good, hit its stride, become the game I've been told it was by the people who've recommended it to me based on my other gaming interests. But at this stage in the game, I've simply decided that is not going to happen; or if it does, it won't be until I complete the story, which I don't appear to be anywhere close to finishing. It's possible this game simply isn't for me, but I feel like I am not the only Stardew/Harvest Moon fan who has been recommended this but won't like it, so I wanted to say my piece after sinking tens of hours into the game and giving it a truly fair shot. I hope the sequel is better, although I'd have liked to see this get more polished and cleaned up before the developers moved on to a new game.

If nothing else, I hope they patch that damn gobble.",1625887676,1625887676,False,56,5,0.647610187530517578,0,True,False,False

This game is littered with graphical glitches, miss-matching dialogue text & voice lines, occasional crashes/freezes, and a horrific frame-rate issue. So, if you decide to get this game, please know that going in.

I knew and expected these issues going into the game, thus it wasn't a particularly big deal to me (only the frame-rate issue caught me off guard, which can be annoying sometimes). If anything, I found the glitches & strange dialogue to be amusing and oddly charming- and charm is certainly something this game has in abundance. The unique art-style grew on me, as did the wonderful array of unique characters. I was sucked into this world and found myself playing for hours on end just to find out what came next! There is an abundance of story line events, random events, character interactions, and random collection missions to keep the player busy at all times. Alternatively, you can build up your own workshop, decorate your house, build barns & coops, and even farm (although the farming system is not nearly as extensive as the likes of Stardew Valley or Harvest Moon). 

Additionally, I cannot emphasise enough how delightful these characters are! The members of the Civil Corps immediately caught my attention, and being able to witness and interact with their pre-established dynamic was incredibly fun and engaging- it made the world feel like it was alive outside of my own presence. As a personal aside, I grew up playing Harvest Moon DS, so certain NPC designs and music sound tracks hit a nail in my nostalgia. Though certain tracks do grow stale over time, they are all varied and overall pleasant to listen to.

.. and then I ran across a few persistent pet peeves:

1. I really don't like the play/date system. It's a more immersive way to date and get to know people, but after  while you're just doing the same actions to get a rep boost because the NPCs will awkwardly hang out in front of your workshop to get you to go out with them, *even after you are romancing someone*

2. Speaking of that, the comission system. It checks only by rep, not by any other method, so if you do anything to accelerate the rep rewards, because, for example, you might think the game loop is so *slow*, it will start giving you missions that you cannot hope to complete, leading you to check the wiki every morning. 

Good design, that.

3.  You will occasionally run across missions where you have to turn down someone hard because the devs thought it'd be a nice touch to have unskippable romance missions. Yes, even while you're engaged to someone. ? ? ? ?

4. So grindy and slow. I don't get it. It feels like that the game builds in longevity (like there's a *year 11 event*) by slowing everything down, rather than being organically paced.

Occasional crashes and instability noted (like there's always a lag going into a cutscene, I've noticed), but that's far less annoying than the design issues.


ETA: Honestly, I'd prefer to rate this a ""depending on your taste"", and neutral. From what I've seen, Sandrock has fixed some of this.

Well I was busy playing, and steam failed me by not going ""Hey Elko my man you seem to enjoy this game, why dont you take the opportunity to write an small review... and get some help with your addiction"". 

Jokes on them, cuz I can stop anytime I want...

Anyway... this game can achieve two major goals, and in my experience can satisfy two types of players. 

The first type is the obvious one... the one who enjoys Stardew Valley, and the likes. You can enter a hassel free world, where nothing is more important or pressing than what you deem it to be. Take your time to enjoy the beautiful landscape, the (mostly) quirky people of Portia, do the activities you like, advance the main story, fight enemies, crawl dungeons and do it all at your own pace.

The second type is the player who wants to be as efficient as possible to beat Higgins as fast as possible, and when he is properly trashed from the leaderboards you might as well continue this awesome path. You begin to plan your layout of your production area, the use of stamina, your character build when you level up, your intake and output of resources and who of the poor people of Portia can be a means to an end and who is not worth your time.

Buy the game and try it out of you can see yourself in the examples mentioned above, and you should have a good time regardless. Even if you dont deem yourself one of the mentioned types, you just might become either after your time at Portia ;)

Pretty much everything in this game was made to be ""good-enough for now I guess"". Even though it's released, in reality this is still an early access title. You know, for example, half the time character have voices and the other half they are silent. Or at random the cutscenes don't have any audio. Or enemy models completely dissapear mid-fight. Or the seasonal events don't start and you have to reset the day. Or you find an interesting item only to find out on wiki that it literally doesn't do anything and is a left over from something.
Nothing in MTAP will ever be fixed or changed because the game is already abandonded (the developer is working on a sequel at the very moment). And no, this game is not like Stardew Valley, not only is it and insult to SV to call it that, but also the core gameplay is different.

The last quest of the game perfectly summarises it in it's entirety: You have to spend a lot of time to gather a large amount of materials to build a boat. Then wait like a week and do nothing in the meantime (there is nothing to do late game, I was ending the days at 10-12AM!). And then the grand reveal! You unlocked an ability to ride the boat in a janky, 3-second long cutscene. Aaand... that's all you get. Congratulations.

The only problem I have is, first; sorting the items is taking quite some time, and the 'sort' option is not really helpfull. I am using the controller here. 
Second is the world is too daymn big, on the other hand it is fun to explore but with given stamina, for starter it is quite difficult, you'll end up forced to slept outside almost everyday.  XD
Third, please give option 'save' in menu, almost every farming game nowadays don't save only when sleeps. It's quite troublesome when to fight Boss Battle after discovering key item, and you end up lost the battle.

The biggest issue is the movement and combat. My expectations weren't high since this is a life sim but the controls really feels terrible, the combat is also very basic.
I like the game's visual style, it's what got me to buy the game in the first place but the characters look kinda bad. The faces are pretty uncanny, characters with very cartoonishly shaped heads and tiny eyes just don't work. Along with the voice acting/dialogue sounding unnatural with the occasional audio errors.

Pros:
- The art style grows on you, sorta.
- The characters have some depth once you start getting into it.
- The world is open and really lovely to run through
- The alpacas are cute

Cons:
- Most of the characters are walleyed af. 
- Your character controls like Sora in Kingdom Hearts 1 but if he had a stroke.
- The fighting system is janky and easily cheesed.
- So is the dueling system.
- Some areas are just, invisible walled off for some reason?
- EVERY SINGLE THING TAKES [i]AGES[/i] TO FINISH. Like, actual, in real life hours for one thing. It's SO boring.

I went it expecting a spiritual successor, and all I got was this lousy t-shirt and a test in patience. I put up with it for a full 16 hours which is a pretty fair amount of time to give any one game to make an impression. 

Everything in this game takes time. It's slow as hell. To craft a thing you need, you need to craft three other things and all of those things need to sit and cook for full in game days at a time. God forbid you neglected to build multiple of the same crafting stations as well, because then you'll be wandering around wondering what to do next for even longer. 

I play these games for the characters and romance options, but I honestly couldn't tell you a single thing about that because 16 hours later and I've only barely reached 2 hearts with my bachelor of choice. It takes AGES. Not to mention, but they have barely any dialogue. You'll hear the exact same line from them for days at a time. I'm sure they have more as you get to a higher relationship level with them, but I don't have another 100 hours to commit to trying to reach the marriage stage. At least, not with the rest of the game play being as slow and dull as it is.

The graphics and music are nice, controlls as well. The story is also quite nice, even though it isnot necessarily the focus of the game. You have a lot of freedom in what you want to do and which quest you want to work on. Some have time limits but they grant fairly long times to get things done.
The game is impressive in the character creation already and part two (My time at Sandrock) did even go into more depth in this regard. I also love that you can date the characters in Portia and eventually start a family with them. After 117 hours into the game I am still far from completing it (even though I am nearing the end of the main quest-line) and will continue to play for a good while longer.

Positive:
-Fun Crafting system.
-The Townspeople.
-World shaped by your creations.
-Surprisingly engaging grind for materials.
-Phyllis.

Negative:
-Jankiness.
-Frame Drops.
-Lack of Quality of Life.
-The Bugs.
-Some Uneeded Animations (Petting animals, for example--takes too long)
-Very Basic Farm aspects.

I wrote this as a celebration of the upcoming My Time game, and I've played the demo--it's good, especially compare to this one.

The combat is stiff and can be unresponsive. Yet despite all these flaws the game still have its good sides, like the fun crafting systems, how the world shaped by your inventions, the characters, and Phyllis--god bless you nurse, and I enjoyed my time with it.

This game is a life sim game that has several permutations of quite interesting aspects such as building, farming, fishing, hunting and others. But I personally think this game is very focused on the supply chain of the many available resources.

The atmosphere behind this game also feels very lively, I am very happy with the back sound of this game. The style of the images in the game also has its own charm.

The story is very interesting even though with a simple plot but it is very worth following. I really like some of the plot twists even on the extra quests, very unpredictable and have a lot of meaning.

Story progress in game really makes a difference in the game, it classify the term of game from native, medium and advanced technology, of course because this game focus is on production not farming.

My favorite turning point is after the event when the harbor is created. Its feel like a mind blowing of concept of game changing, but there is something uneasy about logic, behavior and result, but its still seems like a boom turning point of game.

The thing I don't like is that sometimes there is a glitch when vs monster, using some items make fps down and I think the developer can give some thought about the technology but anyways all of them is minor.

my time at portia captures a charming sense of community not dissimilar to stardew valley! numerous NPCs and even a rival that you can get closer with and, if you want, romance. the city of portia itself has a lot of culture built into it, with seasonal festivities that are always fun to partake in :) it gives you a fun break from the sometimes repetitive gameplay of farming resources and fulfilling commissions.

it's often compared to stardew valley, and rightfully so! not in a bad way though, just that they're same same but different! portia focuses much more on crafting and building, rather than farming and produce like in stardew. otherwise they're not too dissimilar, and if you like to play one then I recommend you play the other!

probably the best thing about this game is that it has a lotttt of content, it takes a while to reach endgame. tbh though, after completing all the quests it's kind of boring to keep playing. for me, post-endgame is not really enjoyable so i've stopped playing portia. the time i had playing it was truly truly fun though! portia is a game well-worth playing!!",1624248642,1624248642,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So i decided to step back from the game and give the devs time to maybe solve this issue.

For some reason, the fix is to install the game on an SSD instead of an HDD. Which to me, anyway, seems like a really silly and honestly, nonsensical fix since it requires a specific piece of hardware to fix the issue rather than putting out a fix to the actual software. it IS, however, the recommended course of action and it did fix the issue after doing so now that i have the capability to install it on a SSD, and since SSD's are becoming the normal hardware now its honestly going to become a non-factor in the future, so take that gripe as you will i guess. Im not a software developer so im not even sure a fix to the actual software was possible, so i have to give the benefit of the doubt.

If you love to start a game and be absolutely overwhelmed with all of thing things there are to do, then this is the one for you. The best modern comparison is to Stardew Valley (though this is 3D, so possibly more similar to the older Harvest Moon games in that regard), but with a bigger emphasis on crafting, plot, quests, and dating. I enjoy how the plot and story lines push you in the direction you need in regards to crafting progression. The relationship system is also very interesting! As you gain relationship with one character, you also gain relationship with their friends and family, who regard you higher by proximity, which is an interesting strategy. The dating system takes preparation and is much more interactive than just giving gifts. The dialogue for the townsfolk changes as the plot progresses, which makes it continuously interesting and updated! 

The only downside to this game is that it has some visual and audio bugs. You may notice that the voiceover in the opening scene is bugged to cut itself off. That is frustrating, but i have yet to have a bug that majorly affects my gameplay more than a slight annoyance or extra wait.

The only issue I had was running the game made my computer sound like it was getting ready to be shot into space and I have a pretty decent computer.  My husband plays too, he also has good computer, and he was getting crashes all the time when he played.  His solution though was easy, since he was already modding* the game he added in the Save Anytime mod and turned on the option to autosave every time a new area is entered, so now when he crashes he doesn't care as much.
Not a perfect method, but it's a weird situation when I never crash and he can crash a few times in a couple hour playing session.  Oh and his computer played the game and was as soft as a purring kitten.  Anecdotal yes, but morale of the story is YMMV and give it a shot if the game play is at all interesting to you.

*So the reason for modding (aside from the old Skyrim adage of 'thou hast to mod it til it breaks', you don't even want to see the hours I've got in that and SSE, edited to add that I totally forgot how many hours I had in ESO, goodness) is that we both played the game a few years ago, my achievs say 2018 so that's what I'm going with, but anyway he said the pressure associated with not having enough time or stamina in a day was not fun (which I get, when playing for fun and no stress, time and stamina management are a pain and not a joy).  My husband had been watching me play again from the beginning and I finished the main storyline, it struck his interest enough he stopped playing his other game and started playing this one with mods. I noticed there was an achievement I missed which was to not use the vending machine in the deepest ruin for 50 levels.  I was pretty annoyed since using it didn't help me get to 50, I just used it because it was there.  Well I enjoyed the game enough that I decided to add mods too and load up my save from 2018 so I could get back up to where I needed to get my achievement. 
(Almost there too!  So close I can see the evil gleam of the vending machine! I'm not sure why not using it is even an achievement, especially when using it[i] eats [/i]achievements. Maybe I just figured it out and it was all a ruse to get us achievement junkies to play again! Or just rewarding those who took the time to read the achievements, it's not even hidden, I have no excuse.)",1623893925,1623894877,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
[*] Detailed and polished systems and world
[*] Lore rich
[*] Breathtaking environment
[*] Good, catchy music and solid voice acting
[*] Compelling, yet simple story. Easy immersion without tons of reading.
[*] Child friendly.
[/list]

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
[*] Time system creates one significant stressor in an otherwise stress-free game. 
[*] Crafting and progression can get complex quickly.
[*] Graphics are a little dated and cartoony. Fits the genre, but not for everyone.
[*] Gets quite grindy with fetch/build quests.
[*] A bit on the simple side of gaming... though that might be entirely the point of it.
[/list]

Overall, this is a really unique gem of a game. While on its cover it looks like a 3D take on Stardew, it's really a lot more than that once you dive into it. The spelunking and adventuring activites add an immense layer of depth to the game that - coupled with the 3D perspective and graphics - creates a really immersive and fun experience for gamers of all ages.

The game's production quality is of a rare level that we just don't see anymore. This game is polished, largely bug free, and has a lot of obvious refinement and care put into it. The graphics, while a little dated and un-optimized, do create a beautiful game world to play around in. The music and voice acting are very much on point as well, adding a layer of characterization that I wasn't expecting.

This is a solid 9/10 game. It's not an earth shattering gaming masterpiece and it's not a game for absolutely everyone, but it is a very cute game that absolutely drips with quality. Anyone who is growing accustomed to the half-finished garbage heaps that developers pass off as games these days might appreciate the sheer ""completeness"" of this game.",1623615831,1623615831,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Imagine a Harvest Moon game set in the Fallout universe, with more crafting and less grit, and you've probably got a good start.
MTaP is an RPG crafting sim, with some light combat elements thrown in, which sounds far less engaging than it actually is.
Unlike most similar(ish) games, it also allows you to proceed at your own pace.  While it does have a linear main storyline/quest series, you can 'pause' this any time you want for as long as you want to focus on other things (as long as you're not on one of the few timed main missions).  The caveat is that the main story is how you unlock new areas and their associated resources/recipes/characters, which is how the game encourages you to actually progress the story, but its never pushy about it.  You can also go ahead and finish the main story and then just do whatever (there is post- endgame content, as well).
About the only fault I have with MTaP, and its not a big one, is that while you can play your character any way you want and run your workshop any way you want, all of the missions - main, and side - are very much on rails, with very specific ways to progress and complete them, which cuts down on replayability.
Replays are mostly just to see what a different spouse is like (although with the divorce/remarriage mechanic you could technically see all of them in a single playthrough) and optimizing your play to thoroughly thrash Higgins at every opportunity.",1623028364,1623028364,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yep, this is a pure rival for Stardew Valley. A lot of activities are the same or similar (assume it's common for most of life sims). But even then you eventually get tired of Stardew Valley or Sims4 - and in that case you got in Portia old beloved ingredients in new mixture.

Yep, it has some unfinished mechanics like cooking (hate it so much grrr), and embarrasses you by kaleidoscope of these mechanics in debute. But if you are not a no-life geek, going to spend two or three hudred hours in Poria in a row, variety of activities doesn't allow you to get bored.

Yep, it's not a top high graphics - but it is warm and cute, forming a kind mood along with the music.

Game is not any hardcore - you won't get punished seriously for any fail.

Game has a lot of interesting storylines, smoothing over grind needed sometimes.

I can say that this game will be the best pair game with Stardew or Sims, and lifesim lovers will like it a lot. Game, thank God, has no ingame monetization, and it truly worth its price.

Pros:

- Has game speed settings for those who want to play each day slower or faster
- You are able to hide helmet and accessories in settings menu
- You unlock a mission where you can transfer armor stats to any aesthetic clothing of your liking
- If you rushed your character creation, you unlock a mission for facial surgery (but no vocal alterations)
- You unlock a barber shop by completing a mission
- There is same gender romancing and marriage 
- You are able to have children after marriage
- You can go on playdates
- You can spar with NPCs
- Ingame camera selfies and photo album
- There are adoptable cat and dog you can eventually call your own after building a bond
- Mounts become available for purchase, rent and tameable after completing missions

- Mining caves are available but cost money to access
- Dungeons with mobs for collecting dropped materials 
- There is fishing and fishing spots
- Tavern with a little arcade inside
- Fun seasonal events with seasonal decor
- Decorate your farm yard and home interior
- You can continue playing even after the main storyline credit has finished

Cons:
- Characters look a bit disproportionate 
- Once you have children, they never grow up. They stay babies forever.
- You cannot swim in any of the water, ever!
- NPCs have repetitive interaction responses
- Less about harvesting crops and livestock, more about workbench item productions
- Some items are not properly explained in tooltips
- NPCs will often have mouth movements for another NPC's dialog

In fact I put this gameplay up with Stardew on fun factor. Farming isn't as important since you're a builder. You have rival, and you can get married and fight etc. 
The only reason this game isn't top tier is that I finished the ""game"" in a year and a month of gameplay. By the time you get all the nicest gear and go to the effort to get the best items, befriend everyone, and find everything there is to do (completionist style) there's nothing to do. You barely use the end game material, there's no point in having the end game weapons and there is no post game content other than a few little bits you may have missed. There's no point in spending years in game. Yes, you can put off the main missions and postpone beating your rival as he starts out with a ton of points in the first year. However the game seems rushed and unfinished an a way. I felt unsatisfied trying to complete the museum (which you can't really do as certain items aren't in the game according to the wiki). It felt like a chore finishing the big dungeon just to get a useless weapon. The only DLC is costumes which I'm not about to pay for. 
Despite them doing a new game, I really hope they add more post game content as there is so much more that could be done with Portia. I hope they flesh out Sandrock a lot more. 
Oh, and some quests don't seem to work right if you get them too early. I know they are still working on finishing all the voice acting which gives me hope they will add more, but since they are working so hard on Sandrock, I can only hope there is more ""Portia"" story to follow inside of Sandrock as some questions are left un-answered. 
Despite all this, the game is worth a go. Especially on sale. I paid full price, yet still feel like I got my moneys worth in one playthrough and I plan to do another to get more character stories via marriage and hopefully slow down the progress to get quests to work properly. Also the available bachelors kinda stink and only a couple will help around the workshop. Considering where the devs are from, it may be cultural as all the women characters all pretty much help with the work. Just a bit of standard sexism in a game.
The game is still lots of fun and I couldn't put it down until I finished and realized the completionist stuff was a slog.",1622082139,1622082139,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The more I play the better it gets and is quickly climbing the ladder of my top games. The graphics modeling is very well done and I love the main storyline, but it was the game play that hooked me.

It feels like a 3D version of Stardew Valley, and I'm a big fan of that game. Yes, I know what your thinking, but Stardew Valley is a farming game and Portia is a crafting/building game, they aren't the same. Yes but the game play have quite a few similarity's.

Both have, Fishing, chatting and gifting to slowly increase relationships with townsfolk,  animal husbandry, fighting and mining ores in mines and ruins, Town buildings being rebuilt, Townsfolk wanting gifts and monthly events. And that is just some of the similarity's.

Now I do have some minor issues with the game. I didn't like the beginning character customization. It works, but I just didn't like the way it was done. Personal choice. The voice acting, well at times its fine other times it sounds awful and there are a few translations that are wrong. I have had a few crashes, (All when trying to use the Assembly station) a bug where a person I was talking to, disappeared then reappeared after I was done talking. I was running back to my shop when the running sounds stop for a period of time. But nothing that was game breaking. And yes sometimes the crafting does get repetitive at times.

Overall if you love Stardew valley or if you love building and crafting games then I highly recommend this game. 9/10

This game reminds me of a mix between Stardew Valley and Slime Rancher.  
Tons of characters and things to do in this game, even though some people say it lacks content.

There's a lot of missions to do and sometimes, I'll be honest, I'll become overwhelm with how many missions you can take on at a time.
Building in this game is fun but can also be tedious.  The items and resources you need for builds are literally everywhere.  Looking for the materials you need to complete a build will have you go on an adventure of your own and sometimes it'll be fun gathering them, imo.

Keep in mind, this game does have quite a bit of bugs.  Nothing that will affect gameplay (from my experience), but there's some silly ones where NPCs will float or clip through a chair or a wall. 

Just like other fans of Portia, I'm also looking forward to Sandrock.  I think it's worth playing this game while we wait for the release of Sanrdock.

So much content, so many quests, so many mini-games, and SO SO much storyline and character development. I was looking for my next fix after Stardew Valley, Garden Paws, and Littlewood. This was it. 

Some initial turn-offs, and why I'm glad I gave it a chance anyway: 

- The cutesy, family-friendly vibe. There are deeper themes and subtexts for the adult gamer, too. The post-apocalyptic setting is poignant and thought-provoking without being gritty or interfering with my desire for a relaxing game. And, as with Stardew Valley, the artistic style grew on me as I got absorbed in the rich content.
- At first, the dialogue seems limited and the characters seem almost rude. Don't worry; there's a complex and robust relationship-building system. You'll get an unbelievable amount of dialogue variation, unexpected events, and cutscenes as you befriend more characters. I highly recommend using the wiki to determine gift preferences, though, because the system is genuinely challenging and random guessing wastes a ton of time and resources.
- Character movement is slow; it gets better. I don't have a great graphics card, and could probably scale down the settings to avoid any lag. But in the first few weeks in-game you feel like you're running in slow motion and getting tired every ten seconds. You'll quickly have opportunities to get gear and skill points that give you more stamina. Later (by the second month of the game) you can build a transport system and mounts.

Overall, this game has the relaxing but oddly absorbing quality of Stardew Valley and similar games, but with a larger world to explore and way more developed characters. It also has a steeper learning curve, and you'll rely more on the wiki as there are some high-stakes interactions that are hard to figure out on your own. It has all the complexity of more serious RPGs, but with a mood that relaxes and entertains rather than making me depressed or anxious.",1621465265,1621465265,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is filled with bugs, both game-ending and merely annoying, and after YEARS of patience from the players, the devs don't seem to have any intention of fixing them. The game will crash randomly all over the place, and the mission event system hardly functions at all. So even if you manage to get through a single game day without a crash, you may discover (days or weeks later) that the mission system isn't actually doing anything anymore. Finished and failed missions will still show up on your map, many missions will simply be impossible to complete because it won't recognize the events, and after a while you'll simply stop getting any new missions at all. Usually happens before the end of the first year, but sometimes it will happen before you've even cleared out the haunted cave. And again, even getting that far is a maddening chore, since the game crashes frequently, and every time it does you lose that day's progress. After playing the same day SIX FREAKING TIMES, for the fiftieth dang time, I simply don't want to play anymore. Especially when I know my progress will eventually end because of the mangled missions anyway. They've been collecting crash reports for TWO YEARS and they still haven't been able or willing to fix the problem.

I was finally inspired to write this review after the latest dev log boasted about new voice acting, and all the cool features they're adding to THE SEQUEL, instead of fixing this game.

The cat has a single, grating, low-quality sound file.

The biggest turn-off for this game is the controller support. The layout deviates in places that have become standard (A is exclusively for interactions while B is jump instead of the other way around), and you have no option to change it around to be proper. On top of that, I found myself having to reach over to the mouse several times during the character creation since certain menu elements had either buggy or missing input from the controller (the box inside the color wheel requires the mouse to do anything with it and the character options, such as the hair and face choices, could not be selected after moving away from the option without moving to another tab and coming back or, again, using the mouse.)",1621340791,1621341052,False,2,0,0.516807794570922852,0,True,False,False

It is placed in post-apocalyptic world where Earth have recovered from humanity's action, but reshaped forever by the great war that occurred in the past. And you take up a role of a Builder, someone who's job is to delve into darkest corner of Earth revisiting humanity's old era to collect salvages to use it to build the future, and bring towns up to better state.

Now this game is not in any way, really similar to Stardew valley, or usually Harvest Moon series in lot of sense. My Time At Portia is a craftsman focus, where most of your income, and focus are intensely crafting-based. You do not throw down seeds, and farm then call it a day as you would do in Stardew Valley. Your job is more nuanced, and clearly demanded by the Portia town. Most of your money will come from crafting multiple items, and selling them to vendors in the town. Sometimes from doing contracts given to you by Commerce guild which your character automatically joins as expected of his role to become a Builder.

The game have very clear story-telling, and the world is impacted by your actions, if not as well impacted by your competitive rival who will occasionally steal some of your work to progress the story further for you. Certain area will change because you've donated resources, or installed items that made impact upon that area. Certain missions will unlock special features, or access to new area or system that wasn't originally intended for access in early hours of your gameplay.

There are few things i will talk about before proceeding to the story completely.

[b]Crafting[/b] One of the best thing about My Time At Portia is that you do not have to worry about crafting materials, they are all automatically drawn into your furnace/workstation/cutter/grinder/etc with exception of Assembly station, unfortunately requiring you to find the material you threw into the chest hand-by-hand. Luckily the game provides you the auto-sort button which is located on right-hand side of the screen beneath your inventory which automatically stack the items from your inventory into ONE chest that holds the item, reducing the clusterness of your chests overall, preventing 5 incomplete stack of wood taking up slots.

[b]Combat[/b] Unlike some more causal sim-like game (Comparing Stardew Valley, Harvest Moon, Staxel, etc), Combat is surprisingly a \heavy\ focus in My Time At Portia. While you may be gathering a lot of materials, and crafting for the residents of Portia, you will also be fighting quite a lot. There will be time where you spend more days fighting than you spend more days mining in a month. This is because My Time At Portia have more stuff going on resorting to combat, and not often hammering a wall.

[b]Activities[/b] You do have quite a bit of activities, but most of them are not related to calendar. Which is saddening, but expected. Monthly events are scarce, and often have something interesting. But while that is a downer, you do have other activities that isn't on the calendars. You have Game-room, Haunted Cave, Sparring people, Rock/Paper/Scissor, Cross Five (Gomoku) with one NPC, Play/Date minigames, Weekend inspections (Checking flaws of products turned in), and attempting to reach 100th floor in one of dungeon. And of course, fishing.

[b]Romances/Relationship[/b] As in any life-sim game. There is definitely romance choices, and they are DEFINITELY hard. Certain characters are hard to please [spoiler]Ginger, Gale, Merlin[/spoiler], while other are fairly easy to please because you can engage in play/date with them which is fast way to increase friendship with them. You currently have 18 male characters (12 if you removes 6 brothers), and 10 female characters. Massive spoiler ahead, hover at your risk: [Spoiler]By completing the long story chain, and creating the plane. If you're married, or planned on romancing Ginger, she will die *Five* years after the final story mission is complete. But she can survive every season with your help pass 5th year if you do Xu's Mission every once a Season. It is fairly easy to make five therapy lights {Requires 5 copper coil, and 5 glass reduced by having full Artisan skill in Crafting tree}, but eventually you will forget about the mission and she will die regardless.[/spoiler]

Finally,

[b]Story[/b] The game's storyline is long, and quite most of it involves in your job as a builder. The story is not fully timed, but there is few segments where it is timed before another builder auto-completes it for you. There is only ONE achievement that is easily missable, it is advised to check the guide and see what achievement you're most likely to miss if you aim to get at least decent achievement %s. 

Unlike some games, you do not pick a side with anyone [b]At all[/b]. While you may be believing that you have to pick the Nature stalwart religion, called the Church of the Light who is religiously anti-technology, and have firm belief that technology will bring down humanity once again, and the technology-researching faction, the Research center who is homebased in Vega 5. Again, you do not pick a side. You're a neutral party, in the Commerce guild. Your entire job is to just progress society, and build. While the Church of the Light will get upset with you on various of things, they will actually express no real ill-will toward you. Well, that is if you [spoiler]get a firearm, and fire it[/spoiler], in which you'll only incur a small friendship penalty but that's nothing.

The game is finished, and they're porting the game to consoles, and bugfixing few things but they're now officially working on second game of the My Time Series, known as My Time At Sandrock.

It reminded me a lot like Story of Seasons, Rune Factory and Stardew Valley. But unlike those games, My Time at Portia focuses on building items instead of farming.

I played the most recent patch (October, 2020) and I have to say, I applaud the devs for being o hardworking. I remembered when the game has nothing much in it in the beginning. As time goes on, the devs keep adding more and more stuff that sometimes I can't keep up. There's also something addicting about building the items, even though they're simple.

One big turn off though, is the voice acting quality (English version). Sometimes, you can hear the difference in quality. Presley's, for example, has good voice quality when he greeted you, but there's also a part of his dialogue in his greeting that sounded as if he's been recorded with a lower quality mic. That's the part where first main impression is important, and yet that happened...

Others, like story quest of Dr, Xu/Antoine's, has different dialogue-text than the voice recorded. I reported it to devs, and they responded, but I'm not sure if they've fixed that. There's also cut-scenes that are unvoiced, especially the new ones the devs added. While you can turn off the option of not having voice in the menu, I prefer to play this game with the voice on.

Being a huge fan of farm/life sim games, I loved My Time At Portia.  It has a huge cast of lovable characters, a long main story, many side quests, and plenty of charm.  New quests, commissions, play dates, and festivals seem to crop up daily.  There's a lot of content to keep the player busy.  

I must admit that, while I love it, the game is not perfect.  Some lines of dialogue are not voiced.  It's not a big deal, but it is a bit jarring when a cut scene is totally silent.  Some mechanics are not totally fleshed out.  I'm pretty sure fainting has no penalty whatsoever.  Unfed animals will never die, unpetted horses will still love you.  Combat is pretty simple.  Many crafted items serve no real purpose outside of being quest items.  Some timed quests will trigger before the player has the required tools to complete them.  While there's an impressive 28 marriage candidates, 6 of them are identical and only about 5 have a half-decent romantic quest line.  Unfortunately, some NPCs seem to have very little development or quest lines at all.  

Criticisms aside, My Time At Portia is incredibly addicting and fun.  Some farm sims have terribly repetitive or unrewarding seasonal festivals, but Portia goes all out with highly interactive festivals each with seasonal outfits and furniture that take effort to unlock.  NPCs can ask the player out on dates that involve playing various mini games to impress them, which is really cute.  Befriending NPCs can unlock new quests as well as items and stat boosts.  Furniture is not only decorative, but gives stat boosts as well.  The player character's skin, hair, and facial features are much more customizable than I've seen in other farm sims.  

What I particularly loved about My Time At Portia was the huge amount of quests.  Most farm sim games have a standard length of ~1 in game year before the main story is over and things start getting boring.  My first playthrough of My Time At Portia took 3 in game years.  There's just a huge amount of things to do, dates to go on, resources to collect, and places to explore.  The gameplay loop is hugely satisfying as strenuous tasks become easier and easier.

The worst thing about the game was the combat. I really didn't like the combat b/c it felt pretty wonky. However, I do see how it positively impacts the game so I'll give it credit there. I just personally couldn't get comfortable with it.

My favorite aspect of the game was the mining! I loved the excitement of finding loot and being an avid Deep Rock Galactic player, the mining part was right down my alley :D. It also helped that mining materials sold for a good price (or could be quickly crafted into something that would sell for a decent price).

I've been playing this because I wanted something similar to stardew valley, chill and going at your pace, this does scratch the itch but there are few things you should keep in mind.
This game is extremely rough around the edges, it looks good enough but the animations are magical sometimes. There is questionable voice acting that I really enjoyed, it is quite flat and I think the game would have been better off without voice acting but I think you can turn it off. Maybe, haven't checked because it is magical sometimes and I get a kick out of it, I wish it had similar voice acting to Shenmue series. Also it is great to watch NPCs sorta walk in rings as they try to find their way to their destination, clap and cheer at a empty ring when you won a fighting tournament even though you left a while ago, stuff like that.
There are mini-games that feel really janky, especially in dates and play dates. I didn't know swinging in swings would be that hard, bouncing proper way to bounce in seesaw is standing upright on it, and my date was seeing stars and star patterns in a sky without stars. This may apply to all mini-games.
The game has a focus on combat unfortunately, it isn't good and really janky but thankfully it is quite merciful. Stuff is easy to beat, there aren't really any notable punishments on failing. You have two things you can do in fights, hit or dodge that is it. There are few weapons in there that have different speeds and animations. You can be stun locked and beaten without mercy, however most enemies can be stun locked with fast weapons and most of people and enemies can be interrupted, especially in sparring.
The crafting is alright, stuff works on timers. Like you put some ore in a furnace and it is finished in game 2 hours (aka around 120 seconds real time) deadlines are usually easy to meet and you don't really get punished in meaningful ways if you miss them. Most commissions are easy to do, however I realised fishing is the most easiest way to make money. I glanced the commission board taking missions that improve relationships with people I wanted to be friends with or taking easy commissions and if you keep up upgrading tools and stuff you shouldn't have hard time keeping up with stuff. The story missions can be put off while you do other stuff, I do recommend taking your time with the story missions. You can put them off while you improve your workshop.
The start of this game is painfully slow, and I do recommend keeping wiki open and seeing how stuff is made and how to get stuff. Once you learn how to get your head around the game it is fun and a bit tedious at times. You can enjoy being kissed on the nose by your romantic interest after giving them a questionable gift every day that is easy to make or pick up the along the way.",1619109624,1619109624,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For me, It's just Harvest moon, but It's different. Unlike Harvest moon, You don't have a farm, but instead a workshop. And the Workshop is can be customized with what you like. You can make it look beautiful by decorating it, or you can make it an easy and accessible workplace like mine.
Well, How about the Farming? Well, In this game, It's totally different. Unlike Harvest Moon when you can bash the ground with the hoe, You need to have a planter box. And there's three type of Planter box (I never used one of the type, but I'm pretty sure It's not used for general use.). One of them is used for planting some general and small plants, Like Cabbage, Potato Fruit, Pumpkin, etc. And then one of them is used for planting for big plants, from Tree, to BIG FRICKING PLANT (The big fricking plant is the regular plant but it's bigger). And like Harvest moon, You have to take care of your plant, by giving them some fertilizer to make the plant happy.
The other thing is, You can mine ore too. And there's multiple ore in the game. And Unlike Harvest Moon, when you have the ore, You need to make the ingot/bar by yourself with the smelter/furnace. And not only It need to smelt on certain furnace, It also takes some time to get it finished. So, while you're waiting the ore to smelt, you can do other thing, like Fishing, Mining some more ore, making love with citizen (either to opposite or same gender) or make some spicy memes (or do whatever you want so you won't get bored waiting for it to get finished).
But wait, there's more. This game has a combat system. It's ooookay in my book. *shows Shipping Book* Oh wait- not this one. *puts up Shipping Book* *shows Gaming book* Here you go! So, the combat. When you engaged the combat, It will lock to the nearest enemy. Which is okay. And then You can dodge. Which is useful when the enemy will charge their attack to bash your... (Excuse me. What's the name of that thing again? ... Oh yeah.) Nut.
Plus, It also has Mission. It can be vary. From regular Mission, Side mission, to Commission. And You need to finish a lot of commission to get into the number 1 Workshop in Portia. And yeah. There's a Ranking on this game.
And lastly, Relationship. You can be friend, be a spacial friend, and/or marry to the people. And when you're in Relationship (whether It's Friend or GF/BF or Wife or whatever), You will get a mission from them which you need to completed it so you can improve your relationship with them. And, yeah. You can have a loving relationship with people by the same gender if you want. And how about me? Well, I've already married with the girl with glasses. And actually, I remember her name, but I won't tell you her name so I can tease you to play the game for yourself.
And, That's it. Overall, It's a great game. I have a lot of fun in it. And, Should you buy i- Yes! Buy it, whether on sale, or you rush it. I will recommend this game to people who ever played Harvest Moon, and need something new, and for people who just wanna have a different game that wasn't Call of Duty, or anything like that. And for the warning, Don't buy the game on [REDACTED! IT'S A CERTAIN INFAMOUS SKETCHY GAME RE-SELLER SITE]! That's it. See ya!

My Time At Portia carries the spirit of Stardew Valley and possibly Minecraft, but is its own game. It's crafting-focused, which I enjoy a lot and also sets it apart from those games. The focus makes the flow of gameplay different - constantly evolving as you get new recipes and upgraded tools. This helps keep the gameplay interesting and reduces the chance of stagnation, and it feels very natural.

There's a lot of thought into the game, minor QoL and just well-considered stuff that makes the experience really smooth or different from other games. You can craft from storage! In the cases that you can't do that, it often involves an Event/Plot Item, and gives you the opportunity to recoup your components before it's finished in case you end up not needing that item. You have the option to, instead of placing a Metal Storage (level 2), [i]replace[/i] an existing Wooden Storage (L1) - meaning a little less total storage, but also more space on the ground saved.

Also, I love the way relationships work - it's a little more work than Stardew, for instance, but has the benefit of each upgraded Relationship level [i]affecting connected characters[/i]. Going from Stanger to Acquaintance with Martha, for instance, gives +10 points to both her son Toby, and her best friend Carol. And yes, you can go up a level with someone else and get MORE points with the first person this way, too. Higher levels also unlock more minigames and interactions with each character.

The way mining works is very interesting - you have the ability to get those minerals (and also gemstones, which if you can get in Ruins I haven't found out how, yet) from random rocks laying around outside, which regenerate each day. BUT, each mine has a high concentration of its respective materials (I got over 500 in less than a day yesterday, for instance) - and more to the point, each mine, or rather, Ruin, has a special table of Relics that it drops. And you can pay a pretty cheap price to refresh a Ruin if you think there's not much left to find. Importantly, you have to rent a week of use for a Ruin, which forces you to consider time management, but in a way I find challenging and rewarding rather than punishing.

I also really appreciate that vendors sell basic materials for an affordable-ish price, in the case that I need Iron but don't have the time or inclination to open up a new pass for it.

One of my few complaints (aside from the wooden drawers not actually having real storage, hey) is how getting certain items, like the apparently important Cooking Set works - it requires both a lot of time and some RNG in getting the recipe from the Research Center, unless I guess I want to grind up a LOT of Data Disks. That might just be something I've got to balance for myself, though.

I do like how Stamina works - you only lose it if the tool (or weapon) you're swinging actually connects with the relevant thing (rock, tree, monster). BUT, you do lose it by fighting and by kicking trees and even picking things up, so there's a balance factor. What's really nice is the game doesn't knock you out when your stamina hits zero, just makes it impossible to do those actions until you restore (via food or even sitting down, although that takes a while).

The game is far from finished - incomplete voice acting and some outright weird dialogue being the most obvious - but it really does feel like they put a serious amount of thought into how to make it, and I'm having a great time so far.",1618619592,1618619592,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Crafting takes WAY too long, I found myself waking up, setting ore to smelt and items to cut/craft then going straight back to sleep so that they would be finished by the morning. For some reason it is the exact opposite for mining where you get too many materials, so you only go to the mines once every few hours or so, maybe even less.
- the above would be fine if there was more to do in the meantime and if the progression wasn't so painfully slow. After 20 hours (a decent time messing around to be fair) it felt like i hadn't progressed past the tutorial of any other craft/survival game (for example i was still crafting using the same materials for the same items, mainly bronze plates that take all day to craft with no progress to my workshop)
- Again this would get a pass if the gameplay was fun, but it sadly isn't. the character movement and animation is wooden, the combat is quite painful and relatively frequent and the crafting system lacks depth and reward, so you just find yourself crafting one thing to make another thing to make another thing and so on.
- It isn't explained what items do a lot of the time, so you'll find yourself either building things that don't do what you want (can't drive the dee dee car, boombox doesn't play music, i had to google what the blender does) or you will find yourself on the wiki a lot.
- uninspired enemies and creatures
- The relationships are very slow also, i understand that it takes time to build relationships but it shouldn't take 20 hours to become ""associates"" with one person, never mind the large cast of other villagers.
- Weird performance issues, like running at 30fps consistently until I go into my graphics settings but change them to exactly what they already were, then it stays at the desired frame rate until it decides it's bored then drops frames. Obviously take this with a pinch of salt since all setups are different and often contribute to the issue.

I'll explain my main reason for uninstalling and spending my time doing something more fulfilling. Its the awkward game design that forces you to do things that waste time or slow down progress artificially.
first example - dee dee cars - they take a while to build, well you need 3-4 of them. they need bus stops too luckily you only need to build 3 of them which also take a while. Oh sorry actually you need to make more, we just didn't tell you earlier so you stopped making the materials needed for them.

Main example - main quest needs me to have a lot of wood. Go to tree farm for main source of wood. Tree farm dead, new quest for device to fix farm. Make device that needs wood that obviously isn't very available. oh sorry, that wasn't enough, you actually need to bring the trees back to life with other separate devices, go and create 2 very wood heavy devices even though you have no wood, also you will need a cutting machine that hasn't even unlocked, so you need to progress the main quest without any good source of wood, then wait 4 days to get the cutting machine, then make the expensive machine, then make the 2 wood heavy devices without a wood source, then youll have trees back.

It's this trend of the game artificially creating a problem that you need to fix with something new, then has no other use, just an annoying stepping stone to slow the player down in already the slowest grind I've ever played.

I'm sure plenty of people would be fine with this kind of grind, but it's way too much for me just to not feel any sort of progression at all. It looked promising but overall was a literal waste of time considering there are plenty of near identical games that are better and have a more rewarding experience. Hopefully some of these issues will be addressed in the sequel.

The bads: It has an above average level of grind, and there are audio and clipping glitches that I wish they would've fixed from when it was in early access, and the world feels too big to the point of being nearly empty that I was hoping would've gotten filled in since the early access days. Plus the cooking system is just plain awful and baffles me that it was never fixed into a streamlined system, and you can and will work around it rather than with it.

The goods: interesting setting, plenty to do and explore, you're able to respec your ability points so you're not locked into your choices forever, building up takes awhile but you build up high and feel like you've earned it, and otherwise checks all the boxes for a time management game.

This is my favourite of the genre so far. It doesn't do much that's revolutionary, other than the 3D environment - which already sets it head and shoulders above many competitors. But what it does, it does well.

Pros: 
* Worldbuilding and backstory is great. Interesting without being overwhelming, and with enough mystery that you want to learn more.
* Town NPCs are engaging, and it's easy to get invested.
* The main gameplay loop is well executed. If you like games in this genre, you'll like this. 
* The gathering activites are suitably pleasing, relaxing and mindless - which is a pro in this genre.
* Mid- and endgame bring automation options to bypass a lot of the tedious fiddling with managing the crafting process.  

Cons:
* English language dialogue and onscreen text is a bit shaky; more effort on the localisation would improve immersion.
* The UI could use some help. It's not *terrible* but it could be a lot better.
* Periodic lags when entering combat make some quests challenging until you way overlevel them. 
* If you want a farming sim that doesn't impose combat, this isn't it. Combat is required to complete the storyline missions, as well as a necessary source of materials to complete much of the crafting. 

I'm not done yet (my played time is high because I leave it open while AFK) but I'm entering the endgame, and I'll be disappointed when I'm done with it. I'm already looking forward to the sequel, My Time at Sandrock.

If you read this and find yourself disagreeing with the points i bring up, then by all means, buy the game - you'll probably enjoy it a lot. That said...

The main points that cause me to stress out in this game (yes... My Time at Portia -stresses me out- ... go figure...) are the following :

1. Everything is on a kind of hidden clock & the game judges you for missing its deadlines

At the very, very start, you are told there is a workshop ranking between all 5 participants (you included, even though you never are asked if you give a crap about being competitive with the other crafters). To add some spice to it all, you are also introduced to the most unlikable character - Higgins - who so happens to be the 'best crafter in town'. At that point, I'm already eye-twitching because of the completely forced sense of competition, but ok... I'm not taking the bait, I'm going to 'stardew' this and chill on my little plot of land, see what's what.
After just casually building a few things and expanding my workshop, the month ends and I get a letter. ""Congratulations, you came in last !"" - Seriously ? I don't -want- to partake in your artificial little competition, but no... every month and every year you get treated to the ""Hurray, you suck"" parade unless you purposefully regulate your life to the beat of the commissions board.
So on successive new saves, you can't let go of 'the master's whip' in the back of your mind, egging you onward to PRODUCE, GET REPUTATION, COMPETE, etc... utterly irritating to me. 

2. Combat in this game isn't optional - it's mandatory

Sure, you can get a variety of animal produce in a variety of other ways. But if you hope to progress the main quest ? You better hope you enjoy fighting lots of mobs and have a stomach for boss-fights in your craft & farm game.
Now, to be fair, the bosses are not hard in any real sense - but they feel hoisted upon you for no reason what so ever. The three 'civil corps' (military/police force) could just as well not have been there, because they do fuck-all in these instances, leaving it up to your little farmer (who had -of course- just a pair of worn gloves and no combat trait investment when he was carted off to fight 'surprise boss crab' and 'surprise rat king'.
It's yet another forced aspect of this game that - to my specific tastes - adds nothing and subtracts plenty.

3. As a completionist, this game seems to go out of its way to irritate you.

A concrete example - the quest Martha's Delivery - where you need to provide a few fruit tarts for Sophie, the old lady that runs the produce store. The first time I got that quest, I had not yet unlocked the Cooking set so with a time limit of 7 days to complete, I was pretty much screwed right off the bat (sure, I handed in some discs in hopes of getting the thing researched, but no luck). So with a mounting degree of irritation, I see the timer go down and boom, quest failed - reputation loss, relation loss, the whole kit and kaboodle.
The fun part ? Seems like the wiki can inform you that the woman who says she doesn't have any tarts so she can't deliver them herself sells them... but only on rainy days. Not that anyone in game informs you of this - including that hag of a baker.
Again, is that such a huge deal ? No, probably not - but this, mixed in with all the irritations left and right just spoils the experience for me.

So yeah, If you're looking for a game where you want to go at your own pace, free of the constant judgement of the game or when you get irked at missing quests (as they can just despawn if you don't pick them up fast enough, too) because of reasons completely out of your control (unless you are cloistered to the wiki like your life depends on it), i'd give this game a hard pass. 
I'm at 150 hours, caught between my compulsive brain pushing me to get this game completed and setting it behind me, but I honestly feel like an uninstall will give me greater peace of mind.

I can't recommend MTaP highly enough. It is my all-time favorite game, and I have played it over and over at least 10 times without fully accomplishing all the possible quests and activities.

It is challenging on a level that is perfect for me. First time through, I bumbled around the game not really understanding its layers, but after using the assist of the 
https://mytimeatportia.fandom.com/wiki/Gift_preferences 
page, I really got into the gift-giving, festivals, fishing, building, mining, exploring, etc.

The graphics are beautifully detailed. Attention to shadowplay and seasonal change  is excellent and wondrous.

Your character wakes up every day at 7am and can go until they drop at 3am, if they have enough stamina and health points. Opening the front door each morning is part of the fun, because you never know what the day will bring: Rain? Snow? A visitor with a challenge that throws a monkeywrench into your plans?

Once you get outside, be sure to check your map for special challenges. (I still forget to do that every day.) Then you go about gathering resources generated by your self-built machines and refueling them as necessary. You go to the Commerce Guild to get new commissions to earn money and reputation points. Talk to characters, give them gifts (especially on their birthdays), build friendships, go mining in ruins,

The story is set in the future, after computerization ruined the world ages ago. You go digging in ruins to find data discs and ""ancient"" parts needed to create and construct machines. There are also parts of relics to be found in said ruins. These parts can be ""recovered"" and used to gain attributes (health, stamina, attack or defense points) or they can be donated to the museum, once it's built. Some ruins have monsters and deformed beings that will attack you, so you need to be geared and equipped for combat, which is a rather forgiving system. It took me a while to understand that each ruin has a map system, which is very helpful. I also needed YouTube assist at times.

There are Main Missions and Secondary Missions. Accomplishment of certain missions triggers other missions. Some are timed, some are not. The story line has many offshoots, and I am delighted every time I play at how much detail is put into the likes and dislikes of each character. The dialogue gets repetitious, but I just click through it.

You can challenge characters to hand-to-hand combat and rock-paper-scissors, and after you get to know them better, you can have get-togethers/dates. I still don't know how to get married, but I love that I am eventually able to have a helper.

I enjoy planning what materials I need, going to get those materials, building the machines to create other materials, and planning each step of each commission. There is a very interactive calendar, map, mission list, and character skill tree.
There are 13 different fish species to obtain, and fishing is one of the best ways to make money. You chop down trees and break rocks. Eventually, you can ride horses or tame llamas for transportation, raise animals and fish, buy and sell goods.

The devs at Pathea Games are now finishing up ""My Time at Sandrock,"" which is due out for early access (hopefully) in late spring/summer 2021. I am so looking forward to the Sandrock game.

MTaP is filled with unexpected surprises, and I hope Sandrock will deliver the same.",1617117159,1617117159,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Only downside is early on, you get chucked in the deep end without too much in the way of in-game guidance.

I was running it on a laptop and at first tried to overlook the lag and low graphics settings, but once I got to the point where I needed to do combat it was basically impossible.  At that point though I couldn't refund it since I spent over 2 hours in the game, but figured since it was in EA that it would eventually be optimized better.  A year or so later I got a computer that could actually run it so I decided to revisit.  I think at that point the game had also been fully released (no longer early access).  But getting back into it, I was honestly pretty surprised that they decided to release it considering there were missing voice lines, the game hadn't been optimized and the main quest seemed kind of lacking (some reviews say it is incomplete though I never made it that far).  Hardly anything had changed since the last time I had played the game, and the fact that it was no longer in EA lead me to believe that nothing ever will change, especially considering they are now working on a new game.

Aside from that I dislike the main game play.  This is a game about crafting and the crafting system is essentially: run around and gather materials, put them in a machine and wait for the timer, now take several of the things you just waited for and put them in another machine together, wait, repeat.  It is a crafting game and the crafting system is based on waiting for hours and hours in game for stuff to get done.  Only thing I really liked about the game was mining, idk how to describe it but it's very satisfying.  Not enough to make the game as a whole fun,

In all, it's a game that isn't finished and seemingly won't ever be finished, the timer based crafting system is awful and even on good computers the game can be very slow at times due to bad optimization.

Most of this game just is a fetch quest with waiting required for parts to be made. The visuals and animations can be pretty janky looking sometimes, especially in combat. They have lots of little tutorials pop up you can read to help you, and can even access them via the ""help"" section of the pause menu. The thing is just how poorly some of it can be explained. It feels like a lot of that stuff was translated from another language sometimes. For example, how any mineral or rock-sourced material has ""quarry"" as it's only source. I'm 25 hours in, almost finished an in-game year, and haven't unlocked anything close to a quarry. I think what was meant to be said instead was just rocks, as there are rocks littered in kind of random places that will drop those materials.

My main problem is just how much waiting there is. I guess if you're used to Stardew Valley kind of stuff then it's nothing new to you, but it sucks having all these materials stockpiled and all I can do is wait for more quests to pop up on the map, that I can finish in 2-5 minutes, and only be able to accept 1 commission a day. 

Another weird thing is how this game will streamline stuff, like if you're trying to craft something it will check all of your chests, not just your inventory, but then make some stuff that goes completely against that how with the assembly station you have to have the part in your hotbar, selected, and be standing in relatively the right spot, with some wiggling around required sometimes, to place that part on the thing you're assembling.

Once you learn a few systems like buying when prices are low then selling high, and only buying furniture when its low will make a large difference. I thought it had a well thought out plot that kept me guessing. I do wish a few things were different but I know the Devs are actually looking into implementing these things into the new Sandrock game! Overall, I recommend this game if you are looking to relax and de-stress. The biggest mission towards the end was my favorite, I don't want to give away spoilers, but it is great and integrative.

Fist off, not a farming game, I know to most that actually bothered to look into it before buying it know this but I being someone who lacks the patience to look into it went in thinking it's a farm game; it's not, there is farming in the game but it's not the focus

This game is an odd blend of crafting and rpg more than anything, but here be my problem:

While the design of the characters looks.. ok-ish in 2d sprites the art styles does NOT translate well into 3D, some of these characters look like play-dou was having a bad day at the bar and puked out everything it was consumed that day.  It's hard to really feel good or bad for any of these characters when the art direction is this distracting, if you could avoid people at all cost that would be a different story but sooner or later you do have to interact with some of them.

The game itself is mostly put together already, it's oddly spammy for what the ""combat""  is worth, no real rhyme or reason to it just click click click so it being a big part of hunting both monsters and mobs does end up discouraging a bit to be honest.

But that's a minor complaint, over all the game is nice!  Albeit I can't say I would recommend it in full since for me, the art direction is just a massive turn off and eventually made me drop the game without even finishing it.",1616785788,1616785788,False,2,1,0.51533740758895874,0,True,False,False

It follows a bit on the footsteps of games like Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley, but deviates significantly from them by focusing on machine building instead of farming. I mean, there is some farming in it, and you might need to do a bit of it, but it's not what the game is about.

The story follows your custom character, who just inherited their father's workshop near the lovely city of Portia. It all takes place about four hundred years after human greed caused a cataclysmic event, and about one hundred years after a kind and ingenious soul saved humanity with a brilliant invention. The lore here is pretty deep, and as you go about your daily routine as Portia's newest engineer, you'll sometimes get involved in dangerous situations where you must explore the ruins left behind by that cataclysm to face some dangerous foes. This game's story is surprisingly involved for a routine simulator, and I like it.

Add to that lovely sceneries, good music, and charismatic NPCs with nice designs, and you have a really involving world. The immersion is broken a little bit by some rather wonky animations and extremely frequent audiovisual glitches, but if you can look past those, the world of Portia is a delight to be in.

This game will see you engaging in several activities to advance both the story and your workshop's evolution. There's gadget building, resource gathering, a bit of farming and livestock rearing, socialization with NPCs, and also dungeon crawling and combat.

Gadget building is the main activity that all other activities serve. In various moments during the game, you'll need to build all kinds of machinery and industrial equipment. Some of those machines are used to process materials, and you'd better get tons of those cuz you'll need them, and others are used for story missions, like building a wind turbine for a new town, or creating an irrigation system for your friend's farm. To build these gadgets, you must gather materials, process them, put them together in workbenches, and finally assemble the whole thing in the assembly station. The assembly station is where you put together large gadgets, piece by piece, and there's something very satisfying in seeing a machine gradually take shape in it, even if it doesn't really add much gameplay-wise.

As an added incentive to do gadget building jobs fast and frequently, there's a monthly builder contest that ranks the five workshops of Portia (yours is but one of them) according to how many tasks they managed to beat that month. This is super cool, and it's always satisfying to come out on top and rub it on your rival Higgins' smug face.

As for resource gathering, it's comprised mostly of mining, woodcutting, foraging, and going into dungeons for some monster drops (more on that one later). Mining in particular is super cool. It has you going into these large sandboxes with fully destructible walls and floor, where you can gather minerals by whacking them with your pickaxe, and find some buried treasure by tracking it down with special gear. Gradually clearing the mines with your pickaxe to get to the goodies has this relaxing zen quality to it that I love. As for woodcutting and foraging, they work exactly how you'd expect these things to work in this kind of game, and they do their job.

Still on resource gathering, there are also certain NPCs that give you daily supplies of certain resources if you complete their sidequests, which is really helpful. There's also a fishing minigame I could never get the hang of, and treasure chests sprinkled around the world that you need to do a bit of parkour to get to. Not a big fan of the fishing, but the treasure hunting is my jam.

Contrary to most job simulators out there, farming takes a significant backseat in Portia. Instead of tilling the soil to plant some crops, you'll have to buy specialized planter boxes, and you don't even need to bother watering them. I think that's a good choice, since you'll be so busy doing other things you won't even remember to water plants. Animal rearing I don't like very much, as it requires you to dedicate a significant portion of your limited workshop space to it. Having to make room for a large animal farm, especially when you still haven't bought enough extra terrain around your workshop, is just too much to ask for. Overall, farming is basically just another form of resource gathering in this game, and it's a nice way to get a passive supply of certain items with little effort involved.

Then there's dungeon crawling, which is the second most important thing you'll be doing in this game. It's decidedly simplistic and not very polished, but I like it. Fighting enemies is satisfying enough, there's a decent selection of weapons and armor to pick from, some cool bosses, and looking around in nooks and crannies is bound to reveal some nice treasure and goodies. The game integrates dungeon crawling into the experience by making certain enemies drop important loot for certain machines, and also by certain story missions where you have to go into special dungeons to beat up a boss. It never feels intrusive, surprisingly, and it's actually pretty fun.

Where this game absolutely shines for me, however, is the socialization mechanics. This game truly goes above and beyond with these. You don't simply talk to NPCs and give them gifts every now and again. You do that, yes, but then you can also engage in several other activities with them:
- You can spar with them. It's the only chance you'll ever get  to kick someone in the face and still remain friends afterwards.
- You can play some simple jan-ken-po, which gives you some extra socialization points.
- You can invite them for ""play dates"" which involve tons of activities comprised of simple minigames.
- When you're dating or married to someone, you can do stuff like kissing and hugging. The animations are hella awkward, but it's still kinda cute.

Not only are the social activities super diverse, the NPCs themselves are all quite good. They have a backstory, a reason to be in Portia, and a bit of a character arc the more you advance into your relationship with them. As an added incentive to befriend them, you can also get some gifts and stuff from them every now and then if they like you.

So yeah, this game is huge and full of stuff to do, most of which feels rewarding and satisfying. There's lots of things I didn't mention in detail, like the holidays that have their own minigames, the random social events you may stumble upon by exploring the city, and a lot of other stuff I forgot, but they all add a bit more flavor and variety to the experience.

Do check this out if you're a fan of sandboxes and job simulators, and especially if you like it when they have a prominent combat and dungeon crawling side to them.",1522728850,1616634670,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Crafting and building stuff for the town is enjoyable for about 10 minutes until you realize how basic it is. If it gets interesting later on thats kind of a moot point because its a slog getting to that point. Combat is very basic, just attack, dodge, attack again without any interesting depth in between.

Build items, weapons, and decorations for your house, upgrade your house and workshop to include extra things, and work your way through a wealth of achievements. If nothing else, there's a LOT of playtime involved.

I enjoyed the story, the way the town grew the further into the story you got, and the myriad of things included; crafting, building, romance, dating and plays, friendship, and lots of little minigames to take up your time. Multiple areas to mine, relics to find, festivals to participate in. There is a LOT worth exploring.

There are a few things on the downside, however. The combat is a little uninspired, often dropping frames and at times freezing. The cutscenes often take a few seconds to load, meaning you're left with a lot of black screens throughout. Not debilitating, but worth noting. At one point there is a storyline quest that glitches out the game. It would definitely have benefited from patching that out (as it is a known bug), as well as giving the game one more layer of polish. The English text features a lot of spelling errors and mismatched grammar, though it is overall readable. A touch more care would have fixed those issues and really brought MTAP up.

Overall, the game is fun and caters to a range of farming sim habits. Whether you like crafting, farming, building commissions, or befriending everyone in town, there's a lot to do.

I'll be looking to get My Time At Sandrock when it comes out, if it keeps to these standards (and improves them!)

. I am 10 hours in and I can't even beginn to fathom what this shitshow will become later on.

I am tempted to cheat my way through because everything aside from waiting seems cool - although almost everything is just that: Waiting. Waiting for crops to grow, waiting for stuff to finish crafting, getting ressources, fighting in the (annoying as fuck) dungeons that you have to wait to unlock, waiting for an event, waiting, waiting, waiting.

If the Combat was good or rewarding I could maaaaybe overlook this, but its just terrible. I'm pretty sure I'd rather poke my eyes out then playing it again like intended. After the shitshow that was Nexomon:Extinctin I cant deal with another game on this level.

You need to mine ore (clunky, annoying process), then make the ore into bars, then further process the bars into other materials that you need to use for crafting. All steps include several in-game hours of waiting. Most of the things that you craft have no in-game use but are just things that you need to drop off to complete a quest to get money. So far I get no sense of growth which is usually what makes this type of game engaging for me. There is almost nothing to buy with the money however so the whole thing seems pointless.

The positive: 
+ the background graphics are really nice
+ the waiting times for materials are appropriate
+ the mining is fun and does NOT follow a set pattern like it does in Stardew
+ the combat is diverse enough to be fun and simple enough so you dont need to learn tons of information
+ ALOT of villagers to befriend and build relationships with
+ the storage system is a gamers heaven; machines automatically access your chests and you can access all chests from one chest by cycling through them
+ after 15h I would describe my state as barely out of the tutorial, the world seems really big and explorable, the recipes are logical, the villagers have character, there are plenty minigames and so much to customize your experience

The negative:
- in the 15h the game crashed on me 3 times, loosing my day's progress which is annoying
- the game leaves you pretty alone early on, you are expected to just ""know"" certain things like where to get specific materials from. I had to use the wiki quite alot early on, which was a bit frustrating
- the comissions go from beginner friendly to bulky orders in a blink, going from taking a day or two to complete to week-long projects (unless you prepared materials before) in just one quest
- you have to go through 3 loading screens until you can play, which is annoying (1st to boot up the game, 2nd to load your file and a 3rd once you exit your house)
- this might just be a ""me"" issue but I think the bitmoji style characters dont fit the rest of the game too much

TL;DR: If you enjoy games like Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon you will also love this game.

I will try and keep this review somewhat short... This is a good game, in my opinion if you were to blend many of the best aspects of harvest moon a wonderful life, animal crossing & legend of zelda ocerina of time together this would be the result.

The Good:
Graphics: They are good and have a very HM:aWL feel to them. While they are cartoony they are still fun and vibrant.
Sound&Music: It is emersive and fitting to the situation and has decent variety in most cases.
Gameplay: As stated above, it has a very HM:aWL/AC/LoZ:OoT feel and is both fun and engrossing and will keep you busy for hours and can take months per playthrough.

The Bad:
1. There is a critical memory leak that has been present since the game came out which leads to the game taking up more and more ram the longer you play and if you are running 4GB or less ram, it leads to crashes and the loss of hours of work.
2. The game only saves when you sleep which is a monsterous flaw in my oppinion and is the cause of a lot of loss of work for reason stated above.
3. If you run any of the many great mods out there for the game then crashes are very likely to occur often.
4. Pathea has been informed by at least 6 people that I know of about the first two above issues from as far back as a few months after the game came out and seems to have yet to take any action at resolving them even after a couple years, which in my opinion is not a good sign for their future games.

There is more but the rest are mostly trivial things and my opinions so I will omit them for the sake of simplicity and keeping this short(er) lol.

However there's a couple of major design flaws:

- Main story line is too long. I'm nearly 80 hours into the game and still haven't gotten through but at this point I feel like I'm done with the game, so I might never get to see the ending because it is just too grindy. It would be fine if the game was different at this stage but it isn't, it just becomes repetitive.

- The only way to gain any meaningful XP is by mining but that becomes boring quite quickly. You end up mining just to get XP, not resources. Crafting items or completing missions yields virtually zero XP. The amount of XP gained from these activities should be increased significantly.

- Getting relationships to increase takes forever, way longer than it should. It feels like a chore right from the start and throughout the game.

- Upgrades to your workshop, like buying land or upgrading the house, initially cost a reasonable amount of money and resources. However the cost just keeps increasing exponentially but your ability to make money does not. In the end you have to grind maybe 20 real life hours just to buy a bit of extra land to build on.",1615817336,1615817476,True,9,0,0.625395298004150391,0,True,False,False

Let me start out by saying this is somewhat like Stardew Valley but IT IS NOT. While I love Stardew Valley to death (with lots of time played) this is different and how it is different might sway your opinion on the game. Let me start out saying with this about the big difference-Content variety, what I mean by this is Stardew Valley is a wonderful game with a few core concepts that make the game what it is where as My Time At Portia there is a bigger world to explore, lots of quests, lots of items to craft, skill trees, and while both have combat, mining, and harvesting of wood there is a lot more depth to My Time At Portia in those regards, as far as farming Stardew Valley is the game you will want to play if your main focus is farming and farming alone. While farming is a somewhat core concept in the game of My Time At Portia it can be overlooked in a sense that you will find you self dealing more with mining and woodcutting. Also the glaring issue is casual vs sorta but not really casual of My Time At Portia. What I mean by that is simply in Stardew you can go at your own pace and not feel pressure at all. You can frankly skip every concept outside of farming in Stardew and face no downsides to it where as in My Time At Portia you will feel crunch, what I mean by this is you need to min max the crap out of your day to get stuff done, and this also is due to the fact of how much more content depth there is in My Time At Portia. I should say this myself as a gamer I am a absolute try hard. I literally will reset a day I almost finished if I didn't get to turn a quest in before it failed, or if I didn't get wood to keep my copper bars, etc going overnight so while there is crunch it is also to a degree based on the player as well. Again if you do want a much more laid back game Stardew Valley is perfect for you but if you have already played Stardew and are looking at My Time At Portia as something to try out it is totally worth it I think regardless of how your play style in Stardew Valley was Portia does a fantastic job with its content depth to make you feel like at the end day excited to get the stuff you need to get done for quests. Portia is a much more quest driven game as well but is still the best game for those looking for a Stardew Valley like game. 

Pros:
-Content Depth
-Wide range of quests
-Skill trees
-Massive array of things to build and craft
-high replay value

Cons
-Ruins where you go mining it will often sometimes lag pause causing the game to take a few seconds to fix itself- generally only when you first start mining after that no problems
-Very little information given to players on where to find items (for first time players this can be annoying but also does make you need to explore a lot to figure out where to find specific items
-Sometimes there are frame drops or a few second spurt of lag causing delayed movement for a second or two

Overall My Time At Portia is a good game with lots of content,quests,items to craft, a vast world to explore,unique NPC's but with there being some frame drops or lag issues that can occur every so often you might feel the pacing feel clunky due to it but isn't game breaking or a constant pain to deal with.

Content: 10/10
Audio: 9/10 
Visuals: 8.5/10
Performance: 7/10 with some frame drops,lag issues that sometimes can happen as well as sometimes NPC's not correcting themselves to face you when you talk to them like they normally do it can feel awkward 

Overall Score 8.5/10

666140,88058949,76561198065723869,0,33,3656,0,1814,1617485964,"I've had this game for a LONG while, It's one of the few games of this type I've supported Early Access and while I dabbled in it before I decided to hold up until it was finished and I had time. Reaching a bit of a dry period I'm giving it a go now and yeah the game is great but not without issues.

Positives:
- The Map. Both in the city and the surroundings, yes there's a lot of wide open spaces of generally nothing, but there's also a lot of cool visuals throughout and more importantly in games like these a lot of verticality. The design of Portia takes a bit to get used to but once you do there's nothing like a town design you have to go up hills to reach certain areas, feels like a small European town in that regard.

- The concept: If you love Stardew Valley and wanted something similar on PC that is also already finished, this is a good stop. There are other titles you can probably give a go to, but many of them are still in Early Access and nowhere near reaching a 1.0 release, and this one while 3D has a lot of similar concepts particularly with the town full of charming characters with routines, people to marry, seasonal events, etc. 

- The gameplay: Look I'm not going to tell you the gameplay is amazing, but it's more than serviceable and has enough variety. The combat isn't perfect and shouldn't be your reason to play this, but compared to Stardew there's a bit more depth to it even if a little janky in execution. The concept of building items piece by piece and part by part is cool too. The regular loop of choosing a day to do X, Y or Z depending on what you need with the rare change due to a special yearly event is fun which is the most important aspect in these relaxing simulator titles, and there's enough variety of what to focus on you can focus on one thing one day and move on the next. 

The Bad:
- Assembly annoyance: As much as assembling intricate items one by one is cool, it's also a little silly you need to physically be holding the item. Unlike anything else while in your area which just grabs resources automatically, this is such a freeze as you're trying to find where you placed a specific part.  The inventory management isn't optimal either which means you could be spending a few just looking for one or two items.

- Optimization: Look I have a 3090 and an i9 10850, and the game while visually OK looking has shown me no reason as to why it needs to dip below 60 fps when at 4K. It's not a visually impressive game, yet it's so resource intensive I'll have to lower my resolution to maintain a steady 60. I hope they do better for the sequel

- Art Style: I'm SO glad the trailer for the sequel looks like a much improved art style, because this is one of the items of this one I am so out of love with. It's one of the weakest links particularly for the main character.

- The start: It's so freaking slow, and it's the reason I stopped at first. If you tried the game and are getting bored early on, please keep going as once you start making money and find the loop that works for you it's a very fun time consuming relaxing game. It just starts awkwardly.

- Some of the voice acting: I get that this wasn't a priority, but come on yall, I had to turn off voice acting because the lead male's voice actor sounded a little too high pitched in voice tone which contradicted the look and design I gave him lmao. At least either give more of a variety for the sequel or choose something a little more in the middle. 

Overall Final thoughts: There are better games out there like Stardew, and I'm nowhere near done, but all things considered it's a solid 8/10 game. There are many little things that add up that could be improved on for the sequel so here's hoping they do so that one ends up being as insanely popular as Stardew, which the dev team shows a lot of promise to be able to do so.",1615176837,1615176837,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Nice game; I like the fact that they give you sufficient time for the requests and don't really have to fulfill them immediately. I managed to get a good system up and running, and [spoiler] beat Higgins in my first year [/spoiler] even though I didn't plan to lmao.

The dating system is cool, and definitely could be expanded upon. I look forward to see how My Time At Sandrock will build upon this, if they do.

Writing isn't particularly strong; but it's...okay. Definitely have room for improvement.

What it really excels at is the building/crafting. From metals and ores to metal products, to turning them into more complicated materials to assemble what you need - it's in-depth, but easy to get used to.

I kinda wished they have a list of possible museum donation items; I often have to go to Wiki to double check. QoL improvements like this would help a lot. 

The fact I can spar with anyone is hilarious.

Farming isn't really a huge thing though; it's far easier to just buy what you need from Sophie's Ranch.

The advantage of My Time at Portia compared to other games of it's genre is that the world is much more fleshed out, and the setting has a vibrant history. The characters you meet feel much more real than those in other games of the same genre, as well as the questing system being a good way to set goals, so the player never feels lost or confused on what to do next.",1614508637,1614508637,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The community of portia has a life of its own and you get to decide pace and level of involvement as events unfold. The characters are fun to interact with and the relationship system is well thought out, i like that the more you get to know characters the more you interact with them in the form of sparing, taking pictures, roshambo, and play dates. The events and celebration are festive and fun with each one being unique and offering opportunities to participate and buy seasonal items. There are plenty of characters to develop a romantic relationship with.

I like the workshop as a focal point to game with farming as an option, however the farming feels forced. you can gather most of the resources that you get from farming and raising animals while gathering resources.  I like the challenge of completing as many of the posted requests while balancing the main quest items that expand the map. 

I like the art styling of the environment and the characters, but the baddies and animals are confusing at best but their appearance and combat abilities make them non threatening making the game accessible to players of most any skill level. The dungeons are a little uninspired but I like the progression of levels.

Overall the game is about time management with many things to spend time on, the game can get tricky when you get further in the game. I feel any fan of the genre would easily get $30 worth of entertainment out of this game.

If you run out of stamina, you simply can't finish the action you were previously trying to accomplish. If you fall asleep at 3 AM in a place that is not your bed, you simply wake up in your bed the next morning.

 It is definitely a grind to have to finish the commissions and missions given by the NPCs. It is also frustrating trying to accumulate money because crafting takes a long time. This game does have a few notable bugs. The screen could sometimes freeze when loading a cutscene. The game might crash when the player alt + tab (this especially hurts if you are in the later portion of the day, since the day doesn't save until you fall asleep). Furthermore, I found it a little difficult to play the game with its limited instructions. I had to look up a lot of other people's guides to make sure I was doing things correctly. Finally, (this is the least groundbreaking detail) the cosmetics aren't fully customizable. Quite frustrating when the clothes that you wear (specifically hats) revert your hair back to default. 

HOWEVER, the depth of the relationship amongst the NPCs and its related content is very intriguing. There are specific details that is shown through their background story and their behavior throughout the day. When you think you are done with the game, it will give you a mission to unlock a different part of the map. This brings to my other point. You get a lot of time to finish the missions and commissions given to you (if there is a time you have to accomplish it by). You even have a say on when to really activate the mission. 

tldr:
- pros: peaceful gameplay, deep NPC connections/backstory, choice in missions and enough time to finish them
- cons: notable bugs, have to grind crafts & money, cosmetics not fully customizable (especially hats)

Tips:
- When your screen freezes while in combat, press ""z"" to activate the camera. After you exit the camera screen, you will be back to combat. 
- If your screen goes white and your device gives you options between closing the game or waiting, try waiting, Sometimes the game will resume after that screen. (Most likely won't. But from my experiences if the game wants to crash there won't be any warning of it doing so.)",1612789063,1614119204,True,13,0,0.639677703380584717,0,True,False,False

It is very addictive and has a good amount of story. It is very satisfying to finally finish a quest after working hard to get everything you need to do so.

Pros:
â¢ Lots of main quests and side quests, so even after a lot of playtime you shouldn't get bored
â¢ Great controller controls. I almost never play games with controllers but this is one that I never play using keyboard and mouse.
â¢ Beautiful look
â¢ Lots of items and furniture
â¢ Encourages progression. Most of the quests require you to upgrade your workstations or go to a new area.
â¢ This one might be a con for some people, but the game requires lots of grinding to complete quests. Personally I think they do the grinding in a fun way, but some people might not like it.

Cons:
â¢ Some quests take a really long time to do and get annoying to work on
â¢ The people you can talk to do not have many things to say
â¢ The game forces a lot of quests on you, and you cannot turn some of them down.
â¢ Some parts are very difficult
â¢ Cut scenes take a while to load

This game has something for everyone. There is combat, building, exploration, and a lot more.

If all this sounds good, you might be wondering, ""is it worth the $30 price tag""? Yes. It definitely is worth every dollar.

If you go back to when I first started playing, yeahâ¦I was definitely having fun. Ten minutes in and Iâm unlocking items and completing quests and leveling up and crafting thingsâ¦and all those little dopamine emitters in my brain are firing. :P Before I knew it, almost 3 hours had gone by and it was past time to get ready for bed.
I guess if I had a main complaint about Portia, itâs that the mid-game failed to maintain the polish, consistency, and pace of the early-gameâ¦and the late-game even less than the mid-game. The designers seemed to use time as the barrier to progress, and so the game eventually began to feel more like a mobile game than a traditional one. For me, the game also suffered from characters I didnât particularly care about (if you want to compare it to Stardew, which you should). 
They did some stuff right though. Combat is more interesting than Stardew. The fishing is better. Also, I think Portia is a lot more lenient when it comes to âquality of lifeâ features compared to Stardew. For instance, I like not being punished for staying out past bedtime. 
I will say that the game looks great visually and the design is fun. The quirky world they created is kind of like if there was a PG Disney version of Mad Max. The super advanced world was destroyed through some kind of apocalypse, and the world is being repopulated by these scavengers. You know, you find âancient relicsâ like silicon chipsets and motors that you use to cobble together technology. Everything is pastel and bright and goofy. It kind of creates tonal problems thoughâ¦like when a character will drop a line like âWell, when I got back from fighting in the great war and my wife died in childbirthâ¦â HOLY WHAT??

The game ultimately bogged down under the weight of its own requirements. When you start out, itâs likeâ¦âbuild a bus stopâ which requires a couple boards and bronze barsâ¦and by the end itâs like âbuild a construction crane for the new portâ which requires steel plates, pulleys, concrete, etc.. All of which take progressively longer amounts of time to manufacture. I think there's definitely a reason only about 7% of players ever finished the game..

For instance, Portia has tons of fantastic quality-of-life features:
- You can access any chest from any other chest on your property. This saves lots of running around to organize/deposit your inventory.
- You can name chests directly, which makes organization much easier, especially when combined with the above.
- An icon appears by your hotbar to tell you when your inventory is full.
- Your HP and stamina are shown as both bars and numbers, making the relevant mechanics transparent.
- When you cut down a tree, break a rock or kill a monster, the dropped resources get pulled to you regardless of how far away you are, so you don't have to run back and forth picking stuff up.
- You can look up what equipment is required to craft an item, before you have the relevant means to do so.
- After giving a gift to a person, how much they liked it is recorded on their page in the menu, so you don't have to keep notes yourself.
- Probably like a dozen more things I can't remember right now.

Also, majorly important: Life sims like Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley quickly fall into the rut of doing the same thing every single day. Portia COMPLETELY avoids this problem. The central premise is you are a builder, not a farmer, so the central mechanic is that you build machines and craft items and structures of steadily increasing complexity for the town. You make most of your money (and reputation) NOT by just dumping piles of items at a shop, but rather by fulfilling commissions for specific items. The pool of items is gigantic (and expands during the game) so you are constantly being asked to make different things.

But you're limited to a maximum of 1 normal commission + 1 plot commission at a time, and can only pick up one of each per day, and regular commissions don't get posted on weekends, so even at maximum efficiency you have to do other stuff. This is where the OTHER traditional life-sim mechanics come in: plants, fishing, mining, fighting monsters, gathering resources, etc. You can do as much or as little of these as you like because most materials can be just bought or even commissioned - that's right, you can BE the source of a fetch quest for some NPC who will go do it off-screen and come back with 50 animal hides in a few days for you.

And the crafting itself is fantastically done. It's not just ""pick a recipe and instantly make the item"". Basic stuff works this way, but everything else either comes from machines that take time to process it (which means this life sim is actually an Automation game in disguise, and I love it) or from the assembly area where you make multiple things and put them together to make bigger stuff like machinery, vehicles and other grander projects that you can only do one at a time.

Mechanically, the game is a masterpiece. The writing is okay, on par with the genre. The social aspect has some improvements too (befriending someone also improves your standing with their friends and family, being friends with people has perks like discounts that the game tells you about, etc), even though it's not -my- focus it's good for people who are heavily into that aspect of the genre.

The only really bad thing I can say is that I turned off all the voice acting pretty much immediately after hearing it. Thankfully, the devs thought of that one, and when there is no VA, you instead get a classic-feeling text printing sound during the character's text box.

It's a launch-era PS2 JRPG throwback, and if you like Megaman Legends or Dark Cloud or Steambot Chronicles you will probably really enjoy this. 

Basically you show up to this town and get a shack where you have to do a series of public works projects that open up new resources and blueprints to upgrade your house. Getting around and fighting is pretty basic, but it works well enough, and isn't the focus of the game. Still, you will end up spending hours upon hours walking the same route over and over, or doing the same weapon combo on the same handful of enemy types. Adding a little bit of depth or variety (you can build a moped, but can't drive one) would massively improve the quality of these parts of the game.

The main thrust of the game is definitely building stuff and interacting with the townspeople. Building stuff is a lot of fun, and the game differs from farming simulators in that you mine/log/scavenge materials from elsewhere and then refine them on your property, doing little jobs for citizens or big jobs like making bridge parts or crane engines to unlock new parts of the map. You also bum around town and make friends with people, because everyone gives you some sort of nepotistic benefit if they like you, especially the fab receptionist. Making things is fun, but the contracts you take are always on a time limit, so instead of interacting with anyone ever (beyond the fab receptionist) I was always rushing so that the dickhead other builder guy who declares himself your rival never completed anything and would hopefully look like a massive tool every time he made a big deal about being better at my job than me in front of people. Fuck that guy, I would neglect anything if it meant driving him out of business. I honestly don't know what happens if you don't immediately steamroll every story job that comes your way because time pressure breaks me easier than rotten wood.
 

I don't really care about videogame dating but all the little village dudes are pretty chill and never complained about me leaving a bunch of unsupervised industrial equipment running at all hours so w/e. Turns out I just exclusively interacted with the fab receptionist because I wanted the contract bonuses he has as well as his coat. You can't get his coat though, I don't think. For the record, I think it's unfair that an NPC gets the badass feather trenchcoat considering I'm the guy getting up every morning and beating a bunch of pastel-colored wildlife to death with my bare hands for their materials. It would also be kind of cool to wear that journalist girl's frito bandito hat but I digress. Maybe if I wasn't so preoccupied with getting my builder rank as high as possible I would wander around and talk to folks more, but as it is the game proceeds forwards at a pretty steady clip regardless.

All in all, despite being a bit rudimentary in places, this game does a really good job producing that 4x effect where you just hop in quick to build one thing, and then six hours pass and your house is bigger and your production line's been completely reorganized and you have a 15-step plan for expansion that you've deluded yourself into thinking you can accomplish before dawn the next day.",1613094072,1613094072,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even if you've never played games like Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, or Stardew Valley, My Time At Portia is a good entry to the crafting/simulation genre.

Every time I hit something it's like the game freezes (not sure if intentionally, either way it looks like total dogshit) framerate keeps slowing down or stuttering when I do something like turn my camera too fast (even though my actual fps is capped at 60 and doesn't dip, it's just the actual game for some reason). Need a relatively decent PC to run this game even though it looks like a shittier version of Genshin Impact, only difference is one's optimized enough to run on your phone. Distant objects like trees, general foliage etc look blurry and is painful to look at. Characters look ""not quite right"" (something to do with the beady eyes I'd say). Every time you leave / enter a building you get a loading screen that's completely black for about 5 seconds (doesn't seem long, adds up really quickly). Music is extremely generic and default, doesn't really add to the mood or the vibe feels a bit out of place. Some textures like the cobblestone floor in the town look absolutely fucking abysmal even on the maximum settings.

All these things add up to a game that feels like it should be worth $2.50 instead of $40. I would urge anyone lucky enough to read this review before buying to go look a little deeper than just the very positive reviews, I don't really ever complain matter of fact this is my first negative review on steam but I really feel like I've been scammed and I'm thinking of potentially refunding.

I'd tried to look past these issues but it was just impossible, this game has been out for 3 years now but it runs, looks and feels like I'm playing an alpha version of it.

My Time at Portia is basically Stardew Valley in third person perspective with some extended social aspects and a few additional systems thrown in and more focus on building rather than farming. It is certainly a pleasant experience, which might, however drag out a bit too long if you're looking to experience everything. Luckily, using the Unity Mod Manager, there is a decent modding support and community around the game to help you fine-tune the game to your own preferences.

The game offers plenty of variety and does so in a great pace, it doesn't throw too much at you at the same time and neither does it rush in you in any way. It doesn't have time limits and in fact offers you the option to somewhat control the day length (even without mods). It has received quite a few updates and I think this its final iteration (the release at the time of writing says Final). If that is indeed the case, however, there are a few bits that are unfinished, like a few items without any or with limited purpose and the Museum is not ""completable"". Outside of those the game has more than enough content to keep you busy for hours (about 200 to 100%, at least in my case)

The game does so-so in the sound department, each area and season comes with different music, but it does manage to get repetitive. Especially the ruins (mining) music might eventually drive you nuts. It's a chill/relaxing tune, but you do end up hearing it a lot. Almost all characters are voiced, but somewhat spottily. Like they'll say 5 of their dialogues lines and then skip one. Not consistently, but you will notice it eventually.

I wouldn't say it's not worth the $30 asking price, but anything below $20 would be a good deal. Just don't forget to grab the free Swimwear DLC, it adds an extra set of clothing, which might not do much, but it does cost quite a bit so it can be a nice gold boost early on!",1612289865,1612974573,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I played this game during early access, before much story was implemented, and was very impressed with what was there, and looked forward to taking the time to play it again once it was complete. Here it is, 2 years after completion, and I have forced myself to find the time to play it. Too many games in the library I guess. But after playing the Sandrock beta version this past week, I really got into the world, so wanted more of it. 

After 30 hours over the weekend, I must say, I am loving this game. Yes, there are a few things here and there that still feels incomplete. As an example, that whole area behind the water plant just feels empty. It is a huge space, just left barren.

I also think I have done too good for my own good. I have been researching every day since day 2. Yet I keep getting commissions offered for things I can't make yet because I don't have the electric furnace. Here's to hoping that my next 20 discs gives me that.

Overall, if you don't already have this game, but like the simple style, buy this game. Combat is weak, but weirdly fun.

Jokes aside, My Time At Portia is a little tedious at times but if you enjoy other offerings in the genre such as the Harvest Moon series or Stardew Valley you'll probably have a good time here. Everything people enjoy in the genre is present here, you can customize the furnishings of your house (furniture gives stat buffs which is super cool), you can find a waifu or husbando, you can farm plants or materials to craft your own products, and you can own various livestock. There's even a combat system, though it manages to be only slightly more engaging than Runescape. 

If you're trying to decide between the Steam version and the Switch version (I have both because a mobile iteration was too good to pass up) I highly encourage you to stick with the Steam version especially if you have a decent computer.

You start off with a tiny little workshop and the game says off you go. It's time to start chopping trees, gathering ores etc etc. You can upgrade every aspect of your workshop: available space, your house, the buildings available to you, your crafting facilities. There are daily requests for items/components in the form of commissions from residents that keep you busy, as well as numerous side quests and an overarching story.

If you've ever played a game and a quest giver has asked you to collect 5 items, and you've thought to yourself while I'm here I'll gather a few more just in case, then returned to the quest giver with 200 of the item, then you'll love this game. It is a hoarders dream.

I don't think I've ever played a game before that has had so much thought put in to quality of life features. For example the inventory system. You can keep paying more and more to unlock ungodly amounts of inventory space, because why not. That's on top of the fact that you have essentially unlimited storage capacity at your workshop because you can build as many storage boxes as you want. Not only that all the storage boxes are linked. You can access any one storage box and then access any other from it from a drop down list of storage boxes that you can also rename. On top of that you can move all items out from your inventory to workshop storage, auto sorting into piles that already exist with one click.

It has some minor issues, but they don't really impact the gaming experience. There are a couple of features I've come across that feel like they were only part implemented. I.e. the horse, you press E to interact with it, it says what do you want to do (although you only have one option), you click pet the horse, you pet the horse, then it says what do you want to do now (pet the horse again, which will have no effect, or go back). My point is the only choice is pet the horse, why doesn't pressing E just pet the horse.

You'll be kept busy most days gathering resources, processing said resources into ingots/planks etc or upgrading your stuff, but there is also a museum for you to populate with relics you find. Fishing is also in there for good measure.

Harvesting, mining, interacting with people in the town. You do lots of quests, if you like quest completion that alone might be enough to tip you over the edge.

It looks and works a lot like Harvest Moon. But it's crossed with a ""help us improve the town"" theme underneath it that reminds me more of Animal Crossing. Which is brilliant, really - I never knew how much I wanted ""let's put Harvest Moon in Animal Crossing."" 

But that isn't where it ends. There is also a storyline I'm only a bit into which deals with an ideological battle between religion and science, and suggests that there may be some difficult choices farther along into it. And there's a mining engine which looks very much like someone did a ""Minecraft with no cubes"" game, except it's better than that sounds. And there are buried rooms which are kind of like little dungeons, which remind me of Dark Cloud. 

Another thing that reminds me of Dark Cloud is that the fishing minigame isn't utter garbage. I mean, it's not a great fun game that I enjoy all on its own, but when there's a quest where I have to go fishing I don't wail and rend my garments and lament that God has forsaken me. It's actually not a bad little minigame. It's not something I get excited about and say ""oh BOY, I get to go FISHING!"" - but then, it never is. 

MTAP, at its core, feels like a love letter to all the old console games that for some reason aren't just not being made for PC - they're not being made at all. Not like they used to, anyway, with a deliberate and distinct effort to IMPROVE the previous entry instead of simply rehashing it with just enough ""BUT NOW"" to make people feel like they have to buy it. MTAP is wonderfully done and addresses a great many of the issues with those old titles; not only isn't the fishing game garbage, you get reasonable notifications that an event is about to occur, reminders of important dates, letters in the mail about things you can do. 

I could nitpick a lot of things, but I won't. It's unfair. You can nitpick anything, and that would just distract from FAR too many things done 100% right. I can't possibly list them all. I could list all my nitpicks, but I couldn't even come close to listing everything this game is doing better than pretty much every other game I have ever played. 

In the end, My Time at Portia doesn't just manage to cram a half dozen different kinds of game into one package, it does a great job on... all of them. Absolutely no part of this game feels rushed or haphazard or like someone's just checking off boxes. Everything it does, they have taken the time to do it right, so people who love that part will be happy with it. And since they've pulled four games I love under one banner and done all of them well, I love this game, too. It's fantastic. It's wonderful. You should try it.

Now having played well over 1,000 hours and continuing, if I don't write this review now, I'll never get it done.
So here goes!

Clearly this is perhaps my favourite genre of game!  I first got into this kind of building, crafting and battling role-playing mix, years ago on a PS2 playing a character called Toan in Dark Cloud by Level-5, the first of the kind I believe... this was followed by Dark Chronicle (Dark Cloud 2) playing Max... Max was given a camera with which he would take photos to capture 'ideas', and with these invent new things, it was also responsible for turning 'clowns' into something terrifying and scary, and may have left the more impressionable of the time, scarred for life!
There were rumours of a Dark Cloud 3 but that never happened. The last of the series was 'Rogue Galaxy' with very challenging gameplay, and a good story... unfortunately, I never got to play it, initially it was only available in Japan... I was part-way through Dragon Quest VIII when my early and backward compatible PS3 gave-up one hot summer - OOh a long time ago.

One major difference between those games and 'My Time At Portia is you get to create your own character. I went with the name 'Sway', of course because of the forward-roll.  I think the developers really got into making this game, and it shows in game-play and detail of this game. While it is not without bugs, the plot and characters are intricate and well thought out, though sometimes a little repetitive, it is family-friendly and 'My Time At Portia' is a landmark of the genre, if this is your bag, you will like me - have trouble putting it down, or, as an escape I thoroughly recommend it! While I am a completion-ist, I am currently spinning it out, and will continue to visit like the Mystery Salesman and spend a little time 'at Portia'.

With 'Sway', initially, I assumed that 'Pa' had left him with his aunt - and her two older daughters. Who treated him a bit like a dress-makers dummy, his only escape... was fishing, so when he got the message that 'Pa' had left him  his workshop, he rushed off, and was on the boat and fast as his feet would take him.

This brings me to a few critiques of the game!

The pool around the fountain in Peach Plaza, no matter how hard I jump, I cannot splash and soak Sonia's dress, and get her shouting at Sway.  Likewise with Higgins, while some, might like the sport of punching him, I feel kind-of sorry for the guy, and would rather give him a little nudge when he gets annoying, so that he steps into the water, and while he's shaking-off his shoe and trouser-leg, Sway nips-in to get's first dibs in the Commerce Guild.

It would also be nice, to be able to go fishing with play-buddies, to go off on fishing trips, quite apart from the annual competition.

Particularly, when Emily persists on lingering, and give us 'the profile'! I mean Emily is a nice girl and all, but her hormones are clearly in overdrive, and well Sway isn't read for that. Sam on the other hand, is a mate, a buddy, she is there in a fight when you need her (though some might argue with that), unfortunately she does annoyingly keep calling Sway 'little guy'! Ok he is a little guy, but she doesn't have to keep-on about it! She means well I suppose, and dedicated to her job, not the domestic type, which is fine, but you can't take her off for a fishing-break, or for a bit of peace and quite away from the week-job.

So yes, a 'fishing-break' would have been a nice addition... I don't suppose there will be any fishing in Sandrock... I mean the name says it all, it's just desert! Isn't it?",1611004575,1611066575,True,23,2,0.614483058452606201,3,True,False,False

My current issue that I just shrug off since I've caught all the fish I need, is that my Master Fishing Rod disappeared from my inventory one day. This item is a one time item so having a way for the Museum Curator give us a recipe to make it would be nice.
Kids don't grow up in this game so get ready to throw a baby bottle at your kid and rush out to accomplish your goals for the day.

If you played Fallout ever just depend on your previous saves for this game. I've had to do this to avoid having kids and getting my Master Fishing Rod back.

 Throughout the game you receive various  commissions (jobs) via the residents of Portia or you can take them from the Commerce Guild,  the jobs you can complete vary depending on your experience and relationship with the characters.   As the game progresses the requirements for crafting the various items gets more complicated requiring you to upgrade your equipment. The map will also expand as you progress though the game.  Apart from the crafting side of the game, various challenges require combat of Post-Apocalyptic monsters to aid this you can craft various weapons.  Despite cartoon like graphics the game is in-depth and challenging.
  The game remains challenging throughout for both good and bad reasons, which I will try to explain below.

The challenge requires work it's not handed to you on a plate and money does not solve all your issues you have to trade at time to obtain better equipment or materials.  Whilst it is possible to both modify the game and to cheat, you don't really benefit from doing that.

The story line is not linear but some missions are meaning its possible for the player to complete missions before the story line actually requires them to be done this for the most part does not matter but some parts can be spoilt by early completion,  For the most part it's well though out but it lacks execution in part due to the chat interface which i will go into later. Missions have a set time to be completed and some will only appear if a certain set of sequences have been achieved.

The chat interface is horrific, where chat is part of a mission its fine, but building relationships (a game requirement) gets very tedious, very quickly.  Listening to the same lines over and over is the single biggest downfall of this game. Dating requires that you score points, points can be obtained by listening to the character, but its the same answers every time.  Even after marriage the chat remains the same.

Item crafting times, they vary but in some cases completing a task can take (in-game) days if you need this to progress the game it can get very depressing.  Certain materials can  only be obtained from 1 or 2 sources and the frequency of re-spawning is very slow (crystals for example) others can only be obtained from certain areas of the map, which may not have been unlocked yet.

It is possibly only through sites such as the 'fandom' wiki that will truly allow you to discover all the features of this game, the in game tutorial does not go in-depth enough and somehow misses things which later seem important. Despite the game being in its final release, some of the games bugs still exist and in certain cases can force the player to restore the game to an earlier point even restarting, the most significant bug for me is the camera and its associated missions Namely Mei and Penny who without the camera working properly cannot have their missions finished fully.  It is possible that 'Pathia' have moved on from this game and will never fix the bugs as they move to the 2021 release of 'My time is Sandrock' this games sequal.",1610715274,1610715274,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I understood it was early access and even still the game was smooth and easily playable with great and addicting crafting progression. I came back to the game after a while and hoping to enjoy it just as much, if not more since they added new content, and I was sorely disappointed. Almost immediately I was slapped in the face with fps drops. After upgrading my computer since the last time the game was played I actually had to reduce the graphics to play without skips, and then whenever something new happened in the game it would freeze for literal seconds.

For the most part after the initial spikes the game runs relatively okay. That is until the hazardous ruins. With a few unfortunate fps drops here and there I made it to the final boss. Not even half way into the bosses HP the game freezes solid which led to an ALT F4, losing all progression that day. I do enjoy this game a lot, it scratches that itch incredibly well for a progressive simulator. However I cannot recommend this game in the current state.

This is most definitely my favorite and most played game on Steam. It was reccomended as a game that I may like in the Sims community and they didn't lie. 

It is hard to understand at first as not everything is clearly explained.. but after watching a quick youtube vid of beginners tips and tricks I knew what to do. 

There is so much to this game.. There's a Craft/building aspect.. a social aspect.. a fighting aspect with boss battles (I'm not a fan of fighting games i'm scared don't judge but I actually really like it in this game) There is always goals to achieve and things to do. & you level up in the process. 

The graphics and art is beautiful and I really like the story. Iv'e been playing for a while and I still feel like there is so much more to explore and do.. I really like that about the game. 

I think its well worth the money. 10 stars.

If so, I think Portia might be for you. 

While it can be rough around the edges, namely the voice work being sort of incomplete, I still found it very addicting and fun. You will inherit a plot of land and small shack and fill the role of one of the town builders. The story takes place after a disastrous event, making this game technically post-apocalyptic, despite it's cheery atmosphere. Because of this, you will use old data mined up to figure out new designs with the help of local scientists. 

While you hone your new career, friendships and romance are forged too. Your neighbors are interesting, with their own stories, and are mostly voice acted well. The relationship quests are quite fun too. 

Pros:
-Easy to pick up and learn
-Pretty chill and relaxing
-Interesting story
-A life simulator not built around farming, nothing wrong with it but it's a nice change of pace
-Takes quite a bit of time to complete the main story, so a good value for the $

Cons:
-Can be a tad buggy (I didn't have anything gamebreaking after several play throughs)
-Some lines don't have audio still
-Endgame gets a bit tedious, however the replay value is good 
-Outfit choices are lacking, but this is slightly remedied after a certain quest is completed
-Combat is almost too simple

Things I feel were missed:
-There isn't a ton of variety to do indoor decor
-Some more substance after you are married, there are quests but they get repetitive and quickly get ignored
-There isn't much customization for the appearance of your home

Overall, if you are a fan of games like animal crossing or stardew valley, I think this game is worth a look. There is also a demo if you aren't sure.",1610652842,1610652842,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's never a point in the game where you don't have something you need to be doing, and the ebb and flow of time in the game gives you just enough time to get enough done so that you can start the next morning ready to finish your task or start on a new project.

Too bad instead of fixing the game's many issues, the company has already decided to move on to their next project: this game but more sandy. If you buy this game, the only updates you will ever see is them trying to get you to preorder/wishlist their new game. Which, despite making money off of this game, they still needed a kickstarter for, with goals going up to 5 million dollars. To add a mechanic in which children grow up. For 5 million USD. In no way is MTaP or it's sequel games that cost so much to produce they need 5 million dollars on top of whatever they made selling this game. Shady company practices should influence your willingness to spend money on their games, when you know they don't care about giving you a good product.

In a lot of ways, this game feels like an alpha. The characters have dead, soulless eyes, and watching them move in cut scenes feels... gross. And not all the dialogue is actually recorded, because the company behind this game didn't want to pay their voice actors â¥ Though the voice acting in this game is overall Bad. Not just bad acting, but bad quality, because this company couldn't afford to get a professional recording booth to have the actors use, and instead of hiring someone to do one voice in their home and send them the recording, find VAs who can voice multiple characters, and hence save them money in the long run, were they to ever properly pay their actors. Seriously, they apparently had over 60+ people do voice work. There's so many glaringly awful things that need to be fixed in this game, but the company won't do anything about it.

The mining in this game is one of my favourite features, I love that you can shape the earth around you, rather than the classic styles of mining in Stardew and Story of Seasons where you just til the earth. The farming mechanic doesn't really satisfy me, it leaves a lot to be desired. You just add manure to plants to keep them happy, and wait for the real time timer to finish. And the fishing is also odd as well. It's not really explained well in game, despite being a relatively easy concept. I do like that instead of passing out if you use up all of your energy, the game instead just doesn't let you use your tools until you rest up. You can also increase your inventory storage at any moment, if you have the money to spare. If you have multiple chests, you can also switch to any of them from one chest, making storage a much more manageable element of the game if you obsessively sort all your items like me. You can also move the chests without needing to empty them.

This is not a farming game, there's just some farming elements. The main focus is on resource collecting so that you can build items for the town and its people. There is combat in this game, but the combat is very simple, and very flawed. One enemy I fought would jump into the air, and I could still hit where it had been on the ground because the hitbox didn't move. I could also collide with this invisible box, despite that rat being 20 ft in the air. You just swing and dodge. You can also endlessly roll, because rolling at the end of your energy bar doesn't require a specific amount of energy to roll. A normal roll can cost say, 20 stam, but you can regen 5 stam and roll again, and in that time, regen 5 stam, and roll again, and it just never stops. Rolling using up stamina is pointless. You can endlessly roll.

I bought this game on sale, and if you absolutely must buy it, get it when it's $10 or so, it's not worth the full price. I bought this game, and had I waited a few weeks, I could have gotten it for free on Epic, which honestly, would make the value of what little they have in this game that actually works, worth it. This game also just. Doesn't run well. At all. It has some weird issues with optimization, and even when running it on the lowest graphics settings on my pc, it still has to freeze whenever it tries to load a cut scene. In fact, any loading screen just freezes the game for a bit. This issue also persists on the two laptops I've tried running the game on, despite all three machines exceeding the recommended specs. Hopefully they'll add that as the next kickstarter goal for their third game. 

Anyway, buy this game if you want all the latest updates on My Time at Sandrock, and to have this game's issues continually ignored by the devs â¥",1610390326,1610390326,False,2,0,0.491515517234802246,0,True,False,False

Fast forward a few months and I finally have enough to build my own PC. I then decide hey, let me give Portia another go. Despite not caring for it on my switch, I heard good things about it on PC, and something just continued to draw me towards the game.

 At first, I hated it. Didn't like the voice acting, the dead look each npc has, the scaling, (why is a door 3x bigger than me??) But my bf bought it for me, so I wasn't about to let his money go to waste lol-so I continued playing despite all that. I soon realized that I have been spoiled with all the AAA games I've played, and that these small issues I saw should not take away from my gaming experience. I needed to think of Portia as a game made by a smaller indie company-I began comparing it to Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, some of my favorite casual games-and I suddenly realized why I kept playing despite not being hooked at first. 

This game has so much charm. It gets ADDICTING. There is just so much you can do! FIsh, build, romance, mine, cook!

It turned out to be quite a gem, a great little crafting-centric game.  If you have a penchant for such games, this will be come addictive, especially if you like to compete.  Having not researched before playing, I was rather pleasantly surprised by the science fiction overtones of the game.  It certainly added flavor to the crafting portion, playing as one of the builders helping to bring humanity back to life.

The game is refreshingly light on bugs.  There were minor irregularities (misspelled dialog text, voice acting incomplete, Emily's Stand never actually seemed to be open on the 23rd of Winter, etc.), but I never encountered a single game-breaking issue, something of a rarity in the current gaming climate.

I have to applaud the art direction.  It is caricaturized, but not to excess, providing charm to its world that felt very comfortable.  Come to think of it, compared to some other games, the crafting process itself is also fairly caricaturized.

A few playing tips...

[olist]
  [*]Set up a Factory as soon as you can.  You'll have more time for adventuring and hobbies when you aren't having to hang around your grounds to manually manage your production process;
  [*]Get a mount as soon as possible.  It's a travel-time saver over running; I even continued to favor my fully trained horse over the Dee Dee transport system, and I was able to win the Land Race pretty handily every time;
  [*]With regard to the end game, [spoiler]pay attention to Titanium Ore, Crystals and Sapphires as soon as you can.  You'll need a respectable stock of these for the end-game challenge[/spoiler];
  [*]If you aren't interested in competing with Higgins, there are a couple of tricks you can use to reduce his standing.  I didn't use these while playing (the Factory helped me stay way ahead of him), but I did verify that they work with the current release after I finished the main story line.  [spoiler]To force him to take a commission with lower reputation points, after accepting your own commission, immediately open another (preferably with a potential for high reputation points) and leave it open while he is examining the board.  He won't be able to select the one you have open, and after he has chosen, you can simple close it.  You can also completely block him from even getting a commission from the board by hassling him inside the Commerce building, repeatedly interacting with him and physically blocking him from the board, until the game clock reaches 9am, at which point he'll simply leave without any commission at all[/spoiler].
[/olist]

I highly recommend this game, having certainly enjoyed My (own) Time At Portia.

[b]UPDATE[/b]:  I don't know if I perhaps completed the main story line faster than I was supposed to, or if this is simply the way the game was designed, but completing the main story line is apparently [i]not the end of the game[/i].  I was about to stop playing, thinking that every subsequent day would just be the same thing over and over, but unique events have continued to occur.",1609523085,1610030759,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've finished the majority of the storyline, almost at the end of year 2, and this is what I think:

Good:
- The main story for me was compelling and I was eager to find out what would happen next
- You cannot deny the visuals are absolutely stunning
- There are lots of things to do: mining for resources and artifacts, fishing, monster hunting, etc.
- Every resource you gather you will actually need, it's not pointless
- Free DLC protagonist swimwear
- For me the experience was relaxing but kinda grindy at the same time. I quite liked that though because it was something I had to work for
- The playtime/dating activities are fun (although I haven't tried them all yet) 
- I liked the fact that you can return furniture back to its original colour by just placing it back into your inventory (instead of paying extra money/resources to change it back)
- Search for treasure chests in various locations (not mission related, just gives you items. Extremely useful at the beginning of the game)

Bad:
- Sometimes glitches/freezes for a second but isn't much of an issue
- Combat is pretty mundane but it's fine
- I've only cooked a couple of recipes for missions but I no like pls no
- Although I will be pursuing a romance, I'm just not excited for it. The characters are just not very interesting to me. Stardew Valley however were very interesting and I was more than eager to start romancing/building relationships with them

I really hope in their upcoming game (coming out this March/April) they will add a lot more depth into their characters. That is pretty much the only thing I didn't like about this game.

I would definitely recommend this, though. It's up there in my top 5 chill back and relax games; and, if you like Stardew Valley, then you'll probably love My Time at Portia.",1609937272,1609937272,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

     Lets get the good out of the way first, with these types of games that have stamina to do a limited amount of things per day (stardew valley is an example) can be a thorn in the side.  However this game has multiple ways to replenish your stamina, from buying food, eating at the restaurant ect, it helps you experience more of what you want or need to do a bit quicker and is appreciated.    The combat animations is entertaining to watch (especially glove weapons or unarmed combat).  Fast travel that you unlock helps get around and save time of the day as well is a great idea as well, though I'd wish it was available earlier.  The concept of the world is a great twist on the post apocalyptic scene.  Going into different mine-like areas to gather ore and getting pieces of artifacts is fun and silly to find what you can get (and bonus stats for what you have in your home is ingenious).  The voice acting of the different npcs is interesting, as each voice matches the character pretty well.  One of the biggest things that I liked about this game, was the crafting station, how you had to use separate pieces and  put them together is more fun than it should be.  And finally, the llamas are so cute and adorable, if they were a plushy, I would buy one.

  Now for the Cons and I'l start with the biggest elephant in the room, the graphics.  I'm not one to rag on graphics in a game (I could play a game of 2 blocks smashing each other if it was fun) but my goodness, why does every wall look like its been badly painted over.  The character models are pretty bad too, I couldn't really talk to the npcs for too long and pay attention cause I kept getting distracted by everything.  At the beginning, the progression is way too slow unless you know absolutely what you need to do and when (good example is getting as much fish from the fishing tournament because that gives you a huge lead on money early on and helps you get out of the snail's pace that the start is).  While the combat animation is awesome to look at, the combat itself is basically rush in and hit them until they attack and you roll away (if they don't get stun locked the entire time), and you can easily lose A LOT of stamina quickly in combat as every blow drains it.  Speaking of combat, when your close to an enemy and attack, your attack auto-locks onto the opponent, even if your not aiming in that direction, or trying to hit multiple targets but aiming yourself, the game will lock you into the closest target and prioritize that one.  This takes control away from you and can lead to frustrations (like enemies you would otherwise hit to stun them to keep them from hitting you).  Next is the fast travel, while it is awesome to have it in the first place, unlocking it can be rather tedious and (again if you don't know it is even there) unexpected and cause you to, again, get frustrated by wasting your time doing something that could of only cost you so little time to do (example would be trying to get into town to sell/buy stuff and your at the tree farm, which is about 1-2 in game hours away and you find out you can use fast travel like 10 HOURS into the game to only use up about a quarter of that).  Some of the movement in this game is... odd to say the least, like some parts of the structures that obviously doesn't look like you can jump on yet you can to scale walls.  As I stated before, the voice acting is great, but it doesn't really follow the text shown a lot, which in itself, can get distracting to some.  Other than the graphics though the biggest obstacle in this entire game... is the time each day.  It goes by so fast for what they want you to do each day (or even what you want to do).  A lot of the time I had to prioritize the entire day doing one specific thing and with no fast travel at the beginning, I can see the time issue annoying a lot of players trying to get into the game.  And it wants you to take your time and experience this game at your own pace, but events and random npc quests popping up out of the blue (with their own time limits)  can force you to prioritize than and get you worked up.

  All in all, if you think you can handle the issues I found with this game, grab it for yourself, you'll enjoy it.  As for me, I'll probably pick it up from time to time to play for like 30 minutes at a time, but probably will get too annoyed if I try to play it for any longer than that at once.",1609535704,1609535704,False,4,0,0.488256901502609253,0,True,False,False

+I really had fun with the mini games, like fighting your neighbour or jumping over rooftops to get treasures. The socializing is hard for me, because there are like only 1 or 2 greetings for each villager, so every day when I say hi they just repeat their phrase. But I really hope those are just placeholders.

~the gameplay is a bit rough around the edges, there still is much polishing to do. (bought it on 18th July) 

For example: The crafting system is such a pain. I hope the developers will take out the 'must have it in your hand to craft this' and change it into 'have it in your inventory/box in the house'. Or give the player the free choice about what he wants to see on his screen: I'd love to toggle out the minimap and explore on my own or put this Quests in the diary where it belongs, not under my nose on the middle-right Screen.
And at the waterfall I just fell into a gap in the map, when I was sightseeing. Surprisingly I didn't die but I couldn't figure out why the earth under my feet just disappeared. Shouldn't climb so high, I guess.

-the reading speed is much too fast, when there is no voice over; and the Message in the beginning of the game was only showed for what felt like 2 seconds and I didn't even get to read 2 of the 10 lines, which was annoying. xD I really want to read the stuff I have paid for, please give me a free choice option to click the dialogue away, when I'm done reading.

The time runs out very fast, which made me a little sad. I like to explore a lot and take my time to take in the scenery, but on 90% of the days I don't even get in town before the shops close. It's a pain... and when you read the dialogue the time around you will not freeze as in other rpgs, it will just keep going. So I will wait for the game to be out in my native language, it's much too stressed out for me at the moment. And I have to admit I'm scared of the clown-lamas. Their faces are really something.


Edit: 

Thank you for the fast response. I had some other ideas while playing, hope I can help you with my impressions. The game is really nicely done but has some funkillers, too. 

*making friends and staying friends: Maybe an 'hi'-button would solve the problem, when the player doesn't have enough time to chat with all of the townsfolk but wants to say hello, while he rushes pass them. I really liked the function in other games (Story of Seasons, Trio of Towns has it) and it saves much time and feels more natural than rereading the same dialogue over and over again

*more tutorials: I like the fact that you have to discover alot in Portia for yourself, but some really important things should be highlighted or designed more userfriendly. For example the Buy/Sell Menu from the Shops - I found the little arrow for the next shopping menu after 40 hours into the game. And wondered why nobody wanted to sell me tea at all.

Or the Photo-Button. It's a genious feature, but at the moment I had the impression you could only make photos while meeting NPCs in the game that are your friends. The funcion is very hidden in two submenus and a little left out in the corner.

*Wishlist: Call the horse button or an item like a whistle. I don't like it that it bugs out when it follows me around everywhere (getting caught up in Doors, etc when it catches up with my 'running' in front of it) and it would be just really nice to have it at hand

*Make the Boss fights optional. I had a hard time following the mainstory, because the fights are pretty tough. I don't want to mine or dungeon-diving and fighting at all but you have to if you want the ressources. So I'd wanted to ask if you could give some more room to free playing - ores and cloths sell as well at the moment. Why not sell drops from monsters at the local flying pig station, fruits from trees and other foraging stuff for all of us who doesn't want to pick warm dung by themselves.

*Sometimes the fighting music bugges out - it starts after I killed 3 monsters and doesn't end until I initiate another fight. It's more annoying than 'relaxing'

*The invisible bug happened to me, too. But I think so many players did send you this bug that you should come up with a solution by now.

Please have fun and keep going! I really look forward to more storyelements of my favorite characters (I love your designs for the people alot, hope the writing will keep up with it ) and wish you all a good time in Portia. :steamhappy:

Edit: January 2020: This game is abandoned, and the developers are starting a new game project. I really hate to say that after all this time this project feels like a rip off to me. Because the game is NOT finished. It is NOT beyond a Beta stage and there are so many things missing (over half of the voices) or buggy or just SLOW that I am just sad to never ever touch a game from this company again.

The game runs well, and apart from the bugs here and there, is extremely fun to play. The voice acting is very well done, and I love the story through and through; it is very engaging!

The style of the game is certainly unique, but definitely not bad! The romance-able characters each have varying stories and depth, most of which are nicely done. The character creator has a unique amount of options, and I often find myself lingering for a while to get the perfect looking character.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, there are definitely aspects of this game that feel unfinished and a little too buggy: and it is exponentially disappointing that the developers are already moving on and working on a 'sequel' for this game when this one still has some work to be done.

For example, children never grow up and your spouse hardly ever even acknowledges their existence; something I find to be kind of annoying. Farming in the game could also use a fair bit of work, as I feel it's not as fleshed out as it could be; though this isn't to say it's necessarily 'bad' as it is now.

On another note, if you aren't into having to grind fairly frequently in games, especially in the beginning, perhaps this game isn't for you, but in my opinion the grinding is far worth the outcome!

The game's visual and audio stylings are quite pleasant.  Sometimes the audio direction is a little flawed (eg different characters have different pronunciations for Portia) and does not always match the text (presumably late-development re-writes), but this does not detract from the game.  The characters are varied and (mostly) interesting, and the core gameplay provides a good variety of tasks (eg mining, gathering, crafting, socialising, etc).

One of my complaints is that the core gameplay loop scales-up a little roughly.  It feels a bit like you just learned how to crawl and are suddenly asked to run the 800m.  A few smaller quests to ramp this more smoothly would have helped.  As it is, this is just a bit of a nasty surprise for the player.  Once you adjust, the rest of the game mostly runs smoothly --- there are a few other, smaller hiccoughs along the way.

The combat is also pretty ordinary.  The system is fairly basic and not particularly enjoyable.  90% of the game lets you ignore combat, but the final hours of the main quest are combat-heavy.  In a game that is all about building things, these late-game combat sections feel a little out-of-place and less enjoyable than the rest of the game had been.

+ The world looks great. And the game has a great artstyle.
+ The seasonal music is the bees' knees.
+ There's some pretty cute platforming and secrets all around. Exploration as well as making weird jumps gets rewarded often. (Though the reward itself isn't worth it very often, I'd say just finding the treasure chest is the real reward.)

+/- There's a couple great townfolk, but also a lot of one-dimensional uninteresting ones. Especially when there's a triplet AND a septuplet(7) all in the same town. Seems kinda lazy.
+/- There's like no replay value, every playthrough will be VERY alike (except for romancing I guess). That's not too great for a farming sim. 

-- There is so much inefficient loading!!! And I'm not talking about just loading screens though those are plentiful too. I'm talking about a frame-freeze every 5 seconds of horse-riding through the world. The special effects all need loading and freeze the game a bit. Something as simple as a sword-swing's special effects causes freeze frames. You can turn off special effects but some enemy attacks are nothing but special effects. If you decide to turn it off, prepare to be hit by enemies' invisible attacks a whole lot. Though being hit by invisible attacks is better than frame freezing every special effect.
-- Unresponsive controls. Navigating menus with unresponsive controls. Because every move you do takes a fraction of a second to be processed but it's enough to force you to wait that fraction of a second before pressing another button. That makes navigating menus pretty tedious.
- The worst sound-design I've ever heard in any game. Sometimes there's not even sound effects, even in cutscenes. And that's not cuz it didn't load or whatever. It's because sound effects were just not done for a lot of things. However you might prefer that over hearing some of the actual sound effects, cuz they are often truly awful, loud and unfitting.
- There's a lot of tiny things that are kinda annoying. Like the music stopping whenever you open your inventory, which you do a lot. There is a pause button for silence too so I dunno why the other menu has to be quiet. Another tiny thing (for me) is how needlessly heavy the game is. A lot of similar games are a lot lighter, but this game really got my computer fans work overtime. Another small thing is no controller configuration? Not a whole lot of settings in general.

That's a lot of negatives right? Regardless, I still enjoyed this game a lot. I just wish the dev team had a coder. Or they oughta make less ambitious games.",1609343109,1609343109,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

It feels like an unfinished, early access game. 

The voice acting is extremely cringey. The characters are flat and boring. Plenty of marriage prospects but I can't bring myself to care enough about any of them (either gender) to invest any time in romancing them.

There's an endless amount of open-world space which is simply fast expanses of nothing. 

The ""farming"" seems to be slapped in as a token gesture towards other farming simulators. You don't even have to water your crops, and there's only a handful of crops to choose from. The animals are elaborate furniture which just drop several items like fur and milk every day (you don't even have to interact with them, they just drop them on the ground).

The combat is so, sooooo bad. It's just button mashing and stun locking enemies until they're dead. The dungeons are repetitive mobs of creatures to kill without any sense of adventuring, progress or discovery. 

The mining/resource collection is simply a big empty minecraft-style cave (without anything fun inside) that you pick away at to reveal ore. 

The music is really bad too. I doubled my enjoyment playing this (which isn't a lot) by muting it and listening to my own music. 

For how much there is to do in the game, I constantly find myself bored. You collect resources, put them in their respective machines to process, and wait. Assemble item, rinse and repeat.

I'm honestly really confused by all the positive reviews this game is getting. I'll go back and play through Stardew Valley for the fifth time instead.",1609293408,1609293521,False,2,1,0.511319935321807861,0,True,False,False

It feels like time flies as you progress through the game and become better at crafting. There is so much freedom to do what you want, that I start to not care that I didn't craft a guy's fishing pole in time. The only consequence for not fulfilling a commission in time is missing out on about 20g and xp. It is easy to follow the game, but I strongly recommend bookmarking the wiki to help with finding materials, recipes, or npc gift preferences. It is a challenging but very rewarding game with the right amount of everything. There's combat, depth, upgrades, hostile ladybugs, treasures, and building.

For smooth game performance, the graphics settings I used are 1280x768 with ""Good"" graphics and v-sync + precipitation off. Frames unlimited. The rain effects are stunning, but it isn't really worth fps drops. 

Additional Notes:
-I'd describe this game like if Minecraft and Animal Crossing had a baby. And it sure is a beautiful creation.
-This game combines simulation and RPG elements to give you a bit of everything! (Probably not suited for competitive hardcore gamers. Maybe more for casual go-at-your-own-pace type of gamers.) In other words, you do need patience to play the game because it goes a long way with the rewards you reap.

There are some slight grammatical and continuity issues but compared to the wealth of gameplay that you get, it pales in comparison. You can think of it as Stardew Valley/Story of Seasons with a dash of Minecraft in 3D.

Pros:
-Rich storyline, a lot of past storyline built in
-A lot fof customization options for your character
-a huge, open world for you to explore and interact with
-crafting, mining, cooking, fighting, farming, relationships, etc.- a lot of gameplay mechanics
-super addictive

Cons:
-optimization is not the best, there are some loading freezes; overall, this is not the game to look for if you are looking for something super polished
-can only save while you sleep
-will take a lot of effort to get deep into the game (for example, you will need to probably spend the first little bit upgrading tools as your beginning tools are very weak)
-daily dialogue is very, very repetitive

Overall: My Time at Portia is a pleasant surprise.

Like the weak voice acting, the wobbly animations, the poor presentation of what seems to be an interesting post-post apocalyptic turned solarpunk society, the emptiness of Portia in proportion to it's size, or even how grindy some of the crafting can get. It's sort of disconcerting, but in a weird way it kinds of adds on the charm. MTAP sort of feels like one of those big off-brand doll houses you used to play with as a kid.

Saw it on the store page, and thought it looked really cute, and wanted to give it a try, but wasn't really expecting much from it, thought it'd just be a random little game filled with mini-games and contests I'd get bored of quickly. Well, I was wrong, lol :D Within the first couple days of playing, I was hooked, there's so much to do!! Tons of fun and exciting things that makes this game addictive, and still, to this day, keeps me entertained :D I didn't review this game straight away, only until now, to give this game time, so, in case I liked it (which I do, absolutely :D), I could understand enough about the game to tell you what makes this game so good.

The central theme around this game is building: your character is basically a builder, when you start the game, there's a cut scene where you arrive by sea at the village of Portia, where you are immediately greeted by a guy called Presley, who shows you where you'll be staying, at a little cottage (your workshop, where you build and craft stuff; it can be customised, expanded and upgraded later on, too) just outside the village of Portia. From there, you embark on an exciting adventure in lots of areas :) 
Here's what makes this game so great:
 
1. It has a story plot, a really exciting one! And it's long, I've played this game for this many hours, and only just finished it. It takes you on a really exciting adventure filled with suspense, especially towards the end, from accepting quests from people and building stuff for them (there's one part where you need to build a drill-like contraption to access mines in the desert), to infiltrating facilities crawling with enemies. New characters get introduced into the game as you progress in the story, really cool :) 

2. Huge crafting opportunities. The amount of things you can craft and build in this game is monumental, it's awesome :) This game is actually very much like Minecraft, where you have a hotbar to equip things like tools, weapons, etc. and also an inventory, where you can store things you collect, build, or craft. You can also craft storage chests and stuff like that, to store them in there, too. You can also buy or craft outfits for your character (in-game, I mean, apart from the DLCs), like worker outfits, or cute little dresses, etc. ^_^ You can do a variety of things to craft and build things, whether it's going out and chopping down trees, hunting animals and monsters for parts, mining, fishing, producing copper, bronze or iron bars in furnaces, or simply just buying materials from stores in the Portia village :) You can even plant and harvest lots of different plants for food or materials to craft things.

3. Huge open world exploration. The open world in this game is really awesome, there's the village of Portia, and other areas like the desert, which you have access to when you progress further in the story. There's caves and ruins where you can mine for ore or hunt monsters. There's a big variety of animals and monsters around multiple areas you can hunt for parts to craft materials.

4. Quests, bunches and bunches of quests, or tasks/missions. In Portia village, there is a building that operates as a guild center, where you can go to a billboard and accept tasks or quests from the NPC characters in Portia. All of these require you to build something, and, accepting and completing them is a great way to make money, because they will reward you with a currency you use to buy things in Portia, gold coins called 'Gols.' The reward of gols is either minimal or substantial, depending on the quest or task's rank (from D up to S). Completing these quests and tasks also raises your relationship with the NPC person you accepted the quest from, on completion; basically a fast way to build relationships with the people in Portia. 
You can accept one quest at a time, once per day, from Monday-Friday. On Saturdays and Sundays, though, no quests come in, the billboard's empty, but on those 2 days, you can make inspections on things other builders in Portia have crafted - tables appear in the room, with the things other builders have crafted on it (there's always 4 items at time). When you click the items on the tables, 2 almost identical images of the crafted item appear on your screen, one on the left, the other on the right. The one on the left is what it should look like on completion, the one on the right has faults/mistakes, it's your job to spot and fix the mistakes on the one on the right). Doing this correctly will give you rewards in the mail later.

5. Seasonal events - in this game, there's a calendar, with 4 seasons, Summer, Autumn, Winter, and Spring. At certain days in these seasons, there's exciting events you can take part in, to win prizes. One of them is called The Day of the Bright Sun: beforehand, you donate a present to the event, and when the event starts later, in the plaza of the Portia village, an airship appears over the village, and drops all the presents down that you and the other NPC characters donated to the event. Try to scoop them up before the other characters do! :D There's others where you can take part in horse riding races, Snow fights, Martial art duels, cooking contests, and more, it's really exciting! Also, with each season, the terrain changes; in Spring and Summer, green grass and flowers, in Autumn, grass turns golden, and in Winter, everything gets covered in snow. Also different types of weather, like rain, cloudy or clear skies, and snow blizzards.

6. Great socialising! There's lots of interesting characters in this game, from Presley (the one who greets you at the start of the game), the Mayor of the village, to other builders, shop owners (like one that owns a bakery, another that sells clothing, etc.), Emily (the red head on the picture of My Time At Portia's store page), a farm girl who's your neighbour, even kids and animals (like a pig, cat, and a dog ^_^), and 3 characters that are sort of like the 'police' of Portia City (who play a big part in the story, especially where monsters are concerned), and also new ones that appear in Portia when you progress far enough into the story. You can talk to each of these characters, give gifts to them, play rock paper scissors with them, to increase your friendship or relationship with them (which unlocks interactions you can do with them, like dates/casual hangouts where you can take part in doing things together in Portia village, like playing together on playground equipment, chatting under the Wishing Tree (where you can discover unique and interesting things about them, depending on which question you ask them, when choosing from the chat), eating at or playing games (dartboard, etc.) at a restaurant), and, yes, even get married and have a family :D 

7. You can ride animals! I love games that allow you to do this, in this one, you can ride horses, or even Llamas. Really handy for crossing large distances, considering the open world in this game is huge. You can also train them to increase running speed, endurance, how fast their stamina replenishes (when you slow down, stamina always replenishes when you make your mount stop sprinting), and jumping.

8. And, of course, beautiful soundtrack to listen to, when playing the game :)

I think that's it, pretty much. Central theme of this game is based around building, but what I really love about this game is that it's not just about that, it has combat and seasonal events, which gives it a fun challenge and keeps it interesting and entertaining. There's no blood in combat either, which I really like, and the whole look of the game just has this really cute, cartoony look  to it, very rare to find in combat games these days ^_^ If you like games to do with open world exploration, combat, doing errands or tasks for people, crafting or building, I really think you'll like this game, definitely recommended! ^_^",1605156636,1608628051,True,7,0,0.592954277992248535,0,True,False,False

There are some glaring flaws to consider though:
1. The crafting mechanics are a double edged sword. It's easy to use, but there are so many recipes that have items/steps that make them more of a chore to make then they need to be. You can't just make herbal paste from herbs, you need to turn the herbs into herb juice first, and there are a million little examples like that.

2. If you don't do story commissions, someone from another workshop will come and do them instead. It brings this amount of fast paced, ""you need to hurry"" feeling to the game that drives me up the wall. I have a to do list a mile long + a disability that makes having a long task list entirely too overwhelming. It's not user friendly for people like me. Not to mention, one of the story tasks is glitched. It will drop the 7 day timer from 7 days to 2 days when you go to bed that night, so I tried to make the items I'd need in advance. Guess who'd already jacked all the requests off the board while I was preparing? The other workshop.

Some of the game's mechanics are kind of clunky, there's a couple of glitch-like behaviors, and the progression gets rather repetitive as you go along (though at a much steeper incline), but the storyline is fun and quirky and the graphics are pastel-like and beautiful (surprisingly so for a post-apocalyptic setting). The Overworld exploration is enjoyable and unique, with very colorful creatures and fiends that you meet along the way. So if you're looking for a relatively simple sandbox game, and you don't mind grinding uphill, then I would definitely recommend adding this to your collection.",1608267786,1608267786,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love this game. I didn't think I would after the first few hours because the map is quite small, so you end up running over the same areas again and again and again, which makes the grind loop feel quite monotonous at times. However, the atmosphere is very charming and relaxing, and the feeling of developing your workshop and your friendships with the townsfolk becomes very addictive after a while. Theres enough story to keep you entertained too, with plenty of main story and side quests to keep you going. And many of the characters are pretty adorable.

I wish the npcs had more lines of dialogue to give you though. If you're serious about developing their story lines through friendships then its a real grind trying to get them to like you and every time you talk to them you hear the same line from them over and over again. A bit more variation would be good. I love the voice acting though (except for Sophie - she was terrible).

I can't see the game having much re-playability sadly, but I'm definitely going to get my money's worth out of it by the time I've finished my first playthrough. An unequivocal thumbs up from me.",1608154889,1608155014,True,15,0,0.670469939708709717,0,True,False,False

Cons:
The graphics are very simplistic; the voice acting and animations are functional but not impressive. This doesn't bother me much. The population is probably much higher than it needs to be; You've got fifty-odd people who you can raise your reputation/relationship with. The combat can feel a little cheap when enemies stun you easily when engaging more than you can catch in a single combination of swings and the combat AI is quite basic.

Pros: It's a tech-tree-'em-up resource collecting and farming sim game, and it does a good job of hitting all those satisfying and moderately addictive feedback loops. You level quite frequently, there's a decent number of events, and there's always plenty to keep you busy every day; honestly, for new players, I recommend resisting the urge to beeline through quests and stockpile some resources before proceeding with any non-timed missions, because it's incredibly satisfying to snatch up every single city improvement commission before your rival can even take one.

I still believe that title goes to SV but either way, this game was WAY more than what I expected when I first got out. Well worth the buy. Game is much more similar to Rune Factory than Harvest Moon in my opinion. There is a TON to do, and a lot to explore and get. Lots of NPCs, hardly any of which feel like mere filler/background. Lots of upgrades to your workshop. Very addicting watching the city grow as you add more and more improvements to it, both major and minor. My only complaint is once the main storyline is done there isn't much else left to do outside of making money. Ending has you judged on multiple aspects of your gameplay rather than a bare handful, actively encouraging you to get more involved in the city and its people. 

Absolutely worth the money, regardless of price. One of the very few games I can say that about. If you love or simply enjoy games like the ones I mentioned above, you should definitely get it.

The third person view is pleasing for the first bit, but the functionality lags just slightly behind top down farmers like Stardew Valley. It does provide a very pleasing mining experience, but that isn't the reason I play these types of games.

That being said, the linked storage system and automatic access to storage by crafting tools is just the best. Seriously, an absolute god-send.

I'm not really a fan of the assembly mechanic. It requires having the items on hand, and after the first couple assemblies, I'm very done with having one less item than I need and running back to boxes.

I'd of loved it if you could create your own town layout, but this jut isn't that type of game. The graphics are good and artsy. I'll admit I don't like all of it, and don't really understand why people haven't removed a lot of the ruins (story thing - you'll see).

Unfortunately, it has some really uninspired mechanics that bring down the whole experience, and it's so rough around the edges it constantly made me ask how could anybody think this is done and ready to be released?[/h2]

My Time at Portia has everything it needs to become a fantastic game. However somehow, it fails to bring all of it together in a way that makes the whole experience click and produce the next hit like Stardew Valley. Actually, I suspect it's exactly because the game has so many things in it that nothing feels like it has been finished. Another example of how scope creep kills the game's quality.

I'm not going to talk about what the game is, we all know what it is. If I say ""It's Stardew Valley, but in 3D"" or ""It's a Rune Factory clone"", then that's close enough to the truth that you can imagine what it's like. Except you're not a farmer, you're a craftsman. So, you mainly craft things instead of farming. Sounds good, what went wrong then?

I need to mention the art direction. I suppose it's personal preference, but... I simply don't like it. It's way too out there, especially character design. Everybody looks like something out of an acid trip, uncanny valley levels of weird. Also, no matter how much I tried, I couldn't create a normal looking main character. They always end up either derpy, or looking like a failed human cloning experiment. Also, everything has this weird, fog like filter over it, it makes it look like some sort of a perpetual dream. I will never understand post processing effects that make the game  look less clear, especially when you can't disable them... So, beware. The game has a really weird artstyle, especially for the subject matter it decides to explore.

Okay, now about the stuff that matters. First, major flaw of the game is that none of the basic gameplay mechanics feel satisfying to interact with, and that's a huge problem in a game that will make you go through the same loops all the time. Chopping down wood or mining is passable, and that's the best I have to say about any of them. Picking things up, interacting with people, hitting things with your weapon, earning money, fishing, jumping... Everything you do in this game feels like it's some kind of a placeholder animation that was never replaced. And that's a running trend through the whole game, it feels like everything that this game has was started and never finished. It feels feature complete, but none of the features feel complete themselves. And having basic interactions feel bad is a cardinal sin in any game, bad enough to cross the whole game off many people's lists. But there's more.

The game feels painfully slow. Especially the main loop of crafting. You see, you can't just craft things, it takes time. A lot. So, you better make multiple production buildings in order to speed it up. But you see, to make more production buildings you need more things made first, so your progression is halted and you have to wait and do other things. Then you start ramping up and you meet another hurdle: you don't have space. The game has a brilliant idea of limiting your building space so much, that it starts feeling like you're doing inventory management with your buildings. Why? You can buy land expansion, and after two of them it becomes less of a problem, but why would you start me off with so little space? This is what I mean by slow. The game PREVENTS you from making progress fast, even if you want to. You can go and mine a lot of raw materials (which is, of course, boring as heck), but you will have to wait for your buildings to process it up. It took me about 15 hours to get my production up enough so I no longer feel like I am slowed down by badly designed mechanics. But now I can't build a barn or a coop, even if I have materials for it, because I don't have space. Again. Sight, why don't you take a page out of other game's books and let people play sandbox games however they like, without putting arbitrary limitations on them?

As I am playing the game, it becomes increasingly apparent that combat will quickly become what I will be spending a lot of my time on, if not majority of it later. Problem is, combat absolutely sucks in this game. In every way. It's the simplest, button mashing system you can think of. There is no depth to it, it's literally just attack and dodge. I guess Dark Souls is also mostly just attack and dodge, but this aint Dark Souls. The combat is unimpactful, and feels like you're playing a free flash game from 2010. Enemies are incredibly basic, they usually don't even do anything if you just mash and stunlock them. The dungeons are basic and have only a couple of different rooms which are recycled over and over. Bosses... they might be normal enemies with bloated health bars, with only 2 or 3 different attacks that are incredibly simple to avoid. Unless the attack connects with an invisible hitbox that's nowhere near your character. Yes, combat is terrible, it takes no effort and gives zero satisfaction. It feels like playing a clicker game, because all you do is mash one button. The game would've been better without any combat or dungeons.

I probably said enough already to show how bad it feels to play this game compared to the rest from it's kind, but let me give you one more example of the game being blatantly unfinished. This one is absolutely mind boggling. Not all dialogue is voiced. ""Well many games don't voice all dialogue, what do you mean?"" Yeah I know, but this is different, There's no rhyme or reason to it, it's just random. Even in the same converstation, some lines are voiced and some not. How is that even possible? It actually left me speechless myself. People's dialogue overlaps, even in the opening cutscenes. It's like nobody ever watched them and noticed how unnatural everything sounds. Mental! How is this considered finished?

I could talk about so much more, like how crafting is unnecessarily tedious and makes you go through the motions way too many times, or how relationship progression takes so long you will ask yourself if they made it so slow because there's a hidden MTX shop where you can make it faster (there isn't, thank god). Or how there is so many characters, yet they all feel bland and one dimensional. Or how poor the UI is... As I said before, this game has SO MANY THINGS in it, it's unbelievable. It's also unbelievable how all of it seems unfinished. It's really sad, because I feel that this game could be remarkable, but I don't think it will ever crawl out of this ditch at the rate I see things progressing. There's too much work to be done to make this game good. All I know is those 17 hours of me playing it, I have almost never felt like I was having fun, and I forced myself through most of it to see if it maybe gets better. It didn't, really. Maybe a little bit, but not enough. And I am not willing to spend another 20-30 or whatever hours to find out if it actually gets better. And even if it actually did, a good game doesn't ask you to waste so much time to see it at it's peak.",1584920497,1606862052,False,228,20,0.721989750862121582,26,True,False,False

The game has a very relaxed feel.  This was helped when the devs added a slider to slow the gameday down by 50%.  The crafting is involved enough to be interesting and keeps you busy - you own a workshop, after all.  Main storyline is interesting enough that it kept me pushing on to the next stage and there's plenty of side quests for flavor.

The one downside was that you could only save your game by sleeping into the next day, so II couldn't just sit down for :10 minutes and play a little - I needed to play an entire gameday through to save my progress.

Gotta love the content in the game, plenty of things to do, you literally won't feel like there's enough time in the world! There's fishing, farming (cows, chickens, ducks), planting, building/upgrading, rides, story/commissions/missions, decorating, exploring (to a point), loads of mining, chopping, beating the crap out of the Colorful Llamas repeatedly, pets, familiarizing yourself with the folks and eventually marrying or having kids... basically you can throw away your current life and start anew in Portia.

I will say that at some points it'll feel like you're working on too many things and it may be stressful/annoying... working til you wake up in your workshop til you pass out in the Hazardous Ruins at 3 AM --BUT it almost seems fun. No matter what you do, it kind of has a pay off.

Sometimes the combat can be a bit janky (like if you turn to do a finishing combo with a weapon it kind of screws up sometimes), but all you're really doing is moving your mouse and clicking anyways, combat isn't entirely my thing, nor the point of the game (?), so I don't have a strong say on it or what I would change/how to change it.

You have a lot of freedom to do what you want in this game. The three ""talent trees"" that you can put points in really make you analyze what you want to work on. That being said, you can always switch things up with Phyllis, should you decide to play a little differently. 

The build system is a lot of fun, combat is pretty basic and I find it quite rewarding at every step. Though there are some things that seem like a bit of a grind, I don't usually have to spend much time to get everything I need done in a day. 

My one complaint is that the save system only allows saves to happen when you sleep. I would love to be able to save at any time of day. What is sneaky about this, is that I always have a reason to keep playing once morning arrives, something on the grill, garden or grinder that I need for the next project...

This game has been very grindy though. Despite what people tell you, the grind never stops, it only gets easier to deal with with better tooling. Waiting for furnaces to finish can also be pretty painful. I've had something like 15 furnaces running non-stop and I'm still constantly running out of materials. I run out of pipes so I have to make more. Pipes take bars so I have to make more bars. Bars take ore so I have go grind more ore. All of which takes about a day if you rush it and a few if you take it slow. All of the furnaces require you to constantly (and I mean constantly) put wood into them and it's not a small amount by any means. You probably end up going through 200+ wood a day.

The worst is stuff you cannot source. For wood, you can just go and cut trees down. For things like Red Mushrooms or Lubricant, things can get very painful because you can only get 2 or 3 of them a *day* if you really grind at it. Red Mushrooms is actually worse because they simply stop existing after awhile. You can occasionally find 1 or 2 in a specific location and nowhere else. You also cannot grow or make them yourself.

It's overall still pretty fun if you can live through that grind. It does get easier with tooling and presumably much easier later down the road (though I'm not sure). I guess there's a chainsaw or drill you can eventually get since it's in the skill tree but I haven't seen it.

The characters are kind of cute but they're repetitive. They'll usually say one new line per event (which admittedly is a *LOT* of different lines as there are a ton of events in the game) but after that, they say basically the exact same things. They do all have distinct personalities though from what I can gleam. You'll hate some, you'll love some, which I think is a good place to be in character design.",1606445994,1606445994,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I stumbled onto this game after I had put a bunch of time into Stardew Valley and realized this genre might be for me. It is in actuality very different from SV in unique and engaging ways. Instead of focusing on farming to restore the community center, you pick (and are occasionally sent) commissions that you fulfill at your workshop. These commissions can be anything from bridge pieces to umbrella parts which you craft at different stations on your property with resources you collect.

The gameplay loop is fun and very addictive. By my time in game you can clearly see I fell victim to the ""just one more day"" mentality a lot with this game. MTaP is very forgiving in that respect as well; there is no penalty for being forced to go to sleep for staying up too late. Progression feels great too, as you continue to travel faster and faster and are able to craft much larger quantities quicker.

The voice acting is mostly good, but the voice production in this game is difficult to figure out. On occasion, it is 100% solid, but most of the time the audio has 1 of these 3 issues: 1: Words make sense but aren't in the correct order 2: No audio 3: Dramatically different sound quality

I'm guessing the first issue is related to poor localisation. There are several times when the characters say things that technically make sense, but aren't really correct. Something similar to, instead of saying ""I'm going to the store"" you say ""The store is a place that I will be going"". It's technically not wrong, but it's weird and I don't like it. The audio will also just not be present during some cutscenes, and some characters have dramatically worse audio quality than others.

The combat is just, kind of, there. It isn't particularly difficult or fun and it can be grindy at times, so don't pick this up if the fighting is what you're looking for.

All those cons aside, this game is an absolute gem and I loved playing it. I highly recommend for the crafting, resource gathering, and super addictive gameplay loop.

It has a lot of similarities to Stardew Valley including a relationship system with NPCs, house upgrades, story questline, an ingame 24 hour clock, and events throughout the year. 

The biggest difference is that farming is nowhere near as prominent as in Stardew Valley. Instead of farming all the time, what you will be doing is smelting ores/refining materials which all have their individual timers. I was a bit disappointed when I realized this because I thought this would turn into some huge idle game, but there's always something to do while you wait for your machines to do their thing.

Another big difference is how long it takes to level up relationships with NPCs. I'd say it takes 2-3 times longer than Stardew to reach the best relationship statuses, which is really long... All NPCs have their own loved/liked/disliked/hated gifts, which are only found through trial and error ingame just like Stardew, so unless you want to do that, you'll have to spend a lot of time on the Wiki looking up everyone's favourite gifts.

Probably my biggest complaint is how badly optimized the game is. I don't have the best computer but it ran at 20-30 fps on the lowest settings. It wasn't until I was around 50 hours in when I found that what mattered more wasn't the ingame settings, but the RESOLUTION of the game. By playing on specific resolutions (not even the smallest ones), I would get around 50-60 fps even after raising many graphic settings, so I spent quite a bit of time playing windowed. Even then, this wasn't consistent as specific scenes/locations would cause the fps to drop drastically and stay that way until the ingame day was over/you restart the game.",1606401553,1606401553,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is reminiscent of a 3D version of it. It's cute, you can focus a few things without having to talk to everyone and it's actually quite a bit of fun.

The only issue I had was with the fact that when you go relic hunting you seem to end up back at the same secret rooms because it doesn't take that mark off your map which can get a bit frustrating. Also there's a few areas if you get stuck near water you have to basically wait till you pass out from tiredness because there's no other way to escape the hole you've fallen down - or a steep bank you've ended up stuck up against with a lake on one side.

I grew up playing JRPGs, Zelda, Castlevania, MegaMan...
I would never play any farming or crafting games, unless it was Dragon Quest Builders, which mixes these things with a series I already liked, but every other mining / crafting / farming / life sim just never had enough for me at all... there are a TON of these games, but nearly none of them have interesting art, designs, graphics, story or music. Maybe some games had 1 or 2 of these things, but it wasn't worth it. Even games like Zelda Breath of the Wild just don't seem to care at all about having any of these things. Most people only seem to be interested in coming in and doing as many random things as possible regardless of how ugly or how empty and soul-less it will be. And then there's Final Fantasy, with characters that are too painful to even listen to, let alone spend a whole game with them... 

Then I discovered My Time at Portia.

This game takes everything I liked from the classic games I grew up with, and delivers it in the form of a life sim.
From the moment I looked at that logo, I knew this had love put into it. Now, many games will have a pretty cover and be shallow inside, but everything inside the game met my expectations based on that! This game is brimming with art and design. I specifically love the aesthetic of this game in that technology looks colorful but cute, similar to how MegaMan games do it (I'm getting MegaMan Legends vibes specifically), and mixes it with that homely appeal of farms and life sims. I love just running around and looking at how the city is built and how it looks where people live, and how it looks from a distance.

The music is shockingly good, just like the classics I grew up with. There aren't many games made in the last decade or 2 that sound this catchy and properly immersive. For a while I had started to think I was just tired of game music in general, but this game's OST was fully refreshing. This composer knows how to make melodies and chords that feel like a game worth having a music CD with a limited edition or something. To me, music is actually the most important element in any game... if a game has everything, but the music isn't good enough, it will bring everything else down. In Portia, this is one of the big reasons I'm enjoying it!

I'm loving all the characters. They all feel natural and inspired by real people... this is something I don't see in many other games either. It seems that the trend is to take a single overused trope and stretch it thin, that's if they even have characters with writing... but in Portia I've had a lot of fun exploring what each person says and does. I'm nowhere near half the game, but things are looking so good already! It's really satisfying and addictive to interact. This is what I needed in a life sim.

None of the little flaws I've found in this game have taken anything away from my enjoyment of it.

I've put in a lot of time already, and I'm still having fun with the game! But, even though this game is enjoyable, there are some things within the game that down-right annoy me and kind of ruin it for me.

1. Commissions. This game is based around doing commissions for the town with your workshop. It's an enjoyable thing to do and can be done Monday-Friday each week. Now, here's the problem with it. You can only do 1 a day. That's all, just 1. When you get to mid/late game, you unlock a Factory, which MAJORLY speeds up production on your workshop. It makes it SO MUCH EASIER to build several things at once. You should also start stockpiling a lot of different materials by this time too, meaning getting multiple commissions done is pretty easy. You start at rank D for your workshop, and go all the way to rank S (You can even find SS ranked commissions to do). It would have been so good if they added the fact you could do multiple commissions a day depending on your rank, that way at end game you wouldn't be finished by 9:30am on commissions at end game, leaving you 3/4 of the day to do basically nothing, since the lumber yard and mining yard give you enough materials to easily stockpile (Once you level it up). It would have been a lot more fun for me if there was a way to do multiple commissions the higher your workshop get's, that's all. 

2. SPOILER! Once you have beaten the main story, you unlock a flying mechanical pig. Pretty cool. Except the fact that it has some MAJOR problems. The first being that it doesn't fly, it hovers, at best. You have to learn to perfectly tap your spacebar to keep it airborne longer than 3-4 seconds, which isn't really that difficult, but for a FLYING pig to not FLY just seems stupid. But, once you get used to the spacebar spam, you're able to fly everything, except for a lot of places where invisible walls stop you in your tracks. If you're wanting to get from the town to the top area of the map, you can't just glide your way up there. You HAVE to follow the bridge routes you built, because invisible walls. Why are these a thing? Why not just put invisible walls AROUND the map itself, and not through the map? I have a horse that can scale mountains, but jumping over a tiny fence from the tree farm to near Sophie's farm is impossible, thanks to an invisible wall getting in the way. It's really annoying having to try to navigate through all the invisible walls (Some of which have caused me to bug out because I've hit it, having to reload the game, which is so much fun when I've done a lot on the day of it happening, so I'm having to do it all again). Just remove all the walls blocking everything through the map and allow people to have full exploration of the map itself, don't break the immersion with 100's of nothings.

3. BUGS. I've mentioned 1 bug that has happened to me several times above, trying to get somewhere and an invisible wall making me have to restart my game because of it bugging out. But, this is 1 of many rather annoying ones. There's time you just can't speak to an NPC, and you can spend hours of the day following them and still not be able too. This is even more fun when the quest is for said NPC and they can't be spoken too. For a game that is Â£25, I don't expect there to be many bugs, if none at all. This game just feels rushed in a lot of places, and since the company is making another game, I don't feel any of these bugs will be addressed. People's speech is messed up, spelling mistakes when you're talking to some NPC's PLUS spelling mistakes in loading screens. There's just so many bugs and mistakes in the game that I spend a good portion of it sighing. It's such a good game, and there's so much to do (Through the main story anyway), that the bugs ruin a lot of the fun for me. 

4. In a playthrough I married Phyllis. When you do that, you spend 50k to buy a building for her to have her dream doctors, which get's a reaction the day after you've brought it and repaired it. Now, I loved doing this. It gave more depth to the character for me (I also married Emily on another file and her quests were a little boring to me). But, after that 1 day of it being mentioned, it seems to become like it doesn't exist (Except Phyllis goes to work there instead of at Dr Xu's. Even going on a date with her and asking her about her job, she mentions ""One day I'd love to open my own clinic"".. It's like, wait, you have one... You've opened one, which I spent money on for you to have one.. It just shows how generic and boring characters become, because nothing really changes when you do their quests for marriage, except you marry them. It feels like through the story the characters progress, but in the gameplay, they don't. If you're going to progress characters through a story, at least let it show through gameplay too.

5. Something to do with Phyllis again. Once you make her Clinic for her, you can NEVER get acupuncture with her again whilst your married to her (Not sure if you can once you divorce, not gone through a divorce yet). I've spent a few days trying to get her to give me the acupuncture option, but it can't be done. You enter her Clinic, she leaves. You leave, she enters. Repeat until 5-6pm. Even if you somehow catch her inside her Clinic, the option doesn't show up. So, marrying an NPC gives you 40% off of a game mechanic that you cannot use, so it's a pointless and wasteful reward lol.

6. The Data Disks and Petra. Having to give Petra Data Disks to unlock assembles for you is a good idea, on your first playthrough. When you decide to make another save file (Wanting to min/max everything like I did or do other things instead), it becomes a problem. I Don't like that the story can be stopped for OVER A MONTH of in-game time because you require a machine that can only be gotten through Petra and the Disks. This was something that really bothered me, since I had been giving her disks AND speeding the research up on MOST machines since the first day of me going into the ruins and getting disks. Having the story just stop because of something out of your control is really annoying.

7. Once you unlock the factory, you can mass produce items which you can turn into money quite easily. Except I can't do this. How the factory is best used is to make 1 item multiple times so that it creates all the items at the same time, speeding production up a LOT. But, in doing it like this, if you do a few too many in a single day, it could take anywhere up to 5 minutes for the game to save and load up the next day. I've had the game crash several times because I've made a lot of items at the same time.

I know I've put a few points that could stop people from buying the game, but even with ALL of these problems, I'd still recommend it. Especially if you enjoy games like this. This is one of the better ones I've played, and I've played a lot of them. I was there was a way to ""maybe"" recommend the game, rather than it just being a simple yes/no answer. Because I would only recommend it if it's a type of game you enjoy, but I wouldn't recommend it if it was your first game of this type.

All in all, if I had waited for 8-9 days, I could have gotten this game a lot cheaper and it would have actually been worth the amount. I know I've already put a lot of time into this game, but with everything that's wrong with it, I really wouldn't say it's worth Â£25. Â£15-Â£20 maybe (At a push), but not Â£25.",1606119295,1606119390,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I do assume i hadn't left the tutorial stage, but it still felt like the game just said ""alright then, well, get to it"" without telling me what ""it"" really was. Time dulled that issue, but it was there nonetheless. The gameplay is a little compelling, i guess?

Pros
-Lots of characters to meet and interact with
-Main quests/side quests galore
-Customizing your own house
-Combat - dungeon runs! (these can be confusing though)
-Game length is pretty solid. You can play this for days and still not beat the main storyline.

-Still some bugs to it to be fair

It's still pretty buggy, and very laggy, even on my high-end PC. If you're looking for a relaxing experience, in any way similar to Stardew Valley, do not get this game. Only buy this if you like games where the main gameplay revolves around grinding and building/optimizing machines on a grid for maximum output of materials.

Also, if you're playing, I'd suggest not getting to know any of the NPC's until you've built every machine, fully upgraded your home, have every tool in the game, and loads of cash. Trying to get to know any of them may lock you into quests you may not be capable of having finished that early on in the game.[/i]

*okay*

I'd like to start off by saying that I really wanted to like this game. Overall, the aesthetic is charming, if not a bit goofy (and at times mildly terrifying, I do not believe that pink creature to be a cat). The music is lovely, if repetitive, and the entire region feels like one massive starting zone (which I do not like). I guess I should probably organize my thoughts a bit better. Here goes.

[b]I liked:[/b] The art style, most of the time. I also liked the character designs for the most part, as well as some of the base movement mechanics - those were okay, too. The mining is fun, and fishing was alright. Combat is decent, but very simplistic. I appreciate the skill trees, and how the more you progress, the more opens up to you. It sounds silly to say it, but I've found that to be fairly uncommon to any significant extent in most of the games I've played in the past ten years. Maybe I need to find better games!

[b]I disliked:[/b] The automation. When I first heard about this game, it was lauded as being very similar to Stardew Valley, and after reading a bit more about it, I didn't see anything regarding the crafting. That said, I avoided lets plays, because I don't like getting too much information about a story's world before I buy a game. If I had known that the primary gameplay would consist of gathering items to run through machines to then make other items to make more machines, I would not have gotten this game. Automation is, for me personally, one of the most excruciatingly boring mechanics a game can have, second only to grinding.

I also find that some of the character designs are pretty horrifying to behold, and definitely could have used a bit of polish. The nicest thing I can say is that they remind me of the Rugrats character designs. Also, the clothing is real weird. Not a fan of everything being vaguely orange, and having forced brightly colored eyes with bright red eyeliner. I know I can mod the game to get rid of the eyeliner, but I don't think that should have even been included in the first place, if it wasn't going to be customizable. 

On a less personal note, the game also just runs pretty poorly. Even on my gaming computer, the loading screens between zones is somewhere in the 3-5 minute mark, and the FPS drops randomly down to 15 and lower. This, on top of how unnecessarily large the map is, make traveling anywhere a veritable nightmare. Almost everything in this game is padded out with artificial time constraints, making crafting take in game days, walking take in game hours, so the loading times being as long as they are is pretty hard to ignore.

Also, the general pacing of the game is weird. I can't seem to get into the groove of it. On one hand, the forced tutorial section makes me want to scream, but you do need to go through it to progress. Then, all at once, the game enters hyper-speed, and you really have to contend with how damnably slow crafting is, alongside the timed quests. I've repeatedly been forced into timed quests where I could not possibly gather the materials in time to finish. The quest I'm on is an easy example: I was told to make an item using materials I will not have access to until I complete a main story line quest. Now, all at once, I'm in a rush to rapidly progress through all of the content I can in two days time. There is just no way to finish this quest, and there was no way to reject it. Now, I'm left losing a relationship score because I didn't progress in the unspoken 'correct order' of events. This feels like a linear game masquerading as a sandbox.

So, in general - no, I would not recommend this to any other players unless they were desperate to play a game that looked and sounded like Windwaker, but was also sort of an okay automation game.",1606011940,1606012002,False,1,0,0.456843078136444092,0,True,False,False

So much to do everyday
Different areas to explore
Crafting, farming, fishing, and fighting (sort of like Rune Factory, with a watered down storyline lol)
Marriage, Pets, Children, Mounts, and an neverending (seemingly) upgradable house
Good NPC dialogue
Fun Events

Then found MTaP and was hooked. I have created multiple characters, reached the end-game for all of them, was out of things to do and started chasing all achievements (got them all but the RPS one... not a fan of that mini-game). COVID hit and I started new characters and essentially started over again, trying to optimize everything and beating my own time to complete the main quests etc. Here are some pro's/con's:

The likes:
- the setting of the village and surroundings. Gorgeous! Reminds me of Italy - San Gimigiano or some of the other smaller towns. Some of the nature is breathtaking - the moon/stars, the sunset... It's just a pleasure to run around in Portia
- most adult characters are depicted as adults (so don't feel like a phedo when trying to romance one)
- there is alot to do - I love that there are so many missions and side-quests. The more complex ones are a project mgmt dream.
- If you don't like to fight, it's ok. Essentially, you get alot of leeway when going into the caves and don't die so fast.
-No penalties if you stay up after a certain time - LOVE THAT! Makes for a much more relaxing game
- the developers are responsive, continue to update the game, and are invested (KUDOS!!!)
- the player community is generally nice - when I had questions someone always replied quickly to help out
- and much more!

The not so likes:
- when I had started the game ( I was pretty much a novice at gaming back that time), I had a hard time figuring out what to do. I always had to keep the wiki open while playing. 
- the dungeons.. some of the layouts are SOOOOO confusing. I am still lost in some of them (the one in the desert! ugh!)
- when the voice did not work for some parts of the game... was annoying. But am over that...

A general remark: 
- It seems the game is geared more for adults. Both my teenage sons (back then 11 & 13) had started the game but got bored quickly it seems due to the chores/grind. Also, the fighting was not so interesting (their words).

I can highly recommend this game for people who like this genre. Cannot wait for the next ""my time"" game!",1604363686,1605714254,True,419,13,0.971795141696929932,4,True,False,False

I finally understand this game. Once you set goals, it's fun <3
Set one goal a day and don't worry about trying to do everything at once, it's still confusing af when you start though LOL

I'm an Animal Crossing franchise fan (ACNH is my least favourite in the franchise though), a Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley fan so I THOUGHT I would enjoy this more, I'm only 5 hours in but it already feels like a grind. 

From the bat, the world is huge and open - I like games that start of small and add more things as you gain more income, so this game feels more like an MMO than a farming/crafting game. That in itself kind of makes it feel a little cheap.

+ Huge selection of characters
+ Mining for ores is unique and fun
+ Fishing fairly easy
+ 

- Dislike the crafting system and the amount of roadblocks it takes to make ONE thing - the first real quest is to build a bridge, and to do THAT you need to build a FURNACE, a GRINDER and a CIVIL CUTTER, all of which take real time to do. it's just frustrating. I'm sure it probably gets better after this, but if the beginning's like this, it just makes me not wanna play the rest of the game. 
- No real sense of achievement
- Graphics seriously remind me of a cheaply produced MMO
- Characters take a LONG TIME to befriend
- Most female characters are less creepy/better marriage material than the male characters (I know you can marry both genders, but the design of the guy characters is something to be desired lmao)
-World feels kind of empty, the characters don't seem like real people (e.g.  even after attending the mayor's meeting, they just revert to their old speech patterns and it feels like their dialogue isn't affected by event)

I've only played 5 hours, but I thought it would be better than this. I'll keep playing to see if anything's changed,  but the beginning levels are too steep to enjoy imo.

I also appreciated the inclusivity that every romancable character was bi (for lack of a better word), and not only stereotypically attractive characters were romancable.   There is a main plot to keep things interesting, and tons of side plots to keep it robust.  

As far as mechanics go:  They're fairly straight forward pseudo mini-games for different activities,  The thing I feel sets this game apart is, I love that as you progress there are ways to automate the more mundane tasks before they become tiresome.

I got this game because of my love for a certain farming sim, and this did not disappoint. The setting is beautiful and vibrant, and the post-apocalyptic concept is interesting enough to get behind. The ""rebuild your Pa's workshop and expand your reputation"" thing is pretty solid. Many of the NPC's are likeable, and I enjoy the socializing system and how it rewards friendship through relationship perks. Also, the marriageable characters are useful! The combat system is so-so, but in a relatively chill game, it's nice to not have major consequences for losing health and such.

Like others have said, it's worth noting that this game feels incomplete. The devs themselves admitted that it was rushed and could have been better. It's apparent through aspects such as missing NPC voiceovers, the heaps of items that aren't very useful, and the NPC's that aren't very interesting (Tody ;( ). I also wish that NPC's had more dialogue and that there were more character customization options, particularly for hair and clothing (I'm really not a fan of the gendered clothing). The game is also pretty intense on my potato computer compared to other games.

With all that being said, I love this game, and I'm excited for the future My Time games knowing that Pathea is setting out to improve the lacking aspects in a game that's already pretty great.

I really wanted to like this game more, but it felt like something was missing the entire time. It feels more like an Early Access game than a full release.

The combat and ruins exploration systems are just not really that fun. Combat feels like a numbers thing, where I just need to make sure my damage output is more than the damage Iâm taking in, and then past that I donât really need to pay attention. The ruins exploration is a chore that never felt fun, just something I needed to do to get certain materials. I felt railroaded into needing to do these ruin explorations or dungeons to get certain materials for upgrades, and it felt way too much like Dark Cloud for me.

My Time At Portia has an infestation of it on an unholy scale. Worse yet it cannot be toned down without a mod. The color choice is eye blinding. I tried just about everything I could with reshade to fix it to a level that makes it actually playable, but I just can't.

It starts out very interesting but quickly deflates, and I say that as someone who loves crafting and farming games.

If I had to describe Portia in one word, it would be: soulless. The entirety of the game doesn't feel like any soul or passion was really put into it. It's very hard to explain, but the longer I played, the more I felt like the game was lacking a soul. The gameplay is very grindy - put down machines, craft stuff, fulfill commerce orders - which is fine for a farming/crafting game like this, but everything just takes so damn long to earn, you never feel like you are making any progress at all. The game feels simply disjointed.

Everything takes way too long. I have played the game for only two ingame months and am not even close to being friends with any of the townspeople despite regular gifts. Smelting just 25 iron bars takes over two ingame days, which is a ridiculous amount of time for a somewhat early-game resource, even if you consider putting down multiple furnaces. There isn't really any sense of progress when everything moves slower than a snail with arthritis. 

There are also some design flaws. Some materials can only be found as rare completely random drops from mining in the abandoned ruins, so if you are unlucky, you are going to be searching days for just one specific material. The people living in the town aren't interesting. At times the game feels like it should still be in Early Access, with people falling through the ground, mining in the ruins looking very weird and several other problems. You can move some machines on your farm, for others you have to go to a building in the town to access a menu to move and upgrade them. And they close at 18:00 ingame time. Why?

Simply put, Portia fails to nail the balance between grind, progress and accomplishment and everything just feels soulless. The townspeople have a dead stare in their eyes, many voice lines aren't recorded and the game is clearly unfinished and lacking in many, many QOL improvements. 

It was fun enough at first but quickly loses steam and the longer I played, the more I just wanted to play any other farming or crafting sim, like Stardew Valley, Factorio or similar. Can't really recommend the game and I don't think the followup they are currently developing will be much better.",1605146507,1605146610,False,10,0,0.556843876838684082,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Awesome art style and sound track
- Engaging crafting and farming system
- Ability to automate all aspects of your workshop
- You get to humiliate Higgins on multiple occasions
- You can have llamas and/or horses as mounts (and race them)
- There's super neat seasonal events, like snowball fighting and the produce competition in autumn.
- Ability to customize your character how you want via the skill tree, clothing, weapons, and hair, skin, eyes, etc.
- You can have multiple love interests, if that's something you fancy.
- You can have two pets, a cat and a dog (each with their own adoption quests).
- You can fully customize your workshop (house) and surrounding property.

Cons:
- Characters, quests, and locations are still being fleshed out to this day, so don't expect a fully polished game off the bat. Some characters/scenes aren't fully voiced yet.
- Combat has always felt a bit ""off"" or tedious to me, as if my weapon doesn't carry any weight to it.
- Bugs are 100% possible (actually rather likely, in my case) and will most likely be caused by your graphics driver :')

You gotta make money somehow so you start harvesting resources like wood & stone, and become one of the local builders. You make tools to make gathering easier, you make machines to process these resources and you craft lots and LOTS of stuff. Your neighbours will pay you gold for commissions, which you instantly spend on more farm upgrades. There are some enemies to kill here & there, but fighting isn't the main focus here. This game is just a very pretty time management crafting sim. Because everything in this game takes TIME, it's in your best interest to craft as many machines that can process resources in as efficient a way as possible.
You can increase or decrease game speed if time management is stressing you out too much, I play it on the slowest speed so I can chill & get things done. And yes, you can woo & marry people in this game. As your friendship with people grows, you also unlock little story side quests.

I had felt the game was faster paced than Stardew but having a second file now, I found more spots where I can completely slow down the main story line and focus on other things.

the pros: 
â there are so many things to do, even after completing the main story 
â lots of achievements, as an achievement hunter this makes me very :)))
â the game is a good concept and base point, similar to Stardew Valley, Rune Factory, Animal Crossing, The Sims, Harvest Moon, Minecraft ( kind of not really ??)
â the characters are fun and goofy 

the cons:
â there are too many things to do, for me atleast i become overwhelmed with the copious amount of things to do
â some of the NPCs are well written and other have no writing 
â voice acting and cut scene inconsistencies

conclusion:
â i could go on and list plenty of more things in both pros and cons, but the best way to sum up my thoughts on the game is that it's over ambitious, the team is fairly small, but they have plenty of great ideas. with that being said i encourage any one reading this who already enjoys the game or is looking for a game similar to this, to wish list the dev's newest project, My Time at Sandrock, very similar in vain but improving on all of the frame work already laid out with Portia :)

With the announcement of the next game in the ""My Time"" series, I decided it was a good time to re-visit Portia. 

The game feels much more polished and enjoyable than the last time I played it. While there are still places where characters are unvoiced or a game mechanic doesn't work quite right, it now feels more ""quirky"" than ""unfinished."" I feel like I only notice the issues because I am actively looking for them.

The characters and story are still a less developed than in games like Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon. In those games, I felt compelled to cultivate relationships even with minor characters. Some of the characters in MTaP have interesting stories, but its still highly variable between them and somewhat strangely implemented at times. 

But the core crafting game is more than fun enough to make up for it, which is why I'm changing my review from ""not recommended,"" to ""recommended.""

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary: It's a good game but shouldn't have left Early Access. The developers have promised continued improvements, but it's unclear if the major issues will be fully remedied. While I like it, I'm not recommending it until I feel it's actually a finished game.

I picked up this game a few months ago when it was in Early Access and on sale. I love Stardew Valley, Rune Factory 4,  and the Harvest Moon Series: My Time At Portia follows the same general system where you're given a ramshackle farmhouse (called a ""workshop"") and set free to meander through the story while crafting and wooing the townsfolk. 

After playing for a few hours, I realized the game wasn't really where I wanted it to be, and I set it aside to pick up later. When it released from EA again, I was excited to start again. Only to realize that, unfortunately, a lot of the things that had made the game feel unfinished before are still there.

The sound in this game is still woefully unfinished. They've encountered trouble with their voice-acting plans, and as a result a lot of the characters are partially or almost entirely unvoiced - even in major dialogue. Unvoiced characters don't really bother me, but the haphazard way that some are voiced and some are not is jarring. The game is also lacking ambient and environmental noises, to the point where a lot of the environments feel rather empty and lifeless.

As an extension, the characters themselves - even main characters and marriage candidates - are unfinished. Your PC gets ""perks"" for building relationships with the townsfolk (cool!), but these perks are inexplicably unbalanced with some characters getting five perks and some with none (boo!). There's no rhyme or reason to it (e.g. the main characters have 5 and the side characters have 0): It's really just that some characters have perks and some aren't fully fleshed out yet. 

Many of the characters are also lacking story development. This was one of my favorite aspects of Stardew: Nearly every character has their own thoughtful character arc. Unfortunately, this is one of the big weaknesses of Portia. There are characters that are just blank. Or whose arc you can never see because their only content is locked behind the romance quests. I worry that this is never really going to be addressed due to the aformentioned problems with voice-acting and the developer's stated plans: It just seems that character development is not a priority and may be difficult to implement. 

Finally, there's a lot of little things that are just a bit...meh. Combat is clunky, which is the norm in these types of games but is more apparent since Portia is in 3D and not pixelated like Stardew. Jumping is weird, as sometimes you're unable to jump over knee-high walls and other times you're able to scale what appears to be a vertical surface. Selecting/utilizing actions is touchy, and sometimes I can stand directly in front of something (e.g. a door, a chest) and be completely unable to interact with it. 

That all being said, the game is fun. Crafting works well, and I enjoy it more than I've liked crafting in Stardew. The seasonal events are fun (if a bit too easy), and the main story is pretty solid. If the developers dropped the game right now, I'd probably continue playing it. It may even be worth full price right now, depending on what aspects of these games you like.

BUT... given that this developer has had a somewhat rocky history and given that I'm not fully confident that my biggest gripes will be addressed fully... I won't recommend it. I really do hope I get to change my review down the line, though.",1548103729,1604179034,True,0,0,0.739589154720306396,5,True,False,False

[b]Summary:[/b]
You get thrown into a situation where you inherited dad's workshop. You start with small space of land, build up reputation, make relationships with the locals, make some machines, craft stuff, fulfill orders. Plenty of resources on land, as well as dungeons to test your combat skills.

[b]The good:[/b]

- Probably one of the unique games where you can move your house. I know it's probably not that amazing, but quite revolutionary for me.
- Freedom of building your workshop, however you'd like to place your machines/barn/coop/house and however many you'd like.
- Lets you go on dates, and actually do some activities with said person.
- Freedom of progression. Some traditional farming games requires you to meet certain deadline. Most of the main quest in portia have no time limit, and the one that does do not fails/punish you for failing to meet deadlines (you will probably just lose opportunity such as money/rel. points)

[b]The bad:[/b]

- A bit unoptimised. I know the devs been encountering this problem since alpha, and the switch version also had a rough time running this game. Expect some frame drops for those with low-mid end computers, especially when raining or in the mine.
- Mine is very, very bad. I don't know how it works, I guess the ground uses some kind of deformation physics, which reaaally lags down your computer. If you enter the mine and your game lags already, don't worry, [i]it gets worse[/i] when you start making holes in the ground. Jetpack have horrendous control, exacerbated by the lag, and also have limited flight time (a problem for very deep hole). This all wouldn't be a problem, except that [u]mining is the only way to progress the game because you need the data discs[/u]. I can say this is the weakest element in the game for me (and it was an important one, too). Honestly, I'd settle with blocky mining if it runs better.
- BIG [b]EMPTY[/b] SPACE. I think I should bring this up as each resources are very well spaced apart on the map and going from one to another takes time. I'm saying that, if you're going to chop some trees and then go to abandoned mine in the desert, it's going to take you 1/2 day round trip, and that's with Dee dees and Mount. There's no point in having a big map if you're just going to do a lot of walking in it and nothing to see or do.
- Movement is a bit weak, noticeable when you do dungeon runs with jumping puzzles. Sometimes you get stuck on ledges. Sometimes you don't jump the way you want. On the upside, you can scale some walls/steep slopes. Going to include the jetpack in this part.
- Mods are necessary (imo). Some game design elements I don't agree with, such as shaky cameras when you hit/mine something, or how you can only take one commission a day, or mining a specific resources. is fixable with mods. Is it crippling? probably not. But I did feel the game plays better after mods. 

[b]Hindwords[/b]

I had some fun. It would be a good game if they ironed out the lag, and some of the tiny hiccups, maybe put some more exciting stuff (interactables, resources, landmarks, etc.) on the big af map. Again, the mining is very tedious and it is a large part of the game, which really is a shame. I would purchase this at discount.

They're now also planning on releasing a, ""sequel"" that looks basically like a reskin of the game, using a lot of the same assets and code. If this is the case, then for shame. It looks clear the developer is only in it for the money and doesn't care about its player base. Buyers beware.*

Good in theory, but definitely unfinished. The game has lots of bugs, from minor character glitches (ie, horse running backwards) to more moderate annoyances (my character can no longer auto run, meaning it's a pain to get anywhere). 

What is here is good though. And while I wouldn't recommend it for $34.99 CDN, if the developers gave it some more love I could see it be worth it. Scaling, the game is very grindy (as others have mentioned). It's less of a farming game and more of a, ""Build a workshop and then a billion other requests"" game, which is disappointing as it does get boring. I gave up when it asked me to build sprinklers for the farm; there was only so far that I could walk before it became more of a chore. The world is huge, which a lot of people would say is a good thing, but it's pretty empty and for what is populated there's no reason to explore or go there. If they shrunk the size down for the open areas, dialed down the amount of components needed for crafting, made the currency scale correctly, and reworked the skill tree, then it may become fun again.",1575803094,1603740186,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sure, there are many farming and crafting games out there, but theres not a single one that i loved as much as this. 

It has a giant playable world, with tons of customization options, a load of crafting, building, exploring...
You can do a lot of different activities, like watching stars, painting, horse racing, fishing, meet, date and play with other characters, adopt pets, animals, children, get married,  go mining, attent different kinds of festivities, explore dungeons... and much more. 

There are many story and side missions to do, but you can also just do whatever you want and spend hundreds of hours enjoying everything that the beautiful world has to offer.

It is robust, packed with features and content that seem to never end. Probably none of it is fully functional or bug-free, but I would call a rough robust game superior to the highly polished skeleton-games that most other videogame producers are trying to sell these days.

Probably most of the features are never explained, or are badly explained in-game. You will have to do a LOT of experimentation to figure out how things work. That being said, you should expect to score poorly on your first playthrough. But, with THAT being said, this game has great replay-value. Every NPC has their own story and quest-line that happens peripherally to the main story, and you'll go on a (partially) new adventure every time as you make connections with different characters.

The design has a tone of a children's game, but much of the gameplay and features are a bit more complex and challenging than I would expect any child to perform adequately in. Also, it conveys a lot of messages that I would call toxic for children. This game would have been greatly improved by being designed with a more mature tone. On the bright side, much of the tone seems quite progressive. It's gay-friendly, as you can date and marry any valid character regardless of their sex (I haven't actually tried having a same-sex marriage yet, but from what I've read, it works no differently from opposite-sex, and I haven't seen anything in-game that would suggest otherwise). Probably the most delightful characters are this flamboyant young man who is passionately the ""most beautiful person"" in town, and a young woman badass officer of the corps who patrols the town and lays down the law for trouble makers who need to get beaten back into order. They're both gender-benders who are portrayed very positively. The game also provides an objective portrayal of pro-enlightenment (like the researchers working to recover old-world basics in science and academia) and anti-enlightenment (like the church, insisting science and technology are bad) cultures in a way that puts the player evenly in the middle, where you can see what's happening on both sides and make your own decision for which (or both/neither) to support.

You might notice a lot of very unusual design decisions peppering the interface and gameplay. As a few examples, it uses that creepy catholic calendar that puts Sunday at the wrong end of the week. The gameworld has its own religion (the ""Church of Light"") that parrots several late 19th century christian church doctrines (almost word for word, in many cases). The game is full of head-scratchers like these that make you wonder, ""What the hell were they thinking when they decided THIS was a good idea?""

The story begins with a setup for epic adventure, but then diverts into something different half-way through, and has a rather uneventful ending where none of the things they've been leading you to expect all throughout ever happen. It's very disappointing. But, even when the main story is over, the game goes on as a sandbox, allowing you to spend as much time as you want doing all the things you hadn't yet done.

Although it is full of problems, I think My Time At Portia will prove itself to be one of the best games you've ever bought. I got it on sale for 12$ (after being on my wishlist since it was announced years ago), and I only wish I could have afforded to buy it sooner.",1603424904,1603425253,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TL;DR - This game balances quality of life and branching paths of options to allow the player the freedom to play the game they way they want to (within reason). Small flaws do not out-way the plethora of positives this great game has to offer the casual, or even hardcore, player. 
Negatives
*Combat is not very polished and can, at times, be frustrating.
-Work input vs incentive for romances / befriending others doesn't feel balanced enough to go for outside of roleplay fantasies 
-Start can feel grindy and tedious to those who aren't willing to put a couple minutes toward daily gathering goals
*Factory toward end game is far too powerful leading to a drop in incentive toward expansion (unless you are a completionist)
-Occasional strange graphic bug / stuck npc / voicing mishap (still better than bethesda)
POSITIVES (a lot)
*Multiple disciplines of work to explore without sacrificing the viability of earning a living.
(I.E. you can mine, fell trees, cave dive, avoid combat farming, do normal farming, take commissions, etc without feeling like another path would pay out far better / worse)
-True romancing system that expands as you complete missions
(I.E. instead of planning a 1 hour block at a cafe, you use action points to spend time running around town with a friend or potential date all while trying to win them over with conversation and events)
-Options to avoid certain grinds
(You can hire the local guard/adventure unit to hunt down animals / run dungeons for you)
*********Quality of Life.
Never have I seen a game with so many quality of life features. It's not perfect but, compared to most games on the market right now with the same theme, it is pretty dang close.

It's quite stable on here and there's also a crud ton more content compared to the console versions.

Honestly, my favorite thing about this game is how you're able to change the game speed to suit your own play style. I like long days in game, so long days it is. It's just a nice option, really, and it takes away a lot of the stress caused by other games of this sort that require you to get home before a certain time or you pass out/lose items or money. You're able to do more of what you want during the days without that added anxiety.

The music is calming and quite charming for the game, it suits it perfectly. I find the art really pleasing too. I haven't really experienced any bugs, but I do notice that when I am in the Abandoned Ruins I lag just a tiny bit while hitting with my pick-axe. It's less than a second of lag each hit, but it's kind of annoying, but not game breaking and it doesn't ruin the experience for me. It's just me being a bit nit picky. The ruins are actually one of my favorite areas and activities in the game.

One of the other cool aspects of the game is that you actually gain exp and level up for doing things. I like games where you level your character up. There are also skill trees that you can put points into as you see fit depending how on you like to play. You earn a skill point each time you level up, so it gives you an incentive to actually work on quests and projects to earn that extra EXP.

The voice acting is alright, there are some dialogues that were never finished but no big deal because you can still read the text, but the thing that bugs me is that there are a few characters that have more than one person doing the voice acting. Again, not a game breaker, but it is totally noticeable and leaves you thinking WTF?

If you like casual life-sim games this is one I'd recommend. There's crafting, building, fighting, fishing, decorating, romance, and tons of quests aside from the main story line that are also interesting and engaging. There's no stress, it's relaxing, and you can play at your own pace without any penalties.

I love the creativity, I love the game play, the graphics (although I do have to turn down some of the graphics in the PC settings, however I have a ""lower end"" gaming PC with hardware that is 1-2 years old), also I love-LOVE- the characters. I love the different styles of game play, you can do so much even though there is a story to follow you can take your time with that. If you like Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, and games of the like I highly recommend this game to you.

On that note I when I initially got the demo I really thought farming would be a major plot point....I was wrong, and I wasn't even mad about it. Farming works more as a resource gathering. You buy, or find, seeds to plant (after you get the quest to build a planter box) and from there it is different time for each crop harvest. So it really takes a back burner in a way but there is so much else to do that you barely notice it. I feel like I'm not doing this game justice.

The world and the characters a charming. After playing just a little I was already wondering which NPC I would marry.
The main plot is not very good, but nice enough (6/10). The main drill of the game (that is crafting things) is solid and truly kept me entertained for dozens of hours. It really managed to give the impression that I was always evolving (until the very end).

The game has some problems. The ones that caught most my attention were some poorly thought mini games (like the cow lacing), not well though or clearly unfinished mechanics (like the horse affection and feeding), the unbalance of the results of some mechanics over others (fishing will give much more money than anything early game) and the side the content, while not necessarily lacking, is not enough to last the end of the main history (at least in my playthrough). 

The last mission is also pure bullshit. You have to expend a amazing amount of time drilling a very specific cave to get a ridiculous amount of rare drops while using their overly simple combat mechanics (I didn't finished the game because of this, if they change it I might finish).

Overall, a solid game and worth the money. I hope they make a sequel and give it some more polish in the points I mentioned above.

Let's start at the beginning, this game throws you straight in, it can be overwhelming at first but all becomes clear in time, it's pretty straight forward, i made a few restarts to make sure i had a better setup, i'm sure i am not alone in this part.

Now for the review part, i don't really do many of them, but this gem deserves one, this game has all you can hope for, it has farming, dungeon grinding, RPG style farming ( as in monster slaying for materials ) Social Aspects, Mini game hall, Board games, Balloon rides, Fishing, Crafting ( most of the game is crafting ) Since you are the builder, and will help to make this town great again. ( wich you do as you progress ) Can get married, Have kids, be a generous giver for gifts, Event days, ( wich is super fun, and give double social rewards when gifting ) 

So when you start this game it will be a bit slow, it will become much faster later on, you get madness machines that mass produce with little effort up to the point of the Factory ( a big building that makes everything automated once you fill it in on a big panel outside ) It comes with a big bad storage box with so much space it's nuts :D ( wich you want for the materials ) 

So on my first play through it toke me 30 hours before i even teched up to the Civil Furnace, wich is the first major tech upgrade you do in the game, that gives you an indication of how lost you will become in this game. ( Wich is a good thing, it never bores, always something to do ) If it's either a mini quest, side quest, a date, you name it, and it's in the game!

Here's a little starting tip : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh3OIF9hy0Q&t=5s 
This is also on the steam section somewhere, it will help you out a little bit in the beginning :)

To finish it up, if you like farming / rpg / social / building / grinding go get this game, it's worth it.

I will probably restart a few more times now that i got the hang of it, this game is addictive as hell, it swallows you up, made me come late for many appointments, even dinner, and all that, ( Totally Worth It! )

 Because in the end, this game scratches the harvest moon/ stardew valley itch while also adding its own unique stamp to the genre. Yeah, you're a fresh import to a quirky middle-of-nowhere town. Yeah, you've inherited your dead father's property which is in disarray and you need to get it juicin' again. Yeah, you navigate the town's complex relationships to carve out your own niche to improve the town overall.

This is just the skeleton, though, and Portia doesn't restrict itself to it. To start, your a builder, not a farmer. You don't have to farm a single f'in plant if you don't want to. Then, there are several different quests along your journey that are unique and not simply fetch/builds. Then there's the post-apocalyptic setting. Then there is the combat and the wide variety of creatures. There are tons of craftable stuff, and the progression is actually very satisfying.

1. It feels unfinished, as though it's still in early access. 
- Quite a bit of dialogue in the game is not voice acted, and this is obvious from within the first five minutes of the game. Not only that, but the recording quality varies wildly from NPC to NPC, with some sounding like they are recording from inside a tin can. Some of the voice acting is off-putting, with some characters seemingly unable to decide what accent to go with. I recommend turning off voices entirely (apologies to the voice actors, I know they went through a lot).

- Some of the animations are awkward and don't line up properly, and it feels a bit like the animations weren't smoothed out before release. One of the most jarring ones is the fact that during conversation, often other characters will fall into speaking animations while your character is supposed to be talking, which would make conversations extremely confusing if it weren't for the name plates.

- There is a fairly complex relationship system that doesn't really pay off at all. It takes quite some time and effort to build up relationships with other characters. Some of them have a few quests and/or personal conversations that unlock as your relationship builds, but other than those few instances there is very little personal interaction. Even after making friends with the majority of the town and starting a romantic relationship, dialogue hardly changed. It was rather odd to go and track down my lover/husband only for him to say nearly the same lines as when I started the game. It makes it difficult to feel like you're actually connecting with any of the people in town.

2. Crashing (feat. the Save System)
- The only time your game saves is when you sleep. It doesn't auto save anywhere else, and you can't manually save. It's a little awkward, but I've played a few other games with saving systems like this. It wouldn't be a problem, except for:

- THE CRASHES. Multiple times now my game has crashed in the strangest way, in which the screen freezes, but I can access all menus and even spin my character on screen using the movement keys. Loading an old save doesn't fix it, you have to close the game down entirely and restart. I'm not the only person with these issues, there are plenty of complaints on steam about it, and there does not appear to be a fix as of yet. Again, this wouldn't be a problem except for the fact that every time the game does this I have to restart the entire day. This can cause me to lose anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour of game play, and is incredibly frustrating. 

3. Storage
- God, I wish there was a better storage system. I end up with 75 crates stacked around my yard. You don't need to find exactly what you want to be able to craft small things, which is very nice. Your workbench will search all of your crates and pull the necessary items from them, saving a ton of time. That said, I like to keep all of my things nice and organized, and my inventory clear for dungeon diving and mining, and by year two my yard is half crates. Please let me stack my crates, or make bigger ones, or something. I have to parkour across my yard just to craft something. Honestly, this one isn't as big of a deal, it's just annoying.

3.5. The bookshelves
PLEASE let me store more than 3 books on my bookshelf. It's driving me crazy. And one of the books ends up on TOP of the bookshelf, not even in the shelves. As a librarian I am personally offended

UPDATE: Since I wrote this review, most of my complaints have been addressed in new game updates. Still can't put more than three books on the bookshelves though.",1550721733,1602712669,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I get lost in this game for hours when I just wanted to jump in and play a day cycle or two. It's got a calendar of events, filled with activities and special rewards, plus it has rivalries, relationships, and quests that make you feel like a part of Portia.

I'm about 23 hours in, but I can say for sure that there's well over 100 hours of things to do. I really hope this game keeps growing and sequels take us to other parts of the world. This is one game that's worth the hype.

I have to say, though, I really enjoy tracking down achievements, but too many achievements in this game require you to be a bad person.

HOWEVER, the parts of the game that aren't, are absolutely atrocious and feel either unfinished or flat out broken. I will point a few out as it seems a lot of people don't seem to mention them in their reviews of the game, claiming the game is the best of its kind. *Spoiler, it definitely isn't*

The game is rife with random Invisible walls, totally broken combat (if you could call spamming one button to lock an NPC into an animation and easily kill them combat), korean MMO levels of grind and contrary to what others seem to say, the NPCs are pretty lifeless and shallow. 

It's a fun game to play while listening to a podcast in the backround, it has pretty steady level of progression and cool ideas. Though the flaws in the game are glaring and really do leave you questioning how the devs have not addressed them. As a single example, they release an update adding swimwear yet you cannot swim.. it just black screens and resets you back to shore, it seems the priorities are a bit mixed up. 

The crafting is painfully slow and quite clunky, a lot of menu switching and creating multiple of the same items, all crafting stations like furnaces, grinders, cutters etc require constantly topping up with fuel, some may like this, however I think it just becomes tedious and chore-like.  

The ""Research"" system is essentially a gamble, you trade discs you find randomly in the caves to the researcher who will then unlock a new item for you seemingly at random. This leads me onto the cave dives and dungeons, they are incredibly boring and samey. Everything looks the same and there is no sense of exploration, this wouldn't be too bad if it wasn't a core part of the game and didn't force you into it, normally i'd love dungeons but the combat in the game is some of the worst I've ever seen in a full release game. (Seriously, it makes minecraft look like dark souls)

As I mentioned before, the combat consists of spamming the attack button to lock a monster into an animation until its dead. When the monsters do hit you, it always feels unfair as the only monsters that can hurt you just do ridiculous levels of unavoidable damage, you can't boss monsters by being skilled, you just need to be the same level.

When you unlock a new area, there will be maybe one or two new items you can collect from there, and once you get them, there is never a reason to go back. This again makes exploring tedious, boring and the idea of unlocking a new area almost pointless. You end up unlocking a decently sized map, only for you to spend 99% of your time at the workshop or town.

The RPG-style talent tree is also badly integrated, the upgrades and benefits are minimal and it seems like it was forced into the game. You hit level cap pretty quickly and considering how long it takes to do ANYTHING in the game, it wouldn't change much in the game if they just removed levels and talents all-together. 

My largest gripe however, is the linearity, a huge no-no for a ""life-sim"". You cannot be a d!ck to NPCs other than cheating on them or gifting them something odd or gross. The most amusing part of the game was gifting some animal poop i found to one of the NPCs. Your experience of the story will be the exact same as mine and everyone else's. (Except for who you decide to romance)

This review sounds overly negative and will no doubt upset die hard fans of the game who clearly haven't played anything better, I am merely listing the massive flaws that people seem to leave out of their reviews. This game IS worth picking up and playing when its on sale, but don't expect it to be a huge fleshed out experience like you'd get on a nintendo game. 

The whole gameplay cycle is Get a quest/commission > Gather > Craft > Hand in > Upgrade Workshop > Repeat. 

I'd give it a 6/10, Decent, though the flaws I listed really hold it back from being a really awesome experience.",1601874666,1601874666,True,1,0,0.493606120347976685,0,True,False,False
666140,77060756,76561198097003986,0,22,8144,0,4655,1604889291,"I'm an avid Harvest Moon, Stardew, & Animal Crossing player. Tried this game with some skepticism because of the art style, but I've really enjoyed it.

Overall I'm surprised this game isn't more popular/loved like the ones I listed. I can't find merch for it anywhere which is a shame!

Some things that are positive differences from the games I listed:
+Dynamic movement, so exploration and mining are more interesting/fun
+Thoughtful social system - if you're friends with one person, you get boosts to the friendship of the rest of their social network; after initially becoming friends through gifts/talking, time spent on ""dates"" is the most effective way to advance friendships (like real life!)
+Romance is available for basically anyone single and rival events almost never limit you. Rather than going from friends to marriage, you have a dating stage in the middle (but that doesn't mean you can date everyone or even two people at once very easily)
+You are never slotted into a scheduled day. Want animals and crops? No problem. Want to mine all day? Also a feasible way to profit and win the game. Dungeon diving or fighting? Same thing.
+Pretty original world-building, the fact that we're in a post-apocalyptic world is really cool
+Various mini-games at festivals or marked places in town. Some are more fun than others. Lots of achievements linked to them.

Not great things:
-Click-heavy, so you may want to remap some controls to save your mouse finger
-Sometimes buggy - in every cutscene the mayor's mouth moves no matter who is speaking (which admittedly can be hilarious)

I like the fact that your interactions with one NPC also affect your relationship with other NPCs connected to that person. Although the relationship buildup does feel like a grind to me, I hope that's just my inexperience talking. Here's hoping devs will retune the social mechanism.

Surprisingly, for a game that does not have many mods, you can customize your player character a lot. Gonna have fun doing makeover :D

Initially I did not know you can change the color of your furniture by using pigments. Definitely will recommend this to sims lovers looking for solace from Sims 4's limitations.

I'm new to this genre, being introduced by Stardew Valley.

Portia is more about crafting and completing ""quests"", which come in a wide variety, but like Stardew Valley, the strength of the game is how each activity feeds into each other, creating an addictive loop were you are always making progress somewhere.

Though there are deadlines for most quests, it's never unreasonable and for the most part you can do stuff at your own pace.

There are of course, other activities other than crafting and quests. You have mining, farming, fishing, socializing with it's corresponding perks and marriage, upgrading your house and tools. Seems like it is overwhelming at times, but it really allows you to take everything easy.

Not to mention the different events sprinkled through out the year, which are very involving and really feel like full day events.

As the title says, eventually, you will complete most of what the game has to offer and you can either repeat it to do it all more efficiently, or just walk away, having enjoyed your time at Portia.

9/10 for me. Highly recommended, especially for the cheap price.",1601660058,1601660058,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

The world, characters and atmosphere are absolutely fantastic and it has a fitting and beautiful artstyle. It is honestly great and I would recommend it to anyone who likes games like Stardew Valley. You will get just as invested in the characters and world around you and it features a similar relationship system. A nice addition is that you can play and go on dates with the other characters, where their relationship with you improves as you do well in the mini-games.

That does not mean it is without it's problems:

- The biggest disappointment are the yearly events. There are a few kinda nice ones that I personally liked, such as the tournament and ghost-hunt. However the winter ""Snowball Battle"" is literally wack-a-mole. Literally... That's all there's to it... Wack-a-Mole with snowballs. No one is throwing snow balls at you, you are not running around throwing snowballs at anyone else. You are stationary throwing snowballs at other characters peeking in and out of cover. ""Snowball battle"" by the way. Maybe it wouldn't have been so disappointing if it didn't sound like it would be actually fun. Most other event's are a 'meh', though they certainly are not all bad.
- The game is very grindy. Now I didn't mind it too much but the game was really pushing it. 
- Lots of missing dialogue. Like very early access level of missing dialogues. I would estimate at least 30% of the dialogue is not voiced, though that may be because I'm far into the game and don't remember if it was that much better in the early game. The same characters even have some dialogue voiced while their other dialogue isn't.
- Though I mentioned it as a plus, some of the mini-games are not all that entertaining when playing or dating the other characters.
- Combat is trash. I just can't put it any other way. Taking the weapon with the highest stats, closing your eyes and pressing left mouse button repeatedly is actually not a bad strategy in most situation.  
- Inventory management is entirely designed as a mobile game
- Customizing your home and building on your plot is entirely designed as a mobile game. There is actually no reason I can think of why they designed it the way it did. I honestly think this part was originally designed as a mobile game and the port is terrible.

All of that being said I still love the game and would recommend it to anyone. Yes it has it's annoyances but I only take them as seriously as I do because I love the rest of the game. If only the events were all great, all dialogue voiced, and the combat actually satisfying. with those three improvements it could easily become one of my personal top 10 most enjoyable games of all time.

I bought this game when it came out but i did not enjoy this game mainly was the choice of the style, it was different from what i usually played  but few weeks ago i started playing again and giving this a chance and that i am excited to say this game is amazing to play overall and worth the money spend. 

pros- 
cool story line to follow 
graphics the best with the day and night system 
the events the game have through the time line duration month is cool to participate 
combat is and get to the point
NPCs are very lively to interact with
crafting system is easily to follow and not to hard to complete 

con. 
- glitching through the dungeon, NPC in the wall
- some story quest seem its was misplace because i have not unlock the creating floor plane to complete the quest  causing time to run out and not able to do the quest, this referencing the quest with cat eating keys which i need a blender but i don't have the blender and the ques failed. the frustrating part is that i received  the blender really late into the game. 
- i was in the dungeon killing some monster rat and the whole thing glitch. 
- the saving option is annoying because you have to sleep to save your game but also go to the next day.


overall the game is good and better then other game i have played before that i get very excited to play everyday and spend all my free time play.

This game is similar to Stardew Valley, with a bigger emphasis on crafting and assembly rather than farming, fishing or rearing animals. The main focus of the game is on your workshop, where you complete crafting commissions and all sorts of requests from the locals, such as cooked food, repairs or small items. Throughout the story you can expand your workshop, explore new parts of the map and introduce a bunch of new characters into town. It makes the town feel alive and vibrant, as there's always something for you to work towards.

There are plenty of things to do in Portia. It'll take you quite a while to even try everything this game has to offer. There's no rush though, so you can go at your own pace. For me, that meant turning my workshop into an industrial style factory as soon as possible, constantly churning out ingots, plates, pipes and crafted gear. As a result, I finished most quests instantly and was focusing almost exclusively on my relationships by the time the story was done.

[h1]PROS[/h1]
+ There is quite a bit of stuff to do and I do enjoy the experience of starting from the bottom and making my way to ""God-King of Crafting and Various Other Things"".
+ You can romance certain NPCs. Opposite/same sex? Doesn't matter, you can romance em. You can also have more than one. Be careful not to get caught though.
++ You can beat up llamas(or was it Alpacas?) with boxing gloves.
++ The play/date system. I really like that you can do more than just talk/gift an NPC (seriously, take notes, Stardew)
+++ social events in general. I love being able to actively interact with the NPCs via different activities ( Swing set, dinner, fireworks, hosting fricking PARTIES) that DON'T revolve around holidays.

[h1]CONS[/h1]
---- Character customization is... Not great. The male faces all look like someone either A.) hit them with a frying pan and they're STILL recovering from the shock or B.) Took a load of drugs and decided to show up for a mugshot. Eye colors are all watered down so you can't have a straight black or a really dark brown or even a deep blue. Eyes have clipping issues when the character BLINKS. You'd think these small things would be ironed out during the Early access period.
- Combat is boring. 100% boring. Definitely something they kinda just threw in.
- Mining is a little different than your usual games, but still boring.
-- Crafting is an absolute CHORE. Crafting a single Bronze Bar takes 3.5 hours in-game time. That is simply bananas. That means in order to create a Bronze Axe, which requires 3 Bronze Bars, i have to craft multiple Stone Furnaces to shorten the time. This is fine, as Stardew Valley does the same thing with Bronze/Iron/Gold/Iridium ingots, but a Bronze ingot in Stardew doesn't take a large chunk of your day to make. Yes, i am aware that there are other stations that can craft faster, but in the beginning, you're stuck with the most basic of basics, so that 3.5 hour timeframe? It's gonna last for a bit.
- the inventory is a bit clunky
- Romances feel... empty? Babies don't do much except add another layer of stuff you need to attend to each day and the romantic interactions don't feel all that great.
- speaking of Romances, the bachelor/bachlorette ratio is off. 18 dudes, 10 females. Even if you take off the Hulu brothers, that's still 12 vs 10.
- Stuttering issues, sticky button prompts. I have a Ryzen 5 3600 w/ a 2070S and 32 GB RAM, fully updated drivers and running at 1080p. I shouldn't be having those kinds of issues.

It's a neat game filled to the brim with little neat things to do, but the payoff for stuff is lackluster, it's rough around the edges and i can't help but wonder if they should've stayed in Early Access a bit longer.",1599439340,1599439340,False,3,0,0.486305147409439087,0,True,False,False

They're like an unholy cross between Steve Buscemi and the Bonsai Kitten. I regret my life choices every time I open the character design menu. Its a panoply of thousand yard stares and malformed facial features that suggest the apocalypse talked about in the game was less technology gone mad and more planetary radiation leading to rampant birth defects. And you can ""romance"" these hellspawn? Kids gonna come out looking like the Bloody Baron's with parents like these Gumby-under-a-hot-lamp looking things.

But hey, aside from that the games a great Stardew Valley successor. Graphics are cartoonishly delightful (apart from aforementioned mutant monstrosities), plenty of content, design keeps you busy, devs are still adding more to the game, so on and so forth. You can run around and do wtfever you want and still be legitimately making progress. Kinda wish you could lock on to enemies like a lot of third person action games though. As a whole though, this games great. 

I avoided this game at first due to the wax doll cartoon horror show look of the characters making it seem too childish/simplistic. Then I watched a review on YT by a Sims player of all people (Carl if you must know) and I decided I had to try it. Glad I did too, because this game is pretty great. I honestly do recommend this game, even with the disturbing character design.

And if you're a member of the graphics team and are reading this, listen. I'm just venting. The character models are well made and fit the theme etc. No doubt there are tons of people that love this sort of cartoon chibi style. You did a fine job with them and they are objectively well made. But I cant help that for me they 100% blast that uncanny valley button.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
There's alot to do any given day, [i]""farming, mining, craft request, main missions, side missions, events, dating, fishing, logging, dungeon crawling, generel crafting, exploring etc.""[/i], and i would say it's impossible to do everything possible each given day... BUT there's not really any reason to try and do everything each day, just do what you feel like!

An example on why there's not really a reason to try and do everything in a given day:
there's an event that only happens after 5 years ingame which would mean after (a maximum) (5*365*19)/60=578 hours after completing the main story, so there's really no reason to try and rush everything, just take it chill :)

Although if your not into slow games, or action games, this is probably not for you, since the combat system is pretty basic... but if you want something to relax and burn time with, this can be it.

[b]State of the game:[/b]
NPC's can feel pretty bland at times, and sometimes there's translation bugs, or event activation bugs (only seen 1 so far)...

There are some things in the game, which have no purpose yet, but prob. will in the future, fx. the mount loyalty system.

The control scheme is simplistic and easy, with no bugs (atleast for me). 
But they keep updating and releasing new content to the game, so who knoes what they will add :)

[b]what i would like add'd to the game[/b]
*it would be nice to have some more NPC cosmetic packs (would also be a way for the company to generate 
extra cash for developing new futures to the game

*would be nice if the babys would grow up to atleast a kid stage fx. a growing system that stops at the same age as the village kids (unless there are plans to implement a full aging system into the game, although i doubt it)

*more outfitting and customisation items for the player char, like hair, beards, trousers etc.

Simply put I love the game.  This is a Life Sim, Farming Sim, and RPG all rolled into one. I think this took inspiration from Harvest Moon. Ironically I like this game far more than the Harvest series.

Brief synopsis, the graphics were slightly weird at first, but they look good and have their own charm. The combat was obviously not the main function of the game, but it works well enough and I have not died due to something that was not my fault. The crafting will reach a point where you cannot keep up and then progress happens and you can do things faster than before. The relationships and dating I had to look up a guide for. I am abysmal at that stuff in real life and it translated into the game. However, the game gives you enough information about the characters so you can make an educated guess each time. I enjoyed the overarching story for the game. I was unable to predict the many twists and turns it took me through so I had a surprising and fun experience.

Anything beyond this will have some gameplay and story spoilers do not read beyond this if you donât want to know. I do not know how to block out spoilers in reviews yet.





I think one of favorite things is that I do not have to do requests once the shop is set up. I shall progress the story at some point, but I can do other things. If I need money I fish. I like going ruin diving in my spare time looking for relics to stick in the museum.

My favorite bit in this game are the characters. They came to life for me. I felt like I had to earn the relationships that I made in the game. Yes, you can give them stuff but there is also a natural progression if you just talk with them every day. I got attached to certain characters and I will not admit to crying due to there story line in the game.  I actually stopped playing past a certain point because I donât want certain events to happen. So, I just start a new character and reach that point again, and again. The side quests you get thanks to your romance choices are interesting to say the least.

The dating and marriage system scared me for being mostly accurate. I got curious and made a second character and discovered you can date multiple people at the same time. They get mad at you if they catch you on a date with someone else. I did not realize games gave you the option to do that. I also discovered that there does not seem to be a gender limitation. A male can date a male and a female can date a female. So long as the character in question was datable in the first place, they are all datable no matter your starting gender. At least I never ran into a gender wall which was refreshing for me.



When you get down to it there is only one question that matters. 
Did I enjoy myself? 
Yes, yes I did.

I am a long time gamer, and this title really surprised me. Very few games can hold my attention very long anymore, and this game I became lost in very fast. It's overall design is just pleasant to play.

Some say it's cutesy. To some extent it is, but it plays like a get away from real life into a cartoon. It's one of most relaxing games I ever played, and it just doesn't get dull. There is always something to do.

It has one of the most extensive crafting and building themes I have ever seen. It all makes sense and is well thought out. It is also interesting and requires planning. There are also fun events and side activities that are nice to get involved in.

The world story is done well, and isn't over the top. It makes sense for the world it portrays. It keeps you going in the right direction.

You need to take your time. There is no rush in this game. You take one day at a time, and see what you can accomplish. It's best to set your own goals and not take on too much at once. You simply can't do everything at once. Small improvements are the way to go.

Almost every system in the game is about as good as this genre can get. Growing plants is interesting. Mining for ores has good mechanics. Crafting is well thought out. The fishing system is good. The combat is just good enough to be satisfying. The town is lively. Progression and character development is spot on. All in all, it's not complicated, but has a very large amount of content.

If I had any real complaint about it, is that the UI can feel a bit awkward. It works, but can feel clunky at times.

This is a family orientated game. My kids are long since grown up now, but still, this game takes me back. Growing up is over-rated anyways, and this proves that.

I sincerely hope My Time at Portia doesn't fly under too many people's radar. If you want to get away for a while, and just build stuff, buy this. It will give you many things to do for a long time.",1598416952,1598416952,True,2,0,0.558823525905609131,0,True,False,False

Game starts off very fun and engaging, but over time the game gets slower, and slower, and even slower still until eventually you're just sleeping the days by because there's nothing else to do really. You only get 1 crafting quest from the guild, the grind is pointless once you're on autopilot mode. And the dungeons feel horrendously out of place in this game. By the end of the game quests are so infrequent that you literally have to twiddle your thumbs (or sleep) weeks away at a time just to get a small quest that lets you progress with the story. Also minor pet peeve but the dialogue is just horribly off sometimes and it's very jarring to read one thing but the NPC's say something entirely different or just wrong. 

Also this isn't a Stardew clone, it's barely even a farming sim at all. I'd say it's a builder gatherer game that's very much story driven.

It's not really focused on farming crops or animal products. Taking big construction projects to help people in the city is the priority. But I can see why people recommend this game for Stardew Valley fans. It's very relaxing to play this game at least in the first 30 hours. Many things to do. Dungeons are quite exciting to me too. I have played for almost 60 hours. I would say at this point it's a bit discouraging for me to keep playing this game. Most commissioned projects that pay handsomely takes a huge chunk of real world time management and project management skills to complete. Every morning I woke up at 7 and check all the finished crafts quickly and run to the commission board at 8:01 to take the highest commissioned request before the competitor takes it. So I might have a chance to win the workshops competition in the end of each month. I feel the time in the game runs very quickly. I wanted to enjoy the story and date. But all I did was mining and chopping. Then processed ores into bars, and then it took another day to process some into plates and pipes. And to fulfill a typical commission job, other things that took time and chance to acquire were also required. The best way to make money so far is actually via fishing. King fish sells for $5000 and even big A level town projects pay only about $2800. It takes 4 hours to get a Kingfish. And it takes 4 days to get a project delivered, if I'm lucky to get all I need through mining ancient machineries. It's a bit exhausting running around just to keep requests from piling up, knowing I'm doing it mostly for the city not money. Maybe because I'm a casual gamer. Working all day at home and working in the game all day, at home... is a bit redundant to me. But hey, I really enjoyed the fist 45 hours of play. I bought it when it was on sale. So it's a big win!

Just as a warning, because a lot of people seem to not understand this:
This game is about grinding and building. It's a game for relaxation for people that likes/needs multitasking. I have ADD (not ADHD, it's a little different), and this game is therapeutic to me. It helps my anxiety and makes me feel a lot calmer.

Now, grinding is self explanatory, but let me explain the building aspect. Because you are not just building furniture. Oh no.

When I say building, you are literally building relationships, friendships, crafting the history of Portia. You are the one that changes everyone lives, either for the better or for the worst. It all falls in your hands at the end of the day.
If you can't build, you aren't alone, there is 4 other people that will always be helping you.
Not directly of course.
They take quests as well and will slowly get things done if you can't. So you don't even need to do the building if you don't feel like it. Just string along to make it progress.

My Time at Portia, much like many other Simulators, are not meant for everyone. If you are coming here expecting a Stardew Valley or Harvest Moon, you will be disappointed, because this game is not about farming at all.
You aren't a farmer, you are a Builder.
It's a very unique game from my perspective.

Only downside that I see, is that the creators obviously are not good at English, because the English voice acting is messed up. The translation of the voice to the subtitles does not match at times, and although the game seems to be fully voiced in Chinese, it's missing a plentora of English lines.
My recommendation if you feel like you can, is to play with Chinese voice acting. Might sound weird to some, but it's worth it, I promise.",1598154108,1598154108,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Aside from dating, there's lots of activities to keep you busy, from farming, to mining, to even clearing dungeons. If you get bored with one side of the game, it's easy to find something else to do. There's lots of short-term and long-term quests to keep you busy. I really love this game.

As other reviews have mentioned, combat is an afterthought you literally have one move and its very easy to not get hit or honestly just get hit a lot and still not die.

At first glance the games graphics seem like a more polished version of Crash Bandicoot and other N and playstation titles. 

There is enough plot to keep the game moving forward and always things to do. Any fan of Harvest Moon, Sims, Rune Factory, and Stardew Valley will find good value in the game. If you are unfamiliar with any of the titles listed heads up: the first portion of the game is very grind heavy. It is worth it to push through to the juicy bits. 

Portia as a town is extremely well thought out. A lot of details have gone into the interpersonal relationships beyond the PC. I recommend pulling up the wiki page as there is A LOT to the world. The price tag offers good value for play. 

Overall impression: I am really enjoying it so far. 
Would I recommend it to someone who doesn't typically enjoy this style of game: No, I don't think there is anything overly unique to keep their attention. Too much if your not invested in the game to keep track of. 
Am I excited to see this become a franchise: Yes, cute design. 

Cons: The game is glitchy. Being out for a year and half I was surprised

Nothing in this game is organic.

Still, a long time after deployment, when you touch water you just disappear.  End of the day you just sit down.  No fall damage or impact.  Cut scenes are cut too quick so conversations layer over each other or get snipped.

This game is the most beautiful escape from reality since World of Warcraft. Even the community around this title is absolutely wholesome (please check its subreddit to know what I'm talking about). 

It has its flaws, of course, but you'll find even more positive things to say about it. To name some:
- This is basically the lovechild of Minecraft, Stardew Valley, and Animal Crossing. It takes everything we know and love from those games and raises the stakes by creating something completely original. How? I have no idea. They're simply brilliant.
- You'll find yourself absolutely embedded in the life of your character. You'll make friends, fall in love, and help build and improve a nice little town. You'll meet many interesting characters and eventually, you'll want to help them, to know more about them, to be a part of their lives.
- The difficulty curve is suitable for adults but also for kids. I know this one is really hard to achieve, but believe me. I've been playing this for weeks and never got bored and, at the same time, I bought a copy for my little niece and she's amazed by it.
- The story, the lore, I can guarantee you'll be talking to every NPC to discover something new about it. Portia looks lovely, but it has a really dark and dense post-apocalyptic history behind it. If you're a grown-up, you'll find the social commentary exquisite.
- If you're a mainly visual person, you won't be disappointed. This game has the most beautiful aesthetics you'll see in this genre.
- If you're up for a challenge, My Time at Portia has many achievements to unlock and it'll keep you coming back to replay it until you get all of those suckers unlocked. I'm currently at my 6th character, trying to complete it.

I can't keep writing because I think I lost your attention with that many words, but you have to know that I can keep throwing flowers at it for hours. It is THAT good.

Allow me to explain. Crafting is the main point to this game and is paced well enough that you wont be unlocking all the possible recipes in the first 30 hours or even on the first play through. You start the game by taking crafting contracts on a job board. It does a great job of giving you contracts you can handle and even locks you out of doing too many at a time. Every once in a while the mayor will have a major expansion project that will require your undivided attention to complete as the contract requires medium expansion in crafting capability on your part. The game is actually designed to encourages you to explore and interact with the residents of Portia whom are of particular importance to the over arching story line. Raising affinity of the towns people unlocks crafting recipes that make contracts easier to complete and provides experience towards level ups. The perk system branches into different categories and contains mostly passive skill boosts and increased drop chances for material collecting. The combat system is similarly lackluster and isnt too interesting opting to just go with 2 combat abilities, hitting and dodging. Thats it, Im not even joking. I would go further into the craftable gun weapons but I honestly havent even bothered with that. Melee weapons seem to do the job just fine and combat is too repetative and boring to give any praise regardless. 

I dont dislike this game. With over 60+ hours as of this review I just can't seem to completely stop, as the story progresses the town itself grows in a way that makes sticking around actually pretty easy and seeing the map expand due to your own efforts is oddly satisfying. I still havent completed the game and only really have may be 1/3rd of the map accessable. Crazy, I know. There is tons of content here and any one that digs a little slice of life game play similar to Stardew Valley and the like will really enjoy it.

It is similar to Stardew and Harvest Moon in the aspect that you take over a family business and build it from the ground up all the while making friends and helping the town. Yes there is a grind to it but then again what would be the point in playing if there wasn't. Though for those who find grinding to be such a pain and for those wanting to replay and don't want to go through the grind again, maybe there could be a cheat code system implemented? Something I would like to see as a side quest (assuming it isn't one already as I haven't completed the game) is the town wanting to fix up and beautify the cemetery. I feel like the cemetery should be important to the town and the history of what happened before the war. I also think it would be neat if the character icon was made to adapt to however the player has decided to create their character. And with any game I would love to see more characters in the town and maybe in the neighboring ones as well that I can interact with in the game.

My only true complaint so far would be that the proportions to some things are extremely odd to me. For example once inside some of the buildings they just seem so huge in comparison to the characters. And I find that the NPCs get stuck quite often.

Going through the 2nd month of quarantine lockdown, I was looking for an entertaining pastime game and stumbled upon this lengthy, story-rich RPG.

I checked the trailers and was keen on trying out Portia, as similar types of adventure games like Animal Crossing are all the craze these days. I've also played Stardew Valley and noticed a couple of similarities in the gameplay that I was fascinated about. Guess there's always that base formula developers replicate from successful titles and modify in their own game.

So after spending hundreds of hours in Portia, I can say that it brings in a fulfilling, holistic adventure. The plethora of activities you can invest here also teaches you a couple of passable life skills along the way. Things like efficiency and finding the balance on how you spend your life.

I've made a wrap-up feature commentary above on my journey at Portia. Hopefully, it'll give a more expansive gist on what you can expect from the game. If you're on the same boat as me and want to experience the virtual outdoors during the lockdown, or if you're just looking for a refreshing new pastime feel free to check it out!",1589349727,1597018908,True,4,0,0.534643828868865967,1,True,False,False

It's so well done, you're given so many fun things to do, I easily stayed up several nights sinking my time into this. It's relaxing, and is not punishing. The game mechanics, to me, a very casual gamer, were a little hard to figure out at first as I felt the tutorials a bit bare, but once I figured them out, I fell in love. Also, I really enjoyed all the lore, and the touches of Asian/Eastern influence. 

After around 140 hours give or take, I have finished the main plot line of the game. I was shocked and I honestly didn't see it coming because we have a lot of unanswered questions, and I felt like there is still so much left to do in the game. Of course, I can still keep playing it, but it makes me rather sad that I won't get the answers I was looking for and that I won't get any more interesting plots. I have played this game for about a month, so I'm sad to see it 'finished', but I'll still keep playing, I just feel like I'm at a loss of what to do now. 

All that aside, I can't recommend this game enough if you like any type of life sim game. I was coming from Stardew Valley, and I very much loved this game. It had some extra combat and bosses, a beautiful 3D aesthetic, and definitely its own charm. I found myself not quite as attached to the characters, but you do get some side quests that help you learn about the characters. I've heard some people experiencing bugs but  I've only played since July 2020, on a PC, I can't speak to any game-crashing bugs. There are a few times where it was glitchy, for example some NPCs would get stuck getting on/off their horse but it didn't affect anything just looked odd lol, but overall, I never noticed any major issues. 

I am honestly shocked not more people have gushed about this game. The character designs maybe weren't as attractive as I ideally would've liked, but the game design was very beautiful and I found myself taking lots of screenshots when I would get an event. 

This game has so much heart in it, and I am thankful the game devs even recently pushed out an update, and I think I heard they're making a sequel. I want to support them and will be looking forward to it.",1596834946,1596834946,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's lots to do any given day. Maybe even too much to do. I don't feel at all like this is a Stardew clone -- I've had no time for farming because all I've been doing is mining, gathering and manufacturing. It feels more like a shiny Minecraft alternative, without the fun building.

It feels too busy. If you're not constantly churning out every type of material at all times, you WILL fall behind and start failing every mission that comes along. I never feel prepared for anything.

Everything feels difficult to control in terms of targeting and moving. Cooking, fighting, targeting and moving quickly feels clunky and slow. 

Building things is difficult thanks to having to have everything on your action bar, and having to target the correct area to place it in. That doesn't sound difficult, but in practice it gets frustrating very quickly. I never build anything for fun. I only build to make machines that make parts for missions/commissions.

Am I still sinking some hours into this? I am. The busywork feels good while the outside world is inaccessible to me, and the music and scenery are nice. I like gathering things.

A fairly good farm sim but not entirely focused on farming, more of crafting. Has a open world/mmo feel that works well, some light combat too. There's options to give your character a voice too but not too much variety, plus it feels more familiar to me at least when my character is quiet.

here is what i think of the game. 

[h1] small introduction [/h1]
This game is largely based on building stuff for yourself or for commissions people give you, farming crops isn't a huge part of the game but you'll find yourself needing some flowers or plants for crafting and missions. 
Taking care of animals isn't really fun, you need to either buy food for them or plant it, you need to pet them everyday and collect their feces for them to be happy and they don't really provide profit, I honestly think they added them just for the tags, show people that there is so much to do or relate it to other games.

[h1] The story [/h1]
Don't worry, I'm not gonna spoil anything. the main story and missions are really fun and diverse, They sometimes ask you to find something, build something and even go on fun adventures.
The side stories are mainly based on the citizens and it really shows you their personalities and how they are, the side missions really bring the game to life. 

[h1] The combat [/h1]
The combat in the game is really smooth and challenging in a fair way. there is multiple weapon types that you will go through so you will not get bored leveling up and getting new weapons.

[h1] What does the game offer? [/h1]
There is a lot of things to do and discover in the game even if you finish the game you can collect artifacts for the museum and customize your home, marry and have kids. but those could get boring very fast if you didn't start doing them from the beginning 

[h1] Flaws and criticism [/h1]
There is like a couple of janky animations and small unnoticed details but they aren't really noticeable.
The fun part of the game is doing the missions and discovering new things, but once the main story is finished there isn't really much to do but do a 100% completion and that can get frustrating really fast and here's why.
[b] The museum[/b] : collecting parts for the museum can get really repetitive and boring if you're grinding it [spoiler] going to the mines and collecting artifacts piece by piece and resetting the cave is just boring and there is a lot of artifacts to collect [/spoiler]
[b] Befriending [/b] :oh my god this is the worst part of the game if you're trying to be ""BFF"" with everyone. let me explain, you get closer to people by going on a play date or giving them gifts, play dates and gifting gives relationship points, if you get 100 relationship points you fill 1 heart with that person, you need to fill 10 hearts to be ""BFF"" with someone gifting loved gifts to a person gives you from 15 to 25 relationship points depending on the person. play dates give from 1 to 30 relationship points i think, if you want to be ""BFF"" with everyone you have to gift and play date with 57 people/animals, 59 if you include your kids.

I can't wait to get The Factory. I did get the choice of some jobs I couldn't complete due to the lack of having The Factory. 
This game is wide open enough that you can be who you are. A Socialite who schmoozes everyone and makes friends out of the entire town or you can just make things and make friends the the cat or dog or a mix of any of it. Perfection!

I want to put it out there that this game, nonetheless if it is lacking in any aspects at all. Is still a pretty decent game in my book. I've played many other sandbox-life simulator type games before, some examples being playing Harvest Moon FOMT on the GBA and Stardew Valley on PC. I got MTAP in 2018 when it was still in development and it really surprised me when  the released version improved a lot compared to its pre-released version, and it really has been a joyride to take because its fun and relaxing atmosphere the game has and all of it was brought upon by the characters of the town, combined together with the picturesque scenery and calming background music.

-My Time at Portia is a game that starts off simple, but quickly opens up to being a hugely diverse experience. The central point is to take on missions that have you assembling a wide variety of items. I find this a very engaging take on fetching and crafting, as you're putting together and then installing all of these things by hand. Even the fast travel system feels incredibly well earned, because you have to craft each stop individually. Your efforts turn the tiny backwater of Portia into a bustling metropolis, and it's very satisfying to see that you did this all.

-Portia is brimming with mini-games, and they're most all fun. It has one of the most enjoyable fishing mini-games I've played. There's darts, slots, see-saws, lassoing, all kinds of things to keep the experience fresh. Even cooking is gameified!

-Combat is simple, but effective, and generally pretty easy. Once you get the hang of it, you'll be able to take on enemies way above your level.

-The characters are pretty flat at first, but most get more interesting as you get to know them. I particularly like the rival builder, who is such a jerk that you will be constantly motivated to get a high rank just to rub his nose in it.
Most of the dialog is whatever, but I laughed out loud a number of times.

For the negatives...

-This game is not well optimized *at all*. Despite being a simple looking game, I had to tank my graphics settings to get it to a functional place. There are a lot of times where the game will just momentarily hang up (like when ordering a cab or opening the workbook). I had a number of crashes, mostly in main quest dungeons. These crashes are especially frustrating with the game's save system, because you're libel to lose 20+ minutes of progress. I avoided getting this game on Switch, because I read there were some game breaking bugs and poor performance. I was disappointed to see these are also present with the Steam version.

-Some of the voice acting is pretty good, but most is... bad. There are also a ton of dialogues where voice acting simply wasn't added. A few characters have spoken dialog that rarely matches the written dialog.

-Player feedback in general feels off. You can barely tell when you take damage in combat. Cutscenes tend to start VERY abruptly. Some areas almost encourage you to cheese your way up hills and walls, particularly in dungeons.

Overall, I think My Time at Portia is a great spin on farming RPGs. There is a REALLY fun and satisfying game in here, but DO NOT buy this if you are unwilling to wade through a lot of glitches and poor design to get to it.",1596351336,1596351336,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Short of it: Very enjoyable game if you like building things, collecting materials, managing inventories, and lush environments fit for adventure. If you like Stardew Valley, Forager, BoTW, etc. try this game too.


Pros +
- attractive and engaging world (the natural environments are especially pleasant)
- reasonably priced for the amount of content and craftsmanship that this game offers
- somewhat unique crafting and advancement system that feels fresh in a sea of similar games
- still being steadily updated and cared for by the developer

Cons -
- honestly, nothing really stood out to me as a real con (it's a pretty solid game by all measures)

The only downsides I see is that you have to go into the mines and fight the bad guys which I would rather not have to do, but it's an integral part of the game. There are also times when the missions/tasks they give you are overwhelming and make me want to rage quit. I prefer going at my own pace and just chilling instead of working mission after mission after mission or having to go into the mines to do fight after fight after fight.

And at this very moment I am still wallowing in my surprise at the things this game has achieved.  Above the previously mentioned games, MTAP has a simply combat system but a relatively complex skill tree that invites you to choose between combat, gathering, and social skills.  The gathering is pretty par for the course: hit tree = get wood.  But the social leg of this masterful triangle holds the most weight for me.  The 50+ characters are all connected to each other in these beautiful webs that can be learned and explored.  The game is translated from Chinese so some things are off, especially considering that it's an indie game.  That means that, while low on glitches, there will be segments that lack voice acting and a few typos but nothing game breaking.  The joy of interacting with other characters makes it all worth it.  You really do find yourself balancing time in a day and activities to take on, stamina and resources, health and loot, giving gifts and completing jobs.  And that balance will have to shift daily.  All in all, the 3 main aspects, combat, gathering/crafting, and social make this game much greater than its whole.  I binged 80+ hours in less than a week because it was so addictive.  Finally, I'd like to add that if you are the type of person to be open to being attached to characters and falling in love with the ""charm"" of a game, then MTAP has charm to spare.

It rises above Stardew Valley and Rune Factory 4 Special, above Story of Seasons and Animal Crossing, etc etc.  The game has such undeniable charm, and far more content than you'd expect at first glance.  The replayability is off the charts (as you might be able to tell by my hours). Really, I can't recommend it enough, especially with the world as it is now...

When you come to Portia, it is as a Builder, not a Farmer, like one would expect.  Your main goals/expectations are to fulfill commissions for Portia's Commerce Guild, while following a delightful series of quests that lead you down a wondrous road of improvement for the bustling town of Portia.  Not only is the main quest line surprisingly length and extremely satisfying to move along, but there's also a myriad of side quests.  The people of Portia are amusingly and visually-pleasingly designed, and the voice acting is often pretty impressive and well done.

It's easy to get lost in Portia (in a good way!), completing commissions, banging away for ore in the Abandoned Ruins, chopping down or kicking trees, risking life and limb for parts and scrap in the Hazardous Ruins, talking to your neighbours, gifting your neighbours, farming (yep! got that, too!), caring for animals, growing your workshop, etc etc etc.

And? All of this is set against the backdrop of a setting that gives a strangely inspirational twist on a post-apocalyptic world.  Humans messed it all up once... And in the darkness, we drew together... When light shone upon us all again, humanity stepped forth and decided to [i] do better [/i].

Your job, Builder, is to help the beautiful town of Portia do that.  Go forth and help bring telesis to this world!",1596138329,1596138329,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you've played that one, you know what to expect on a basic level. This game is very much about 10xs more involved though and..... it's a lot. For me, way too much.

The reason *I* don't like it is because after a while, it just becomes over-whelming. Like to the point of needing a notepad and the wiki open at all times to keep track of everything. After a while it turned in to tedium for me. And if you put it down for a few months and come back to it? Even worse. Good luck trying to remember what almost anything does or how to make it.

If you've played DQBuilders2, or Stardew, or Harvest Moon, Portia takes little pieces from each of these games and turns it into some great. The relationships and activities from SD and HM, and the depth of crafting from DQB2. It also adds in a nice little skill tree for some customization on top of that.

Definitely one of the best games of it's genre. I love the storyline, mechanics and art of this game but I find it sooo slooow. With the addition of of mods it is MUCH more fun. I play with reduced stamina drain and increased crafting speed/walking speed/day length, which thankfully are very easy to install. With these added you can actually explore the world at what I consider a decent pace, befriend townsfolk to learn their stories, make your farm attractive as well as functional, and not hate your life while attempting to mine. Plus... you can ride llamas (you don't need mods for that, unless you want to do it within the first 20hrs of gameplay) 

Note that I have played 56hrs of this game and I'm still probably only 60% through the main story - and 30% through the achievements.

Pro
- Have many things to do so you can play all the day long and have more to explore
- The graphics and tone of pictures are quite nice.
- The dialogues are pretty good and the dating scenario or moments are cute.
- Have many things to craft and many ways to use them. You can use items to complete quest and commissions, sell or give it to villagers to gain relationships.

I was hesitant to buy the game because of the art style, which is so weird because once I booted up the game I was like OMG itâs beautiful!! So soft, nice colors, the grass swaying in the breeze. Sooo relaxing. I spent the first couple in-game days just admiring everything. Dungeons were laid back but fun, gathering resources wasnât too grind-y, I legit loved all of the townspeople.

The lore/history of the land is what really drew me in. Upon entering the mines and finding relics like washing machines and clocks and whatever, realizing that this was a post-apocalyptic world where some really wild AI-related sh*t went down. 

Everything you do is beneficial in several ways. You can decorate your house and all the items you place give you stat boosts. Mining yields resources AND relics that can be placed in your home or in a museum for reputation points. You can also find tapes to play on your TV that give you some history of the world. Gathering resources yields EXP so you can level up and become stronger for your dungeon excursions. Making friends with townspeople will give you perks at different levels of friendship (boosts to your stats, store discounts, discounts on purchasing land, gifts, etc). Everything you do is satisfying and worth your time. And there is a LOT to do!

I just kinda wanted to live in Portia forever.

Until I didn't. LOLLLLL. I dunno, like all games in this genre, for me, it just got a little stale and I couldn't force myself to continue. I believe I made the mistake of putting the story on the backburner in favor of focusing on all the optional stuff. Knowing myself, I should have made the story priority.

I married Gust on the first year third month, and so you can probably guess I don't have the top of the line workshop that allows children, so If there could be more things to do with your spouse like take a vacation week, sort of like a paid vacation where you could take a week off, no commissions, just to be with your spouse, Probably have it pause the time on all accepted commissions as well so the player can focus on leveling up the workshop, and getting money would be amazing.

You can get married have a few kids, divorce etc. Relationships take time!! Which makes it more meaningful. Characters will get made if you stand them up for a friend date or a date date. You lead multiple on, they will know eventually. World is beautiful and there is underlying story and events happening to the village.

Like one character will be fully voice acted, and another will just be silent. One of the last scenes of the game involves a voice actor messing up their line, clearing their throat, and starting again. Not some side-quest, mind you, the very last quest that ends the game.

Parts of the game are fun. The resource management and building at the core are fine. Farming seems like its there as an obligatory gesture for a game clearly based on the Harvest Moon/Stardew Valley format, but it's far more about building than farming. The mining aspect is alright, too. With the idea being a mix of mining for precious resources and searching for buried treasure, though it's super annoying if you need to find something in particular in a mine.

The combat totally sucks. Each weapon basically plays its own damn self, so all you do is click occasionally, and let your weapon take over. There's a late game sword that literally does 3 attacks per click. It feels less like you're fighting, and more like the graphics designer is showing off how many weapon animations he can put in a game. Add to that poor responsiveness to the controls, and bizarre hitboxes and you just dread any combat-related activities by the end of the game. And by that point they're all super easy anyway.

Exploring dungeons is also weird, with at least one situation where I have to weirdly glitch jump up a wall to continue, and it seemed to be purposefully set up like that. By the last dungeon the developers seemed to realize this, and reduced all floors to just the combat section.

Like the combat, most of the side-activities and minigames are also pretty crappy. A ghost hunt through a cave particularly sticks in my memory as it was one of the main ways to gain a rare resource, but god was it awful. It uses a ranged weapon, but doesn't require the player to aim it in any way, shape or form. It just automatically targets the nearest ghost. It's like... why even bother? Is there fun in just click to win? Other activities that you'll do on dates with NPCs are also pretty uninspired. A see-saw minigame is inexplicably slow, taking a full minute to finish, but only requiring maybe 4-6 seconds of actual input throughout. Dating activities like talking aren't a challenge, or a choice in any way, you can just mash through them to get bonus and move on.

I feel like this game should still be in Early Access.

Performance isn't amazing, but that's not a deal-breaker for me.
The English can be odd, and there's often times where voice lines do not match up with the textor there's simply no voice for the dialogue line -- again, not a deal-breaker, and more a consequence of it being an ambitious indie title and (I assume) it being developed over time.
There is a LOT to dig into and sometimes it's superfluous (there are some really out of place mini-games), but the flip-side of that is that I've been pleasantly surprised by mechanics and systems that I just did not expect... Like characters asking me out on play-dates and pencilling it into my in-game calendar, old-school Animal Crossing style. 

I realise this review is sounding a bit negative, but I don't want people launching into this expecting a polished gem. It's only polished in very particular areas and if you don't enter it keeping its humble origins in mind you're probably going to bounce off of it. The slow pace is probably its biggest weakness, as at the start there's a decent chunk of time where you wonder if every character only has one line... they do have more lines and personalities and unique quests, it just takes a while to get there! Mostly. Some of them are just what it says on the tin.

Making progress in this game is thoroughly satisfying and it's full of little quality of life features that make a massive difference. An example of this is the calendar I mentioned earlier (which allows you to add your own reminders, as well as automatic ones for your friend's birthdays and seasonal events) and also universally useful features like being able to switch between storage boxes and access all your materials from the crafting menu. And you can turn off hats in the options menu, so you can be vain AND have good stats! I have my priorities.

Pros:

-Crafting is made easy to understand what is needed and how to get what you need but requires a fair bit of work. A very good balance.

-The relationships are unbelievable! If you know what you want and strive for it, 3 seasons is all you need. The dates are very unique in the variety of activities.

-Extreme customization is always a plus. The game allows the player to just about play how they want. As any good game, you need to dip your foot into every aspect to fully progress but how you play is in your hands.

-The voice acting is supreme. Every character fits their personality and really touches the player. For me, Emily and Ginger really fit their background stories. Speaking of backgrounds... (continued below)

-The character development is very good. With one year down (and many, many more to come), the player can experience much of the NPC's background and truly how they because who they are within the time they live and play in.

-The soundtrack is touching. Many of the background tunes really played with my emotions. Not to nit pick but the winter song ""White Out"" nearly brings me to tears. Worth the $5 on that OST.

Cons:

-Combat is trash. No counterplay and any enemy near your level will basically one shot you. This needs a rework for it to be worth doing at all (with the exception of quests). If you think the combat is good at all, think again buddy.

Overall, as mentioned previously, an extremely solid game (minus any combat) that is worth the full $30 USD (sale price is a bonus but not a must)

The game is fully voice acted and looks great, and is overall very fun to play.  You can generally play the entire game without a wiki-type page open on your second monitor which seems to be lacking in many similar games, as mechanics, recipes, and even strategies are presented to the player directly in game.

The game is a bit repetitive, but it doesn't feel all that bogged down.  The last handful of hours dragged a bit for me as I was ready to move on, but also wanted to finish the story.  Inventory management is also a bit lackluster as you just make dozens of boxes that you need to sort through to get your materials.  Combat is bit button mashy, but not altogether bad.

It turned out to be based on Harvest Moon, only in over the shoulder 3d and where you need to build a factory rather than farm. It's good and fun but does incorporate a lot of busy work: you'll end up giving a thousand gifts in an effort to make everyone like you, etc... but there's enough other activities to make it worthwhile.

The graphics and tone of the game are cutesy, and I would have preferred a more grown up story line, but it's fine. The combat is better than I expected. This is one of those games where you're going to need to check the wiki page to figure out exactly what you're doing as the interface is a bit overloaded.

It has lots of little things to do, but none of them feel like they have any depth or are fleshed out.  The game is astoundingly grindy, even very early on, and a depressing amount of time literally just spent running from station to station, refilling the fuel, collecting the stuff they made, and then hitting auto-sort to toss it into one of your 300 chests because each chest has a very, very small capacity and the game throws dozens upon dozens of items at you that you probably want to hold onto in case they're useful later.

There's also some oddities with the game itself.  I have to pretty much always restart my computer before playing or else I lose my mouse cursor and can't even start the game - trying to identify what's going on would probably be more trouble than it's worth, so I just roll with it... but it adds to the feel of something that's maybe a little bigger than the team was really able to grasp.  Art and sounds are cute and endearing.  Most characters and lines are fully voiced, and I'm assuming the ones that aren't were added in later.

Ultimately, a game that didn't grab me in the way that Stardew Valley did.  I really think I'd enjoy it more if it wasn't so damned *grindy.*  I spent several in-game days literally just walking around and waiting for bronze bars and then iron bars and then carbon steel bars to craft so I could progress the plot or do things.

Buy this game if u enjoy games like Stardew Valley, where u collect ur own resources, kill monsters for l00t, build and upgrade workshops and tools, build relationships with other townies and completing quests etc. These are just some of the things u can do on this game.

It's not like harvest moon or stardew valley, although it shares many aspects of both. 
If you're here for a relaxing progression, to see how much different things you can make, or to painstalkingly build up a relationship with one of the NPCs, it's pretty rewarding. 

In my opinion, if you're here for any one single mechanic, you'll be disappointed. The game does have some bugs, and battle is pretty meh. But the amount of content, stuff you can make, progression, quest story, side quests, relationships are, although not extremely deep or the best, extremely relaxing. 
You cannot make 'fatal mistakes' in this game. There are no harsh consequences for making mistakes. (Disclaimer: There are consequences, but they are easily recoverable).

The main difference is that most of the time you'll be crafting stuff for missions to get rewards instead of just farming. You probably should be farming and raising animals to get money on the side, but most of the time you don't really need to do it to succeed. Also, there's a story that develops as you progress and you're almost always working towards building something bigger and better, like bridges or a lighthouse or elevators.

There are dozens of quirky townspeople to befriend and romance, and most of their dialogue is voice acted. They don't just keep repeating the same lines, either. What they have to say actually changes depending on what's happening in the plotline. The combat is pretty decent, but you only really need to dodge attacks on dungeon bosses.

Just keep in mind that you'll probably need to consult a wiki to discover how to obtain some of the more obscure crafting materials. Luckily, there are usually a couple different ways to find them, whether it be mining them, getting them as loot from combat, or commissioning the civil corps to find them for you in exchange for cash.

I have only stopped playing this game because I am eagerly awaiting the next update, so I may be a little biased.

First off, I think it is important to note that despite the tags on the store page, MTAP is not a farming game. Farming actually takes up a minimal portion of the game and you can actually fare pretty well without barely growing anything (apart from those god damned crystal trees). You play as a builder collecting materials and assembling various objects for quests/commissions. This takes up a bulk of your time early-game and therefore I appreciate that farming has been made as low-maintenance as possible. You apply fertilizer to increase crop yield, but you do not need to water them everyday. You can literally leave them in the planter boxes and they will grow just the same.

It is not difficult to see the influence of games like Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing in MTAP, but it is also evident that they try to be more than a regular sim game:

1. There is a combat system (with PvE and PvP in the form of friendly sparring with the NPCs) and while some may feel that it is little beyond button mashing, I think people who play such sim games may not typically want complex combat features. 
2. There is an RPG-style point system where every time you level up you invest in skills (under 3 trees depending on your play style). It also offers you the flexibility of resetting your points to better suit your mid- or late-game needs. 
3. The social system is more intricate and involved than what I've seen in SDV or AC - aside from basic things like gifting and talking, you can also go on play dates with NPCs where you can choose activities to do. Some of these are in the form of mini games which I still find to be one of its most unique and charming points. It is also pretty hilarious when you gift someone a sofa and they just put it in their pocket like nbd. Side note: gifting is done from your inventory, so there is less chance of you accidentally giving someone the wrong gift.
4. I also especially appreciate the relationship tree where if you gain a heart with one NPC, your relationships with linked NPCs (e.g. family members or friends) also improve.
5. Ruin-diving may be one of my favourite activities in this game. There is just something so appealing about drilling down in 3rd person to find relics and mine for ores at the same time.
5. Assembling objects is oddly satisfying and being a builder makes a lot of sense in the story line. 
6. The game time is much more forgiving than SDV - the day ends at 3AM and your character passes out if not asleep by then, but you just wake up the next day with no penalty to your stamina. There is no acknowledgement from the game too and you do not ever need to pay whoever mysteriously found you in the mines and brought you home.
7. You can equip various equipment in the game, and mid-game you are given the freedom of altering your preferred clothes/weapons to adopt the stats of higher-level counterparts,

Despite all of this, MTAP is not without flaws. I love this game to bits, but not blindly enough to not acknowledge this. 
1. This is well-known to both the player base and developers, but the voice acting leaves [b]a lot[/b] to be desired. It is inconsistent (sometimes the VA just stops in the middle of a conversation, sometimes there is outright no VA, and in my particular case the VA synced up for the NPCs but was early for my character). I would turn off the VA but I've gotten so used to the NPCs and their voices (which I must give credit for - it is mostly well suited).
2. I understand the whole idea of putting materials in your hot bar and adding them one at a time. This works for the assembly part of the game, but not for the cooking part. Having to run to your storage and retrieve ingredients to put in your hot bar, then add them one by one to the cooking part has deterred me enough from cooking altogether. It would be such a good QOL fix if we could cook known dishes directly from the recipes list. 

Overall, MTAP took me by a big deal of surprise and is now one of my favourite sim games I've ever played. If you can look past the character modelling (which I know some people dislike, but I find charming), the VA, the sometimes buggy camera you will thoroughly enjoy this game.",1594474633,1594474649,True,28,0,0.770410418510437012,0,True,False,False

The devs tried to do too much and weren't able to do almost any of it well. The game is broken and buggy and the performance is unbelievably bad. It takes me a full 5 minutes just to load the game and my save, then another 45 seconds to leave my house. There are regular stutters and brief freezes that make me think the game has crashed, which, to be fair, is only because the game crashes so often (and since you can only save at the end of a day, you lose all your progress for that day when it does). The combat is sluggish, unintuitive, grindy, and contains frequent freezes while cutscenes and such load. 

Now and then you'll be given a (fully non-combat) quest, usually to gather some materials and deliver them to a certain place, and upon delivery the game will drop you into a dungeon and lock the door behind you. You've been given no warning that combat is coming, so of course you haven't brought any restoration items.  This is extra-fun, because swinging your weapon costs stamina, and enemies don't typically drop stamina-restoring items. So it is fully possible to wind up in a position where you can no longer swing your weapon, can't move forward, but aren't allowed to go back, and if you die, you just get sent back to the start of the dungeon with no recovery of stamina. So you have no choice but to quit without saving, losing your progress for the entire day again.

I cannot comprehend what people like about this game. I love the concept! But the execution is atrocious. I really wanted to reach the end of the story, but at this point, honestly, I'm not sure if I can bring myself to continue. Fortunately, there are some mods on Nexus Mods that fix some of the glaring problems, like restoring your stamina over time, which I will probably have to use if I have any hope of finishing this giant mess of a game.

As you get to know the townspeople and defeat monsters, you learn an intriguing story about what caused the world to end, and different people's opinions on it. While the village has fallen on dark times, they are optimistic for the future, creating this lighthearted apocalyptic vibe that I absolutely adore. You can choose whether to stick to traditions by the recommendations of the church, or to seek out technological advancements with the research center, both of which have different advantages and repercussions. The story is very complex, fun, and creative, and leaves players with a HUGE amount of content to explore.

[b] Ok, enough gushing let's go to reviewing. [/b]
Story-wise it's a very good story. the story is a clear red line in the game, it's obvious what your purpose is in this world and the voice acting is nicely executed. 

The graphics are nice and clean as are the animations. The style is fun, colourful and happy. The photo aspect of the game works with the graphics and you can get poses for you're character and the townspeople what makes it fun. 

Gameplay-wise, you can switch between a purely exploring to let's get back to the main story to let's have a chill relax session. The other characters are interesting, although I would say that it would be nice to see changes in their way of acting with other people after you get married. Some dialogue seems a bit strange in the romance department. 

What brings me to the social aspect of this game. what works. You got those games were getting a friendly statue with towns our people are annoying and grinding work. In this game not so much. you can easily build a friendly relation with the townspeople. If you want to get a best friend or the romance option you need to but more work in it. But it doesn't get too annoying since there are multiple options to get to those statuses. 

Now the in-game events. There fun and you can easily skip them if you don't feel like doing them. 

Crafting in the game is easy but you may be hoping from the building table and chest back and forth. Further in the game, you can have an automatic building what scraps that back and forth hopping. 
The grinding for building resources isn't a must if you want everything done. yeah, you have some grinding to do but if you want everything in the game. If you want only the story then you can to the min amount of collecting resources.

Are there things that need changing or are there negative parts? well, there are some parts that  I personal wise wish where different but that's nick picking. They also continue updating and improving the game. What is nice, this includes adding voice acting, removing bugs, adding extra side mission/story,.... if you see something that is bugging they listen to you and that's is a big plus.

MTAP is a soft post-apocalyptic world that is filled to the brim with an interesting quests, amazing characters that you can either befriend or become romantically involved, and building up your own reputation as a reliable builder within the city of Portia. 

There is many things to accomplish just within the first day of your arrival to Portia. You become involved within the world and with the people as the seasons go by. The world while it is small is absolutely beautiful to look at. There is just something that is oddly beautiful as you see the remains of what was our civilizations just over covered with foliage. 

The voice acting can be either really good or really bad depending on your preference. Thankfully you can turn off voice acting. I recommend that you do since dialogue does not match with the transcript. 

While the main story line and major quests are finished there are some character story lines that either unfinished or not even have been developed. Thankfully the developers are still hard at work at updating the game. 

Characters will repeat the same dialogue when you try to chat with them more than once  a day.  So you will have to do a lot of gift giving to raise their friendship levels. They game does not give you hints on what the characters would like, so you are mostly likely going to give gifts that characters won't even like. 

Most of the game  mini side quests will be trial and error such cooking and gift giving.  There is not much do outside of the main story lines so often enough it can be a waiting game for your machines to finish working.

Despite being a workshop sim rather than a farming one, this game finally scratched my Stardew Valley itch. The pacing is not as frantic as SDV - which can be seen as a negative or a positive, really - but there's lots of similarities: loads (LOADS!) of characters, some very attaching; every day brings something new to try/build/fight if you're so inclined, or say 'bugger that' and go fishing; and good progression in the main questline keeps you hooked.

Above all, the devs here figured out that a peaceful sim game like this needs a little oomph, a little edge, in order for it not to be torpid. SDV's idyllic Pelican Town had a background of small town ills, despondency, alcoholism, suicidal ideation, you name it. Portia isn't that bleak, nor are the characters quite as thoroughly developed really, but it has a very neat post-apocalyptic setting that's more than a backdrop, it's part of the story. You build a ramshackle workshop in the midst of majestic fallen ruins of the Ancients, you scratch to recover a bare minimum of their knowledge, you patch things up and re-use to the hilt, and you are constantly aware of a fine balance represented by the Research Center on one side and the Church on the other: recover the wrong piece of knowledge and you can wind up in considerable danger, like a chimp stumbling upon a machine gun. There's also rumblings of war in the distance, and on the outer edges beyond where humans have re-established itself, AI Machines run rampant. It's actually kind of funny that there's two other full-time triple A games happening in the distance, while you're stuck in Portia building crap and only hearing about all this excitement from a remove. But that's part of the game's charm. You have chosen not to be your dad, not to go haring off on wild adventures or fight a war. You're staying home, building stuff and remaking the world, one winch mechanism and one tame llama at a time. It's not as exciting or as glamorous, but I would argue it is just as noble. Telesis!! 

My only critique is that the characterisation doesn't go as deep as other games of it's kind (and none of them are a recreation of War and Peace, really.) Most characters don't have an arc, or cut-scenes where they can reveal something deeper about themselves. However, there's some powerful show-don't-tell going on in the background, tiny minimalist touches such as looking for a family on one particular day and finding them surrounding a grave, head bowed in prayer... that's pretty effective, but you have to go looking for those details, and there's little follow-up. On the other hand, the main questline is long and much more full of adventure, swashbuckling, drama and friendly robots than SDV or any of its competitors, and actually helps to make up for the shallowness of other aspects. 

Oh, the very best thing about this game? The town is large and labyrinthine, but there's No Fall Damage! Take your giant cotton llama flying over the rooftops in seconds to get to where you're going, laughing like a maniac all the way! Never gets old.

TL;DR: Not quite as good as SDV but definitely up there, and a good way to while away 200 hours of quarantine.",1593977857,1593977993,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game's geared more towards people who enjoy life simulations like Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley but with slight RPG elements in combat and skill trees, but can be played fine at any pace as the game is just great for relaxing - from the music, design and gameplay, it's a great game for destressing. The cast of characters is also large and has most of it's lines voice acted,

Overall, I'd give the game a 7/5/10, falling short of higher scores due to some parts of the game having redundancies and the hardest dungeons being tedious more so than challenging, but the rest of the game being worth playing.

Like:
- There's alot of missions and options you can do everyday!
- If you like Stardew Valley, you might like this aswell!
- You can date the NPC's and have babies, get married, adopt pets and own farm animals <3
- You have to grind <3

Dislikes:
- Some characters look a bit creepy, like those orphans from Alice Madness Returns... brrrr
- The animations aren't too good in my opinion, for a game that costs almost 30 euros, I expect better animations.
- The Llamas are so cute, i feel bad for killing them :(
- When you buy the clothes DLC's at the start of your journey, you have to figure out how you can get all 24 items out of your storage. Since you can't sell them or dispose them, you need to figure out how to make those wood crates. I was really stressy about this one!
- In the ruins (more like a cave) , when you try to fly out of your hole, sometimes the jetpack lags and you get stuck on the wall which is a bit annoying. 

Note:
-> I didn't know you could accept commissions from the guild board untill I was 7 hours into the game XD
-> You need ALOT of wood crates. Specially if youre about to dig holes for 5 hours straight!

I7 4790k @4.4ghz
R9 390 8gb
32gb @2133 ddr3

Originally installed on a 7200 RPM 1tb HDD

With those stats in mind, initial load times were considerable, upwards of a minute just to get to the main menu, and then nearly another minute to get into the game and no matter what I did, the game stuttered terribly with every action, whether it be chopping wood, mining a rock or simply picking up an object. This would eventually start to clear up, perhaps it was clearing as things got loaded into ram, but if you restarted the game for any reason, it would start all over again. 

This doesn't seem to bother some people, but for me, it was unbearable.

But then I moved the game to one of my SSDs. Specifically, I moved it to my windows drive, a 525 Crucial Mx300 SSD, Load times dropped to under 10 seconds each (loading main menu/loading into the game), this also eliminate almost /all/ stuttering, every once in a while it will still stutter for a split seconds while hitting rocks with a pickaxe, but its so minor you have to be looking for it to notice it, all other stuttering is gone.

Installing to SSD was my last resort, had this not fixed the stuttering, I was going to refund the game...

Also note, that in over 48 hours of play time (with one 14 hours stint in there lol, I had nothing better to do that day, and was not feeling life, what can I say lmao), the game has not crashed a single time (now it probably will today when I play because I said this :P )

--------------------- Now for the game itself ------------------

This game is best categorized along side games like Stardew Valley, but it is not the same. Instead of being a farmer or rancher, you are a builder and your job in the town is to make things(Also the game is in 3rd person rather than looking down from above). Some jobs are minor and make no difference in the game world, others actually physically alter the game world and expand the area you can traverse. You can grow crops, and have chickens, ducks, horses, cows and sheep if you want as well.

The game world is beautiful and colorful, and when you are outdoors, there are no load screens anywhere on the map (unless you use the games 'fast travel' system after you have built it but its just a quick fade out/in) and the only time you load is going in and out of buildings, which is usually very quick. The map itself is larger than I expected and includes a desert area off to one side.

Mining is more interesting than in Stardew imo, as you actually dig and alter the ground as you do so, most materials (iron, copper, etc.) are in veins much like they would be in real life, rather than just ""Crack this rock and hope for the best"" so you can mine what you need as quickly as you want. In and out, or, spend some time finding random objects.

There are also 'dungeons' where you fight monsters to get items and other gear you may need, the combat is about what you'd expect from a game not focused on combat. Not great. But, sufficient enough to be fun (though bosses are boringly long until you get better weapons). Its one button to attack, one button to dodge roll, but no way to just block unfortunately. And the targeting can be fidgety, I've had numerous times where I've tried to attack something I was looking directly at, and instead attacked something off screen to my left or right. can be annoying, but not really game breaking.

The characters are varied and all voiced. Some are done better than others, but overall its done quite well. Some characters are genuinely enjoyable, others I just avoid because their voices annoy me, but that's going to be different for everyone. Although, dialog was limited during normal interactions, as it pretty much is in every game like this, so I won't hold that against it too much.

THE MUSIC : I love the music in this game, I am bias, because I love the sound of a piano, but I could sit and just listen to the main menu music and be content, most of the music fits the atmosphere of the game perfectly. Its very relaxing, I've actually considered buying the soundtrack for this game.

One thing that annoys me still is the controls are a bit strange (using a PS4 controller). The best example I can give is moving items in your inventory. In most games, you'd press X to select it, move it over to the inventory slot you want to place it and press X again.

For some reason, in this game, to grab it, you press square, and then to place it in the slot you press X.

When moving your stuff in your yard, you pick it up with L2, and place it with square. It just doesn't feel natural to use separate buttons and I still sometimes press the wrong buttons lol.

Overall, I like this game a lot, and look forward to having free time to play it.

[quote=Pathea Games]Restore your Pa's neglected workshop to its former glory by fulfilling commissions, growing crops, raising animals, and befriending the quirky inhabitants of this charming post-apocalyptic land![/quote] 

How could you not think it was just Stardew Valley in 3D. Even the pictures and trailer for the game posted make it seem like that. What the game really is is something else. Sure, you can ""farm,"" if by farm you mean put seeds in a box and fertilize them every so often to get materials to craft more. You can raise animals, if by raise you mean creating more busy work for more materials. And there are villagers who are, I guess, quirky, but it takes forever to befriend them.

The game really boils down to being a crafting sim. And I think it loses a lot because of that. Most of your time in the game is spent waiting for things to get done crafting- and you're waiting on things to get done crafting to craft something else- and then you take those materials to craft something else... Do you get the point? It's just crafting to craft more crafts that eventually become things you, pretty much, ""sell"" for trivial amounts of gold, experience, and fame. It's not a great gameplay loop, which is made worse by having to shuffle through the pages and pages of different kinds of crafting materials to find the right ones- or consult an online wiki to figure out how to even get an item or crafting material.

The exploration was fun, but at twenty five hours I'm sitting here wondering what more is there to see. More crafting materials? A new type of metal that does the same thing as the five other types of metal I've had to deal with already? More janky combat that makes musou games look complex? More characters that each pronounce ""Portia"" differently? I'm at a loss.

The game is fine. It's not amazing, but it's fine. There are better sim games out there, but if you've already played them then this might be of some interest- just not at full price, the game is not worth the full price.",1593883912,1593883912,True,0,0,0.484581500291824341,0,True,False,False

It has an insanely addictive crafting system alongside the farming system.

Positive points are how the game lets the player move at their own pace without forcing them to do the main story or anything else, and several other things. This game is great in many ways, and I enjoy the cave diving, most of the dungeon crawling, etc.

The one main negative I have about the game is how small grammatical errors are littered throughout the game. This doesn't subtract at all from the gameplay of the game and can be overlooked without thinking much more about it, but it does bother me.
Also some enemy hitboxes and their attack hitboxes are a little weird. For example: when you spar with Sam, her final kick combo is a little unusual in how far away it can hit you from.  Other than that though this game is great.",1593838228,1593838228,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has; 
[b]Character customization[/b] - Tweaking characters is fun and underestimated! I can spend a long time in there, but I mostly end up going for the same look every time I make a new character. That's a personal issue though. *looks into the distance*

[b]Outfit options[/b] - Do I feel like being ugly, cute or cool? Everything at once? There's a big selection, and you can buy NPC outfits too. Would be fun if there were even more, I wish I could make Aadit more handsome~ (he's my temporary husband, sometimes).

[b]Story [/b] - Since I don't want to go in to spoilers, some things about the story really interest me. Although it's not that intense, it has its intriguing moments and you feel kinda involved and welcome in the town. Some choices I made also had an impact on it that I didn't expect. It's very lovely.

[b]Relationships[/b] - I always appreciate the idea of friendships and dating in games, and this one has it. You can go on dates and playdates where you do different activities, give gifts and do quests to get closer to everyone. You can even drag them with you to kill monsters, although some will grumble over it. Later on, you can get married and have your spouse move in. You can also have babies, although it's not as developed as I'd like. They never grow up, and you can never delete/release them. Even if you move on to the next guy/girl, the baby follows you like baggage clings on to the wrong flight. 

[b]Crafting & gathering[/b] - I like the way it works in this game. You craft various tools and machines, then you use them to craft other things. As for gathering, it's really satisfying to just chop/drill things down. Not to mention the ruin diving system, I've had tons of fun with it after being confused and skeptical at first! Especially after you change from a pickaxe and get a drill;it speeds up significantly. Basically you just woosh through these mines and get ores while you look for relics, but you can fly around while doing so. 

[b]Dungeons[/b] - This was surprising to me, although it's not a very complicated system, it's very  fun to go into dungeons and just slash down enemies. You get mats and a satisfied feeling in your tummy that you did something right at the end of the day.

* El juego es extenso y variado, con muchas horas de tareas y eventos a realizar.
* Siempre te mantiene ocupado con misiones a realizar, es difÃ­cil quedarse sin nada que hacer.
* Permite elegir una misiÃ³n especial por dÃ­a entre varias, dando mÃ¡s variedad de elecciÃ³n en el dÃ­a a dÃ­a.
* La estÃ©tica del juego es muy agradable e invoca calma, mismo para la mÃºsica.
* Permite tener relaciones con muchos de los NPCs del pueblo.
* El sistema de afinidad de los NPCs estÃ¡ vinculado entre sus conocidos, permitiendo subir relaciones de a varios a la vez.

Contras:
* El juego estÃ¡ muy mal optimizado, y pide requerimientos de PC altos para el tipo de grÃ¡ficos que tiene. Pudiendo correr con la misma PC juegos AAA de alta exigencia mucho mejor que este juego.
* Falta de feedback visual al recoger objetos.
* El combate es aburrido y repetitivo, le falta mucho feedback. Y es obligatorio para avanzar con el juego.
* Los dungeons y cuevas son demasiado lineales y bÃ¡sicos. No resaltan para nada.
* Minijuegos para subir relaciones aburridos y monÃ³tonos.

ConclusiÃ³n:

El juego es divertido, pero los desarrolladores pareciera que apuntaron demasiado alto y se quedaron cortos. Habiendo partes del juego que parecieran que estÃ¡n en Beta o Early Access, como el combate por ejemplo. AÃºn asÃ­ las relaciones con los NPCs y las actividades son relajantes y finalmente tienen su lado divertido. Recomiendo el juego si les gusta mucho el gÃ©nero y lo compran con una muy buena oferta.

NOTA IMPORTANTE: Si estÃ¡n viendo este review pensando en comprar la versiÃ³n de Nintendo Switch les recomiendo que no lo compren ni siquiera en oferta, ya que es extremadamente inferior a la versiÃ³n de PC y por momentos injugable.",1593733045,1593733045,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I love this game, Its everything i want from the relaxing/sim genre....
But I cannot reccomend it to others. at its early access price it was well worth it, but [strike]  the missing dialog and [/strike] inconsistant optomization mean it should have stayed in early access just a little longer. [strike] If the dialog was only used in the cutscenes and the sound effects for the text conversations them maybe its worth $30, [/strike] after all there is is a TON of content here.  But it just doesn't have that polish that makes it feel finished.
[strike] That being said, I have faith the devs will continue to work on this [/strike], so i will update the review when they make the appropriate fixes.

You take over your dad's old workshop, moving into a new town. Doesn't have the same anime style/tropes as the games above; has more of a western, Stardew Valley-ish vibe for characters.

TONS to do. You can mine (in a very neat way that doesn't go by the block), craft items (including building large items according to a blueprint), explore caves and new areas, upgrade tools and weapons, get new clothes, complete tasks assigned by NPCs/the guild, get points for your workshop and strive to be better than your rival, ride and tame horses and llamas, fish, raise fish, raise farm animals, fight monsters, spar with NPCs, decorate your house, expand your property, socialize and give gifts, shop, manipulate market prices, acquire pets, contribute to research or to the church, marry, and participate in various different events (eg. one where gifts fall from the sky, a fishing tournament, a horseback race, etc.). There is character customization, and you can play as male or female.

Major cons: Dialogue is repetitive and sometimes unfinished. Some random NPC visitors with nothing to say can break immersion. A little buggy, even on a decent computer. Getting friendship levels up can take a long time (might be a pro to you). Storing your items in like 10 billion chests can be annoying.

Overall, your best option for this kind of game on Steam so far.

It is similar to Stardew Valley as a daily interaction system, but focuses on an inventor system that continually develops as the game progresses.  Plenty of social interaction, fishing, fighting, RPS (rock-paper scissors).  The game rewards big events well, and I enjoyed the story line as well as the difficulty level.  I personally enjoyed the battle sequences and battles in general.

This is what everyones routine is going to look like in early stages:
1.fix house.
2.run to beat higgins to commissions first thing in the morning \
3.steal higgins stuff/
4.make items to give gifts to folks specially mayor
5.make items for future
6.burn SP to max before nightfall by gathering wood or stones.
7.keep machines running.
8. Do it all over again.

or

1.fix house
2.get fishing rod
3.make money
4.buy chair to reset stamina. then do step 4 to 8 as above.
No one will be able to skip this if you want to progress at all.

Having no save button makes the constant crashes no fun. Game seems to bug out a log during load out screens from one building to the open world.

Game speed good option - but still makes this game a mental chess of what you can and cannot do. It is going to be an MMO like grind till you reach higher levels and can have surplus of stamina. 

In a way the option of choice is just an illusion -- there is no free will per say as if you want to progress is game there is only limited options to move ahead till

Beautiful game, great ideas restricted by bad mechanics. The time constraint - either don't force me to sleep or let me have a longer day. I uninstalled it because was always running against time and not able to enjoy anything you do. It became chore..trying to just run through to get up and running so you can multi-task. But time you finish with that - you are already past half day.
Make the nights dangerous or something - but don't force to sleep. If you are going to force to sleep then allow the player to set time for how long a day should be.
I barely played this game but its already become a chore.
Can't recommend as is, it almost makes it arcade like. Basically WAKE up >> spam get  out of bed key >> so you can rush to whatever event you wanted to >> but first reset and refuel all the workbenches and forges >> then rush to town hall before higgins and then continue do whatever singular job you can do before having to rinse repeat with workbenches and forges >> and go to sleep..

Not fun.
Hope there are good changes in months to come. C'mon Devs lets not do the same thing we did for last one...shall we?",1581041019,1593388069,False,0,1,0.436507940292358398,0,True,False,False

With over 500 hours of playtime, it is both addicting and amazing. Although the plot is linear with each play through, the quests and side missions do change depending on who you pick as your romantic partner. I would also like to give a shout out to the makers of this game for allowing a same sex game play mechanic. Even though I am heterosexual, I think it's great that when you pick a male or female character, that you can marry someone of the same sex and then proceed to adopt children. So kudos to the game designer. It's definitely a sandbox style game with some limits to it of course. This game brings to the table the ability to mine, fish, build, buy, sell, date, get married, adopt pets, mini games, level up, complete quests, commissions, tame and ride llamas...
