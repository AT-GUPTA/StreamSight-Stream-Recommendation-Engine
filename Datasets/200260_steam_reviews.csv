On the surface level , everything might seem simple and straight foward but there's a lot happening /happened behind the scenes that the game never forces you to know , it's right under your nose. Collecting the riddler trophies might seem like a waste of time with no rewarding factor than just filling a counter in the statistics screen but that's simply not true , it rewards you with lore , arkham stories , character bios and tapes you can listen to. 

Pay a little more attention to the environment and you""ll figure out how everything in this prison city came to be. Listen to the random converstions among thugs for valuable info , jokes and even lore that you might have missed or didn't read.

Simply put , Arkham City is a gourmet meal and such meals are better consumed slowly while savouring the taste of every bite. The Characters , the atmosphere , the combat and the gadgets , everything flows together so well like peanut buter and jelly. 

Besides a few wasted characters such as Bane and ivy , everything about the game fine asf.

[h2]Story[/h2]

""You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to a lawyer. I'm not a lawyer."" Rocksteady Studios weaves a complex web of intrigue, pitting the Dark Knight against a rogues' gallery of his most notorious adversaries. The story takes place within the walls of Arkham City, a sprawling prison district housing Gotham's most dangerous criminals. With Two-Face stirring the pot, Joker playing his usual chaotic hand, and shadowy figures lurking in the background, Batman must unravel the mysteries at play while facing his own internal struggles.

The narrative is masterfully crafted, packed with twists and turns that will keep you guessing until the very end. The characters, both heroes and villains, are brought to life with exceptional voice acting and writing, each with their own unique motivations and personalities. Humor is sprinkled throughout, providing welcome moments of levity amidst the darkness. But it's not all just brawls and gadgets; the story delves into themes of morality, justice, and the true cost of vengeance, leaving you pondering long after the credits roll.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]

Arkham City is a joy to play. The free-flowing combat system is addictive, allowing you to chain together bone-crunching combos with effortless grace. Taking down thugs feels incredibly satisfying, thanks to the responsive controls and impactful animations. Stealth mechanics are equally well-polished, letting you outsmart enemies with strategic takedowns and gadgets like the Batarang and smoke grenades.

The open-world environment is a highlight, brimming with secrets to uncover and side missions to complete. Soaring through the skies as Batman is exhilarating, and the detailed environments, from the gritty industrial zones to the opulent opera house, are a treat to explore. The Game of the Year Edition includes all the DLC, adding even more content and challenges to keep you engaged for hours.

[h3]Minor quibbles:** While the core gameplay is fantastic, there are a few minor issues. Some boss battles can feel repetitive, and the Riddler's collectibles can become tedious after a while. However, these are minor drawbacks in an otherwise exceptional experience.[/h3]

[h2]Graphics & Sound[/h2]

Arkham City is dark and atmospheric, perfectly capturing the essence of Gotham City. The character models are detailed, and the environments are richly textured. The lighting and shadow effects are particularly impressive, creating a truly immersive atmosphere. The sound design is equally top-notch, with the score perfectly complementing the action and the voice acting being superb. Kevin Conroy's iconic portrayal of Batman is a particular highlight, adding another layer of authenticity to the experience.

[h2]Overall[/h2]

Batman: Arkham City - Game of the Year Edition is a must-play for any fan of superhero games or action-adventure titles. It delivers an engaging story, exceptional gameplay, and a stunning presentation. With its wealth of content and replayability, this is an experience that will stay with you long after you've put down the controller. So, if you're looking for a game that will take you on a thrilling journey through the heart of Gotham City, look no further than Arkham City. Just remember, the night is darkest before the dawn... and Batman is always watching.

In every single way it is an improvement over Arkham Asylum. Combat is engaging, story is captivating and varied, exploration is exciting. All systems are in just such a perfect harmony. Sincerely, the only negative I can come up for this game is that the gadget selection is tedious. A weapon wheel would have been so much nicer to use. But that sincerely is the only negative I have.

This game might not be the best game ever made. It does not have the deepest combat ever, it doesnt have the best story ever written, it doesnt have the most beautiful open world ever creater. What this game is a gold standard of what a good game should be. Perhaps none of the individual aspects alone are the best ever on their own but as a package this game is one of the best ever created and I truly mean this might be the perfect game in that this game is what games should be.

To change your keyboard controls, you need to open your drive (C:\) and then go to the following:
Program Files (x86) -> Steam -> steamapps -> common -> Batman Arkham City GOTY -> Binaries -> Win32

Not only did it improve on its bland and disappointing predecessor in every possible way, not only it turned out to be one of the best superhero games ever produced, but also it can be counted among the top games in any genre, period. Its not at all necessary to be a fan of the character to enjoy this gem... and I'd argue, its not necessary to play the first game in the series either. Beyond a couple of references to the original, the series could have started at this chapter just as well, and this is what I'd recommend to new players of the Arkham games: It isn't worth it to complete Arkham Asylum just to see the whole story.

The game takes place in a whole section of Gotham City, closed down and turned into a big prison complex, where criminals and supercriminals have free for all and fight among themselves for control. In terms of the gameplay, though, Arkham City represents an open game space where you, the player, can freely travel from spot to spot, climb buildings and swing between them. The mobility, once you get the hang of the game, is superb. Very aerial, just moving around the city becomes an exciting experience, while the non linear nature of the missions and collectibles give you a remarkable feeling of freedom and keeps you interested in the game.

No gameplay feature in ""City"" is underused... from the exciting and greatly expanded combat, to the numerous gadgets you can employ in many, often creative ways. Most importantly, Arkham City received a lot of surprising attention to detail in regards to interactivity, specially how the enemies and the environment react to certain player actions. Experimenting with the game is often rewarded. The stealth sequences are also greatly improved from Asylum, they're harder, they demand a bit more thinking and skill from the player. They're fun.

But the main dish is still Batman kung fu, and the game doesn't disappoint in this area. The variety and creativity you can invest in your fighting against large groups of foes, greatly honors its Batman license. Furthermore, you aren't limited to play as the Dark Knight this time, and best of all, the other characters all feel very enjoyable and different to Batman.., each has its own set of moves to fight and means of travel. This feature expands the already good variety and replayability of the game quite a bit.

In contrast to the campy, '60s style Batman of the previous game, this is a more modern take featuring a lot more brutality and grit, both in visuals and in writing. The gothic style of the art design coupled with a gameplay-focused architecture, results in a visually compelling, but at the same time entertaining, Arkham City. And the costumed criminals, Batman's main foes, are so much better written and delivered by the voice actors in comparison. They actually feel like the violent, psychopatic, disturbed criminals they're supposed to be. Gone are the endless, and senseless, Joker ramblings on the comm from the first game. Here, all the voice work has a purpose in the narrative. The story line branches a lot more, its not on rails anymore... many things are happening at the same time, not to mention it is more ""noir"" flavored, and more logical too... without the huge plot holes and implausibilities from the first game.

Perhaps the only design problem from Arkham City is the lack of proper, satisfactory difficulty settings with less of a skill gap. This is a problem which, in fact, seems aggravated from Asylum. ""Easy"" is, well, easy. Its alright for casual or young players. The normal difficulty, though, is still rather low, and underwhelming for an experienced player... while the ""hard"" difficulty is incredibly tough to just anybody. While ""hard"" becomes satisfying after the player truly learns the combat system from experience and gains some skill perks, its almost impossible to beat for a new player, skilled or not. I think an intermediate difficulty, between ""normal"" and ""hard"", is missing from the game.

Batman: Arkham City, is still a fantastic game in the present day, even after all these years since its release. Its a modern classic which has never been outdated by modern games, simply because all of its individual components were polished to near perfection and still work so well together. In this sense, Arkham City is like Batman himself, who trained his mind and body to their peak in the process of wearing the cape. And he's still relevant as a character today, after more than 80 years of comic books.",1707935701,1707937520,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has some flaws I would say, one of them being, the story feels a little messy at times. But the presentation is amazing. I think the main thing I love about arkham city is how much of a 'video game' it feels. It sounds weird, but the way it's structured, is really immersive. In the sense that, now you're in the sewers looking for a way to the lazarus pit so you can help freeze, that kind of thing, like it finds really fun excuses to put you in new environments.
I think, the boss fights are a little weak overall, because the gameplay is inherently limited in how much it can stretch the player, but the existence of them really helps the game to feel more cohesive too, summarising every big gameplay segment in nice chapters. The soundtrack is, amazing, I can't put into words how good the music is. The gameplay itself is extremely fun, I'm just a big fan of the arkham series combat, particularly on hard difficulty. I understand some people find it a little annoying to spam, personally I really like it as more of a rythm/timing sort of thing, instead of spamming, but any play style is fine, it's not like theres a 'right way' to play. 
What else. Gameplays fun, story presentation is fun. Story elements are a little messy, 
[spoiler] hugo strange was a little disappointing as a villain, he didn't do much. [/spoiler]
But yeah, overall it just feels so immersive and cinematic without taking away control or sort of, overly hiding that it's a video game. It's not afraid to make you do X thing to unlock Y area, but presents it in a way that just feels really fun. You're not exactly sure why you're punching a shark over ice, but it feels purposeful. Sure, it feels like convenient that the only reason you're chasing the ninja is because they happened to be in the museum with freeze and now you need the lazarus pit, BUT, now you're chasing a ninja on the rooftops with a decent story justification and the music is great.
[spoiler] Sure it's a bit weird that batman is carrying the joker out like that at the end, considering the joker is literally evil, I prefer incarnations of batman who genuinely despise the joker, however, the way it's presented felt like a sort of, I dunno, meta sort of respect/sendoff to the character/voice acting, it's hard to describe, but it just felt impactful in a way that goes beyond the story, cinematic, emotional, etc. Like a send off to the whole 'fun' of the characters, not so much the actual in universe character. [/spoiler]
So yeah, overall. I'd recommend arkham city, for sure. Great game. 
Hmm, I guess one thing I would say is that I think the game is a little disrespectful in how it treats the female characters, they all seem to be designed to appeal to a fantasy and make batman feel more 'cool' rather than being actual characters. But other than that it's a great game. ",1412362251,1707657632,True,2,1,0.504950523376464844,0,True,False,False

I finished all the side missions and nearly everything.

Now, about the game...
This game builds on everything that Asylum achieved and went to 1000 from there. Everything is better! I thoroughly enjoyed everything this game has to offer. Definitely worth my insanely long wait. Now, on towards the Knight!

There are almost no negative sides to this game except that if you want to 100% it, you have to go through a quite annoying process finding all the Riddler's trophies. Although it's a distinctiveness of the saga at this point (since both Asylum and Knight also have this complementary ""quest"").

It also a lot of replay value given that you have a NewGame+. And apart from that, you have a DLC that situates between Arkham City and Arkham Knight.

Batman: Arkham City is an exceptional game that truly captures the essence of being the Dark Knight. As a fan of the Batman franchise, I was blown away by the immersive world, gripping storyline, and addictive gameplay.

The open-world environment of Arkham City is beautifully crafted, allowing me to freely explore Gotham City and its iconic landmarks. The attention to detail is remarkable, from the gritty streets to the towering skyscrapers, creating a truly immersive experience.

The storyline is captivating, filled with twists and turns that keep you engaged from start to finish. The game introduces a wide range of memorable characters from the Batman universe, each with their own unique personalities and motivations. The voice acting is top-notch, with Mark Hamill's portrayal of the Joker being particularly outstanding.

Combat in Arkham City is fluid and satisfying. The game offers a variety of combat moves and gadgets that allow you to take down enemies with style. The stealth mechanics are also well-implemented, giving you the option to silently eliminate foes or engage in intense hand-to-hand combat.

Graphically, the game is stunning for it's time, with detailed character models and impressive visual effects. The soundtrack perfectly complements the dark and atmospheric tone of the game, further immersing you in Batman's world.

Overall, Batman: Arkham City is a must-play for fans of the Caped Crusader. It offers a rich and immersive experience, combining a compelling storyline, addictive gameplay, and stunning visuals. Whether you're a die-hard Batman fan or simply enjoy action-adventure games, Arkham City is a title that should not be missed.

This game introduced me to many things. It helped me find an appreciation for comics, an appreciation for game design, and an appreciation for voice acting. I've seen many reviewers dock points from this game for having very simplistic combat mechanics and while yes it is simple enough to learn, there is so much to master. The variety of ways to bust absolute ass is insane and it is incredibly fun to mess around with the mechanics of all of Batman's gadgets and skills. The amount of in universe lore and information about the history of Batman as a whole is nothing short of fantastic. These are supplemental details, but they show that Rocksteady gave the needed care and love that makes a game like this so great and, for the interested party, rewards the player with information in and out of game. As far as voice acting goes, it should go without saying that it is chock full of knockout performances. The late and great Kevin Conroy was amazing here, which is saying a lot because I think this is far from his best performance as Batman. The intensity Conroy exudes while in the role fits the setting perfectly and makes Batman feel like an impending force that should be feared. Mark Hamill is stellar as usual as The Joker, from the maniacal laugh to the incredibly well written dialogue between him and Batman, this may be Hamill's best performance as Joker. The supporting cast is nothing to write off either. The cold and calculated tones of Mr. Freeze that Maurice LaMarche brings is genuinely chilling. Nolan North as The Penguin is a stellar performance and is a perfect fit for the role with the heavy cockney accent and condescending lines. Tara Strong's Harley Quinn is fantastic and bombastic as usual and she always brings a fun performance whenever the character is on screen.

If you have any interest in comics, super heroes, voice acting, music, atmosphere, or simply just want a great game to play then look no further. 10/10.",1707037430,1707037430,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Improves on the combat by introducing new enemies and new special moves and gadgets while also making it seem faster, extending that freeflow combat to new areas never before seen in a Batman game. It completely wipes Asylum's terrible boss fights, dishing out some variety and even puzzle solving, (I.E. the Mr. Freeze fight). The setting itself is as great and atmospheric as ever, building up the dangerous foes you have to fight and adding great bits of environmental storytelling. I wouldn't say it's a perfect game, there is still some tedious padding when it comes to the plot, like when you have to disable jammers, do those stupid password thingies, play those Catwoman missions, etc, a lot of these missions are just stringing Batman along. The side quests are mostly good, some are better than others but man, doing Riddler challenges and getting the trophies just to progress on that one side quests was ridiculous, I hate trying to get those! Batman also sounds a little tired, at least compared to the last game, I also dislike how he blatantly tells the player what to do sometimes or talks outloud, a bit hand-hold-y there, Bats.

An ,,old game'' but gold in the hearts of many.

The game features a captivating narrative,maybe it's not the best story but still decent to keep you hooked until you finish the main missions. But there's more ,the side missions quality impress on their own too. With outstanding voice acting from characters and beautiful visuals Arkham City provides an immersive experience to fight criminals and feel as a true vigilante.

The Dark Knight fights crime with an impressive arsenal of gadgets and abilities. With the help of counters you can combo a huge chain of hits on enemies and it feels amazing to strike and evade with incredible accuracy. I was a little disappointed about the simplified stealth mechanics ,it felt like a huge potential lost . 

I liked the exploration and the enigmatic puzzles, the Riddler Trophies but i couldn't find them all..maybe there were too many.. Grappling and soaring around the city is thrilling and fun ,it really feels like you playing as the Batman from movies or comic books.

On a negative side of the coin,side missions can become repetitive after the initial impression and a few glitches can happen from time to time but nothing serious. 

I enjoyed the diverse lineup of villains ,each with his own motives and schemes. The boss fights were fun and well designed despite minor imperfections.

In conclusion, Arkham City is not a perfect game but close to perfection for the comic book fans and superhero fans. My recomendation is to first play Batman : Arkham Origins and Batman: Arkham Asylum.
Playing through the story chronologically is a better choice and should be considered.

Pros:
-Fluid combat with smooth counters and gadget combos
-solid voice acting
-good story and decent side-missions

Cons:
- Side missions can become repetitive after some time

It was an improvement on Batman Arkham Asylum, but not really by much. Combat was mostly the same. Enemies were bland and repetitive, bosses were quite uninspiring, and the story felt all over the place. While simple in premise for Joker, there was also Ra's Al Ghul in there too for some reason. 

Joker wasn't as charismatic as a result of him being 'diseased'. Far too many riddler trophies when focus could have been placed on more interesting side missions.

all games are good but have a few issues which i've listed below i recommend the games but they have their faults (arkham origins blackgate is a bit harder to follow its like a puzzle game kinda)
before you buy any batman games i found almost all are filled with glitch in origins predator encounter enemy's will teleport which makes stealth a bit tricky,in asylum i found zero glitches good game,in city enemy's will go flying in the air when you punch them and in stealth will occasionally teleport,in origins blackgate i found no glitches (and in Gotham knights i have yet to find any glitches)

in city's Harley Quinn dlc robin will slightly float above ground in combat leading to losing combos.
in origins stealth is great but in detective mode you will usually take out an enemy and the enemy's will run for a few sec then teleport to you which sucks ass.
in arkham knight the graphics look funny for characters looks kinda like arkham asylum and city enemy's mixed together (my opinion) i also have found 2 enemy's so far have run sideways i have screenshots of 2 ai running facing the ground mid air",1706387504,1706387504,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

City is the best because it had all three of those and it worked really well. It also feels like it could be adapted into a comic. Asylum and Origins also could be but neither have a wide amount of Batman's classic villains to make it really entertaining. Knight just wouldn't really work as a comic cause Batman is going up against an army which really isn't much of a Batman thing to do.

Rocksteady Studios has not only refined the groundbreaking mechanics of its predecessor but has elevated the genre to new heights with a gripping narrative, iconic characters, and an open-world Gotham City that serves as the ultimate playground for justice.

The narrative of Arkham City is a masterclass in storytelling, weaving a complex and mature tale that showcases Batman at his most vulnerable. The sprawling prison city, transformed from sections of Gotham, becomes a battleground where the Dark Knight faces not only familiar foes but also new, enigmatic adversaries. The voice acting, led by Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as the Joker, delivers performances that define the characters in ways only the Arkham series can.

Gotham City itself is a character in Arkham City, a sprawling urban landscape that feels both atmospheric and lived-in. From the towering skyscrapers to the gritty streets, every inch of the city is meticulously designed to reflect the grim, noir aesthetic of Batman's world. The seamless transition between interiors and exteriors adds to the immersive experience, allowing players to feel the weight of the city's dark secrets.

The combat system, known for its fluidity and depth, remains a highlight in Arkham City. The Freeflow Combat system enables players to unleash devastating combos and counterattacks with unparalleled finesse, making each encounter a ballet of martial prowess. The addition of new gadgets and improved environmental takedowns adds variety to Batman's arsenal, keeping the gameplay fresh and dynamic.

The open-world structure of Arkham City allows for unprecedented freedom in navigating Gotham's grim streets. Side missions and collectibles are seamlessly integrated into the narrative, providing depth and replay value. The Riddler's challenges, in particular, are a testament to the game's clever level design and puzzle-solving elements, offering a rewarding challenge for completionists.

Arkham City's rogues' gallery is a who's who of Batman's iconic adversaries, and each encounter is a thrilling test of wit and skill. The boss battles, ranging from Two-Face to Mr. Freeze, are standout moments that showcase Rocksteady's ability to craft memorable and challenging encounters.

The musical score, composed by Nick Arundel and Ron Fish, complements the dark and atmospheric tone of the game. The powerful orchestral arrangements enhance the emotional impact of key moments, intensifying the overall cinematic experience.

In conclusion, Batman: Arkham City is more than a game; it's a definitive Batman experience that sets the standard for superhero gaming. Rocksteady's attention to detail, respect for the source material, and innovative gameplay mechanics combine to create an immersive and unforgettable journey through the heart of Gotham. For fans of the Dark Knight and gaming enthusiasts alike, Arkham City is an absolute must-play, proving that sometimes the night is darkest just before the dawn.",1705869604,1705869604,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Batman Arkham City is one of the most enjoyable video games I have ever played in my life. Just going to list what i think are the reasons this game is a must play; Freeflow combat system makes for the cleanest and most destructive fighting/beat-em-up game play (breaking skull and bones of the criminally insane has never been better). Predator sequences allow for creative and unique take-downs and is a master class for the stealth genre of games. Game is rich with iconic batman villains in the main story and side quests. Batman's gadgets are in full effect with classics returning and being upgraded like batclaw, linelauncher, remote batarang, grapple hook, and new gadgets added to the utility belt, the freeze grenade and jammer being my favorite. Main story keeps you guessing what next, with a amazing climax and twist ending that makes replaying employable while you pick apart the hints of foreshadowing. The Catwoman side expansion, which is supposed to be played along side the main game, is my favorite change of pace. It is similar game play but so unique as your approach to stealth changes to work with different abilities and gadgets, and fighting with the cat's expressive combat style is a part of how the developers care for characters other than batman. Do not sleep on the alternative dlc skins, all of them look great in game and all from respected batman universes, the tv animated skins are my favorite because I love the way they clash and stand out in this game.
     While I did have a problem with tedious riddler collect-a-thon as a kid, I found it more enjoyable later as i could apreciate the rewards for finding all of the riddles. You receive viewable in game character models, lore pages about the Batman Arkham universe, extra re playable combat and predator levels with character unique challenges, and get the pleasure to find and beat the shit out of that pencil neck dweeb Riddler while he sits behind his nerdy desk with two monitors and rainbow light up keyboard for thinking he could outwit the worlds greatest detective. 
     Harley's revenge is a great post game dlc that shows love to the greatest crime fighting duo batman and robin. We all wanted robin to be playable in a campaign and switching in-between robin and batman through the story similar to catwoman, is what we are being vindicated for in this campaign, NO NIGHTWING CAMPAIGN IS CRAZY THO. Nightwing is so chill and him being locked to the riddler challenge mode can hardly be fair. All the best gadgets are in this guy's utility belt and he comes with the wayne manor predator challenge, GOAT end of discussion.

The Story is really good having some really cool twists that exceed what Asylum was able to do. The characters are all so entertaining in the best way and the voice acting is phenomenal.

The Setting of Arkham City is just fantastic with it giving the player a more open world experience. All locations are well diverse and offers up more to explore than Asylum did. 

Visually, it's really held up well for this being a 2011 game. Performance was again iffy as i got the same problems that i had in Asylum with there being a tone of stutter that got really distracting. I don't know it's to do with the settings or just how these games are made but the stutter problem is really annoying. And while there were no glitches, I did experience one bug that completely crashed my game. Hopefully it's a settings issue than the game itself being broken. The Art Direction however is just brilliant with all character designs being on point and holding up a pretty good realism look. 

Sound and Audio are amazing with there being more memorable pieces in this game than the previous and I do think that the Audio is greatly improved especially in combat. 

In terms of Gameplay, Arkham City makes major improvements. Movement feels better and it's great to be able to actually fly around as Batman instead of what Asylum offered. Combat offers more variety in taking out enemies and the core systems that made it great feel a lot smoother. Gadgets feel a lot better to use and there is more variety. I really like there being side quests with other villains that offers a lot of playtime on top of the challenge modes. The Riddler is better developed with trophies working as actual puzzles and there being a quest to beat him. There is also the ability to play as Catwoman and while she is really fun to play as, I don't like the grapple mechanic for her.

The fact that it integrated a lot of the villains from Batmans villain roster into the plot in a way that doesn't feel forced. Much like Asylum (and Arkham Knight following), you're not just fighting random nondescript thugs fighting for a singular bad guy, or only focusing on thwarting ONE bad guy, but are focusing on multiple villains was a great concept for me when this game first came out.

Gameplay wise, it's just what you's want and expect from a Batman game. Plenty of exploration, investigations, brawling, and gadget use. Even graphically, it holds up considering that it has a mild ""cartoon-y"" look to it that really helps with the longevity of how it looks.

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

From the moment I donned the iconic cape and cowl in Arkham City, I was plunged into a mesmerizing world that surpassed all expectations. Having spent 13 hours immersed in its captivating narrative and polished gameplay, I can confidently declare this game a magnum opus of the gaming world.

The combat system, a hallmark of the Arkham series, is nothing short of spectacular. Fluid, responsive, and deeply satisfying, every punch, counter, and acrobatic move feels like a symphony of controlled chaos. As the Dark Knight, I found myself seamlessly transitioning from one foe to another, orchestrating breathtaking combinations that left me feeling like the embodiment of justice.

The open-world design of Arkham City is a triumph, offering a Gotham that is as atmospheric as it is expansive. Every alley, rooftop, and dilapidated building exudes a sense of grim beauty, capturing the essence of Batman's world. The attention to detail is staggering, from the rain-soaked streets to the ominous architecture, creating an immersive environment that feels alive with the spirit of the source material.

The storytelling in Arkham City is a masterclass in narrative craftsmanship. The plot is intricate, weaving together iconic characters from Batman's rogues' gallery in a way that keeps you guessing and engaged. The voice acting, led by the legendary Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as the Joker, is pitch-perfect, elevating the emotional depth of the characters and the overall experience.

The side quests and collectibles in Arkham City are not mere distractions but integral components of the gameplay experience. Each Riddler trophy, each side mission, contributes to the overall narrative, providing a rich and layered storytelling experience that goes beyond the main plotline.

The visual and auditory elements of the game are equally impressive. The dark and gritty art style, coupled with a haunting musical score, creates an atmosphere that is both chilling and enthralling. The attention to detail in character models and animations enhances the overall cinematic quality of the game.

In conclusion, Arkham City stands as a magnum opus in the realm of gaming. Its flawless combat, compelling storytelling, and meticulous attention to detail make it a timeless classic. Whether you're a Batman fan or a gaming enthusiast, this title is a must-play, showcasing the pinnacle of what the medium can achieve.",1705086705,1705086705,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also the controls for grabbing, jumping and running are all the same so it can stuff up your movements at times. The second fights which usually involve a group of guys attacking you with different tools. Its pretty amazing how all the fighting animations flow but honestly the style of gameplay can be pretty frustrating, most thugs will get back up like 3 times before being fully knocked out, then there are thugs with shields / tazers / body armor which require lots of time and focus to beat, I understand that this style of gameplay is intentional but honestly I find it quite annoying and frustrating when some nameless thug just keeps getting back up.

Batman: Arkham City stands as a testament to the brilliance of Rocksteady Studios in crafting an unparalleled superhero gaming experience. From the moment the iconic Gotham skyline appears, you're thrust into a world that encapsulates the essence of the Dark Knight in a way that few games can rival.

The narrative is a gripping rollercoaster ride, seamlessly picking up from the events of Arkham Asylum. The notorious Arkham City serves as an expansive and atmospheric backdrop, a sprawling urban prison that redefines open-world gaming. The stakes are higher, the villains are more menacing, and Batman's world is pushed to its limits.

The voice acting is top-notch, with Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reprising their roles as Batman and the Joker, delivering performances that elevate the storytelling to cinematic levels. The script is rich with twists and turns, and the interactions between Batman and his rogues' gallery are nothing short of captivating.

The gameplay is a refined blend of combat, stealth, and exploration. The Freeflow Combat system feels more fluid and satisfying than ever, allowing you to unleash a variety of gadgets and combos in a seamless dance of destruction. The predator sections bring out the stealthy side of Batman, offering a strategic and exhilarating approach to taking down armed enemies.

The open-world design of Arkham City provides a playground for the Dark Knight to glide, grapple, and swoop between towering skyscrapers. The attention to detail is astounding, with every nook and cranny hiding secrets, Easter eggs, and side missions that add depth to the overall experience. The city feels alive with the criminal underworld going about its business, creating a dynamic and immersive environment.

Graphically, Arkham City was ahead of its time, with a visual style that remains impressive even years after its release. The character models, animations, and atmospheric effects contribute to a Gotham that feels dark, gritty, and authentic to the source material.

The game's soundtrack deserves special mention, setting the mood perfectly with its haunting melodies and intense orchestration. The musical cues during pivotal moments enhance the emotional impact of the narrative, creating an audiovisual experience that is truly cinematic.

In conclusion, Batman: Arkham City is a triumph of superhero gaming, setting a standard that many have tried to emulate but few have surpassed. It's not just a game; it's an immersive journey into the heart of Gotham City, where you get to be the Batman in all his glory. Whether you're a die-hard fan of the Caped Crusader or just love exceptional games, Arkham City is a must-play that cements its place as one of the greatest superhero adventures ever created. Don the cape, embrace the night, and dive into the chaos of Arkham City – you won't be disappointed.

Ultimately, City provides a robust enough gaming experience through a world that holds tremendous nostalgic value for me. And that's why I am recommending it.

So what does it do well? The story first and foremost. It has one of the most epic video game openings I've ever experienced. Every encounter feels visceral and salacious. The writing is witty and does not take itself too seriously. Everything is complemented by a great soundtrack. Yet despite the pristine presentation, the cinmaticness of the game never takes over gameplay like it does in many Sony titles. It all culminates in an immersive experience that Asylum could never match due to the latter's smaller scale and linear level-design.

There are compromises however, for going open-world. For one, the predator sections as we know it in Aslyum are virtually gone, replaced by open-ended stealth segments where your options are overwhelming to the point where you don't win by winning but by winning with the most style. There is also a STAGGERING amount of Riddler trophies which is enough to give anyone who's not a trophy hound a massive migraine. Finally those virtual reality training hoops...

I think jumping into City for the first time, you will most definitely be blown away by its presentation, improved combat, and steady supply of gameplay scenarios. Yet like Asylum, its flaws also don't become apparent until repeated playthroughs where you realise it's not that deep of a game after all and what it has in breadth it lacks in depth. This is a game to be consumed in minute proportions and probably not stretched over too long a time. I made the mistake of trying to aim for 100% and it almost made me never want to play it ever again. I think this speaks to ultimately what kind of game City really is.

That said, if you've never played this and you enjoyed Asylum, this is a definite buy.",1704409978,1704409978,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The GCPD interviewer reached into her pocket. Pulled out a cigarette. The goon tried to reach across the table for it - she stood, out of his reach, lighting the cigarette. Puffing smoke, pacing around the cramped interrogation room. Walking circles around the goon like a shark in the water.

""The City. Tell me about the City.""

""Right, fine, okay."" A grumbling, discontented voice. ""So the Asylum was good and all. Everyone liked it. But there was something more, there. We were hoping, but didn't expect it'd be [i]that[/i] big a hit. Now we got a budget. Now we got leg room. Time to stretch out. Time to get [i]ambitious.""[/i]

""Ambitious.""

""Yeah. See, we'd done the Asylum, but that's just one measly little island. What if we do a [i]huge[/i] chunk a' Gotham? What if we go all-out makin' this big open world ta go around?""

""Grand Theft Auto scale?""

The goon recoiled. ""No! God, no, fuck that shit. Who has time for that? And what kinda fuckin' comparison is that, anyway?""

""One that was being made at the time.""

""Those people're fuckin' stupid. They see a minimap with icons and bark like yappin' fuckin' dogs. 'Is it grand theft auto? What about GTA? It should be like GTA.' Feh. Fuckin' morons, all a' 'em."" He eyed the lit cigarette. ""Anyway. No. It's an open world packed full a' shit. Cool villains, some ya probably never heard of. Neat shit ta find.""

""Riddler trophies?""

The goon winced. ""...Look, those mostly suck.""

""But there's a reward that makes it worth it.""

""...I fuckin' wish."" A laugh. ""No, don't even bother with those. We put those in as a joke ta make the most annoyin' people on the Internet mad.""

""It worked. What about the story?""

""It's just as dumb as the first one. Comic booky, ta be sure. But ya didn't pick up a game called fuckin' Batman because ya thought it'd be War and fuckin' Peace, am I right? The characters, though. We really did a great job with those, this time. We went all out.""

""Tell me about Catwoman.""

A wince. ""You don't wanna hear about Catwoman.""

The interrogator leaned in. Pressed the cigarette to the goon's forehead. He screamed.

""OKAY! FUCK! FINE! JESUS! Catwoman's in the FUCKIN' game, are ya happy?! And she sucks! Playing as her sucks! It's bad, it's really really bad, just completely absent everything good about the rest of the game and instead it's replaced with shitty stealth sections and unsatisfying combos! JESUS! But the game's still fuckin' great, alright? It's still worth playin'. There's fuckin'... Talia Al Ghul is there! And she's HOT! And yer gonna love her, I swear.""

""We'll see,"" the interrogator said, as she returned to her seat. ""What's left?""

An actual open world this time, with the collectibles having a bit more of a reason to exist in it. There's proper side-quests now too, with B-level storylines to explore, some of which are just as engaging as the rest of the story.
That'd be my main failing point in comparison to the first one - the story is a bit less structured, kinda meandering about until the game ends in a ..finale. It's not bad by any means, just that it's worse and you can feel it if you've played the first game not too long ago.

It got me through when my dad died, it was my gateway into modding and eventually into coding from there, the first true writing I did was Chex Quest fanfiction - it has been my loyal love for a very long time. I never thought I would have another favorite game.

Batman: Arkham Asylum is now my favorite game, and Arkham City is right up there by it. It's hard to pick one or the other as my favorite - Asylum has a close place in my heart for the hours I spent [i]being[/i] Batman, because believe me you [i]are[/i] Batman - you're not just controlling him, you embody him, you become the Bat. But City is ostensibly more advanced, cleaner, bigger, and with a more expansive story. Maybe you can't compare one as better than the other - they're both amazing.

I have heard these called the definitive Batman games and now that I've played, I agree. The acting by Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, along with everyone else, is as incredible as always. You can really feel and believe the situation and Batman's stress becomes yours in a delicious way. Hearing the scream of someone in trouble, you [i]are[/i] the Bat, you go to help, you feel what it means to be Batman in both of these games.

Combat is smooth and satisfying, especially for the fact that it makes you think - there is no moment where you are simply clicking the button over and over. Your situational awareness goes to levels you didn't know you had in you and you feel like Batman even more, a one man army ""kicking all kinds of major ass"" as you might hear from a Tyger chopper's comms. And it's not easy to master either. There's a genuine feeling of accomplishment for doing well in combat, but it's not gated behind being too difficult - effort to learn feels meaningful.

As for the story itself, I couldn't have asked for more. If you are at all capable of doing so at this point, go in without spoilers. I was unfortunately aware of the outcome before playing, and it hampered some of my enjoyment - if you're tempted to look up what happens and still don't know the story/ending, I highly recommend sticking it through and feeling each moment as Batman experiences it - as [i]you[/i] experience it, Batman.

That's what this game is. You are Batman. With everything that comes with that. It's not a superhero simulator or a fighting game or a story told in a comic book. You become the Bat. That's what Batman: Arkham is.",1703882662,1703882662,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Batman is honestly just some overated sissy punk. Her bull even agrees with me. Last night we had an intervention with her. We both said our pieces, revolving around how the Arkham franchise is great but it has been taking over her whole personality. 

Of course she simply responded by saying ""Think of it as a running gag"" and then she stabbed me in the shoulder. 

I was going to improvise as batman but in the sudden heat of the moment I shot her 4 times. Me and the bull agreed I was roleplaying deadshot.

The atmosphere of the Batman comics is perfectly conveyed here, as well as one of the best incarnations of the comics characters. The characters are what make the narrative part of the game interesting. For despite the fact that the plot is intriguing from the very beginning — it is difficult to call it outstanding, and with the exception of the ending there is no drama. And the presence of Catwoman as the second main character is very nominal, cut her out of the story and nothing will change.

The combat system is quite simple and does not have a huge number of combinations. But despite this the fights here still look impressive, due to the huge number of unique kick animations, which makes it interesting to fight here until the end of the game.

One of the game's major flaws is its open world, which is a section of the city of Gotham. It doesn't feel alive and all you can do in it is to do uninventive side quests and solve Enigma riddles (When you find out the number of them, you'll immediately give up). In addition, the city itself is very poorly memorized because of the visual monotony, it has no sights and you do not get lost in it only because it is not big in itself. 

And if you compare it to the previous installment, the only thing it loses to Batman: Arkham Asylum in is exploration. Since the first part was a chamber metroidvania, its locations were fun to explore. Plot events could change their appearance, and getting new devices immediately made you want to try them out to discover new paths, and the locations themselves were much more diverse.

Otherwise, this part is better than the previous one, it has a beautiful, though simple combat system, an intriguing story, interesting bosses and characters familiar from the comics. I think everyone will find something for themselves in this game.",1703373409,1703373409,True,1,0,0.518348574638366699,0,True,False,False

It took several years for me to complete this game. I tried playing it on four separate occasions: in 2013, 2014, 2015 and in 2017, but I just didn’t find it interesting. 

Being my first Arkham game, the design felt very confusing to me and I never felt like I knew where I was supposed to go or what I was supposed to do. 

It finally clicked for me in 2023, when I gave it another chance after having played through [b]Arkham Knight[/b]. Fifth time’s the charm, I guess?

I thought I was going to struggle even more after playing one of the sequels, but it was surprisingly easy to get into it because most of the controls are identical between the games. 

The combat is not as good as in Arkham Knight. Many times I found myself attacking the air rather than enemies, something that I never had happen in Arkham Knight. But don’t get me wrong, the combat is still very satisfying and perfectly serviceable, just not as good. 

I enjoyed the story and atmosphere more in this game. I also absolutely loved the highly inappropriate dialogue between the bad guys. 

One of my favorite things was playing as Catwoman in some of the story missions, and the fact that she gets unlocked as a playable character when you complete the story. Unfortunately, in terms of post game content, she only has a very simple mission to do stealth takedowns on enemies across the city to gather loot. She doesn’t have her own set of side missions beyond that, and she can’t do Batman’s side missions, so that was a bummer to me. 

Coming from Arkham Knight, I was pleasantly surprised that there were no Batmobile segments at all in this game. I also really liked the boss fights, something that in retrospect felt absent from Arkham Knight.

Rating: ★★★★★

Batman: Arkham City stands as a testament to timeless gaming excellence, even after 12 years since its release. As a devoted fan of the Caped Crusader, I couldn't have asked for a more immersive experience.

Gameplay (5/5):
Arkham City's gameplay is nothing short of phenomenal. The fluid combat mechanics make you truly feel like the Dark Knight, effortlessly countering foes in a dance of martial prowess. The seamless integration of stealth elements and detective work adds layers of depth, making every encounter a thrilling challenge.

Soundtrack (5/5):
The hauntingly atmospheric soundtrack perfectly complements the gritty atmosphere of Gotham City. From heart-pounding battle themes to melancholic ambient tunes, the music elevates the overall experience, immersing you further into Batman's world.

Story (5/5):
The narrative is a masterpiece, weaving a complex tale that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Arkham City serves as the ultimate playground for Batman's rogues' gallery, and the plot twists and turns keep you guessing until the very end. The character development is top-notch, adding emotional weight to the overall story.

Side Activities (4.5/5):
The abundance of side activities in Arkham City is both a blessing and a curse. While some diversions feel essential to the Batman experience, a few may seem a tad overwhelming. Nevertheless, the variety of side quests, Riddler challenges, and other activities contribute to the game's overall richness.

Challenge Rooms (4/5):
The challenge rooms offer a satisfying test of skill, showcasing the depth of the combat system. While enjoyable, they might not have the same lasting appeal as the main story or side quests. Nonetheless, they provide a welcome change of pace for those seeking additional challenges.

Replay Value (5/5):
Arkham City's replay value is exceptional. With a plethora of collectables, alternative paths, and multiple endings, the game invites you to dive back into the shadows of Gotham City. New Game Plus mode adds an extra layer of challenge for those looking to prove their mettle as the World's Greatest Detective.

Graphics (3.5/5):
Given its 2011 release, Arkham City's graphics show their age. While the character models and environmental details were groundbreaking at the time, the visual fidelity is not up to par with today's standards. However, this is forgivable, considering the game's age and the outstanding quality in other aspects.

In conclusion, Batman: Arkham City remains an essential experience for any gamer, even in a landscape dominated by newer titles. Its unparalleled gameplay, gripping story, and memorable soundtrack overshadow the dated graphics, proving that true classics transcend the constraints of time. Don the cape and cowl; Arkham City is a journey every Batman fan should embark on.",1703260836,1703260836,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This edition, adorned with extra content and enhancements, solidifies its status as a must-have for both die-hard fans and newcomers alike.

The graphics of Arkham City remain impressive, even years after its initial release. The gritty atmosphere of Gotham is brought to life with meticulous attention to detail, from the towering skyscrapers to the ominous alleyways. The character designs are exceptional, capturing the essence of each iconic figure in Batman's world.

What truly sets the Game of the Year Edition apart is the wealth of additional content that accompanies the base game. From extra challenge maps to additional storylines, players are treated to an extended and enriched experience. The narrative, already engaging in the original release, is further enhanced with new subplots and characters, adding depth to an already intricate storyline.

The combat system, a standout feature of the Arkham series, continues to shine in this edition. Fluid, responsive, and empowering, players feel the impact of each punch and the satisfaction of executing perfectly timed counters. The seamless integration of gadgets and acrobatics contributes to a combat experience that remains unparalleled in superhero gaming.

One of the highlights of the Game of the Year Edition is the inclusion of all previously released downloadable content (DLC). From additional costumes to new challenge maps, this edition ensures that players have access to the complete Arkham City experience. The Harley Quinn's Revenge expansion, in particular, offers a gripping continuation of the main story, providing a fresh perspective on events in the aftermath of the main campaign.

While the game excels in many aspects, the open-world design occasionally leads to minor pacing issues. Navigating the vast city can be overwhelming, but the sheer variety of activities and missions ensures that players always have something engaging to pursue.

In conclusion, Batman: Arkham City - Game of the Year Edition stands as a testament to the enduring quality of Rocksteady's superhero masterpiece. With its captivating narrative, polished gameplay mechanics, and an abundance of additional content, this edition cements itself as the definitive way to experience the epic tale of the Dark Knight in the heart of Arkham City. Whether you're a seasoned Gothamite or a newcomer to the Arkhamverse, this edition is an essential addition to your gaming library.

The bosses in this game are nothing short of incredibly well done, the combat is as fluent as ever. The gadgets have been expanded upon and the stealth missions are always a blast.

2. The Bad: The only negative things I can say is really just personal preferences. I like diversity in maps and the universe but this one is constantly dark and pretty much a lot of the same in terms of maps and missions. The dark aesthetic gets old to look at after a while for me personally but it does perfectly fit Batman and the Gotham universe. The side content is definitely there but a lot of the side missions and locations are difficult to navigate in general and a lot of the side quests happen sporadically (which I'm not a fan of) Some side quests are good and some are repetitive. I did not bother finishing all the side quests or collecting the Riddler trophies. Some side quests are good though and can be worth while if you are willing to run into them by chance with some location hints. This game can be buggy at times.

Don't get me wrong although Riddler is my favoerite part I am glad you don't have to recollect all his riddles cause I got sick of replaying everything else, pretty much just new game with more armoured enemies, I will admit it's cool that they let me keep all gadgets and even orta skip some roadblocks in the main story, even tho I am forced to pick up gadgets I already have, the later game Knight kinda removes some of that redundancy like if you already picked up the rec gun it won't appear in the GCPD heck you can even pick it up early which is cool, unfortunately they hadn't thought of that yet and even dedicated whole side quests to just getting gadgets which thankfully also isn't done in Knight, the side quests are also a problem in general for NG+ cause they lose their charm after the first time unless you took a massive break and most of them you have to wait for and it's still you just doing the same thing as the first time Hush and Deadshot especially sucked in this regard cause they both had a lot of unskipable dialogue during crime scenes and very redundant upload percentages that for some reason require your movement to be extrmely limited(the main game also did this quite a bit) 

Zsass also didn't change for NG+ and you just hear the same story on top of having to wait for his phones(waiting for random points also happens with like every quest that is more than one part save AR and Bane and it sucks cause unlike first game you probably have no RIddler content left you just pace around an empty map with a massive wall through the middle you just can't pass through[at least not in a more convenient way]) I just really feel most of these did not deserve to return for NG+ they offer so little Bane and Mad Hatter were the only ones with propper cobat to actually make it any different so why not have it be mirrored like the riddler content especially the random acts of violence and AR cause they had no plot to them they did not need to be there. at least every quest in Knight actually has a reason to be repeated they all have at least one instance of proper combat(except Man-Bat) sure you couild say at least they learnt their lesson, but this is honestly something they should have thought of from the get go there are some parts where it feels like they ignored a fundamental.

The main game first time around was great, and had a great story as well as very interesting innovations made to the overall gameplay of Asylum one major example is the quickfire gadgets my only problem with it is the aim for the batclaw is so imnconsistent with subsequent taps it's cool to disarm the enemies but it often let's me down with the 2nd fire tho I am greatful that they even let you use the batclaw on trophies although I am glad it wasn't like that in Asylum cause it would have killed some of the puzzles.

The only major problem I have with the main game however is the way it's intersected by the Catwoman DLC cause it comes at the worst possible moments to put way too many cliffhangers in the middle of a videogame, worst of all they both start you off as her and force you to play as her after the credits before you can do anything post game, my other issue with the DLC is there is litterally no explanation as to why Riddler left her trophies and it makes no sense for him to want to test her,

I know I dug into the game alot but I can assure you I still deffinetly reccomend it(maybe don'ty play NG+ tho)",1702578252,1702635565,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Glide between rooftops as the Batman -- or switch sides, and prowl the alleyways as Catwoman -- in this instant classic!

While stealth approaches are still always an option, you're now free to really kick some ass in a crowd -- and rioting is frequent.  Your arsenal of combos is more numerous, and you have a variety of special takedown options at your disposal. 

This GOTY Edition contains all the DLC from the game's history -- AND gives players the option to unlock their skins from the start, without the need for a cheat code.
The highlight of these is clearly the DARK KNIGHT RETURNS.

There were massive improvements here ahead of the last game where now you are in a much bigger location and many more villains appear as well as having more unique fights with them such as with Mr Freeze and so on. many which make you think hard about tackling the boss.

the ending was one hell of a surprise, but it suited the series down to a T as well. the combat has also been improved and the story is very interesting. I do miss Scarecrow though and how he'd poison you subtly giving you all those messed up visions in the first game, but still. Game is a hell of a lot of fun.

Edit: One of my favourite moments was learning about Victor Zsasz's past where he phones Batman from the various payphones to talk about his own past and how he became who he was. Many of the stories are  really interesting of the many different criminals, including some who had not appeared in the first game and expanding upon Batman's Rogue Gallery. I won't give too much away for spoilers and surprise bosses, but you also have Deadshot to contend with and Mr Freeze adjusts to each takedown you attempt on him so no duplicate takedowns. Many of the bosses require you to be creative and think I little more when taking down a boss.",1437010164,1701959638,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

Good big map, open world with a interesting story mode which continuously peaks interest throughout the game keeping you enjoying and coming back. . Even though I still prefer Arkham Asylum over Arkham City's story mode as my personal preference, nevertheless City does not disappoint one bit! 

 Next for me is Arkham Knight! I remember buying Arkham Knight when it first released but due to all the glitches and problems it had at that time i never got a chance to finish it although still from what i remember it had a strong enjoyable gameplay factor. Looking forward to playing it next, glad to know all the glitches and issues have been resolved now. Once completing AK will drop a review for that game then finish of the Arkham Sage with Batman Origins. To anyone wondering if these Arkham games are still worth it in late 2023 early 2024. Absolutely! Must play for all gamers in my opinion. Who doesnt love a Superhero smashing bad guys and making the world A-Ok! Thumbs up!

The Arkham series pioneered the superhero video game genre with its revolutionary free-flow combat system, and Arkham City builds upon this success. While opinions may differ on whether Arkham Knight's combat surpasses that of Arkham City, there's no denying the visceral impact of each punch in the latter. The combat system retains its fluidity and technical finesse, with the removal of the throw combo compensated by the addition of two new combo moves: disarm, which aptly disarms and dismantles the enemy's weapon, and a multi-takedown combo, enriching the player's options when faced with a diverse range of adversaries.

In addition to its stellar gameplay, Arkham City excels in storytelling. The narrative takes a significant leap forward from its predecessor, introducing numerous side quests featuring iconic villains and characters from the DC Comics universe. The inclusion of challenging Riddler trophies, numbering a whopping 440, adds depth to the game. While only 400 are required to confront the enigmatic Edward Nigma, the additional 40, entrusted to Selina Kyle, provide a refreshing change of perspective in both missions and free roam segments. The main story is a compelling test for the Dark Knight, weaving a narrative that captivates players and deepens their connection to Gotham's vigilant protector.",1692207371,1700855386,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's how I got confused thinking Tara ""I'm islamophobic but everyone hates me for something completely unrelated actually"" Strong always voiced Harley Quinn cause I didn't know the late great Arleen Sorkin existed for a time. It's what introduced me further into the lore of Batman and when I started fully appreciating him as a superhero, especially with his no-kiII rule. It's the game that took everything about the first game and expanded & improved on it a hundred fold.

Most of all, it took the story of Mr. Freeze being a sympathetic villain from the 90s Animated Series and made it so much better(WB Montreal did great with his origin story in Origins, too, and Rocksteady gave him a bittersweet yet perfect end to his story in Knight, mind you).

-the time you get to play as catwoman is incredibly short, you cna only choose t play as her after you finish the main story. considering how little she has to do it suprises me that she has unlockable upgrades at all. you're incredibly likely to use all your upgrade points for Batman sop catwoman having a ""skill tree"" at all seems incredibly pointless
-therea re 400 riddler trophies for every 80 you collect unlocks a missaion where you save a hostage form a riddler themed saw trap. with how much it takes to unlock each hostage it barely feels rewarding to save a hostage especially when the fist 80 trphies unlock a hostage that requires 0 effort to save.but the worst thing about this is that Riddler tells you where the hostages are there' no option as far as I know to find them yourself which would be much cooler as it'd prove you're smarter than Riddler. why is Hush's mission full detective work while the Riddler's traps require's no effort?
-the shield enemies suck. they already had the perfect formula for sheild guys with the stun rod guys, nut NO you have to use a very specific attack with a long animation to damage a shield user instead of simply attacking form behind like you do with stun rod guys
-blades having their own dodge system is dumb

Riddler's hidden question marks are back. If you see one, find some place to see the whole thing and tap the Detective Mode button.

When the game is over, you'll get to go back and get anything you missed.

There are easter eggs everywhere and some of them have achievements for finding them.

The only immediately useful upgrade you can get is the one that slightly slows time when your freeflow combo hits x12, everything else you can get when you feel it's necessary.

When your first set of Augmented Reality glide challenges becomes available, do them for a very useful grappling hook upgrade.

The ""Catch"" achievement involves a character who you can find on top of the ferris wheel by the steel mill after a certain point in the game. Throw a remote batarang at him. This is also the start of a side-mission.

There's no time limit on finding new leads for side-missions.

There is no achievement/trophy for completing the game on the hardest mode this time around.
Just like in Asylum you'll need to revisit portions of the game for Riddler Trophies as you'll have to unlock gadgets in order to get them. This includes trophies frozen in ice.

You wont be able to solve the question mark alignment riddles until you progress a little into the game.
Your explosive foam can be used on the question marks switches and you can trigger them manually in first person view.

If a Batarang isn't working on a switch this means you'll need to run a current through it by remotely running it into some electricity - fly your Batarang into a conduit and then run it into the switch. A good example of this is a switch next to Calendar Man's cell.

There's a few pressure plate Riddler wall switches that require you to glide into them. Many of these will have you kick off the wall to glide to another switch without touching the ground. If you're having trouble you can Bat Spring yourself up a building and then adjust yourself without having to do a kick off (the controls for it can be unresponsive at times).

Complete the first set of flying challenges for a gadget. The second set is a royal bitch that requires pixel perfect gliding. Only bother if you want the achievement/trophy.

Level up your combat abilities first as this will give you access to easier x5 finishers opposed to x8, timed combos so you can have a higher multiplier, and the x15 combat flow ability.

Catwoman's chapters are mostly towards the end of the game opposed to being scattered throughout. It's not urgent to level her.

If you're having trouble with The Stranger side mission you will be able to see the masked man after completing various plot points. Make it habit to turn on detective mode the moment you're outside after a cutscene and scan the top of buildings.

Riddler will eventually send out green goons mixed into gang groups throughout the game. An easy way to deal with them is by a triple stun or with the late game freeze weapons. By the end of the game if you managed to take them out properly they will reveal all of Riddler's Challenge locations on the map. Not bad if you don't want to bother with a guide!

The 50 combo and 5 gadget achievement can be easily done in the challenge modes.

There's an annoying Riddle in Joker's Steel Mill (the Assembly Line room). The solution to will not appear until the final act of the game even if you managed to beat its location out of someone. If you're curious, the Riddle is ""Once assembled, do these two become one again?""

The last two upgrades that get you Riddler trophies are an item that can make platforms in water and the master encryption key for your hacking tool. After that, you shouldn't need any more items to pick up trophies. Use some creative thinking!

When you get the item that can make platforms, spend a while exploring and getting as many trophies as you can. Some Catwoman trophies require you to have opened areas as Batman.

You can break flimsy walls by gliding into them; you don't need any specific items to do that.

You can zoom in to selectively detonate explosive gel; don't be like me and assume selective detonations come later.

You can't put gel on overhead walls; it's either something you'll come to later from the other side or there's a path around it.

If you can't find a riddle marked on your map no matter what you do, it's probably a place to view a question mark.

If you can't find electricity to fly a remote batarang through to hit a fusebox, you might need to wait until you get an item that can shoot electricity directly at it.

The quick-fire grapple -> punch followup is very useful and abusable - it's easily interruptable to counter and can shoot you across rooms. Without the followup it puts the mook into a pretty long stumble animation, too. And it can disarm!

The triple cloak stun is the easiest way to get riddler mooks out of the way while you defeat the rest of the crowd. Be careful, though - it sucks to accidentally take them down when there are only two enemies left.


Batman: Arkham City isn't perfect, but listing the little things I didn't like gets in the way of all the stuff I adored. The voice acting, the challenges, the amazing opening, the unbelievable ending and the feeling of being the Dark Knight -- these are the things that standout looking back. I've beaten this thing twice and still want to call in sick and chase Riddler Trophies.

Suddenly, penguin laughs at you and calls you an idiot and then you punch him in the richard. I really loved the part when I saw the Face beheading that guy or like dipping him in the mcdonalds fryer or whatever at the building and it took me like 8 f𝐮cking hours to find the bullet hole the game was telling me to look for. It really made me FEEL like i was gonna return the game to blockbuster at any minute. 

Then f𝐮cking dumbass catwoman shows up and i have to play her f𝐮ckass catwoman game and then i get to play Bruce Man again. After that you go into jokers 60 billion dollar mansion (which was the standard at the time) and punch him in the d𝐢ck again. Except, its just another one of jokers jokes that he does, and like the absolute moron he is, he gives you blood herpes, which is a really deadly disease that gives your blood cells deadly herpes. 

Now Brucie only has about 14 seconds left to live so he goes to look for Mistor Freeze, and mistor freeze tells matman to go f𝐮ck himself. So Bruce Man goes to look for pengius and blows up his mansion and punches him in the d𝐢ck and then he goes to an underground secret society of lizard gamer people and steals their liquid heroin to get big and strong. 

It turns out mistor freeze is actually just an actual idiot and he gives you the cure for blood herpes and then you have to do another f𝐮cking Woman section or something. and then you shoot the jerker in the head with a pistol but it was actually always just the fake joker, so the real joker punches you in the d𝐢ck to get his revenge. and then the jerkers d𝐢ck EXPLODES. Amazing game. I'll be telling my grandchildren about it.

Arkham City's open world is a crime-fighting playground, replete with iconic locations and passphrases that pay homage to Batman's history.

The combat system is smooth and intuitive, making you feel like a martial arts master as you fight groups of thugs with various gadgets and abilities. The stealth elements are equally well done, allowing you to outsmart and destroy your enemy from the shadows, just like Batman should.

But what really sets Arkham City apart is its compelling storyline. The narrative is dark, mature, and masterfully written that takes your breath away. The voice acting, especially with Mark Hamill playing the role of the Joker, is superb. The pace of the game keeps you in suspense, and the side missions add depth to the overall experience.

The game also features a rich selection of unlockable items, quests, and secrets that will keep you engrossed in the game long after the main story is over.

The Arkham games have always been my favorite, the combat, the gadgets, the story, even the designs of the maps. The Riddler trophies and even the riddles are honestly my favorite because they add a lot of exploration to the game, stumbling across a riddle and looking for the answer or a destructible wall and blowing it up to find the green question marks are fun, even if they don't add anything materialistically aside from achievements and a challenge to find them all. The side quests in this game specifically don't disappoint either, you can finish the main story line as quick or slow as you want and still have hours upon hours of gameplay along with other (DLC) side stories, including Harley Quinns mourning story line and Tim Drake's. It's a very good and well made game especially for releasing in 2012, and the graphics remain great!

The inclusion of playing as Catwoman also adds a nice change and an interesting play for the story, the different mechanics especially. Love climbing on ceilings. Overall, it's an amazing game with a really well thought out story and well made large map. You have hours of playtime and unless you get bored of beating up bad guys, you wont be bored of this game any time soon. 100/10 (Maybe a little biased because of my love for most things Batman, but it is genuinely a good game.)",1699053850,1699053850,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Arkham City's open world is a crime-fighting playground, replete with iconic locations and passphrases that pay homage to Batman's history.

The combat system is smooth and intuitive, making you feel like a martial arts master as you fight groups of thugs with various gadgets and abilities. The stealth elements are equally well done, allowing you to outsmart and destroy your enemy from the shadows, just like Batman should.

But what really sets Arkham City apart is its compelling storyline. The narrative is dark, mature, and masterfully written that takes your breath away. The voice acting, especially with Mark Hamill playing the role of the Joker, is superb. The pace of the game keeps you in suspense, and the side missions add depth to the overall experience.

The game also features a rich selection of unlockable items, quests, and secrets that will keep you engrossed in the game long after the main story is over.

definitely an improvement from asylum, this one had a lot more to the story and was shrouded with the mystery of ""protocol 10"" being slowly revealed to the player, i like this mysterious atmosphere as it kept me wanting to play the game and find out more. the combat is very fun with a good challenge and the map is good and traversing it is easy, side missions and encounters are good too and add a little more depth to whats going on around the prison city. the negatives are that the final bossfight in the main story against clayface was too easy like i was almost expecting there to be another part to it because i got through it incredibly easily, the joker bossfight should have been somewhere at the end as that one was challenging for me, i loved the ending, as although youre supposed to hate him i felt sad for the jokers outcome and the silence in batman at the end really showed his guilt and that his conciseness is high although appearing dark,  fearless and hostile.

overall definately reccomend this being played if you like batman, really good game for me and i look forward to playing arkham knight!",1698361678,1698361678,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics: ★★★★★
The graphics in Batman: Arkham City are outstanding. The game brings the dark and gritty atmosphere of Gotham City to life with detailed environments and stunning character designs.

Gameplay: ★★★★☆
The gameplay in Arkham City is smooth and intuitive. The combat system is incredibly satisfying, with fluid and acrobatic moves that make players feel like the Dark Knight himself. However, some repetitive mission structures and occasional frustrations with the stealth mechanics prevent it from receiving a perfect score.

Story: ★★★★★
The story in Arkham City is engaging and keeps players hooked from start to finish. It's filled with intriguing twists and turns, as Batman navigates through a city filled with iconic villains. The writing is top-notch, offering a deep and immersive narrative that complements the gameplay perfectly.

Characterization: ★★★★☆
The game features a strong cast of characters, both heroes and villains alike. Batman is as brooding and determined as ever, while the villains are portrayed with depth and complexity. The voice acting is excellent, further enhancing the personalities and motivations of the characters.

Replayability: ★★★★☆
Arkham City offers plenty of replay value, with numerous side missions, collectibles, and challenges to keep players entertained even after completing the main story. The open-world environment allows for exploration, and different playstyles can be employed to tackle missions, adding to the game's replayability factor.

Overall Rating: ★★★★☆
Batman: Arkham City is a superb game that successfully captures the essence of being the Dark Knight. With stunning graphics, immersive storytelling, and solid gameplay mechanics, it is a must-play for fans of the superhero genre.

Graphics: 7.5/10
While the graphical quality of the game was likely good in its time, it is now outclassed by newer AAA games. The people look fine, and so does the environment. But, just like Skyrim, if you look close enough at the finer points, you probably come to the realization that, ""This game was made in 2011..."". Despite that, it still has good graphics. I use a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti and the game looks good.

Music and Audio: 6/10
The music is fine, I suppose. i'm not much of a game music critic, but I am a music snob, and it's fine. As for the audio effects, it makes a really realistic ""pow"" sound when you knock out a dude, which is funny but not accurate to life. Everything else is fine.

Difficulty: 7/10
Arkham City has a comfortable learning curve, but I remember toward the end there was this one predator (stealth) level where you had these 6 dudes with guns and tons of stuff to help them capture you. I had to redo that one several times. Other than that, the only other thing that is noteworthy here is just other stealth stuff, which is easy enough if you don't get caught, but it has justified consequences if you do get caught. Then there's the tedious AR challenges, and, of course, the Riddle puzzles which are way too common and the  open world is riddled with them. (pun intended). Other than that, nothing is very tough about Arkham City.

Story: 8.5/10
Being a critic of literature, comic book reader, and ""trying to be an author"", I actually thought that AC had a good story. It was set up good, had an excellent twist, and delivered the climax wonderfully. But, there really was one thing missing; a choice point. What I mean by that is that, correct me in the comments if I'm wrong, but Batman never really had a big choice that significantly affected the story. One may argue that the alternate ending included as an option with the Catwoman expansion was such a choice point, but you would do well to remember that Catwoman is not the main character. Other than that, I liked the story.

Gameplay: 9/10
The combat is simple, fun, and of an ideal difficulty. The stealth is exciting and sometimes difficult. The exploration and adventure portions are interesting. The only two things I really have against this part is that (1) i'ts almost always the same and never introduces anything new, and there isn't enough elements to make any part of it uncommon, if you catch my drift. And (2) it's not especially difficult. After beating Dark Souls 2, I found that I like difficult games better than games of ideal difficulty. Once you figure out the strategies you need to do to win, you win every time. Enemies hardly change their tactics (though the legendary Mr. Freeze boss fight was a renowned exception. ""Residents of Arkham City, you should be more like Freeze!"").

World: 8/10
The world in City, which boasts various different zones with different thugs and interesting graphical changes and differences in mood, is good but quite small. Yes, there is an underground portion, but it really doesn't have all that much to do. But the main thing that folks love City for is that Rocksteady packed City full of stuff. It's never empty, and you always have something to do (that is, before you finish the story, side missions, physical challenges, and the infamous Riddler trophies).

Comparison to Arkham Knight
This game is fantastic, don't get me wrong, but Knight does lots of things better. The graphics are superior, there's a more varied and interesting combat system, and the world is ""well over 5 times bigger"". But, my main (probably more like ""sole"") reason I don't like Knight as much is because of the Batmobile. When I first got the game, I would just drive around in the car and wreck dudes, also in cars. And I thought to myself, ""This is the best game of all time."" Then, however, as I advanced in the game, I found that Rocksteady used the car way too much. I understand that the addition of a practical tank that you can drive is a compelling addition. And it was well executed, save for it's over-usage. There is a supple amount of vehicle-based combat in the game, which I dislike to a degree. And then there's the kind of dumb stuff that it makes you do with the car, like siphon power to other stuff. As for the story, I actually haven't finished Knight's, it seems interesting so far. I think the flaw there is the delivery of the story. In Knight, the stakes are much higher, but i don't feel as involved as I was in City. Challenge maps in Knight, however, surpass City in every way. I love the Endless Knight predator map, where you are timed, and the further you get into it, the harder it gets. Oh, and it's endless, just like in the name.

Overall, City is a wonderful game with a good fan base and hours of fun. It had everything a game needs to be successful. If you want to play one in the series, i'd recommend starting with this one. If you don't like Batman, try to look past the Batman part of it and focus on... everything else. If you enjoyed Monolith's Middle Earth duo-logy, definitely play.",1697841598,1697841598,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Batman: Arkham City, in its Game of the Year (GOTY) edition, is a masterclass in action-adventure gaming. With 11 hours of gameplay, I can confidently say that this title is a must-play for any fan of the Caped Crusader, and it delivers a superlative gaming experience.

Set within a sprawling, walled-off section of Gotham City that has been converted into an open-air super-prison, Arkham City places you in the role of the iconic Batman. The story is a rollercoaster of suspense and intrigue, as you navigate the chaos orchestrated by some of Batman's most notorious foes, including the enigmatic Hugo Strange and the diabolical Joker.

The world of Arkham City is a dark, atmospheric, and intricately designed playground for Batman's gadgets and combat skills. From towering skyscrapers to grimy alleyways, the city feels like an authentic part of the Batman universe. The level of detail in every corner of Arkham City is astounding, providing ample opportunities for exploration and hidden secrets.

Gameplay in Arkham City is a thrilling blend of fluid combat, stealth, and detective work. The combat system is a highlight, allowing Batman to take on multiple foes with finesse. The Freeflow combat mechanic makes you feel like an unstoppable force, delivering punches, kicks, and counters with satisfying precision. The stealth sections, often involving encounters with armed thugs, offer a rewarding mix of strategy and tactical takedowns.

The detective work is another captivating aspect of the game. Batman's detective mode allows you to analyze crime scenes, solve puzzles, and track down villains with a detective's intuition. This mechanic adds depth to the gameplay and offers a strong connection to the Dark Knight's crime-solving abilities.

The voice acting, led by the legendary Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as the Joker, is top-notch and adds a layer of authenticity to the characters. The writing and character development in Arkham City are superb, making every interaction, every villain, and every twist in the story utterly engaging.

The Game of the Year edition comes with all the additional content, including extra challenge maps and the ""Harley Quinn's Revenge"" story expansion, further enhancing the game's replay value. With 11 hours of gameplay, you've only scratched the surface of what Arkham City has to offer.

In conclusion, Batman: Arkham City in its Game of the Year edition is a tour de force in the world of superhero gaming. With its impeccable storytelling, exhilarating gameplay, and a world that feels pulled right from the comics, it's a definitive Batman experience. Whether you're a die-hard fan of the Dark Knight or simply enjoy exceptional action-adventure games, Batman: Arkham City GOTY is an absolute must-play and stands as a high watermark for superhero games.",1697695543,1697695543,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall as a Open World game fan, this game is awesome. Lots of exploration to be done as the Dark Knight, which means it comes with tonnes of gadgets at your disposal. Gameplay is quite straightforward as a third person view game, and story is superb.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
As mentioned, the gameplay is an Open World game with lots of action and stealth as the player takes the mantle of the Dark Knight. This also includes multiple in-air, rooftop and street level traversal. Apart from that, players can use different characters with different skillsets. Other than that, there is a skill leveling segment which requires players to level up, making some level of grinding available.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The graphics is relatively good and details. Apart from being quite light and optimized.

[h1]Audio[/h1]
The music and theme are relatively good, especially if you are using THX Spatial audio, either via Speakers or Headphones. Music and voice acting is quite good. One complaint is the lip sync being a bit rigid.

[h1]Controls[/h1]
Controls are basically like any third-person perspective game with multiple options for various gadgets/skills. Each character has unique abilities tied. The Keyboard+Mouse feels rather natural overall.

[h1]Bugs & Issues[/h1]
Not much game-breaking bugs so far, multiple issues found.

[h1]Bugs[/h1]
1. Stuck at random within the world, e.g.: Whilst jumping
2. Some cases sequences does not trigger, reloading game fixes this issue

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Overall a great game, too many things to do and does feel bloated at times, especially the Riddler challenges. Sucks that there is no blood and violence since Batman does not kill.",1697383229,1697383229,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It improves on virtually every aspect of its already fantastic predecessor, combat, detective work and riddles. It gives you an open world in which you can glide around to your hearts content, solving side cases, each of which are incredible little crime stories of their own, and a main Batman story that is much darker and more gritty than anything we have previously experienced and honestly really well written, one of the best Batman stories there are to be honest, with actual consequences and characters dying, pushing the Detective to his mental and physical limits. The characters are also quite honestly the best version of themselves here, Catwoman, Mr.Freeze, Hugo Strange, Zasz, the Joker, they all feel so grounded somehow while still being fantastical in an almost mythic way, and for me at least, the Arkham games are my favorite version of Batman and his world, violent, gritty and noir, authentically Batman. Arkham City achieves all this without sacrificing any of the atmosphere or vibe that made Asylum so great, so yes, Arkham City is the perfect sequel, and in my and many others opinion deserves a spot on the Greatest Games of All Time List.

On the whole, [i]Arkham City[/i] is a game worthy of your time. It expands upon the gameplay of its predecessor, [i]Arkham Asylum[/i], but unfortunately, it's open world bloated and padded out with a lot of boring side content that feels tedious and adds nothing of real substance. 

[h1]Arkham City - The Open World[/h1]

They say bigger is always better, and in that vein, Rocksteady took the core gameplay of [i]Arkham Asylum[/i] and put it into an open world: Arkham City. [i]Asylum[/i] followed a metroidvania approach to design - an open, albeit focused map that extended its exploration by forcing players to obtain upgrades and continuously backtrack to open up new areas. In [i]Arkham City[/i], the whole of the map is immediately open, allowing players to explore as much or as little as they'd like. The problem with this approach in [i]Arkham City[/i], however, is that there is nothing worth exploring. There is not purpose to the sandbox approach,

There are side quests: Riddler challenges, Zsasz's phone calls, a mysterious guy that leaves glyphs, Bane's titan containers, saving political prisoners, tracking down Deadshot, I think I saw something about the Calendar man? None of these are interesting though. 
- Riddler challengers are just collectibles in various forms, and there are [i]a lot[/i]. There are too many. Now when you complete enough challenges you get to save a hostage. The puzzles here are actually unique and interesting. You just have to collect so many to get to each one...
- Zsasz calls, political prisoners, finding Deadshot, and finding the mysterious man are essentially random world events. None of them are interesting. I never completed any of these.
- I didn't even know the Calendar Man had anything.

With any of these, there just is not enough incentive to make me roam around the map hoping to stumble on them. Zsaaz calls are especially egregious, because the phones are usually surrounded by a group of thugs and by the time you beat them all down, you miss the call.  

[h1]The Story[/h1]

The story starts out incredibly weak. Arkham City is just a thing that you have to accept. Somehow, in the span of a few months after the events of [i]Arkham Asylum[/i], the warden, Quincy Sharp, who allowed the Joker to take over his asylum, gets elected mayor, and is manipulated into turning part of Gotham City into a prison. Bruce Wayne doesn't like this idea and gets kidnapped over it, and that's how Batman gets in. The problem here is Batman really has no motivation to do anything other than just leave. Instead, he chooses to stay to single-handedly stop yet another prison riot. But to call it a riot is somewhat misleading, because letting criminals loose to kill each other was kind of the whole point of Arkham City. 

But I digress. The story does eventually get much better, with several twists that keep you on your toes. The use of Ra's al Ghul and Mr. Freeze were fantastic. The cherry on top, of course, was further pushing Batman's relationship with Joker, which culminates perfectly.

[h1]Catwoman...[/h1]

Catwoman felt very shoehorned in. She plays a role at the very start and the very end of the game. Since she plays completely different from Batman in both combat and movement, she's hard to get used to. Some of her Riddler trophies also required Batman to obtain (e.g. the trophy is blocked by a destructible wall which Catwoman cannot break), which felt really cheap. It feels like Catwoman was supposed to play a bigger role, but due to time and/or scope creep, she got relegated to a few awkward side sections. She would have been better off as just being DLC.

[h1]Difficulty spikes[/h1]

Based on achievement stats, there is a notable drop off as players moved through the story. The reason being, I think, is that the game just gets relentlessly hard. About 60% of the way through the game, everyone has guns. There is sweet little Batman can do against guns. You can disable 2 at a time, but when 8 guns are in play, you still have to deal with 6 guys shooting you. The game requires you to be both exceptionally clever and patient, as it takes away any advantages you may have over guns (e.g. destroying vantage points and heat goggles that disable your stealth), and once in combat, Batman can only take away one gun at a time. If you grapple the gun away, someone else can just pick it up. Even when you get the upgrade to destroy guns, you can only do one at a time. I sympathize with everyone who dropped off, because this wasn't really a satisfying way to up the difficulty. And that speaks nothing of fights where you'll have guys with guns, stun sticks, shields, knives, and the unarmed ones constantly throwing objects at you. It's hard. It's frustrating. It's just not really fun. 

[h1]So What's Good?[/h1]

The core gameplay carried over from [i]Arkham Asylum[/i] is still solid. At times, the enemy count can get overwhelming, and the streamlined nature of the combat can make Batman do things you didn't really intend (e.g. leaping across the room to hit a stray enemy or grappling the guy next to the guy with the gun).  

There is still a good mix of exploration, puzzle solving and combat that helps mix up the gameplay. 

Like its predecessor, [i]Arkham City[/i] pits Batman against an impressive roster of classic villains. Each boss fight is unique, requiring the player to do more than mash the attack button to beat them down. The fight with Mr. Freeze in particular was my favorite. Any time you damage Freeze, he becomes immune to that attack. This forces the player to change strategies on the fly, all while hiding from Freeze, whose attacks will obliterate you, and whose armor is nigh impenetrable. 

[h1]Overall[/h1]

I know I highlighted a lot of negatives, but I still enjoyed the game. The core gameplay, for the most part, is enough to carry it. It feels like Rocksteady was attempting to take 3 steps forward from [i]Arkham Asylum[/i] and in doing so maybe overexerted themselves. The main story works. The setting, the writing, the villains, it all works. What doesn't work is the excessive bloat. Did there need to be over 300 Riddler challenges? Did Catwoman need to be part of the main campaign? Was any of the side content really worthwhile? Does the sandbox design serve the gameplay in any way? 

In my opinion, the answer to all of these is no. I would have preferred a much more focused gameplay experience, more akin to [i]Arkham Asylum[/i], rather than having content for the sake of content. I think I 100% completed [i]Asylum[/i] in about 10 hours. [i]City[/i] took me about 25, and I didn't 100% it. For me, that extra 15 hours did nothing other than make my experience worse.

This game blew my mind the first time I played it.

I thought Arkham Asylum was amazing but this game was perfect. It had that perfect balance between Story and Gameplay. And the difficulty was actually fair, pick easy you can play through the game with no worries. Pick hard and you are in for the most amazing Super hero experience ever (in video game form)

Pros and Cons time

=Pros=
-Voice Acting is fantastic (Mark Hamill kills it as the joker)
-The story is fantasicly told and works so well as a sequel
-The characters/ character design's very well done
-Batman is a fucking bad ass through this entire game
-Lots of content and side missions to keep you busy
-Lots of downloadable content and cool costumes that reference the Comic Books
-Tons of Easter Eggs that will keep you entertained for hours on end
-The ending is so good and even though it shouldn't, brought a tear to my eye

=Cons=
-Animations get kinda choppy at times
-Not the best optimized game but it isn't terrible

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even if the game is old (2011), it still holds up pretty well in comparison to many more recent games.

Graphics have a bit that cartoonish look that ages well. Gameplay and fight while easy is still relevant and enjoyable. The maps is quite small but there are plenty to do and it's not filled with redundant objectives. However if you're a collector and want to gather all the collectibles, you're in for a long time.

It's enjoyable to switch from Batman to Catwoman and to Robin if you have the Harley Quinn DLC (quite enjoyable as well but much shorter and linear).

When it's on sales you can get this or the full package (Asylum, City, Knight & Origins with DLC) for such a cheap price that it's a steal.

Arkham City is clearly a step up mechanically from Arkham Asylum. The combat is better and the flight system kicks booty. The music is also way better, although that's a minor detail. I think there is one too many type of enemy, and I would choose to get rid of the blade guys, mostly because the counter is stupidly complex to do on PC. I also wish that more of the gadgets took out enemies in one hit. It doesn't make sense for me that a shock charge that's strong enough to magnetize a massive hook doesn't also knock someone out or kill them. I know it's a Batman game, but still...

I also tend to get randomly spotted a lot in this game, and it's unclear why. The bad guys in Asylum were idiots, and maybe they wanted to challenge the player a bit more. But sometimes, I'll be in the middle of a silent take down and some other guy from across the map will randomly turn around and spot me. It happens often enough to put it in this review.

I also don't like the snipers mechanic. They're super overpowered, and the game doesn't always tell you they're there until you're dead. Placing them around the city makes sense from the story perspective, but it's annoying mechanically to come around a corner and get brained by a sniper who you couldn't see beforehand. Not sure what I would do to fix that. But it's annoying.

I also don't find Strange a compelling villain, and his secret partnership is so stupidly half-baked that it doesn't make any sense. In fact, of all the flaws with this game, that is my biggest one: the villain(s) in the main plot-- other than Joker-- suck. There's no big boss battle. You just go up, take out Strange's henchmen, then a cutscene takes out Strange and any other villains that may be lurking around. I really hated that. Like, it's so weak in my opinion that I knocked off a whole 1.5 stars for it.

But those are all the things I dislike.
I like the way Riddler's puzzles are done (although, there are DEFINITELY too many of them). I like most of the side quests (except Zsasz, which is a cool side quest, but in order to do it, you have to stop everything you're doing and find a phone). I like the Catwoman stuff, and I think it's cool to get a second main character to use while fighting. I enjoyed playing as her more than I expected.

I LOVE that you can just end the campaign by walking out of Strange's vault with the gold. That is the kind of thing that elevates Rocksteady's Arkham games above other superhero games. The aesthetic is amazing, just like Asylum. There's a palpable sense of doom overshadowing everything, and it feels so much like a Batman story in that regard. They didn't overstuff the plot with villains, etc. I can always find complaints in a game, but there are so many things this game does right.

1- The thing that Batman uses to hack became the least interesting gadget to use. In the previous game it felt like a dumb little mini game but it had some level of challenge. This time I hacked everything without having to put any effort into it.
2- While most Of the riddler's riddles were interesting, some felt really underwhelming and almost kinda pointless, especially the catwoman trophies.

If you are familiar with the first game in the series, this is the basically the same thing, but on doping agents. Take the already established and proven action-brawler, refine the controls, make the use of the gadgets more intuitive, expand the storyline of each character, and make the whole experience open world. A recipe for success, if you ask me. Combat feels much more fluid and varied than before. The dark and well-thought-out story delivers the same quality of before while taking radical, irreversible steps too.

[u]Recommended if:[/u] You like a dark detective story, an interesting take on well-known comic characters, and if you want to meet your favourite comic characters animated and voiced with a great attention to detail.
[u]Not recommended if:[/u] You are an achievement hunter, as most of the challenges feel not only hard, but also a bit tedious and repetitive.",1694359648,1694359648,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its story is abysmal. Its characters are uncompelling. It is needlessly padded out with tons of filler. It’s dragged down by a host of issues. The game does not deserve “Overwhelmingly positive” reviews. I can only imagine it received such widespread adulation because it is a Batman game and it certainly is a Batman game, but is it good? No. Is it terrible? No. It’s middling at best.

The combat is unsatisfying. It can be fun here and there, but there just isn’t any depth. It doesn’t feel earned. I didn’t come away from it feeling like Batman. I felt like I was just playing a very violent rhythm game. On top of that, it’s weird in practice, too. Sometimes Batman will leap across two screens to attack a bad guy, then he’ll fumble an attack on a bad guy right next to him. There’s no rhyme or logic to it. And you’ll be pissed off when it happens because you then lose your combo for no good reason.

The game is utterly filled with content, but that doesn’t mean it is good content. It is Filler City. It is seriously padded out with a lot of meaningless content that is either trifling at best or just atrocious at worst. It suffers all the pitfalls of a Ubisoft-style open-world and is no more compelling for it. The side activities are shoddily implemented and feel tacked on as a way to expose the player to more of Batman’s rogues gallery. Unfortunately, it just doesn’t work for creating a fun or interesting experience. Why would I care to see more of these characters when the experience is the same for every one of them? They aren’t interesting to see. They are window dressing. I feel like 75-85% of the game could have easily been cut. And the resources dedicated to more meaningful, interesting content. 


The story is just abysmal. Batman himself is completely uninteresting here and the central dilemma plaguing him and the world at large is equally uncompelling. He has zero personality beyond delivering gruff lines to everyone around him while all the characters you interact with are homicidal maniacs that would be better off dead. The villains are particularly heinous here and it beggars belief that Batman lets them live after the crap they pull off repeatedly in the game. Even the villains that aren’t wholly evil act idiotic here, too, and it drags the story down even further.

There are two massive drivers of events in the game and one is completely shrouded in mystery til the very end, so you have zero reason to care about it. And the other is much more immediate, but due to the flat performances and needlessly tacked on filler, it doesn’t feel urgent at all. It is barely a blip in your mind. And you feel there are no stakes whatsoever to what you are doing.

I know Batman is a gruff character with a somber demeanor, but he’s more than that. We have seen him across a large variety of media. And he can be so much more. And be more dynamic and interesting. He’s complex with a lot of issues that extend well beyond the surface. And we just don’t see any of that here. It’s just the most surface-level interpretation of Batman being Batman and that’s that. 

I came away from this game feeling like I may have enjoyed parts of it, but it was ultimately just a tedious experience and after playing other games, my opinion has been revised downwards. It just isn’t a good game. It wasn’t even a good game for its time. I’ve played a ton of games from its time period recently and it doesn’t measure up to any of them. I know my opinion is in the minority, but hey, it is what it is.

No it really isn't; the main difference is not in the more obvious points such as graphics fidelity or controls prompt, it's in the rhythm of combat. Yes it's simpler, there is no medic or electrified suits here, but you'll find the rhythm of attacks and counters to be more satisfying. Unlike in arkham knight where you are forced to use one very specific quickfire gadgets to counter certain type of attack (batarang for charging thug, batclaw for electrified goon etc) you are free to tackle the combat with fists only ...if you're up to it. Difficulty of challenge maps lies in the number of thugs and their attack speed (not to be underestimated on Hard modifier), not on cheap tricks like spawning 8 shield thugs at once like AK. 
Predator encounters also have different vibes, excluding the apparent absence of Fear Takedown; it is smaller and denser, and though the thugs still jog in conveniently slow speed, they move faster compared to thugs in AK (which the more compact map size also contributes to). It's easier to be seen and shot, and those henchmen really don't miss. Admittedly, the predator maps' design could feel pretty artificial at times (like having gargoyles and gargoyle-like objects where they clearly don't belong, or odd stretch of floor grates on unlikely places) but they do provide unique environmental takedowns that you rarely see on AK. (window takedown, vent takedown, overhanging choke etc)

As for the open world, it is small and offers very little after you're done with campaign (practically devoid of thugs to the point where you can memorize everybody's location) but it does have solid, gloomy dead-city vibe which stimulates the imagination; how it might have looked like before Arkham City, how did the prisoners live here amidst the gang war and so on. 

Ultimately, this game is for those of you who want a more compact and focused combat experience, less frustrating but longer combat challenge maps, and smaller but denser predator maps.",1693502075,1693502075,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The challenge maps are frustrating and difficult, but when you get good at them they're very satisfying. The story is great and the city is pretty big (for the time) and lively. It's really fun running, flying, and sneaking around as batman. The attention to detail blows me away with every little character interaction, I love it. The DLC characters are a little frustrating. Robin is fine (he's pretty similar to batman) but night wing and cat woman feel a little clunky at times. I can't blame them, they're dlc characters, they control better than a lot of main characters in games today do. But there are some goofy running animations and little things like that for night wing. Overall I would 10/10 recommend this game.

  ""Pay Your Respect"" was the last achievement. Leaving this last so I can explore the game one more time knowing I enjoyed everything about. Makes me think how Batman handle all of this.

I'll admit I could not get into at first. My goal was to get all the achievements like I did in Asylum and the 400 Riddler collectibles was a bit overwhelming. With the mindset of I have to get everything I enjoyed it less and it felt like a task to play. I only got about 6 or so hours on the game and didn't touch it for months. I finally decided to pick it up again, except now with the mindset of play and enjoy the story and worry about collectible and side missions later. The story is great and I quickly become obsessed with the game. 

The combat in Asylum was great and fun, but City adds more moves that (once you get the hang of them) creates even more entertaining fights. The ability to play as different characters with different moves helps to make the combat challenges more interesting and less repetitive. 

The amount of side mission and Riddler collectibles adds much more playtime, but it can be a bit tedious. I focused on the main story so I am just now getting to the other stuff, and the amount of trophies is starting to annoy me a bit. Most of the side missions are quite fun, and are kept short and sweet (loved the Mad Hatter one), but for some I feel like it ends too quickly and easily (like the Zsasz mission). 

Overall, this is an amazing game. If you enjoyed Arkham Asylum, you will absolutely love this game. The combat is entertaining, side missions are fun, and main story is great. 10/10 would recommend.

More of the same punchy combat, improved by more gadgets and a variety of enemy types. Combat often feels more like a puzzle now; you have to think about how and when to take out the enemies that require special moves. The story is even better than the first game. Being able to explore the whole city is much more open, like you'd expect a Batman game to feel rather than the small corridors of the Asylum. I really enjoyed the story on the whole, although there were a couple of annoying boss fights. The ending is particularly good. If you enjoyed the first one, absolutely play this.

[b]Pros[/b]
- Features Catwoman (which is not only cool, but also adds a new skill tree and some variation in gameplay)
- Graphical upgrades since Arkham
- While Arkham Asylum was very linear, being in the city really opens it up with lots of verticality
- You can now use the Batclaw to pull yourself to ledges while gliding, which is really useful for the new open environment
- New additions: Double take down, smoke bomb, slide tackle, double parry, titans are less annoying, knife dodge, different format of Riddler puzzles, line launcher can change direction in flight, electrical charges, freeze projectiles, shield enemies, armoured enemies, lots more enemies with guns, a gun disabler device
- Really enjoyed the boss fight with Mr. Freeze, as you have to think about the environment and use all your abilities
- There's a section where Batman is knocked out and needs help, and you're playing as Catwoman. You're given a choice whether to escape with your loot and leave Batman to die, or go save him. You can genuinely just leave the city and leave Batman to die, and the credits roll
- Nice short main story with lots of extra side content if you want to keep playing
- The annoying Scarecrow sections from the first game are gone (with only one annoying mad hatter section to replace them)

[b]Cons[/b]
- I found the number of new gadgets and abilities rather overwhelming. It's built for consoles, so everything's on a D-pad switcher and various controller button combinations which I constantly forgot or mixed up
- The game crashed during a boss fight",1472393547,1693073154,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For those of you who are new to the series, don't make the same mistake I did, this trilogy is not worth playing on ""hardest"" mode on the first run. The combat and keybinding input is terrible on keyboard and you might end up dying due to wrong inputs since 3-4 actions are bounded to ONE key and cannot be changed.

The game is not really an open world, it is more like a sandbox and it is very easy to travel around the map although there is no fast travel.",1693021949,1693021949,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The quality of the story felt like a normal Dark Knight comic (definitely a good thing) so I guess that was why the length was short. This goes on sale frequently bundled with other Batman games, so definitely worth it to get 3 or 4 top tier games all for a relatively small amount.

The story is about the length of a comic book and they fill time by introducing all the various supervillains for bit parts. The other way to fill time is collectibles and there are hundreds of Riddler trophies and other stuff around the map. You have to collect 400 of them to unlock the final Riddler mission so be ready for a long grind or have a video guide on your other monitor.

[h1]Batman: Arkham City[/h1]

[u]The story:[/u]

Arkham City is my favourite entry in the trilogy by far. The story is incredibly fun to follow, but my only gripe with it is that Strange was barely a factor in the story by the end. Even though, since the beginning, it was sort of a given that strange would be the centrepiece of the story, unfortunately, the same can't be said about the side missions in the game. They were very bland in comparison to the main story and felt like useless filler.

[u]The Gameplay:[/u]

Moving on to the game play, it is for sure a big step up compared to Arkham Asylum. The issue is that while the combat felt good and the stealth even better, the Catwoman sections of the story were quite the bore to play through. Her movement felt extremely lacking in comparison to Batman's, and the combat was less engaging with her lack of gadgets. The bosses in the game were quite fun, though, especially the Mister Freeze fight, which was super innovative.

My biggest gripe with this game, though, is its Riddler missions. As is usual with these games, for some godforsaken reason they need to include a collectathon in the game for it to be complete. There are over 400 Riddler trophies and such that need to be collected for you to even complete his side story. While I understand it's completely optional, it does feel like a slap in the face to have to endure such unnecessary filler to get the achievement.

Last but not least, the Riddler's Revenge content. Honestly, I've never dealt with a more infuriating set of challenges in my life. To complete the related achievements, you have to endure the same sets of maps four times as Batman, Catwoman, Robin, and Nightwing. This whole set of challenges takes filler to a whole new level. The way Arkham Asylum handled challenges was extremely fun. They were challenging but not overdone in quantity, with not much repetition. Here though? Were forced to endure the terrible movement of Catwoman and the horrifying mass of missions and campaigns.

[u]Overall:[/u]

Ignoring my gripes with the collectathons in the game, I think that Batman Arkham City is a top-notch game that tells its story in a way that's enjoyable and never infuriating. It's a relaxing game with an incredible story that leaves you itching for more. There are low points in the game, but the overwhelming majority of it is worth your time, even when not on sale. I do suggest waiting for the insane sales that the game frequently has, though.

The great parts - 

The game's atmosphere.

Combat, stealth/predator sections are awesome and highly improved from Arkham Asylum with new mechanics, gadgets and takedowns,

The music and voice acting is top notch.

Boss fights - Mr. Freeze and Ra's al Ghul are one of the best fights not only in the series, but in all of gaming as well.


The only downsides are - 

The story is not that great, it starts off strong, but it is difficult to ignore the plot holes. Nevertheless, it is an enjoyable ride.

There are too many Riddler trophies and collecting them is required to finish a side mission.

Nighwing is only playable in Challenge maps and does not have a story DLC. Additionally there should have been a dedicated tutorial for the character as his moves are quite different.

You can only change Display settings and keyboard and mouse controls from the game launcher and not the in-game menu

Even if you are a casual gamer and not a fan of superhero games, you should definitely play this one. The Arkham Trilogy (Arkham Asylum, CIty and Knight) are often on sale and are worth your money.",1687628222,1692640528,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Improves a lot over it's predecessor when it comes to basic combat, navigation through the Arkham city, overall controls and PC optimization. The gameplay is really great with hours of content. Gliding through the city of Arkham is so seamless that one could find themselves just navigating throughout without giving a fudge about the missions. Catwoman is fun to play with and I liked the fact that both the characters have a striking difference in their abilities although I found the movement mechanics for catwoman a little bit limiting but that's natural I guess. The puzzles for getting Riddler trophies are of varying difficulty levels and solving them is so much fun. Also this has to be the best portrayal of Joker in any DC game. The level at which he's shown to be demented straight up blew my mind [spoiler]along with the way he went out, so poetic.[/spoiler]

Catwoman and Talia Al Ghul are hot gyatt damn. I love DC women so much.

This was the first game in the Arkham series that I played. Definitely a 10/10 for me.

FYI I ran into some problems wherein the first time I launched the game, the cutscene would play and then the game would crash without any errors or prompts. This happened repeatedly. I searched some forums online and found that it had to be some issue with Nvidia PhysX, The fix was simple.
1. Go to the NVIDIA Control Panel
2. Click on Set PhysX Configuration from the side pane
3. Select CPU as the PhysX processor from the drop down list and you're good to go.

After buying the full trilogy (and being really pissed off that Arkham Knight wouldn't work with my $1000 laptop) I got bored of Arkham Asylum after playing the gargoyle parts over and over because that one guard named John wouldn't stop finding my location instantly I decided to give the next game in the incredible trilogy. Arkham City encapsulates the great elements of open world and fast-paced combat perfectly into its amazing story. All of the boss fights feel genuinely different and it's impossible to predict what happens next. The voice acting is incredible and with the talents of Kevin Conroy, Troy Baker and Corey Burton it truly feels like you're grappling through the (sometimes submerged) streets of Gotham. 

Overall, Arkham City is a great game with even greater fun and it will remain IMO as the best Arkham game

The game is truly ""immersive"" in the way it sets the whole atmosphere and mood of the world. It draws you into the Batman universe and lets you experience being the hero like you've always imagined. For example, everything from gliding and grappling around the city to using gadgets and pummeling goons feels accurate and fine-tuned. The story is intriguing with some good plot twists and features plenty of fan-favorites including Catwoman, the Joker, Harley Quinn, Mr. Freeze etc. You can also expect stellar voice acting and a phenomenal sound track. As for game length, my completion time for the main story clocked in around 50 hrs. ,and there's still more to play after the credits roll! Not to mention challenge mode and the bonus chapter.

Now I did like the story but it kinda has an identity crisis, it can't decide weather it wants to be about Joker or Hugo Strange, I previously didn't like the game so much but my latest play through i really did enjoy it, I'd hesitate a bit to call this an open world game at least by modern standards and I can imagine this was probably pushing the limits back then. There were some points in combat where batman would randomly attack a different target, idk if it was something i did or a bug. One of the things I did not like was how many times you would go to one place to get something then go back to the original location only to have to go to an entirely new area, it becomes a bit repetitive. Overall while I didn't enjoy as much as Asylum or Knight, it's hard not to find some joy with dynamic duo of Kevin Conroys Batman and Mark Hamils Joker",1691428319,1691428319,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rocksteady Studios has once again proven their expertise in crafting an immersive and gripping experience, taking players on a dark and atmospheric journey through the sprawling open-world streets of Gotham City.

From the moment you step foot into the decrepit and dangerous Arkham City, you are immediately engulfed in a rich and intricately designed world. The attention to detail in the environments, from the iconic landmarks to the sinister alleys, is simply breathtaking. The developers have managed to capture the essence of Gotham City, making it feel like a character in its own right, adding to the immersion and the sense of being the Caped Crusader.

The gameplay is where Batman: Arkham City truly shines. Fluid combat mechanics, intuitive controls, and an extensive array of gadgets make you feel like you are truly embodying the Dark Knight. Engaging in bone-crushing battles against a diverse array of villains, each with their unique abilities and strategies, provides an adrenaline-pumping experience that remains enjoyable throughout the game.

The storytelling in Arkham City is compelling and mature, successfully capturing the essence of Batman's world. The narrative delves into the darker aspects of the Batman mythos, tackling complex themes such as morality, justice, and the blurred lines between hero and villain. The game's voice acting is top-notch, with Mark Hamill's iconic portrayal of the Joker stealing the show and Kevin Conroy reprising his role as Batman with gravitas.

One of the most impressive aspects of the game is the rich gallery of rogues that Batman faces. From iconic villains like Two-Face, Poison Ivy, and Penguin to the enigmatic and terrifying Hugo Strange, each character is given enough depth and personality to make them memorable and captivating foes.

Arkham City's side missions and collectibles offer a vast amount of content that will keep players hooked for hours on end. Whether you're solving intricate Riddler puzzles, tracking down notorious criminals, or uncovering hidden secrets, there's always something exciting to do within the boundaries of this twisted city.

Moreover, the game's seamless integration of detective work adds a refreshing layer of gameplay that showcases Batman's intellect and strategic prowess. Solving crime scenes using forensic tools and piecing together clues feels gratifying and highlights Batman's multifaceted nature as a hero.

In terms of presentation, the graphics are stunning, and the music score perfectly complements the dark and brooding atmosphere, further immersing players into the world of Batman. Additionally, the attention to detail in character designs and animations contributes to an overall visually appealing and polished experience.

In conclusion, Batman: Arkham City is a tour de force in superhero gaming, offering an outstanding combination of compelling storytelling, exceptional gameplay mechanics, and a beautifully crafted world. Whether you're a die-hard Batman fan or just looking for an exceptional gaming experience, Arkham City is an absolute must-play.

200260,143033106,76561198836871096,0,16,7590,0,7590,1624584414,"Personal words about the game: When I first played this game, I played it as a pirate copy and because the game was not original, the save files were reset every time I closed the game. This meant I had to play the game without ever quitting or turning off my PC to complete it. Most people around me used to play mainly football or FPS games and since none of them played story-based RPGs or stealth-themed games, I couldn't find a solution to the problem of losing save files. Of course, I was happy to play the game after purchasing it. While playing the game, I was thrilled inside as it was something I had always wanted to play properly since my childhood but never got the chance to do so.

There's something to tell about the story: The game starts with a pointy eared shadow sneaking up on the thugs but this pointy eared person is not Batman. It's Catwoman, the other playable character in the game. After a short sequence of theft and capture, the game switches to the main character. The continuation of the game continues with Bruce's speech against this new prison and things are not going well for him. Later one of the three major villains in the game, Hugo Strange. Reveals that he knows Batman's true identity and foolishly releases him into Arkham City instead of directly killing him. What a genius. After that, you wear the costume and face a lot of puzzles to solve, save, and investigate in a small, lifeless open world. Meanwhile, the only problem is not the revelation of the secret identity. Also the development and wider use of the titan formula used by Joker in Asylum. To investigate this matter, Batman goes to Joker's location and is poisoned by Joker. He also has to find a solution to this problem. In Arkham games, the story always ends within one night and this game is no exception. The story progresses nicely and diversely. So side characters appear as part of the main story and continue without losing momentum. For example, characters like Mr. Freeze and Mad Hatter have almost no difference between main and side missions. Of course, this is not a bad thing because their side missions are of main mission quality, which positively affects the game. Finally, having 2 playable characters means 2 different perspectives, so some of the stories interact with each other.

Retinal Pleasure or Art: Textures and graphics have been further enhanced compared to the first game. Especially the frozen police station in the Mr. Freeze fight, the section filled with water by Penguin, and the League of Assassin sections were beautifully designed. Costumes have been diversified and detailed for all controllable characters. Perhaps the Batman Beyond costume could be a little skinnier, then it would be much better.

Mechanics: This game, which is already a sequel to a game with very good mechanics, naturally reached the peak of its era with even more improved mechanics. It excels in close combat, and you can use the equipment you possess to create various combos during fights. Now let's talk about the important mechanics of stealth that the game has. It's important to note that you shouldn't expect a Thief-style stealth like in the previous game. The stealth in this game involves climbing on ledges, hiding in grates, staying in plain sight of enemies, being able to move silently even while running, and gliding over your enemies. Then you take them down, but this kind of stealth suits the game well because Batman is more of a super-secret agent ninja than a realistic character. Apart from that, you can use your equipment for stealth purposes. For example, you can place three explosive gels on a wall and detonate them when enemies approach, taking them all down effortlessly. Additionally, there are Riddler's puzzles, and it was quite enjoyable to solve them using the equipment you possess. Also, the mechanics of Catwoman, Nightwing, and Robin are similar in the same regard. All four characters have unique styles, but they can be roughly categorized as 2 acrobatic and 2 heavy hitters. Catwoman and Nightwing are acrobatic fighters, while Batman and Robin are heavier fighters. This doesn't mean they are slow, it's just that their movements are not as acrobatic as the others, which is reasonable considering their origins.

Atto Finale: In the end, if you still haven't bought the game, get it and play. You will not regret it because of the diversity of the story, the richness of mechanics and the ability to experiment with various trials thanks to its small mod kit. In fact, you will even seek more games of this kind.",1690651724,1690651724,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So many changes from the first game, alot of time spending content for completionists and so many different moves and gadgets to play around with. God tier voice acting by Mark Hamill as the Joker and Kevin Conroy as the batman. 

This game changed so heavily that you can legit call this the definition of the perfect sequel. The story was amazing. I didn't have much time for the side stuff, i did a couple but this game has crazy amount of content for the trophy hunters but if you're a casual gamer like me you'll LOVE the main story, map design, graphics and gameplay. 

I think the only thing that i genuinely find a flaw in this game was riddler trophies.

Pros compared to Arkham Asylum:
Better Story/character development
Travelling is faster due to open world mechanics

Cons compared to Arkham Asylum:
Worse combat (guys with shields and armour really ruin the fights that are normally quite fluid)
Unintuitive puzzles (really obscure solutions for some puzzles that I doubt 99% of people could solve without Googling)

Batman Arkham City is a great part 2 of this amazing franchise and doesn't disappoint in any way.

You will meet old characters from the previous game such as[spoiler] Zsasz, Poison Ivy, Bane, Riddler, Harley Quinn, etc. and the main man himself; the Joker.[/spoiler]
It took me a total of 75 hours to fully complete the game and get all of the achievements. (Main story, Side quests, Riddler Trophies & Challenges, Combat & Challenges Mode, DLC content and miscellaneous trophies like ""Perfect Freeflow 2.0"".
I think most of the time gets invested in collecting the riddler trophies and doing side activities.

The sequel to Rockysteady's Batman: Arkham Asylum, Arkham City brings a whole new experience to the Batman Arkham franchise. With new gadgets, a new fighting system, an entire city to explore, and a great story. 

[h1] The Batman Rises [/h1]

[spoiler] The game tells you to climb ACE Chemicals in the first 10 minutes of the game (hilarious! I know!) [/spoiler] The story greatly improves from Asylum, and has the amazing voice work of Kevin Conroy (may he R.I.P.), Mark Hamil, Troy Baker, Steve Blum, and more other great VAs. The story has excellent foreshadowing, and keeps you engaged until the end. [spoiler] Except for the Catwoman Episodes [/spoiler]

[h1] The Ruined City [/h1]

In Arkham City, you play in a ruined [spoiler] Gotham [/spoiler]. The city is swarming with thugs and other obstacles in your way. There are more collectibles than last time, but they are not too difficult to find. The textures in the map are meh for a 2011 game, but luckily, there are many graphics mods you can download from nexusmods to make the game more visually appealing. 

[h1] The Improved Gameplay [/h1]

Not much to say when it comes to the gameplay, other than it is drastically improved on with the better gadgets, more fighting animations, and a more precise fighting system. The gameplay gets better when you see how these elements affect the gameplay of other characters. 

[h1] Riddler's Dungeon [/h1]

Riddler's Revenge will take the most time in your completionist playthrough. You have 4 characters to play instead of 1, and the maps can be hard for everything to work perfectly. On the other hand, some of the maps are fun with certain characters.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

The Arkham trilogy/quadrilogy (origins) is a complete masterpiece, Asylum, City, and Knight are all some of the best games ever (Origins is also amazing).

The voice acting (RIP Kevin Conroy) was phenomenal, story well written, combat/gameplay being simple but extremely fun with some challenge to it, and the music being absolutely breathtaking, with slow and atmospheric tracks, followed by tense orchestras and choirs building up to an epic finale. It was all so tightly knit and crafted with love for Batman, the DC universe, and games as a whole. Hopefully there will be another Arkham game in the coming years.

Beat it at around 12 hours (didn't achievement hunt, not worth it imo) beat it quicker than I did Asylum, I have a review on Asylum as well, hard to tell if the game is shorter but it certainly has more quality than Asylum did and the combat has more variety.  I do wish they introduced Catwomen more in the story, you play as her like 3 times, he does stuff for like 5 minutes and then you switch back to Batman.  The extra Harley Quinn story when you beat the game is pretty nice, you get to play as Robin for the most of it, his bullet shield is op not even gonna lie lol

Holds up pretty good for a 2012 game, def worth the try

If your curious of the order of games you should play it in, the 4 main ones are

1 Arkham Origin
2 Arkham Asylum
3 Arkham City
4 Arkham Knight

You should play Origin before Asylum and City despite it coming out later since it takes place before Asylum and City but if you don't want too (since it's not really included in the Arkham Steam bundle) it can be skipped, it's the least important",1688426749,1688426749,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I liked the story in this a bit more. more of the great arkham bat man formula. the collectables are easy enough to grab and don't feel tedious to get you definitely earn some of them but feels good to do so.

Perhaps I value this game more because it is shrouded by the pure nostalgia and fond memories I have of it, but it sincerely is one of my favorite games that I have ever played.

Some lines are cheesy, but many carry a great impact with them, of course due to the incredible performances from the entire voice cast, but ESPECIALLY Kevin Conroy (rest in piece) and Mark Hamill, as they reprise their roles as Batman and Joker.

The music of this game can be anything from thrillingly intense as there will be an entire orchestra of many stringed instruments and the haunting use of a choir in the background, to more quiet and stress building pieces, even to just emotional ones.

The story is truly something special and unique with a good twist and many hints toward that twist that you will notice on subsequent playthroughs.

I somehow managed to not even mention the combat in these games yet. 
There are 2 main types of combat, that being FreeFlow combat, and Predator combat. 


The FreeFlow combat is seriously incredible. It feels much more fluid than it had in Asylum, which is a theme of this game. The game as a whole took everything that made Asylum great and made it spectacular, the hand to hand combat being part of that.

The combat is normally criticized for being ""button-mashy"" which I can see where people are coming from, but it really is deep and complex and even challenging as the game continues. It is incredibly satisfying and the animations flow together incredibly well. It's easy to pick up but hard to master, which is perfect in my eyes.

The predator combat is one of the most unique systems that the game has to offer. You play as Batman in stealth encounters where you must pick off armed enemies one by one until you have cleared the area. Music intensifies, henchmen's heartbeats rise as they find fallen members and their movements get more sporadic and much much more.

I hate to use the overused term, but... It really makes you FEEL like Batman.

I wish I could say more but the amount of respect I have for this series as a whole is something too immense to put into words for a steam review.




Thank you Rocksteady for helping to craft this cornerstone of my childhood.

Naturally, this means doubling down on the combat, gadgets, side-missions, and the world itself. Before I go into detail, does Arkham City prove itself a worthy sequel to the legacy of Arkham Asylum? 100%, and in many ways surpasses it.

The story is grand, engaging, and packed full of iconic Batman rogues, all underlit by an absolutely chilling operatic theme. Without spoiling too much, it does a marvelous job at elevating the stakes and action, with multiple factions vying for control of the isolated Arkham City. With the exception of Hugo Strange, Catwoman, and Robin being underutilized, it was a fantastic story that really expanded on the Batman mythos. Speaking of, Batman himself is definitely more moody this time around, but beside the fact that he’s the Dark Knight, there’s a good reason for his grumpiness here.

In Arkham City, you’re working with a much bigger playground than before, which feels like the perfect size. Landmarks are clear and gliding has been made more involved and practical for travel, making it a blast to coast around the city. What’s more, the various side missions are short, sweet treats that put the spotlight on the lesser featured villains. Sure, some missions are a bit less deep than I’d like, but it was cool to see so many new and returning faces.

Most noticeable of all, the combat has been greatly expanded, both for and against you. But don’t be mistaken, the game is still heavily in your favor. The special moves and gadgets make going through this entry a relative breeze. Like Arkham Asylum, City is easy if you know what you’re doing. To me, the draw of Rocksteady combat (beside the animations) has always been trying to build the biggest combo using the largest variety of special moves. And with challenge mode being back and bigger than ever, allowing you to now play Catwoman, Robin, and Nightwing, there’s no shortage of opportunities to lay the hurt on some unsuspecting mooks. This extends to the breakout boss fights like Mr. Freeze as well, which really emphasizes thinking outside the box.",1656466910,1687570088,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't even know what to say or what to begin with. I lost my safe file back in the day and needed to start all over after a long break, which made me prone to being frustrated and disappointed throughout the experience, but it went surprisingly well.
The game kept me hooked for quite a while so I 100%-ed the campaign + the DLC and it didn't feel repetitive at all. Some challenges or riddles showed new ways to use your skills and gadgets, which I didn't even know where possible.
The graphics, mechanics, animations and the amount of them counting their smoothness is shocking for me, because this game is almost [b] 12 years old [/b] at the time of review.

Batman Arkham City is a great game that improves on the greatness of Arkham Asylum in plenty of ways. I enjoyed that some of the unlockable abilities from the first game were available from the start, such as the gargoyle takedown where you grab someone from above and hang them on it. There are also plenty of new gadgets and the main hub is a massive improvement from the first game with new ways to get around with gliding, more buildings and criminals throughout. The story also felt improved over the first game and the ending was great. This is definitely the best game I have played recently.

Don't get me wrong I love a challenge and this game does have difficulty settings. Difficulty settings are meaningless when I take the difficulty to easy I will not die unless game actively tries to bore me in a single fight for 20 minutes.

the difficulty settings don't change parkour difficulty which gets really hard. I failed one parkour more than a hundred times. the puzzles are painstakingly random. they are hard at times but they are never satisfying to me. 

most of all every single hack and slash game except mad max feels like the hardest game to me. I hate to play fast and reflex dependent. even in souls game I tried to go for slow and calculative gameplays. 

I would delve deeper into the mechanics and how it punishes intuitive but it is too much work for someone who has a ""hack and trash"" game category.",1685465364,1685465364,False,0,1,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

The main story is rich and exciting, and I'm sure you won't get bored because there's plenty side quests as well! I was shocked how much emotion can this game bring to you, from smiling, trough crying! 

Again maybe the only ""boring"" thing in the game is getting Riddler's trophies, but again if you're an achivement hunter like myself you'll enjoy it for sure! It'll take time tho! 

I recommend everyone to at least beat the game once, of course together with the trilogy! Guaranteed fun!

Introduction:
Step into the gritty and atmospheric world of Gotham City once again in Batman: Arkham City, the critically acclaimed action-adventure game developed by Rocksteady Studios. In this review, we delve into the shadows to explore why this sequel to Batman: Arkham Asylum has become a beloved and iconic entry in the Batman gaming franchise on Steam.

Engaging Open-World Gameplay (9/10):
Arkham City takes the gameplay of its predecessor and expands it into an open-world setting, allowing players to freely explore the vast and atmospheric streets of Gotham City. As Batman, you'll navigate through towering skyscrapers, dive into the grimy underbelly of the city, and engage in exhilarating combat encounters with a variety of iconic villains. The seamless integration of exploration, stealth, and combat mechanics creates an immersive and satisfying gameplay experience.

Combat Perfection (10/10):
The combat system in Arkham City is a highlight of the game, building upon the already excellent mechanics of Arkham Asylum. As Batman, you'll unleash a flurry of punches, kicks, and gadgets in fluid and brutal combat sequences. The timing-based combat system rewards skillful play, allowing players to chain together devastating combos while countering enemy attacks with precise timing. The combat in Arkham City is both empowering and deeply satisfying, making players truly feel like the Dark Knight.

Captivating Storyline (9/10):
The narrative of Arkham City is a dark and gripping tale that immerses players in the corrupt and dangerous world of Gotham City. As Batman, you find yourself trapped within the walls of Arkham City, a sprawling prison overrun by criminals and ruled by the enigmatic Hugo Strange. The intricate plot weaves together iconic Batman villains, including The Joker, Two-Face, and The Riddler, leading to unexpected twists and turns that keep players on the edge of their seats.

Immersive Atmosphere and Stunning Visuals (9/10):
Gotham City is brought to life with a stunning level of detail and atmospheric design. The gritty streets, dilapidated buildings, and iconic landmarks create an immersive and believable world. The dark and moody visuals, coupled with the exceptional voice acting performances, including Mark Hamill's unforgettable portrayal of The Joker, further enhance the overall experience and make Arkham City a truly immersive and cinematic adventure.

Abundance of Side Quests and Collectibles (8/10):
Beyond the main storyline, Arkham City offers a wealth of side quests, challenges, and collectibles to discover. From solving intricate puzzles set by The Riddler to tracking down hidden Riddler trophies scattered throughout the city, there is always something to do and explore. These additional activities provide hours of additional gameplay and reward players with valuable upgrades and secrets, further extending the longevity of the game.

Conclusion:
Batman: Arkham City is a superb action-adventure game that showcases the dark and brooding world of Gotham City with exceptional gameplay, a captivating storyline, and stunning visuals.

AMD double driver? Microsoft Net 3.5? Come on. The launcher even
fails with flying colors. Error. Uninstall.  Bang head against wall.
Realize the installer is missing Direct X stuff.

So I install Direct X End-User Runtime Web Installer.
Installs missing files. Done. Game starts. As good as I
remember. Now to act like Gotham Knight never existed.
Then I realize how dated this game's combat is mechanically, and did not
age well.

 I have to deduct points. Protocol 10 was a letdown. Scanning helicopters while getting shot at was tedious. There's an overabundance of stealth sections, not enough combat in the campaign. I found myself learning on the fly and dying.

Also guns. Stop tossing guns into everything and calling it hard. Seriously. There is an overabundance of armed enemies. 9 times out of 10 I get hit after or while disarming an enemy. Batman is the only character that can destroy weapons as a special ability. My advice? Play defensively. Always. 

Near mid to end game, most common enemies have guns, and after you beat the game, 90% of them are packing assault rifles by default, and they will shoot you outside of street brawls. Through fences and rooftops. It's worse than the stinking helicopters. It made kid me angry in 2012, and still irritates me in 2023.

New game plus is just moronic. They remove the visual cues and that just makes combat more chaotic and irritating. Everything is already an ugly, washed out grey and blue. On top of that enemies can hit you coming out of a counter, which is already difficult to tolerate if they pile up on you. The only way to get more exp is to do New game+. It's just a harder and sometimes unfair experience. Getting around in Arkham City is a chore. Movement feels restricted and slow. 

The gadgets in this game are mostly gimmick related outside of combat, and only serve to chase down hidden stuff. In combat gadgets do three things. Stun an enemy or freeze them. Sometimes knocks em down. That's it. Beyond that, Catwoman is the only character with crowd control, and I find her more fun to play as than Batman. Nightwing and Robin  don't count, because they are bonus characters that you can't use in the main campaign.

Overall a solid game, but lacks any replay value outside of the fun combat. 7/10.",1683517725,1683745398,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On PCs that run Windows Vista and later and/or an Intel CPU, you won't need that program because it will impact the performance and cause other issues.

Unfortunately when you launch the game for the first time you don't get the choice to decline the installation of AMD Dual-Core Optimizer (that's why I left a negative review).
In order to stop that program from being installed, do as follows:

If the program is already installed, you should uninstall it. Go to ""Programs and Features"", select ""AMD Dual-Core Optimizer"" and click ""Uninstall"" (perhaps it will take a while, do not cancel the process and wait); afterwords, reboot the PC.

1) Go to the installation folder of the game (right click on the game title -> properties -> local files tab -> browse local files)
2) Open ""installscript.vdf"" (right click -> open with -> use Notepad)
3) Scroll down until you see the word ""AMD"", followed by a bunch of code between the two perpendicular { and } brackets; delete that portion of code, beginning from the word ""AMD"" to the last perpendicular bracket (note that you must leave the brackets on the left side and everything else)
4) Save the file. Make sure you didn't delete anything that has to do with DXSetup, VCRedist_x86 and DotNetFx35
5) When you're done, go to the ""Setup"" folder and delete ""amd_dc_opt.exe"" (this is an optional step, just to be safe)

If you've done everything correctly, when you launch the game the installation of AMD Dual-Core Optimizer won't start.

Batman Arkham City is an incredibly special game to me. This may sound a little corny, but it changed my life. Massively. If I didn’t play this game way back in March 2017, I wouldn’t have become the massive Batman fan that I am today. I may not have watched The Dark Knight Trilogy, and since those were the movies that got me into film and filmmaking, then I may not have started looking at movies the way I do now. This game has a special place in my heart and I just have to say: Thank you, Rocksteady. And this game still holds up on a replay. The graphics are really good, especially for the time, and the sound effects in this game are unforgettable. If you asked me to recreate any sound from this game, I could do it. From the footsteps, to the grappling hook, to the explosive gel, it is all just so memorable and I don’t know why. The combat here is incredibly fun. Building up your combo is incredibly satisfying and there are so many different moves you can use to get through each encounter. Also, the boss fights in here are great and they are all varied and unique, especially Mr. Freeze. Stealth is a blast too, although catwoman’s stealth sections can be a little tricky. The story and writing here are fantastic as well. The characters are all interesting and the story has a ton of twists that I did not expect. Overall, this game is a blast. It never has a dull moment and it has truly changed my life. If you want a game to play, play the Arkham Series. I’m sure you will have a great time with them.

10/10

When I Revisited The Game Last Year:

Since I played Batman Arkham City last year and did a review for it, I didn’t really feel the need to do another one this year, but I do still want to talk more about it. The game itself is still absolutely phenomenal, with a compelling and fantastically written story, incredibly engaging combat and stealth, and a ton of attention to detail. But, even aside from that, I don’t think I would be reviewing movies and games or be as interested in them if it wasn’t for Arkham City. I first played this game in April 2017. Nowadays, I mostly play single-player narrative-driven games, with some exceptions, but before 2017, that definitely wasn’t the case. I mostly played survival games, some online multiplayer shooters, and other similar types of games. Arkham City definitely changed that. I don’t remember many games having a story that really impacted me before this game and after that, I started playing more games like it (firstly the other Arkham games) and now those make up the bulk of the games I play. It goes beyond games as well. While I think I’ve always liked Batman, Arkham City really got me into the character and ever since I played, I’ve been a huge Batman fan and still am today, collecting comics, memorabilia, etc. I’ve gotten to meet some Batman writers at conventions which was really cool too. And since I enjoyed this game so much, I decided to watch The Dark Knight trilogy a few months later since I had never seen them before at the time. And after I watched that trilogy, that’s when I really started to appreciate movies (though it would be a few more years before I started reviewing them) and not just passively watch them. So yeah. Saying Arkham City changed some things in my life is an understatement and I don’t believe I would be the same person without it. While I think Arkham Knight executes some elements better than City (more on this in my coming Arkham Knight review), I have to say that Arkham City is not only my favorite game in the series but my favorite game of all time for having this much of an effect on me. If you haven’t played Arkham City yet, you absolutely should and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

Thank you, Rocksteady.",1495764626,1683505256,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I recommend playing the main story and the non-tedious side missions only if you do buy this game. The whole package I don't recommend in general though because the other parts of the game aren't that great. Especially the boring-as-hell challenges.

Main Story

I hate the combat in these games with a passion. Mainly because your character's movements are mostly arbitrary and you have no idea what exactly they will do other than ""attack"" or ""counter"". You don't know which direction they will counter in, which enemy they will target next, you have little agency in movement during combat. Battles last forever. It feels like crap. It's easy too, but when you ""lose"" ever it's because of the above issues, not because you made some sort of mistake. After all, all you have to do is press A to attack and Y occasionally when you need to counter. Whether the game allows those attacks to connect with an optimal enemy or one with 50 other enemies around them is up to the game though. You have other techniques you can do, but no real way of indicating which enemy to do any of them on for sure, so it feels like you just hope the game does it on the right enemy for all your attacks and actions. Enemy about to shoot you? Sorry you targeted a different enemy and got shot and died. You couldn't do anything about it - it's just the game's decision. WHY CAN'T I HIT MULTIPLE ENEMIES AT ONCE WITH SWEEPING KICKS OR SOMETHING IF THEY SURROUND ME? You have no agency in combat other than punch one guy, counter the guy who ran up behind you - maybe use a gadget and hope it targets the right enemy. Dealing with multiple enemies at once is out of the question outside of some special attacks you can occasionally use that stun them, you can never kill multiple enemies in one go, that'd be a fun and quicker. You have to suffer through punching each enemy one-by-one to kill them. Or spend 200 years creeping up on each enemy like it's dishonored (much better game) if the room layout lets you.

The graphics are great. The story is quite interesting, and the exploration of the city and light puzzle solving elements are fun. This game isn't all that long so the reliance on ""bat-vision"" isn't too annoying. I actively just avoid combat since it's such a drag. At least the game gives you options to take out opponents without having to start another brainless boring brawl session. Great voice acting and the appearance of each superhero/supervillain look fairly accurate to their original designs. I appreciate that aspect. I'm not much of a superhero fan but it was interesting seeing all these supervillains in the game.

There are simply too many riddler collectibles. I got all of them, but it gets to be a drag after a while. Rather than pepper the world with things that give you a tiny amount of EXP that look exactly the same, pepper the world with actual interesting experiences and encounters. Focus on side missions with actual interactions with characters, and if you need collectibles, have a smaller amount that give you something particularly useful like a new optional gadget or skill or something.

Challenge pack DLC / Riddler's Revenge

Absolutely abysmal DLC / extra content that is just ""fight some enemies"" times one million. The combat in these games is the most boring part. The exploration is more interesting and the light puzzle solving as well. No I don't care about getting a combo of two million (mashing A and Y and maybe B for fun) for three hours to get a medal and an achievement. F*** off with this garbage. I'm glad this fad of ""attack and wait to counter and no enemy lock-on"" went out of style eventually. Arkham Asylum, Shadow of Mordor, and this game are the ones with that combat style I've played and I'm already completely sick of it. There's a reason the achievement rates for this part of the game are the lowest out of the whole package. It's not fun and takes forever.

Harley Quinn's revenge

It's a small DLC that focuses on story and combat. It's essentially another mission that adds on to the main story, and is pretty good just like the rest of the main game but honestly if I bought this dlc separately I would feel like it isn't worth whatever you could charge because it's such a small thing and is almost completely reuse of assets in the steel mill area of the main game's map. Nothing much to it, and almost entirely just fighting trash normal enemies too.

Overall this whole Arkham City game would have been recommendable if it wasn't padded with so many awful combat sessions. If you play the game just for the story it's more fun than trying to do the soul-sucking challenges. So I'd recommend if you just play the story, but don't recommend the other parts.",1682833164,1682833164,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,2,True,False,False

The city looks great, but feels dead. There's only a small group of NPCs that aren't violent.

The combat is a lot of fun, with a lot of variety. You can get some awesome beat downs going. It flows great, and is a lot of fun...until it doesn't. The camera spins you around, and Batman punches at air instead of jumping at the enemy. The game also has problems with the many uses of Y. Sometimes it continues to stay on Smoke Bomb instead of Ground Takedown. Sometimes instead of Interrogate it only gives Silent Takedown.

Detective mode turns itself on a lot during combat. It's not my controller, as it never happened when I played Asylum right before this. I've also tested it with multiple controllers.

The riddles are great, and challenging. The AR training is fun, until you get to that one that almost makes me need a new controller.

They added a compass, which was great. Unfortunately, it doesn't work inside a building, or underground. I see we used satellite radio technology there.

The camera spinning at times also caused me to grapple onto things I wasn't aiming at when I hit RB. When you get launching around town with the upgrade...it's awesome though. You can really move around the city quickly.

The Catwoman DLC is great. Her third mission was one of the most fun in the game. I like the minigame of climbing walls with her...except that the game starts after you hit the wall, not when you hit it, which would make more sense. It's very noticeably breaking the rhythm. Also, inverted takedowns make you not return to the ceiling for some reason. The Harley Quinn DLC is rather weak since they lock out all the menu functions from the map button. If you forget a combo, you have to go to google to remember. This is absolutely stupid.

The bosses to interrogate are a great upgrade from just finding the maps in Asylum.

I could go on, but overall it's a blast. It's well worth playing. I'm not even a Batman fan. These were recommended after my run through the Assassin's Creed series. I got the three games for $15.",1670011121,1682814578,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only weak part of the game - as it was in the asylum - its boss fights. There are no intimidating enemies and final encounter with Bane ends...in a quick disappointment manner.
Open world is not really big - but it rather plus, than disadvantage, because it rich on encounters, points of interest and various locations (at least until you complete the game, then openworld feels a bit empty, but beating a shit out of thugs is still fun).
The amount of gadgets Batman has is even bigger and ability to use much more of them without losing combo makes fights spectacular.
There are only 2 things that a really bothered me - THE FREAKING TON of Riddler trofies and Catwoman 
 predator challenges. (yes, this game has a dlc-campaign for Robin, that continues the main story, ability to switch to the Catwoman in openworld (but her missions are most grinding-type), and all 3 of them + Nightwing for challenges.
Getting all achievements requires grinding through, so i would recommend just enjoy the main story, Robin campaign and trying some challenges (imagine  other heroes as difficult modificators Batman -> Nightwing -> Robin -> Catwoman).

Don’t get me wrong, Batman. I like this game. Simply to say – ‘The first game with improvements.’ I did’t have problems running it on Manjaro (It’s an Arch distro, btw). The game-play loop is good. The story – dramatic! Classic DC Animated Universe. Paul Dini - good writing. 
The fighting mechanic is ..terrible..  one button mash. Probably to be easy for the children. After all they are nagging on the parents for presents.
Speaking of nagging -  “it is hardly a surprise…”  nyu-nyu .. whatever – The nagging cut scenes after dying can be funny – If was made in a game with proper controls. But, wet again Dark Souls have the more simple “YOU DIED” sentence.   
And the stealth system, Batman? Oh, boy! The stealth system. Who made it? It was someone extremely sneaky.. .. I know! Cobblepot!
So, we have a “Stealth is optional” type of action game. And the both main gameplay systems are unresponsive counter-intuitive trash. Thanks I hate it.
And still, I consider this to be the best game in the series. It is easy 80% subjective rating, from me. The rest of the game series just “jumped the shark”, after this.
But something still, bothers me. Makes me uneasy. No, it’s not just the fighting mechanic.
Something that I feel in other games, too. And I finally got it! I hate this current trend of artificially inflating the value of a game by adding “social network” memorabilia - achievement, collectable cards and clunky services connected to the games. Achievements does not add an additional game value. This just adds irritation that most of the time is perceived unconsciously, by the player. [b]Yea, I’ve learned ThIs woRds from Hugo Strange…[/b] This incentivise the gamer to play a game just to get the “social credit” that deserves. Even if the player don’t like the game. Because ‘You’re not a good gamer, if you don’t achieve 100% completion’.
That’s why gamers always complain for something and they don’t know why. Not just about the Easy Difficulty in ""Sekiro"" or the other Souls games. Films, too. Star Wars; Lord of the Rings; etc.
[b]Pride and Accomplishment in action! Ladies and Gentlemen. Pride and Accomplishment![/b]
I don’t want to be fed with artificial ingredients, any more. So I’ve decided to return the favour. 
[b]This are my review rules – The game starts with 100 points. And for all the artificial social bloat that I don’t like I will subtract points – “maluses”. And my final review score will be calculated by my subjective Content Quality percentage applied on the points that are left. Fractions are rounded down. If the game reaches 0 or below by only subtracting artificial ingredients – I will not recommend the game, by default. But still I will give you a score by removing this percentage from the negative score. Because I’m generous.

But genuinely this is (probably) the best hero video game ever made, (yes even more than Spider-Man PS4), The music is Phenomenal, most of the sidequest are great, The boss battles in this game are some of the best (minus 1, and 1 that should have been one, don't wanna spoil but if you know you know) plus the Mr. Freeze Fight is still one of the best Bosses in the series if not THE best and is one of the best stories from a game, HONESTLY if you love a good Batman story filled with twist and turns, Plenty of Easter Eggs that reference stuff from the comics plus actually lore in the Arkhamverse, fantastic villains and incredible voice acting (RIP Kevin Conroy) than this is the game. 

I will say to a handful downsides that the game does have is that the combat is rough, not as bad as Arkham Asylum but not as great as Arkham Knight, it's right in the middle tbh. Also if you are a fan of the free roam music in this game do not get too attached it leaves mid-way towards the end of the game (weird glitch that Rocksteady still hasn't fixed).

Having started with Knight and worked my way backwards, I really much prefer the less overtuned combat in city. The first time i played this game I was blown away by the amount of detail in the city. Combat is very solid, Open world is amazing and story i@ by far the best stories in all of the games (origins is number one). Batman skins are amazing, the catwoman dlc is annoying if you wanna stay immersed in the story, and just like every arkham game I wish you could roam around with all the characters in free roam ( like every arkham game)

By far if you want bang for your buck this would be a must purchase for any superhero fan and made me realize why the dark knight is my favourite superhero

The side quests are stories of there own and flesh out more detail into the villains you are up against. And defeating them sure does feel satisfying. 
The combat and stealth challenges are actually challenging and only get annoying if you don't pay attention to your surroundings.
You get to play as Cat woman! (and also Robin and Nightwing in the challenges)  

My only downside with the game was that it does not run as well as it probably should getting crazy stutters and even sometimes crashes when gliding through the city but it would settle itself rather quickly or crash on texture loading.

It is daring, fun and introduces villains that more causal Batmanfans might not know about (or very little)

I do must say that I personally prefer the original Arkham Asylum over City. It may be stiffer in terms of gameplay, but the overall atmosphere, world and art-direction capture me more than those in City (whom are still great btw!)

It is definitely more packed with content than AA (just look at the 200 more added ""Riddles"") and is now a more true open-world with side-quests and all. 

Easily beatable under 10 hours if you just go for the main story plus a few sidequests. But if you go for NG+, Riddler, all the sidequests and DLCs, you might see yourself play this for up to 30 hours easily.

For many the fan-favorite of the series and I cant blame them. For me however just a great follow-up to an even greater Entry to the Arkham Series.",1679872649,1679872649,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has a much better story that hooks you instantly, great boss fights, equipment variety, challenges and many more.
Combat is still the same which is a turn off for some people so bear that in mind.
Only negative i have is with the game itself running like absolute trash whenever you are not in combat. There are some fixes that make it better but still after the fixes, the performance is not so great.

It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

It is a good game, there's a lot going on and a lot to do- 10 hours in and I feel like I've only really scratched the surface. That being said, for every good thing about it, there seems to be something that sours it a little.
I never played this game before this year, so let me tell you as someone with no nostalgia: It's beautiful. There's a lot of obvious love here in every location and how seamless and easy it is to get lost in and explore.
On the note of exploration: The controls are too sensitive sometimes. I cannot tell you how many times I got stuck trying to glide off a railing but I climb up instead.
Coming off of Asylum, I was not looking forward to combat in this game. But it's actually much easier to get combos and there are a lot of other fun, creative ways to take down opponents.
It's just too bad that, unlike Asylum, this game is pretty dead set on forcing you into arena battles with a large number of enemies you have to take on all at once. Doesn't feel very Batman to me, but I guess it is fun every now and again.
Oh- but that thing about combos being easier to get? That's not because the combat is better. In fact, it's probably just because combat is *too* responsive. This means you'll often end up knocking out that Riddler informant you've been dancing around trying to keep up for this fight that could have been over forever ago, and hitting that dodge too fast on a knife-wielding enemy will land you a punishing 3x hit that you... just sort of have to deal with. That's not even getting into some of the combat inconsistencies. For some reason, Batman will auto-turn to fire a batarang at the enemy the camera is pointed at, but he won't do the same when quick shooting the charge gun- he'll just shoot it blindly off screen if you happened to already have him turned away. 
Oh, but about the Riddler informants and comparisons to Asylum- I really like how this game handles the Riddler! The Riddles and quests are challenging and take me a minute to puzzle out instead of just going ""Oh, 'bird-' I'm looking for the Penguin poster"" or whatever. Though this game does have some riddles like that, it's so wide and expansive that the search for them truly feels like exploration and not just squinting into random corners of an office trying to find Cluemaster's shoelace or whatever. You even get to answer actual non-Batman related riddles, which I feel was sorely missing from the first game and I did whine a bit about to some friends. The best part of the riddles in this game over Asylum- hands down- is definitely the informants. Huge step up from just finding a single map with all of the locations you'll probably only get to after getting through %80 of them anyway if you're looking for them on your first play through like I was. The informants add more agency to that, and the location of the clues don't always match up to where you have to go to activate them. This is great for puzzles like the ""perspective"" riddles, where finding where you need to go to activate them.... is the whole point of the puzzle. Give you anything more, and it's just handed to you.
HOWEVER- there is no longer a ""teeth"" counter. (Teeth have been replaced with balloons, penguins, and... more teeth- but I'll be using teeth for simplicity.) The teeth counter made keeping track of how many you needed super simple and teeth were usually found in clumps of three, which made them less like mindless collectibles (that's what the riddles were for...) and more like a marker of explorable areas. Have 11 teeth? Sounds like you missed a corner of that room you were in- should be divisible by 3, bud. Have 12 teeth but need 15? A whole other area of the building is probably still locked off- don't stress out and keep on with the story. I can see why this may not be a feeling you want or even see as feasible to evoke in such an open world, and to that I say: dump the group of three, but keep the counter.
But hey- this game is way too old for anything I say now to impact it or how it was made... It's also way too fun for any of this to really... matter?
It's a great game! Lives up to the hype. I'm actually sorry I never played this back when it just came out and my brother was telling me to give it a shot, but I'm happy to catch the train this time around. I know most people looking to buy this kind of game don't even read the comments- but if you're down here looking to get the game for yourself or a fellow Batman lover: It's more than worth it! Any time I've gotten shot because I jumped over a gap I was trying to glide between or fallen into water or felt like a boss fight was kind of cheap has been immediately swept away by the thrill of the next piece of the action.",1679219813,1679219813,True,0,0,0,3,True,False,False

The game is quite similar to Arkham Asylym so if you've played that this will be an easy game to learn(not that there is learning curve). Basically you just beat the crap out of criminals and solve a couple of puzzles every now and then.

The game takes place a couple of years after the events of Arkham Asylym. You are captured by Doctor Strange who knows that Bruce Wayne is batman. He sends you to his prison that he build in the middle of Gotham called Arkham city. You have to escape from Arkham city and stop Stranges plans to take over Gotham.

If you're going to play this game I recommend using a controller also TURN OF DIRECTX 11 FEATURES and PHYSX. They will crash the game every 5 minutes. If you disable them you shouldn't have any problems. Overall Batman Arkham City is  an awesome game and is definitely in the top 10 beat 'em games  of all time.

There are a few spots in the game that can be headache inducing, but once/if you know how to flow in combat, its easy. The only thing that makes this a longer game is the side quests.

Arkham Asylum before it was a breakthrough game and really made you feel like you were Batman. This game expanded on that innovative formula but made it open world and it worked out very well.

I remember when this game was about to be released in 2012 and I was waiting to get on it my Playstation 3 after loving Arkham Asylum. I was blown away back then and playing it again on Steam a few years later was still just as enjoyable. I highly recommend Arkham City as the best game in the Arkham series with Arkham Asylum as a close second.

Be the Batman - Let's be real, who wouldn't want to be the Dark Knight? In Arkham City, you get to live out your wildest superhero dreams and take on some of the most iconic villains in the Batman universe.

The Voice Acting - Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as the Joker? Enough said. The voice acting in this game is top-notch and adds an extra layer of immersion to the already engaging story.

The Combat System - The combat system in Arkham City is smooth, intuitive, and downright satisfying. You can take on multiple enemies at once and chain together combos for some truly epic takedowns.

The Gadgets - Batman has a seemingly endless supply of gadgets at his disposal, and using them to take down enemies and solve puzzles is just plain fun.

The Open World - Arkham City is an open-world game, and it's a blast to explore. There are tons of hidden secrets, easter eggs, and side missions to discover, making it a game you can sink hours into.

The Story - The story in Arkham City is compelling and well-written, featuring twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Plus, the game's portrayal of the Batman-Joker dynamic is nothing short of iconic.

The Atmosphere - The dark, gritty atmosphere of Arkham City is perfect for a Batman game. It feels like you're really in Gotham City, and the game's attention to detail is impressive.

The Rogues Gallery - Arkham City features a wide variety of Batman's most notorious villains, including the Joker, Two-Face, the Penguin, and more. Taking them down one by one is immensely satisfying.

The Challenges - If you're looking for a challenge, Arkham City has plenty of it. From the game's notorious combat challenges to the Riddler's fiendish puzzles, there's always something to test your skills.

The Batcave - Who doesn't want to explore the Batcave? In Arkham City, you get to do just that, and it's a blast. Plus, it's a great place to upgrade your gadgets and prepare for your next mission.",1677706314,1677706314,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat feels great and it feels like you're a badass even though you're left clicking 90% of the time and right clicking when you see a blue warning icon pop up. Story was good but there is an urgency to it which makes pursuing side missions even harder as you have to snap yourself out of the main story loop to help catch some other villain.

 The collectibles/achievements are just there to lengthen the game for people that enjoy wasting time and provide little to no actual value to your playthrough. Other than that, it's a pretty solid game that will give you about 10 hours of fun, it's short but it rarely feels that way in the stealth sections where you have to take one guy out, AFK for 10 minutes while the other guards come together and then split up again, rinse and repeat. The worst offender is batman sometimes blocking instead of doing a stealth takedown that alerts enemies that made my blood boil around the 6 hour mark and it just soured the complete experience until the end sequence.

 This game -as I've said- improves over its predecessor (Arkham Asylum) but falls short in other places considerably which balances it out at the end for an OK game.",1677346289,1677346289,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics are amazing, I find the environment very fascinating, there's tons of detail, and you can explore every part of it. 
The story seemed okay but I stopped after 6 hours as you can see, because of gameplay reasons.

The gameplay is a shitshow. Gliding feels clunky, because it's mouse controlled. Combat and Stealth is greatly improved but still not perfect. Blade dodges don't seem to work, interesting to see a bug still in the game after 10 years of it being out. Every action seems more responsive now that I think about it. But it falls behind in other areas. Whilst I'm grateful there's no more Scarecrow, well, yet. I am frustrated by the fact that some boss fights and side missions are so poorly designed. Like they are tedious and hide information from you constantly. I got stuck on Penguin thinking there was some strategy to take him out, like I can run up to him through brute force and punch him. Nope. You have to find a gun to disable his gun, then run up to him, then take him out. ????????????? This is dumb. Missed opportunity too, to do something revolutionary. 
The open world exploration is okay, but again has this ""Keeps information from you"" stuff. I get confused why I can't collect some riddler trophies. 
So after having quite a few deaths in the game for different reasons, I realized some big flaws. Before Penguin, there's this ice bridge section, and holy shit this was not tested at all. This section is buggy and quirky, which don't mix. It's so dumb. And given that it's a one shot kill if you fall into the water, it's really bad game design. 
Even worse than this, I got to the section where you have to scan robots to get to Ra Ghul? or something? I did that last night, and found out how they got through the door. I leave the game there, and quit. Come back this morning, game didn't save. Apparently I have to do all that again. This is a flaw with a checkpoint save only system. This is just shit. Terrible. On top of the game being widely inaccessible too, lacking settings that could help players who can't necessarily play as well as others (I have timing issues and meltdowns), it was clear that this isn't a good quality game. 

As usual though, I approach these types of games with an open mind, but I just can't see this being any good. I've played games for over 18 years, so I understand what makes them good and what quality of life features they need, as well as accessibility. The Batman series lacks everything. It's a waste of talent. I'm not looking forward to trying Arkham Knight which is next for me to play.",1675846676,1675846676,False,1,0,0.482259243726730347,0,True,False,False

1st time that i played this was on demo mode and it was on other platform and i didn´t understand the story mode a lot.
The story mode is amazing. there´s a lot to explore and it was one of my first arkham franchise i played and became one of my favorite arkham games. 
About the graphics they are insane and open world mode is so much more open and the game is much bigger.
If i wanted to repeat the story mode again i wanted to challenge myself to end the story in 1 week/month.
Kevin Conroy & Mark Hamill reprise their roles as Batman & The Joker, and they play off of each other as brilliantly as they always do.

- Gliding, particularly where it is required for objectives (AR training, Ra's Al Ghul main quest). Game brought down some by bad platforming mechanics. It can be useful to watch a youtube walk through on when to dive/end dive rather than try to follow path indicated in game.

There's a lot more to explore, a lot more to do, including a ton of awesome missions & honestly a few too many Riddler Trophies, but I can totally overlook that because at the end of the day this game is a masterpiece and I'm having a BLAST!

You know that thing where in the last game you probably spent 99% of your time running around Arkham Island with Detective Mode ON at almost all times to pick up secrets and solve puzzles? Remember how that made the textures look worse, it made everyone look like skeletons & it put a blue filter around everything? Arkham City gives you incentive to turn OFF Detective Mode a little in a fistfull of situations. For example, when you're gliding around the city, you'll probably turn Detective Mode off because then you'll be able to see the guide arrow pointing you to your destination. This gives you much more incentive to look around and enjoy the sights of Arkham City & appreciate the love poured into the fine details in the graphics & Easter eggs.

Kevin Conroy & Mark Hamill reprise their roles as Batman & The Joker, and they play off of each other as brilliantly as they always do. The story is fantastic, but in truth I do have one concern about it: Apparently, a large section of Gotham has been closed off and a bunch of criminals have been left to their own devices with no government to watch over them or hold them accountable for their actions. I'm sorry - who exactly thought that would be a good idea? The fact that these criminals wouldn't be able to organize their own Fire Dept within Arkham City alone would make this a blatantly terrible idea if executed in real life. I would absolutely go so far as to say the whole premise feels very contrived. Still, Arkham City is a very fun playground for Batman, the city feels as dangerous as it should, and contrivances aside, the story is otherwise fantastic.

Arkham City is a gated-off part of Gotham that was made into a maximum security prison (basically like Manhattan in Escape from New York). The world isn't very big but it basically functions as an open world with side quests and collectibles while the main quest sends Batman around the map to explore the interior ""dungeons"".
This is the main difference in design compared to Asylum, which was more of a metriodvania where the exteriors functioned as a hub. Sure the hub had some collectibles, secrets and fights, but you spent the absolute majority of the time in the different interior levels. In Arkham City, you spend the majority in the open world (at least if you do the side quests).
When it comes to combat it's basically an improved version of the one in Asylum, which is great. The only thing that annoyed me was not being able to cancel takeout animations if someone is attacking me. It's like Batman has the reflexes of a bat except when he's in the middle of finishing someone off. Then he needs 5 seconds where he can't interrupt what he's doing. Otherwise, the combat is extremely fluid and responsive.
I also love the fact that the stealth gameplay isn't slow. It feels just as great as in Asylum to quickly jump down, take someone out and then disappear leaving the rest scared. But I think Asylums level design was better at encouraging stealth while City favored brawls a bit more. The open world also doesn't feel designed with stealth in mind but this is also somewhat true for the dungeons. Compared to Asylum, City's dungeons are more focused on complex ways of traversal with gadgets and then rooms with brawls, than the methodical hunting Batman does in Asylum. The mechanics are there though, this is just my experience of the level design.
My big gripe with the game is that the story isn't written in a way to encourage exploration since Batman is always on a literal timer in the story (not mechanically but narratively). As I was playing the main quest I found no motivation to stop and do silly riddles while Batman/Gotham was on the verge of death/collapse, it just didn't make any sense to me. So I finished the main quest and put the game down but after a week I felt the need to return and do the side quests. It was nice that the game allowed me to return after the credits and story wise I still think it makes sense for Batman to tie up the loose ends.
The side quests themselves were fine. Some endings hinted towards a sequel (Mysterious Watcher and Identity Thief) so it'll be interesting to see if they are resolved in Arkham Knight.",1674816378,1674816378,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game takes everything that was good in Arkham Asylum and improves it so much. The movement is smoother. The fighting is better. The environment is bigger. The Riddler challenges are more varied and harder. 

This is THE Batman game. You don't need to be reading this review to know that - you already know that. I could rehash things people have already said but it really is as good as they say it is. I was itching to get home from work and continue playing this game. It looks great, the voice acting is great, the story is great, it just feels so complete. 

Pros:
Looks beautiful. Arkham City is gorgeous. The lighting is so atmospheric and it is easy to navigate the map due to in-game signage.
Arkham City is big enough to feel real but not so big that it's oppressive. As someone who is burned out by modern, gigantic open worlds, it is the perfect size.
So many types of challenges! You can do the flying  challenges (NOT RECOMMENDED; they are impossible), save political prisoners, team up with Bane, team up with Dr. Freeze, whatever you want. You can investigate crime scenes, race across the city, interrogate mooks, whatever you want.
YOU FEEL LIKE BATMAN FOR REAL MAN. WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY ABOUT THAT.
Voice acting is immaculate. Mark Hammill as the Joker is unbelievable. He tops himself in the previous game, somehow.
Introduces new characters not in the previous game, like Ra's al-Ghul and Solomon Grundy.

Cons: 
Story is convoluted as hell. I think if I played through it agaian I would ""get it"" more but there is so much going on at once and so many characters.
The postgame is simultaneously too long and not long enough. Once you burn through fighting the extra villains it's just you and 400 Riddler trophies. This sucks.
Playing as Catwoman is kind of terrible. There, I said it. The climbing is not great. The combat is hard because she's much more fragile than Batman. 
I hate the way every female character in this game has her boobs out and walks like has as stick up her backside.

A classic! My critiques are mostly just nitpicking. This game rules.

Players take on the role of Batman as he battles his way through several of the enemies in his rogues gallery in order to stop them from taking over Arkham City. 

Like Batman: Arkham Asylum, the game features an open world environment that allows its players to explore and interact with many of its inhabitants as they progress throughout the story; however, this concept has been heavily expanded upon in Batman: Arkham City. For example, the difference between the two games' map sizes is staggering! This is because Batman: Arkham City has given players a much larger area to play in, and with all of this new space comes loads of hidden Easter eggs and collectibles for players to find.

Because of this, I cannot praise the exploration element of this game enough! I mean, there is so much content in this game that it has taken me actual days to get through it all; and I still feel like playing because there are still things that I have yet to experience! It's amazing!

But, with such a big map, you may be concerned that traversal will be a chore. Let me reassure you that this could not be further from the truth. I mean, I could not express to you in words just how much fun I had gliding around the city as Batman! And although the gliding mechanics were changed only slightly, it felt like such a major upgrade from Batman: Arkham Asylum. I really liked the addition of the grapnel boost upgrade (which allows the player to continually glide by using the grapnel gun to boost themselves from an object into a continual glide).

Obviously the graphics in Batman: Arkham City are stunning, with detailed environments and characters that bring Gotham City to life. It is very unlikely that you will not enjoy spending time traversing throughout the city.

The only thing that seemed to miss the mark were the collectibles. Maybe it's just me, but hunting for the Riddler's trophies is just so gosh darn boring. Sure, the first few times you solve his new puzzles it feels exhilarating and fun! But after the three-hundredth trophy you start to realize that things are becoming a bit...repetitive, to say the least. Still, they added a reason to explore the city, and they provided cool rewards like: concept art, character models, and more!

But, if you aren't one for collectibles, don't worry! The game also features a variety of fun side missions that add a lot of depth to the overall experience.

Now let's talk about the game's combat system. Players of Batman: Arkham Asylum probably noticed how similar the free flow combat systems in both games felt, but I think that Batman: Arkham City enhanced the experience just enough that it did not feel like a boring copy and paste from one game to another. Between making the combat feel smoother and the combos more skill dependent the game's combat felt like it had been significantly upgraded from it's previous version.

""Batman: Arkham"" series is just that good. Each one of those games are similar in term of core mechanics but they have own personal pros and cons making them unique from each other with no way of picking ""the best one"" out of all of them:



===============================================



☆Batman: Arkham Asylum

Pros:

+spooky and chill atmosphere of crazy asylum

+everything Scarecrow related

+not ""too scary"" but ""ok"" amount of collectibles and puzzles (collectibles that give you both experience points, healing, challenge maps and bonus in game content)

+very entertaining ""Joker"" DLC (only available on other platforms than PC but there is way to mod it in on PC) 

+rest of DLC's challenge maps is alright too

+not many of them but bosses and mini-boss fights are good enough for the first game in the series, I have nothing to complain about here



Cons:

-the smallest and least dense map out of all Arkham games in term of side content

-the weakest combat out of all Arkham games because of slowest animations ever, least amount of combat gadgets and least amount of ways to take down people

-predator sections feels a bit too slow with not enough ways to take down goons after playing other Arkham games 

-zero side activities beside collectibles which are not even that cleverly hidden

-no fun Riddler puzzles that require gadgets to solve

-very small amount of unique challenge maps



===============================================



☆Batman: Arkham City

Pros:

+bigger and more dense map than in Arkham Asylum

+improved roaming, gliding and exploration

+more NPC's to interact with

+way, way better and way more boss fights and mini-boss fights 

+extra fun side missions

+way more good and unique challenge maps and unlockable bonus content

+4 unique playable characters and lots of extra skins

+Catwoman mini story DLC was ok



Cons:

-story and motivations of few characters in this game are the least coherent out of all Arkham games

-side missions ""Acts of Violence"", ""Cold Call Killer"", ""Identity Theft"", ""Shot in the Dark"", ""Watcher in the Wings"" are often hard to progress on your own without a guide because the game expects you to just randomly find very specific locations and characters while traveling across the map

-Harley Quinn's Revenge was garbage DLC with no interesting mechanics, ideas, boss fights, story or gimmicks



===============================================



☆Batman: Arkham Origins

Pros:

+not only bigger and better map but also snowy

+both story and overall dialogue is the most entertaining and engaging out of all Arkham games

+new Remote Claw gadget (that replaces Line Launcher) is very fun to use and allows you to do for way more stuff than crappy Line Launcher. Not only more utility in both combat and predator but also in exploration. Screw Line Launcher - Remote Claw all day all night, BABY!

+Electric gloves aka Batman's Devil Trigger are way too fun in use

+even more unique and better boss and mini-boss fights. Hands down the best out of all Arkham games

+fast travel

+better ranking system encouraging you to fight better for more bonus experience points

+enhanced detective mode and lots of special missions using it

+you are not fighting only prisoners for a change but also corrupted cops

+even more unique side missions

+not as many challenge maps as in Arkham City but still a lot

+3 unique playable characters on challenge maps

+multiplayer mode (its kinda dead at this point but overall quality and gameplay of this mode was very good and fun)

+both ""Cold, Cold Heart"" and ""Initiation"" DLC's are very, very good



Cons:

-definitely the most glitchy out of all Arkham games, yet nothing game breaking like crashes or anything that would cause Game Over or corrupted saves or progression block

-few examples of bugs: sometimes you will just miss, get hit or lose combo for no reason or due hitboxes nearby walls, sometimes the room or texture may no load correctly (restart fixes that), there that one floor in open world that loads way too long so you can clip thru it and fall down into water but you never need to go there, that goofy ""the dark room"" in ""Cold, Cold Heart""...

-very weird facial animations during character conversations during in game cutscenes, mostly noticeable while talking to Alfred



===============================================



☆Batman: Arkham Knight 

Pros:

+not only bigger and better map but also rainy

+Batmobile gameplay (driving around, puzzles, combat, pursuit, racing sections) is just WAY too fun

+Batmobile may be the most smooth and responsive controlled ground vehicle I had ever used over the past 30 years of my gaming life

+finally Batman can chill out inside a police station

+graphically the best out of all Arkham games with even more animations and extra details

+Arkham Knight was a really flesh out and entertaining character, despite (sadly) not being on screen very often 

+character that appears during [spoiler]hallucinations[/spoiler] later in the game is definitely the most hilarious part of this game (no, I am not talking about [spoiler] Batman or Arkham Knight [/spoiler])

+each previous Arkham game had a very good end game sequence but Arkham Knight end game sequence is just amazing

+huge number of collectibles and stuff to do 

+lots of side quests and side activities, good DLC's

+8 playable characters in challenge maps

+overall the biggest amount of in-game content out of all Arkham games



Cons:

-a proper final boss fight is replaced by a set piece for some reason. Its a good set piece but I would rather have another Joker Titan boss instead.

-detective aspect of Batman Arkham games is basically and completely gone here

-repeating some races and other challenges is really annoying just because you have to spend few extra minutes to go back to previous point. Was that hard to implement quick restart prompt?

-the game is constantly hammering you hints for the simplest in-game puzzles every few seconds like the the target audience of this M rated game and long Arkham franchise fans was 8 year olds BUT funny enough the game doesn't tell you where to find Freeze Blast gadget at all so its easy to miss

-some people may find this game way too big or overwhelming due amount of content, collectibles or batmobile sections (even tho I had no issue with it and Arkham City had had way more filler collectibles so its funny people complain about it in Arkham Knight)

-after fantastic amount of enemies and bosses in Origins.....this game decided for 10 steps back and just not bother with that at freaking all. 
Knight have weaker boss and mini-boss fights than previous City and Origins. 
Don't get me wrong: bosses in Arkham Knight are still good, fun and unique on their own but the game could do a way better job at their variety and number, especially after so many of amazing boss fights of Arkham City and Arkham Origins.
Heck, Batman: Arkham Knight had so many moments when you think you are gonna fight a boss, especially at the end of each side quest, and then...........nothing. 
Big nothing. A cutscene where you punch a villain and its over. Garbage!
On top of that the game screams for at least two more melee combat fights against Arkham Knight in the middle of story just so it can build up the character a bit more. 

-you better have a STRONG PC to run this game at 60 fps and max settings



===============================================



☆Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate

Pros:

+it may be fun to play with enough booze and friends around



Cons:

Don't even bother touching that sh*t
It's a huge waste of time and money

The story is amazing and it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The characters are so well written and Kevin Conroy (RIP) and Mark Hamill once again masterfully voice two iconic characters. Finding all the batman easter eggs was a treat, even for someone like myself who isn't too knowledgeable in the lore of batman.

The gameplay is once again fluid and it's a ton of fun using batmans gadgets in many different ways.

This game improves upon everything to love about Arkham Asylum. While the graphics and combat system aren't as fully developed as they would be in the console version of Arkham Knight that I own, it also functions properly for the most part. I've only encountered a couple of glitches on my most recent play through. One in the bell tower as Batman fell through a barely rendered floor between loading but the game refreshed itself quickly and went into the cut scene with no further problems. Later in the museum when Freeze's suit is still on display, I had a Riddler henchman spawn. I saved him for last and cut him off before he snagged a hostage, but as I clicked to Interrogate the henchman fell over the guard rail and left Bruce holding his right hand in the air as if stealing Big Show's choke slam taunt while waiting for Jason to present him an award for Father of the Year.",1672748870,1672748870,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

STORY: Probably the best story in the whole series. It is interesting and keeps your attention. The villains are well written and they are woven into the main story very nicely. The side missions are good ( could have been expanded on). The main story is a bit short so take your time playing, do a bit of the main story and then work on side missions. 

GAMEPLAY: A big improvement from Batman Arkham Asylum. Combat is smooth and flows nicely. It does not have the best combat in the whole series but its very enjoyable. My biggest complaint is it a huge button masher. Thought my controller and hands would fall apart so get ready for that. (could also be how I play so hmmm) I didn't experience any issues like frame rate drops or bugs (RX 3080).

GRAPHICS: Textures wise, looks very good. Sharp and clean. In terms of the character design, some of the thugs are so ugly. Like ugly ugly. Batman looks good but I think the face modeling for a lot of the main characters falls a bit short. It is an older game so keep that in mind while playing.

VERDICT: You will not be disappointed playing this game. The ending hits you hard, like you will have emotions you didn't even know was there. When the credits play, do not skip it. Watch the whole thing.",1672428686,1672428686,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With an amazing story, engaging characters, some of the best boss fights in video game history (mr. freeze were looking at you) Not to mention this game truly brings you in and really makes you feel as if you're in the batsuit with all the gadgets and combos you have at your disposal. One thing I really want to point out is just how much content is in this game: with a ng+, a dlc story, over 275 trophies and over 125 challenges you have hundreds of hours of batman content. This game will forever hold a special place in my heart.

batman: arkham city is a 2012 action/adventure game developed by rocksteady studios. one thing i originally said about arkham asylum when i completed it earlier this year was that it didn't age as well as it could've, and while arkham city is a direct sequel, it was released only about two years after arkham asylum and it still was able to GREATLY improve on asylum's gameplay and as a result, holds up wayyy better today than asylum does. arkham city as a setting was awesome and a great upgrade over the more linear asylum setting in the first game. the atmosphere is top-notch and there are plenty of landmarks all over the map, which is very highly detailed. just like how the setting is memorable, the characters/villains you deal with are also great. everything here is just a massive upgrade over asylum, even the scarecrow levels from arkham asylum are clearly upgraded in this game, just given to a new villain and with new challenges/gameplay mechanics. the combat is obviously great, even better than it was in asylum. i started my blind playthrough on hard and while it got pretty hard at certain moments (specifically whenever when you fight a ton of enemies of varying types), there also are upgrades you can select that can make combat very easy even on hard difficulty. the mini bosses and boss fights are wayyyyy better than they were in asylum, and the stealth sections are super fun, somehow clearing a room full of armed guards is even more fun than it was in asylum. the catwoman portions, while brief, were still fun as a change of pace and were a great addition. the side content is also upgraded in arkham city, as again, there’s more to do and more variety. there’s cool moments throughout the game. the story is probably a weak point but it’s still pretty good overall, with good characters and tons of detail for even minor characters. overall, this was about as perfect as a sequel can be, it made all the bad stuff in asylum good, while also improving on everything that made asylum great in the first place. this was a very enjoyable completion experience and i am so excited to play arkham knight (and maybe arkham origins).",1671566973,1671566973,True,1,0,0.485011786222457886,0,True,False,False

The final game listed I cannot play because of the limitations of my pc. The first game in the package was a fun time but with a bunch of flaws. Arkham Asylum is a good game just short of great, but Arkham City could be the greatest superhero game of all time. Before diving into the gameplay it is important to talk about the games story. Bruce Wayne is trapped in a new super prison called Arkham City by a mad scientist named Hugo Strange. Hugo has figured out that batman and Bruce are one in the same as uses this information to fuel his plans. But first Batman must take out the Joker. Because Joker turned into a titan back in the asylum he has developed a deadly sickness. He then injects his blood into batman causing Batman to have this sickness. After that it is a mad dash to find the cure and stop Hugo's plan of initiating his plan of 'Protocol 10'. Although this plot sounds very simple it has multiple different threads that tie together.but the story never became convoluted. This allowed the game to have a story with a lot of depth without having to recap what happened every 5 seconds. The story never overtakes game play which is a very good thing in this situation because of how great the game play is. In this game you ARE Batman. You rythmically beat down foes with you fists and some gadgets, you stealthy take down enemies one by one by zipping up to vantage points and silently taking down enemies, and you glide around the city and use your grapnel gun to bring you to a ledge to fling you up into the beautiful Gotham night sky. The game play excells your fun into full gaming bliss. The graphics are also great too! Although I had to turn my settings down almost all the way the graphics still look amazing for a game that came out so long ago at this point. There is also a bunch of sides modes such as riddler's challenges, Harley Quinn's Revenge(Play this mode after beating the main game because it contains spoilers.), a collectible viewer, etc. For those looking for more of a challenge check out the new game plus. The side missions of the main game are amazing as well. I have completed all but four at the time of writing(The ones I haven't beat are the riddler side quest at 30% complete, the identity theft side quest at 50% complete, the AR training quest at 90% and the political prisoners in trouble side quest at 90%.)

One of the worst games, if you dont use/like a controller. The flying rat is an idiot. In a pack, he always attack the one with electric shocker and looses health. With gadget quickbutton he always stuns the weak enemy, not harder ones, no matter where you poit with the mouse. And the block system... It works perfectly with catwoman, but not with the ratman. He cant block knifes, no matter what i do and leaves the weapon behind, if i kill the thug, the destroy upgrade is done, help says 'z' is destroy, but no use. By the way buttons layout is not very good, some important buttons are out of reach and you cant remap it.
And the challenge maps... combat challenges are extremly hard. Its not a problem, if a game is good, thats why its called challenge. But is game system is bad, hard is just screw. Like here, where combos die very quickly. If there is no enemy next to you, the combo ends.

I am currently playing Arkham City on an Acer Predator Helios 300 with an RTX3060, which as of the date of this review is still considered a good, middle of the road GPU, and this game plays smoothly. Readers should note that there exists a mod on nexusmods.com for an unofficial HD texture update, although I myself haven't been successful in enabling the Arkham City Redux update using their built-in launcher. Even so, with  Rocksteady's unique graphical style, it's not a bad game to look at (think X-Box 360). Some of the flourishes seem a bit stiff (falling leaves, newspapers blowing in the wind), but otherwise Arkham City is still able to pull off an immersive and atmospheric presentation.

the gameplay is revolutionary for its time. it is definitely an improvement from asylum- much more fluid with more freedom and combos. there are endless amounts of ways to take down enemies, both in strategy and combos. the arkham combat system has undoubtedly left a major impact on video game combat, and despite its years it never gets old. 

the atmosphere encapsulates the essence of the gotham, there is so much detail put into every nook and cranny. Not a single piece of the city feels ""empty"", it is evident that the devs put their heart and soul into the creation of the environment. there is so much to explore, and the atmospheric storytelling is rich and interesting. 

the characters are all extremely accurate to their comic counterpart, especially that of joker, harley, catwoman and batman himself. the designs are gorgeous and suit their character so well- harley and catwoman's costumes here might be my favourite across all media. everyone has a unique moveset and feel to their combat, and not a single playable character has significantly better combat than the others.

the storytelling is nothing short of amazing. the foreshadowing in the beginning with [spoiler] the painting of cain and abel is absolutely genius, both a nod to the comic panels of the death of jason todd & the ending.[/spoiler] the ending is jaw-dropping. i was in shock and awe when the shot of [spoiler] batman carrying joker [/spoiler] was on screen. somehow hit harder than an actual movie.

Combat feels mostly the same but faster and with a tiny bit more of strategy to it thanks to the inclusion of new enemy types. The best and most noticeable upgrade is the one made to Batman's movement. Gliding all over the city without ever touching the ground feels great and makes moving from one place to another an enjoyable activity that prevents the need to rely on any kind of fast travel methods like many other open world games.

The completionist experience feels a bit worse than Asylum. I think 400 Riddler collectibles is a bit overkill, even if the map is bigger in this game. It's nice that you can actually catch the Riddler with your own two hands this time around (unlike Asylum) while also having to rescue multiple victims along the way but again, these are way too many trophies to hunt down.

The story is very solid, if anything because of the great sense of continuity it has right after finishing Arkham Asylum. It's another rogues gallery story, but everyone gets to have great moments and it's just a good time all around.

The DLC content included in this version of the game is also pretty good. Harley Quinn's Revenge gives some subtle foreshadowing of what's to come in Arkham Knight.",1667674160,1670716909,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a lot similar to Asylum, but with lots of new stuff added. Even the combat has been expanded, but the core element is still the same. The map is twice as large as Asylum, and feel a lot more ""open-world"" than its predecessor. Even the puzzles are twice as more intricate than the last (damn you, Riddler!). And last but not least, Batman won't be the only playable character.

Overall, not much is changed from Asylum. To be exact, it's more of perfecting the elements that made Asylum so great. You can simply jump straight to City since some of the in-game data sort of explained the event from Asylum, so you won't miss much.

Frankly, it's a lot better to only play City since it's basically an improvement from Asylum, the writing is better than Origin, and it doesn't have sort of unnecessary mechanic (I'm talking to you, Batmobile from Knight).",1670122334,1670122334,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Neither graphics nor function are dated in this classic. On the contrary, Batman AC is often the standard for many other games to achieve.

Though, IMO, Batman Arkham Knight does top this one, this second installment could arguably be the best (pre-Gotham Knights). It improves upon many of the mechanics of the first, while adding all sorts of freedom and new gadgets. Whether it is a merit or demerit is debatable, I find this one to be much for open than Batman AA. I was much less interested in pursuing Riddler til the end (though the conclusion is better than AA) and finishing half of the other side-quests in favor of just finishing the game.

The graphics are almost identical to AA, but now you have a whole city to explore! Combat is a little bit smoother, and you have a few more options are your disposal.

It takes the thrilling combat and stealth mechanics from [i]Asylum[/i], making improvements and expanding the story from the tightly linear plot of the first game into an open world mega-prison district. This allows one of the most key additions: improvements to cape-gliding, and the space to use it in, creating some really fun mobility-based gameplay.

It's hard to overstate how solid of a game this is. Even the complaints I have of it are fairly subjective: The Catwoman segments, while still fun, lag behind the main gameplay by the end.

Jokes aside, this is, in my opinion, the best Arkham game out of all of them. Origins was great, but has a bunch of bugs and completely wastes the potential of an interesting villain (not gonna spoil it, but if you've played, you know).  And Knight, although I've softened a bit on the game, is still probably the weakest due to a plethora of different issues (just to name a few- boring Batmobile fights, awful bosses and wastes of villains, Scarecrow is super boring (seriously, Asylum Scarecrow is best Scarecrow), and once again pulls the Joker card to get out of actually putting focus on Batman's other rogues).

City, in my opinion, is the height of the series. The gameplay from Asylum is improved in basically every way, with more enemy types, a NG+ mode, different characters for challenge mode, a bigger open world, and more varied, entertaining bosses. The story is great, and actually allows Batman's other villains, like Penguin and Hugo Strange, to contribute to the plot and have screentime without the Joker being tossed into the scene because ""He's the archenemy so it's ok to keep spamming him nonstop and putting potentially interesting villains into the background!"" The atmosphere is great, and it's really fun to fly around the city and just look at the scenery. The thug chatter is really entertaining, there's a lot of really cool sections, and as always, the voice cast does a great job. Get this game. 

One final section here, just to pay tribute to Kevin Conroy, who passed away earlier this month. It's a bit late, but I still want to acknowledge his incredible performance as Batman in not only this game, but in several different movies and shows over the years, starting in 1992. Ever since I first played Asylum all the way back in the early 2010s, he has always stuck with me as THE Batman. Rest In Peace.",1615593740,1669488171,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also one of the best versions of batman without a doubt.

The graphics are still good to this day. They are not realistic but it has that comic booky style which is lovely. Everything from the character designs to Gotham city itself (a small section of it but okay) is simply lovely.

Atmosphere? Man, this game definitely shows what Gotham City is like. Unlike any other media, this time you are in Gotham City, although a small section of it, and this means you can explore every inch of it which shows how much developers put their love into it. Art deco buildings are everywhere, there are neon lights illuminating the streets. The backdrop of the prison shows the rest of Gotham city and you feel intimidated by huge skyscrapers. Also, it is middle of the winter and the weather is snowy.  And IMO, there is no better setting than winter and snow (or rain) for any batman story. We are in this city prison called ""Arkham City"", and at every turn, there are thugs, and big baddies (Hugo Strange, two-face, Penguin, Mr. Freeze, riddler, etc.). Once the game starts it shows you how dangerous this prison is. You are trapped inside this prison with no way out. This prison is alive, you hear the thugs while roaming around the city and they react to the events that happened in the story, they have their own opinions which makes them individuals despite almost looking copy of one another. It is simply fun to stop and listen to what they talk about. 

As for the story, it is just so good. The way the story makes batman face every baddie in his gallery is so good that you don't even stop and think ""wait how is that related to the plot right now?"". 

As for the gameplay, you FEEL like Batman. The combat is amazing, it is easy to learn but hard to master. There are multiple gadgets you can use during fights and when you master the combat, boy it is just perfect. 

Lastly, the voice acting in this game is superb. Kevin Conroy is the definitive Batman and Mark Hammil is the definitive Joker IMO.

A well deserved GOTY title I might say. [/h1] 

Batman: Arkham City is what happens when you take a good superhero game and try to make it open world, and I'd say Rocksteady did a pretty good job.
They took what made Arkham Asylum great and then added some more to their formula.


[h2]Pros: [/h2] 
[list]
    [*]A good sized city with a lot of exploration options.
    [*]The Freeflow combat system, which is extremely satisfying as you rack up those combos.
    [*]A very well written story.
    [*]Creative side quests.
    [*]Top notch voice acting that includes veterans like the iconic late Kevin Conroy (RIP), Mark Hamill, Grey Griffin, Tara Strong, Nolan North and many more.
    [*]Great immersive soundtrack by Nick Arundel and Ron Fish.
    [*]Great boss battles that require you to actually think and change tactics.
    [*]Puzzles, riddles, you name it.
    [*]The arena/challenge mode can be fun.
    [*]Some of Robin's gadgets like the shield spice up the way you play in the Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC.
    [*]The game can easily run on any potato specs computer.
    [*]You can always listen to the thugs trash talking you then watch their heart rate skyrocket as you beat them up.
[/list]

[h3] Cons: [/h3]
There aren't many of these and I'm probably nitpicking;
[list]
    [*]Some of the Riddler's collectibles can be a pain to get.
    [*]Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC is pretty short imo.
[/list]

[b] TL;DR: This is the best Batman game of all time and everyone should at least experience it once. [/b]

200260,50657080,76561198020414098,0,37,660,0,660,1557928333,"Arkham Asylum is a perfect example of a game where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  While the combat and stealth were both merely okay, the level design, exploration, and atmosphere (helped greatly by some of the best voice acting ever in a game) elevated the game to greatness.  Doubly so if you like Batman, and who doesn't like Batman?  The only problem I had with the game (besides the mediocre combat and stealth) was that the game forces both combat and stealth encounters on you, rather than letting you choose how to tackle each problem.

Arkham City adds pretty much more of everything—a much larger map, more optional content, more upgrades, more gadgets—but strangely makes hardly any improvements the core combat and stealth mechanics.  There are some new enemy types and other new wrinkles, but you will be doing pretty much the same thing in every combat or stealth encounter from the beginning to the end; this is a problem since you already did this for 20+ hours in Arkham Asylum.
[hr][/hr]
Unfortunately, the game falls behind Asylum in two key areas.

The first is level design.  The tightly designed environments of Asylum are here replaced with a sprawling city in which 99% of the buildings are just things for you to sit on.  On top of that, the few structures that you can enter are pretty boring and very linear.

The second area in which City falls behind Asylum is the length of the game.  Asylum was a pretty meaty game with a story that would take you anywhere from 15-20 hours to complete; in contrast, City has a story that can be completed in 10 hours. It does have TONS of optional stuff to do, so if you love seeking out side missions and slowly filling out lists of optional content, character models, etc., City might be your game.

However, if you (like me) are not interested in optional stuff and want to play City as the sequel to Asylum, you might be quite disappointed when you reach the end (including a final fight against a boss that comes out of nowhere).

As amazing as Arkham Asylum is, City improves on its gameplay and level design in almost every single way.  The combat is faster, the enemies have a lot more variety to them, the boss battles are amazing, and it's just a perfectly paced game on top of all of that.  (Also, Catwoman.)

For me it's ALMOST a toss-up whether or not City or Knight are the best Arkham game.  (Asylum isn't far behind either of them, and Origins is actually somewhat underrated but not quite as good.)  All in all I think that Knight has a slight edge for having the Batmobile and some of the best level design out there.

It's just right.. then within the story you have to detect things, sneak up on enemies, find riddles, connect the dots
in short the game mechanics of this game are a 10 out of 10..setting up keys is outside of the game, which is a bit unusual and they fixed that in the sequel, other than that I find it a highly fun game.

I was blown away by how well this game holds up more than ten years after release. As an experience, it easily tops 99% of all modern titles both in the genre and outside it, including, unfortunately, the sequel.

If you are reading this and you haven't played any of the games in the Arkham series or perhaps you remember this game faintly from having played it a long time ago, do yourself a favour and play through it again. For me, it served as a reminder of what serious effort and talent in game-design and storytelling feels like.

The story is emotional, deep, gripping, full of twists, always a sense of urgency and the gameplay is infinitely improved from Arkham Asylum which itself was great. The boss fights are fluid, the world feels more alive though the atmosphere is not as great or haunting as Asylum's, fun as hell, only I skipped like 85% of the side missions, the main story is excellent. Challenging as hell too. But the Catwoman bits were the death of me : ) I though they were boring & distracting and dragged an otherwise fantastic game.

As someone who has played and beaten all four games in the series (if you count Origins, made by a different developer), I highly recommend this game.  But here's my recommendation:

1. Play Arkham Asylum first.  It's the oldest of the games, but it plays well, the story is excellent, and it's a good introduction to the series.  The story of Asylum leads well into Arkham City's story.  
2. Play Arkham City.  The game's story is one of the best in the series, and the characters are fleshed out and true to their comic-book counterparts.  The large Asylum in the first game is replaced by a larger section of Gotham, and the roster of villains and allies also expands.  Catwoman is also a playable character. 
3. Optional: Play Origins.  It is fun but is more of a prequel.  Still fun, but different developers, and the story isn't as good or faithful to the comics/animated shows.
4. Play Arkham Knight.  The PC port was atrocious on launch but has been patched and really finishes the franchise well.  More playable characters, Bat-tank to drive through Gotham, and a full city to explore. 

Overall an excellent franchise with a compelling story.  And the Steam sales for this series are great.

There is one problem however, but it is a steam related issue. Achievements half the time are achieved and sometimes not. I don't know why but even after 100% completion I don't have the basic achievements that every play gets like 5 minutes into the game

This is one of the best atmospheric games ever created! This game is from times, when men had chest like a barrel and women were pretty and they knew what to wear. Yes those times. Exactly!

So men are manly, women are womanly, punches hit hard, villains do bad stuff and the only way to solve it is by hitting them repeatedly over and over again. Yes I know the perfect world! Yes, everything makes sense. No grey zones, no middle grounds, simple solutions, to simple problems.
When I played this game before some years, I did not appreciate it as much as I am appreciating it now. Everything around us is complicated now. Nobody knows what, who, where, why. We just know we had it wrong or at least this is what I hear.

I'm Batman.

Seriously though. It's an alright game. Main storyline is good but rather short. Lots of side missions, puzzles and challenges if you are the OCD type that likes a perfect game. Else if you're just looking to finish it once off, then yeah nah not for you.

Cons:
Fights aren't as hard as I thought it would be. Once you get use to the controls, its really all about patience and timing. Counter almost everything.

Seriously disappointed in the game as a whole. Any story it's trying to tell is vastly overshadowed by the absolute trash controls for key and mouse. most of the special attack combos do not work.  The characters tend to talk over each other, so any side story it's trying to tell is lost. Worst part of that is they put several side story elements in boss fights. 
The camera is very difficult to control and combat, when it works, is click click click, hope.


Having bought the G.OT.Y i got about halfway through ""Harley Quinns revenge""  and started finding major bugs in the mission.

Batman: Arkham City is one of the greatest games ever made and easily the greatest superhero game ever made. This is the perfect representation of Batman.
The voice acting is phenomenal with some of the most talented voice actors and actresses in the industry having a role within this games such as; Kevin Conroy, Nolan North, Troy Baker, Mark Hamill and Tara Strong to name a few. This game makes you feel like you are Batman kicking ass and taking names.

The chain of events that lead to the end of the story never fit and I played through the game twice and still had to read a synopsis to understand the story. At the end, I strongly felt that Batman mourned the wrong person’s death. Another story choice that baffles me. I did enjoy the side missions and Harley’s DLC.

Arkham City is beautifully detailed and filled with interesting locations. Gliding over the city and launching yourself into the air with a batclaw is very satisfying. Tracking down 440 Riddler trophies is not. Lastly, the amount of button combinations needed for all the quick gadgets, gadgets, jumps, slides, kicks, punches, counters, etc. was over the top.

The added catwoman sections are also pretty neat, since she plays a little different.

This game builds on every single mechanic in the original, heightens the stakes of the original story while still maintaining feasibility within its own comic-book world, and really delivers on a surprising and exciting finale. Same great atmosphere as Arkham Asylum, same mood for the soundtrack, and a good number of QoL improvements in how your tools are leveraged. This game plays very, very similarly to its predecessor, which isn't a bad thing at all. I do kind of cringe at the Catwoman segments, but I guess her characterization is just a product of the times. Dock a few points, but it's not a gamebreaker.

Now, a cynical take would be that this game is the result of the trend of open-world games infecting the Arkham series, and this is clearly not wrong, but I feel it misses the point that the previous entry was already excellent and that opening up the setting this way was a totally valid way to take the franchise forward. 

That being said, there's plenty of things here that also distinguish the game from many other ""open world"" games, specially the movement mechanics. Batman's ability to glide and move about is the glue that binds every other aspect that hinges on the open world and it works very well.

Additionally, many aspects from Asylum return, such as the sandbox arenas, the puzzle boss fights and the whole collectibles aspect courtesy of the Riddler. It's clear an attempt was made to include these elements and add a bit of flavor to them as to distinguish them from the previous entry. The result sometimes is a little too on-the-nose when it's gimmicky, but often the set pieces feel pretty fresh, despite the same underlying gameplay.

Returning also is the excellent atmosphere and visual design, along with greater graphical fidelity as expected.

Another interesting addition is the multiplayer component found in the extra stages which focus entirely on combat encounters. It's a nice side diversion but it highlights how this game is already pushing the combat system so far that the problems become apparent. Mind you, just like the previous game, the combat system within the context of the main campaign is perfectly acceptable, but as you play the extra missions it becomes clear that there's a lot of automation and it leads to a lot of the encounters feeling samey. Compare and contrast this to a game series like Devil May Cry, and you can see that the automation of the combat system, while impressive for what it is, ultimately makes a lot of the combat lack player expression.

But at the end of the day that's a minor nitpick in what is otherwise an excellent sequel to an already excellent game. Recommended.",1666039763,1666039763,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

Much like Sleeping Dogs, I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to hop back into this franchise. If you're a fan of open-world games and action combat, this game is 100% of you. Arkham's combat system has essentially laid the groundwork for any other similar minded combat system, and if you've played Spider-Man (2018) it's the same exact vibe.

With that in mind this story is also very unique to experience, though most of the game time for me wasn't in the story but was in the side missions. Side missions are great, but collectibles are tedious as any Arkham players knows. 440 riddler secrets is no mean feat, and not for the faint hearted. Not to mention the extra challenge maps.

Overall this is a good game to hop into for the open-world, story and combat.

Fear is a tool. They think I’m hiding in the shadows. But I AM the shadows. I wish I could say I’m making a difference, but I’m not. Murder, robberies, assault- 2 years later, they’re all up.

What'll you notice first is that game looks a LOT better, no longer does the game look like it's had a brown filter added to it. Everything has more color, is way more diverse and also has a lot more detail. The city feels alive, there are many more different locations than in Asylum and getting around is actually quite fast (even faster if you do the first AR mission for grapple boost). Some locations do feel a bit underused and I didn't feel it was optimized quite well. Usually ran about 120fps on Extreme but sometimes would dip to 30fps for no reason, even tracked CPU/GPU/RAM and weren't even close to being maxed.

Gameplay is much more interesting than Asylum. The combat actually becomes so much easier once you get the hang of all the combos (although some are very weirdly keybinded) and the upgrades feel like they actually bring something useful to the table. There are way more gadgets, some only used on specific puzzles/boss fights but sneaking around they do give you options. 

Platforming is way more fluent than the first game. It actually feels very natural, the grapple sensor is quite on point and the controls behave quite well. You'll still often roll into something when you mean to jump but had it happens far less than the first game. The gliding missions can be tedious as hell though, same goes for the controlled batarang.

There is way more content this time around, the main story is quite shortish but the secondary objectives, collectables, challenges and the game+ mode add some replayability so that's definitely a lot of content.

Again, the voice acting is top notch, Music wise there is nothing to complain about, it's all very well done. One minor complaint is towards the final part of the game where I felt that picking up the chatter from the choppers got a tad annoying.

The characters are very well designed. The taunts on death are even better now with more characters reminding you how bad you are at the game. I don't read the comic books, but get the feeling they stayed true to how they look. Catwoman and Harley are yummy indeed.

Now, I enjoyed the game very much but there are some very big complaints coming next.

The story is by far the weakest part of this game. It's a bit short but worse, it just doesn't make any sense.
So many things had me shaking my head thinking 'wtf'. 
[spoiler]No one seems to care Bruce Wayne gets tossed in jail, Batman gets poisoned but takes 4 months to bother getting the cure, ow nvm Joker has a clone now, catwoman hates plants, bad professor does bad things cause other bad guy told him but ow wait he's got a bomb,... [/spoiler]It's such a mess. Even when the game finishes, it felt like that's it? seriously?

Next is the Riddler collectibles. They were actually very well done in the first game. Not too many, just enough to make you bother collecting them all, with a little secret ending to reward you. Here, they expect you to go find 400 collectibles. They're easy enough to find but goddamn are the puzzles tedious as fuck. I gave up after throwing 40 batarangs in a pipe to get one trophy. Also the menu is a bitch to navigate so enjoy looking for hints. It gets sadder than one of more interesting side quests involving Riddler forces you to collect these or you can't advance the quest. That's just retarted.

Next part that annoyed me to no end. Sometimes for no reason, at least when play with controller, the game will start spamming both prompts. So for a grapple, it'll keep prompting 'F' and 'RMB', keyboard and controller prompts basically. This makes the game have a literal seizure and run at 5fps. But that's not the worst part, the worst part is having to restart the game completely to fix it. Which wouldn't be so bad if they didn't do what they did in the first game. Which is make you sit through another 30 secs of who made they game, ow look we used Bing Video and 10 secs of Nvidia being blasted in your ear. I restarted the game like 20 times over my 19 hour playthrough because the game becomes literally unplayable.

Ow and the game is called BATMAN Arkham City not BATMAN and some CATWOMAN Arkham City. I know she has some killer tits and an ass you wanna eat breakfast off but I didn't enjoy the gameplay as Catwoman. The Mad hatter part was dope tho.

Still, worth a buy. You'll get a lot of content, just don't expect an interesting story and hope you have less controller issues than I did and you might even enjoy the game more than I did.",1665455481,1665455481,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Despite the gigantic size I can still pinpoint which building is where on the map without looking at the waypoints which is a really impressive feat even 10 years later. The city is split into multiple districts and each are packed with riddler trophies to lose your sanity over. Like come on, 282? Not saying they aren't fun to collect, just wanted to point out the absurdity of the amount of trophies riddler somehow managed to place without being gunned down immediately by thugs. It's really impressive how many of batman's rogues gallery they managed to put in this game without feeling overbearing. Each character is pretty seamlessly woven into the chaos and it makes for really engaging foes despite their relatively miniscule role in the grand scheme of things. The sidequests are also really fun with many of them focusing on one of batman's most iconic villains. I would be lying if I didn't say that mad hatter's quest didn't caught me off guard, a call from Alfred claiming he found the cure batman has been looking for and to retrieve it on the rooftop of mad hatter's hideout. Seems a bit SUSpicious dont you agree? Then you wake up inside this nightmarish realm with a TERRIFYING bunny batman, like seriously I thought this would be a really simple side quest but no, it took a completely unexpected turn. The way the game handles each villain is fascinating and makes the otherwise goofy-looking evildoers actually menacing. Mr Freeze was a standout, he looks so silly and as someone who didn't watch the batman animated series growing up he sounded so random and wacky. But his arc in this game, with hsi tragic backstory and motivation, is heartbreaking. And I'm solely talking about his character because I found his fight really easy and disappointing (again my opinion I know a lot of ppl like this fight), brilliant stuff Rocksteady. The story is MUCH better than asylum too with more stakes and a more convincing motivation for batman doing what he does, though I feel the ""joker being clayface"" thing didn't really stick for me because if you didn't know the character prior to this reveal then it feels like a pretty out-of-nowhere plot twist. The game could've maybe had Clayface play a larger role because the only time hes mentioned in the game before the final fight (as far as I know) is in one of those riddler scans. Other than that, Arkham City is a sequel that improves on EVERYTHING that its predecessor did and is one of the few open worlds that doesn't feel daunting to explore. 9/10",1664089768,1664095351,True,7,0,0.541546046733856201,0,True,False,False

During the installation process, along with the DirectX libraries, another program will be installed called [b] AMD Dual-Core Optimizer [/b] which was meant to improve the performance on systems that run Windows XP and use old AMD Dual-Core CPUs.

On PCs that run Windows Vista and later and/or an Intel CPU, you won't need that program because it will impact the performance and cause other issues.

Unfortunately when you launch the game for the first time you don't get the choice to decline the installation of AMD Dual-Core Optimizer (that's why I left a negative review).
In order to stop that program from being installed, do as follows:

[i] If the program is already installed, you should uninstall it. Go to ""Programs and Features"", select ""AMD Dual-Core Optimizer"" and click ""Uninstall"" (perhaps it will take a while, do not cancel the process and wait); afterwords, reboot the PC. [/i]

    1) Go to the installation folder of the game (right click on the game title -> properties -> local files tab -> browse local files)
    2) Open ""installscript.vdf"" (right click -> open with -> use Notepad)
    3) Scroll down until you see the word ""AMD"", followed by a bunch of code between the two perpendicular { and } brackets; delete that portion of code, beginning from the word ""AMD"" to the last perpendicular bracket (note that you must leave the brackets on the left side and everything else)
    4) Save the file. Make sure you didn't delete anything that has to do with DXSetup, VCRedist_x86 and DotNetFx35
    5) When you're done, go to the ""Setup"" folder and delete ""amd_dc_opt.exe"" (this is an optional step, just to be safe)

If you've done everything correctly, when you launch the game the installation of AMD Dual-Core Optimizer won't start.

The story is richer, the map is bigger and we can engage different enemies and characters from the Batman universe in contrast to its predecessor.

But i have a complain, is for someone wanting to get ALL the steam achievements; the Riddler challenges are definetely a PAIN IN THE ASSSSSSS. My god, i suffer a lot. More than 100 hours to finish this, when completing the whole game (with the 400+ Riddler trophies) took me like 20 hours, tops. Even after playing New Game + (required for a couple of the achievements), still i may have spent 27/30 hours. The rest was just pain through these challenges. If you are not really good with the combat system (i mean, i was good enough for the main game, but for the challenges was something completely different), you are gonna suffer. A lot. It took me all of Batman's challenges, and maybe half of Catwoman's to make a mental checklist of movements to get the most points possible. Besides, you are probably gonna do twice or even thrice for some of the combat/predator challenges, since in the campaign challenges you have to ""repeat"" them, but with obstacles (if it wasn't hard enough). Definetely this was Satan's work, but i'm glad is over. Will wait some days before jumping into Origins, or i'm gonna have a stroke.

However, it was a transitional phase in my life, and I mostly went on hiatus from PC gaming, so this sat in my backlog. I'm now trying to clear some games out, and this was one of my top picks. How does it hold up all these years later, with rose-tinted memory of its predecessor?

One negative was just how unfocused and chaotic the story progression is. From the opening moments of the game, the story just barfs characters, flashbacks, lore, exposition, and comic book references, yet none of it feels in service to a greater narrative. It's the video game equivalent of celebrity name-dropping. They clearly tried to cover more of the Batman universe, but they've stretched themselves a bit too thin. I remember Asylum having a surprisingly compelling story with excellent progression, but this doesn't feel that way at all.

The game play is a similar story. It's structured like an open-world game, albeit with a relatively small open world. Throughout it are countless training missions, events, secrets, side missions, characters, collectibles, etc. If you've ever played one of those F2P mobile MMOs that just throws a bunch of stuff at the wall to see what sticks, that's what this feels like. Much like with those F2P games, I honestly think this game throws too much at you all at once. Ironically, if there's anything it gives the player gradually over time, it's the tools necessary to do everything. Hours into this game, I'm still unlocking new abilities needed to complete many of the challenges, which may sound like a good thing, but the game does a poor job of guiding the player through the progression. There are rarely ever tutorials, and when there are, they're almost never any good. There are also minimal indications of when something isn't yet accessible with the current set of abilities.

The level-up menus are so unhelpful that I never really know how to use the abilities I'm unlocking. Many of them are so situational that I just find myself pressing keys when prompts appear without having the time to read or understand them. In Asylum, it felt meaningful to unlock a new ability, and I generally understood the immediate impact it had on my ability to manipulate the game world.

I also think they did themselves a bit of a disservice when placing the main story missions in the open world. In fact, ""open world"" is maybe a bit misleading, because at least early in the game, there's a huge restricted zone up through the middle of the map, so it's basically a big upside-down U shape. This wouldn't be so bad if the story progressed linearly around the U before opening up the restricted zone for the late game, but the main missions seem to flip-flop between opposite ends of the map, so you're constantly having to traverse the entire perimeter, which ends up feeling like a chore. As if the designers couldn't help themselves, they even exacerbated this issue by introducing all kinds of silly ideas that conflict with this map layout. A perfect example is when you need to locate Mr. Freeze by monitoring temperature and following it to the coldest zone in the map. This sounds like a cool idea, except that the temperatures might lead you to the border of the restricted zone, and the place you get to might be all the way on the other side.

That being said, is this a bad game? Absolutely not. A lot of this inconsistency seems to stem from the fact that it's arguably one of the most ambitious games ever made. The fact that they stuffed so many little twists on what are effectively just prompts and quest triggers is technically impressive, and some of them do feel better than others. One that stood out for me was when interrogating Riddler's thugs. As part of a Riddler quest, you need to walk around, find groups of thugs, and take them all out except for a single designated informant, at which point Batman can lift them up by their throat and interrogate them. This serves 2 purposes: 1) show Riddler secret locations on the map; 2) when you've successfully collected enough Riddler secrets (which are themselves puzzles rather than just basic collectables), interrogating an informant will reveal the location of another hostage that will progress the Riddler story line. These functions should sound completely familiar to veteran gamers, but done in a unique way that integrates puzzles, secrets, and missions together, making all of them more compelling. Lots of the negative things I pointed out above are byproducts of the developer's efforts to go above and beyond in making compelling versions of common game tropes.

This last point is not so much positive or negative as it is subjective. I remember in the mid 2000s, there was this prevailing design trend of games becoming more forgiving and hand-holding, exemplified by games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare which popularized regenerating health. Only a handful of exceptions like the Souls series were praised for embracing traditional design. Thankfully, this dichotomy is much more nuanced in today's game design, with plenty of acceptance for games throughout the spectrum. This game may not have come across this way when it came out, but playing it in 2022, this game definitely has elements of the Souls school of design, in that many of the challenges and puzzles are quite difficult and opaque. This actually stands in stark contrast to the main missions, as well as the first game in the series, which was known for being a very straightforward and elegant brawler that was accessible to players of all skill levels. You can absolutely breeze through the main story missions in this game and ignore the optional challenges, but if you do attempt them, there are numerous challenges that expect you to master the very fine nuances of the physics system and gadgets. Personally, I don't love this. It's not so much the difficulty level that bothers me, but rather that the challenge prompts do a poor job of clarifying what players need to do. A good example is when the game teaches you to press the Ctrl key to dive while gliding, but fails to mention that letting go of Ctrl puts you back into a horizontal glide. I spent hours trying to complete stupid physics challenges that seemed impossible, until I searched for completion videos on YouTube and discovered that you can do crazy things like dive down and then pull up into a tight space like a tunnel or doorway, which is obviously very useful. I suspect many, if not most, players will breeze through much of the game not knowing that such advanced techniques are possible. However, for the right kind of player, having to discover these things through repeated tries and experimentation might be half the fun, so I think it was worth mentioning as a more neutral point.

To close out, I think this game has not aged as well as its predecessor. One of my favorite games is God of War 2018, and in many ways, Arkham Asylum felt like a precursor to that game. It was a very streamlined, approachable, exciting brawler with compelling narrative and just enough hints of open world design to make the experience more compelling than most linear story-driven games. In contrast, Arkham City almost feels like Arkham Asylum and Genshin Impact had a baby. Many of the core mechanics that worked so well in Arkham Asylum are present here, but the developer's attempt to make an extremely varied open-world experience with every Batman reference imaginable comes at the expense of focus. I spent hours coming to grips with the basics of this game, and now that I feel like I finally get it, I'm not as hooked on it as I was with Asylum back in the day. If you're looking to try this series in 2022, I would recommend starting with Asylum before deciding if you want more. Arkham City is different enough that it doesn't replace the former, and I think the former does what it does better.",1662341702,1662341702,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

•Pros: 
1. Great plot where Hugo Strange now runs a prison like city & Joker dying! 
2. Outstanding voice acting performances 
3. You get to glide, dive & grapple at the same time! 
4. You get to play Catwoman! 
5. There are side missions in the game!
6. Love the boss battles starting with Solomon Grundy, Ra's Al Ghul, Mr Freeze & Clayface! 
7. It was the first Batman Arkham game to be an open world! 
8. Love how you can double or triple counter thugs hitting you during combat encounters! 
9. Love the Beatdown move introduced in this game! 
10. Love both the Remote Electric Charge & Freeze Blast gadgets!

•Cons: 
The Main Story objectives were a bit short! 
Must Buy.

200260,120772018,76561198283228547,113,59,652,0,416,1660851766,"So far this game exceeds its predecessor, Batman: Arkham Asylum, by a long shot. From the fighting mechanics to its mobility mechanics, the mechanics of this game are just amazing. You will also have a wider variety of methods in which you can utilize to apprehend your opponents, and several more useful gadgets to play around with. The story is engaging, and the side missions are great and don't feel like they take away from the story's main focus. The way the characters are written makes you feel that much more immersed into the city of Arkham, and the environments really make you feel like its the end of times almost.

The fighting in this game is phenomenally gorgeous and fluid, almost making you believe that you could recreate these moves in real life. You will love how the fighting is so seamlessly easy that you'll go beat up random thugs on the street just because. The counters in this game are also very fun, and the knockout hits are brutal. Suffice to say, you will have a great time with the fighting in this game.

The movement/mobility in this game is fantastic, and you can move along either the city streets and allies or its rooftops with your grappling hook. Gliding feels very smooth, and there aren't many times where I feel that it is bugged out or feels wonky. Grappling to ledges and higher ground is easy and honestly very accurate if you know how to aim.

The gadgets are more of the same from the previous title, but with a few new additions that make game play new and exciting. These new gadgets come into play with The Riddler's many different puzzles throughout the city. Which brings me to...

The Riddler's puzzles in this game are very fun to complete. Some of them are infuriating, and you might just look up a YouTube tutorial to figure some of them out, but figuring it out on your own is an extremely rewarding feeling. A lot of them are just simple puzzles that can be solved in a minute or two, but some genuinely have me stumped. There are Riddler Trophies that are only accessible through playing as Catwoman, which are indicated as red Riddler Trophies instead of green ones that Batman can pick up. Piece of advice, upgrade to the Sonic Shockwave Batarang as soon as you can. It helps you in the long run.

The graphics of this game are still quite amazing even in 2022. They aren't anything jaw dropping, like some more modern AAA game titles, but these graphics still hold up and can keep you immersed in game play for hours at a time. The animation is pretty good too, only every once in awhile breaking immersion with very obvious clipping and such, but not often. 

The open world aspect of this game allows you to explore most everything, and there is a ton to explore here. Of course you could just simply follow along the main story line instead of engaging in side missions and Riddler Puzzles, but you would be doing yourself a disservice by not at least doing a few of them here and there. Besides, they give you EXP that you can use to gain an edge over your enemies in future missions.

Overall this game is fantastic and well worth the money, although, I would still personally get it on a sale, especially if the trilogy is available in that sale. Even though this game is over a decade old it still holds up in terms of story, game play, achievement, and more. I have found that this is an extremely fun game that pulls me in for hours at a time, always having me wondering what's coming up next. And I'm not even done with the game yet!

Now I am at the second visit to the steel mill to get the cure from Joker, and I spent forever trying to get the remote batarang to open a stupid door. Only to go on a gamefaqs forum and find out I was doing it the wrong way. Just moving through this game is infuriating. I don't care what any of these reviews say. This game makes you work WAY too hard in irritating mechanics mastery to get to the fun parts. It's more frustrating than it should be. Farther into the game, I stand by my rating.

Got 56% though this game and I still stand by my review, and to add even more irritation to the game, you can't proceed until you've solved the Riddler trophy mini-puzzles to get more hostages or additional side quests.
