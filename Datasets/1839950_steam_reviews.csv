A few shortcomings though, the game can feel like it forces you to save scum in certain scenarios. For instance, the enemy ai can rocket you from the fog of war without any way of predicting or preventing it besides reloading and being more careful. So the ai clearly have that typical advantage of not actually being blinded by fog of war so your just playing at their mercy. 

I started the game on realistic but holy hell dont do that. The aforementioned issue is exacerbated tenfold as any and all of your units become made of paper. and the ai become literal Terminators (lol) with that i mean they become insanely more tanky by a large margin, and will wipe out anything you send at them. Only my Abrams and the founders rocket unit with the javelin can stand a chance, Forget using any of your other units, especially your infantry which will die immediately in any gun fight since the enemy infantry are dialed up to eleven. But that was on realism difficulty, story mode if far more forgiving and beatable without losing your entire army in a single skirmish.

The story is not terrible, we could of got a lot worse, but instead we got a return to a style of story i haven't really seen since i was a younger. Just a story to be told with fun and challenging missions and a narrative to keep the pace going. Nothing too serious. I love all the optional objectives, makes the missions feel a lot more fun and getting some useful units or gear is always nice. 

Not sure how we are suppose to move around the map with limited supplies. I guess we are suppose to keep our army pretty small if we want to back track or go out of the way? No matter what i did i couldn't get enough supplies to do any of the objectives on the travel map. Much less travel to, say the integrator camp for the best upgrades. That was literally impossible. Idk maybe i didnt fully understand the system, i just keep selling extra vehicles for goodwill and the mission rewards would give me enough to move forward but any type of excursion out of the main path was not going to happen when you have 3 days of supplies and the main objective is 3 days supplies travel but that juicy integrator camp is also 3 days travel the OTHER way, what, do i have to sell my entire army off just to visit some out of the way side task? 

All in all its a fun game with potential, I hope they will add workshop to the game, it would be really great to see what kind of mods this game could inspire.

Its actually really fun and pretty good, but there are bugs that make it very very hard to recommend if you are a serious player. First is a relentlessly brutal mission system. This would not be so bad, but Auto saves go from frequent after finishing every major objective to, GG you get like 2 auto saves. Frankly I am stuck on like the third map and its not hard but I have saves and auto saves that set me back 20 or 30 minutes of progress. I Highly recommend save after every time you do something significant. Another thing adding onto this is that in the 3 main mission, you have cut seen fights, cut seen fights you can lose. Which means that the mission failed and you have to start over. These are optional fights but there almost no point in doing them because you have no control and there is a risk that you will lose whatever you have done between major objectives and doing the optional objectives. Finally the game is actually kind of buggy. This is by far not the buggiest day 1 game, but it becomes very obvious. Units can get stuck on each other because they are going around a corner. Units will be stuck holstering and equipping their weapon, I have seen it happen 7 or 8 times back to back. You sometimes just have to span movement button because fundamentally the units are just stuck on nothing or their path finding sends them not only the longest way but also the most enemy infested. 

The biggest thing that make me not want to recommend is the randomness. I enjoy some random aspects, missing 8 anti-tank rounds back to back forcing them to be resupplied is not something I enjoy. There is no way other than experience to increase accuracy but maxed units still have a fairly high chance of missing there target.

The game is fun, and realistically I am playing on Medium difficulty and trying to save as many units as possible. I usually go middle of the road between easy and hardcore mod so I usually do either Hard or medium mode depending on the setting available. But I highly recommend the first time going through the game play on store mode unless you are an expert tactical gamer. So I guess I will recommend, the game is actually fun and other than an inconsistent auto save system and extreme punishment on lower levels its not bad. Normal or Medium is what I believe most developers make as a their intended difficulty so if that is the case I believe they did a good job balancing so far nothing feels unfair but at the same time you will wish you had a Commissar to execute some of your men because I believe they are working with Legion with how often they miss.

Edit: I know why I have a love hate relationship with this game. This feels like Fallout Tactics, and This game is much more infuriating. In Tactics, love it or hate it, but you had like 4 units, and everything was balanced around that. Terminator however does not know how many units you have, You have extreme amounts of units to compensate. I can kill 700 units and they are still getting reinforcements. They will flat out say that They don't have reinforcements, yet they constantly have more units. If you could dry the forces it might get Easier but they are never drained, you will run out of bullets before they run out of men.

After playing some more of it and thinking more on it... I can't recommend the game. The game is simply too hard and is not challenging, but frustrating. I have like 8 squads of Militias, 2 of Infantry and 2 skirmishers. Militias are trash and you can't spend resources to turn them into proper Infantry or Skirmishers. So in reality I have to push with 4 units. I have like 8 vehicles but most missions I can't bring them in. You have no way to Replace units during a mission so if you loose too many Skirmishers or Infantry you have to pull them back and if you don't you will lose that unit forever. In any other RTS I would say okay, Do this and this and then it will be fun. This is almost like you are so pissed off that you can't help but continue. I mentions wanting to shot some of my men for their accuracy, Well it is just as bad if they are firing guns or tanks shooting rounds. You have 600+ enemies and 40+ enemy vehicles. You have such an absurd KD ration is that the best options is slowly push to your object hold make sure you get an ammo trailer and truck to pull it and just keep replenishing your troops ammo as you push, but don't get to bold because, while your AT misses every other shot (usually they miss 2 or 3 and hit Once), the enemy hits every shot unless you duck behind a building (even then the round just might get luck and go through it). Don't play unless you want a game so annoying that you can't help but play it. Also I turned this down from Medium to Easy or Story mode, and its better but the AI opponent is great at firing rockets at your tanks and just bad at everything else.

Edit 2: I love this game but I honestly can't recommend it. Every mission takes between 4-5 hours. And I think my biggest issue remains the path finding and accuracy of units. I am in mission 6 with 3 Abrams tanks and 4 BFV and I will watch as they miss every shot on an opponent tank despite 2 of the units being max level experience. If there was less randomness I think I could recommend the game. Usually I advocate for more randomness, but in this instance I believe that the randomness is almost too unrealistic. A M1 Abrams can hit a moving target at a range 2100 yards. If you were playing as movement or Cartel I might understand but the main faction is basically the last of the Military and highly trained yet they can not hit a target 20 feet away? Pathfinding isn't the worse but I really have issues how when a unit moves they keep moving for 3-5 seconds after you give another command. I will tell them to enter a building just then tell them enter the building they are next to and they run to the other building just to run back and Units look like like strings when they leave a building and don't stay together. Slytherine please fix path finding and the unit accuracy and I can actually recommend the game. I will concede I am trying to save every unit I can possibly save, but I like doing challenge runs and my challenge was to save as many lives and vehicles as possible. But the challenge should come in on difficulty level and not base mechanics of playing the game like movement and firing. I am at the point I can not trust my units to take on a target so I blob all my vehicles and just send them in to slowly pick apart the enemy.",1708665782,1708927958,False,0,0,0.511225461959838867,0,True,False,False

I haven't tested Skirmish or Multiplayer yet, so I can't comment on those. But the Campaign is a lot of fun,  if misleading. 

The Campaign is not a straight forward RTS, you don't build a base/units and try and sweep the enemy from the map. instead it plays a lot more like Jagged Alliance with a touch of Fallout: Tactics. Your ""Army"" is made up of units/vehicles you scavenge from the field or trade for from friendly settlements each unit levels up and can be further specialised with unique abilities and equipment load outs. 

Your supplies are finite and need to be carefully managed, it maybe awesome to have that M1 Abrams with a plasma cannon, but it's also going to cost a fortune in supplies to keep it battle ready. What this results in is you needing to make difficult decisions about the composition of your army,. You also can't do everything in every map, your choices will matter (at least they have so far) so you need to choose your objectives carefully and learn to live with the consequences.

You are a guerrilla force facing off against a far superior enemy with almost limitless resources. You don't get the luxury of being able to take everything for every situation, you need to be focus on modifying/enhancing the strengths of your army.
To that end the game gives the player a lot of freedom in just what that army's strengths are. There are many options with many different ways of customising them. You could have a very small but powerful force of high-tech modern units that cost a fortune to maintain and are hard to replace, but can hit like a sledgehammer and are too stubborn to die easily. Alternatively, you could create a highly mobile force of cheap/disposable vehicles that are specialised in ambushing and hit-and-run strikes or a Mad-Max style army of modified Semi-Trucks and trailers all heavily modified with scrap armour and as many guns as you can modify the chassis to fit.

Overall, Terminator: Dark Fate - Defiance will most likely appeal to those who enjoy games like Jagged Alliance or strategy games that include a focus on Logistics and Strategic Army Management.

It's a terminator game in the ambiance of a different timeline I'm not used to, but that isn't the issue here. The issue is that the first four missions are a struggle (was playing on hard), but I felt there was something more I could do and just do it better. The fifth mission, the cartel mission, is damn near unplayable. It has infinite spawns for the enemies so you can't wait them out. Half the mission is based on RNG randomness, but you can stomach through it. But in the last part of that mission, it is almost impossible. 

I've been checking the discussions to see the strategies people use, but in this strategy game, there is only one way to tackle the 40-60 minute mission that has to be followed perfectly. Worse, even if you follow it perfectly, you can lose an essential squad in two seconds and the mission becomes unplayable and you have to reload.

REALLY enjoying the game up to now.
its Living up to the possibility of being RTS game of the year.

the only down sides to it currently, 
the camera angle could do with a bit more control on the zoom in, and tilt angle, so you can see what a hill or mound of dirt for cover, and whats flatland.

and playing wheres wally when trying to see the wolf packs or drones.

all in all,
money well spent,

The devs really did well with the whole ""You gotta take what you can get"" vibe as you'll often find yourself dragging everything of use off the battlefield towed by a half intact pickup truck if you're lucky.

The game doesn't make you feel like clique plucky resistance group as the founders are quite literally the remaining units of the United States military, your pure units are well trained, well equipped and professional. But you need to supplement to fight the overwhelming might of the machines with whatever you can get because the factories for creating proper equipment are bombed or taken by legion.

The fact you can customise what your troops bring into battle, including vehicle armament and armour is only a few RTS games let you do, but they're usually on a smaller squad level like XCOM or Xenonaughts. 

If you decide to man up and play on ""Realistic"" the game stops hand holding you, the enemy will deal full realistic damage to your troops and you will experience what it's like to fight an uphill battle in my opinion, realistic mode is the way the game is meant to be played.

Just to name a few, if you change your graphical settings the game crashes to desktop (every time) and will not save the settings you wanted. The game will crash at random intervals entirely of it's own accord (primarily in cut scenes), just played a 30 minute mission meticulously managing your forces' attack/defense strategy? Too bad, crash to desktop and restart the mission. This has happened three times now within three hours of playing. The audio in multiple cut scenes is either non-existent or plays sporadically cutting in and out leaving you feeling ""un-immersed"" and often times with questions as to what is happening and what you need to do going forward. Last point is that several missions leave out mission critical information that could lead to the success of said mission. One instance is a base defense mission where you need ammo, fuel, and drivers to supply those resources to the front line, (this is called logistics for people who don't know). Need an ammo truck? No indication as to where it is other than ""hurry up and grab a resupply vehicle!"" Need fuel? No indication as to where it is other than ""hurry up and grab a fuel vehicle!"" Need drivers to ferry the fuel and ammo back and forth? No indication where these drivers are at other than ""we're sending you reinforcements!"" It's not a matter of hand holding so much as it is just poor game design. I shouldn't have to drop everything I'm doing (and leave my soldiers undefended/wounded/dying) just to go on a ""where's Waldo"" adventure to find this driver to move supplies. As of the typing of this review, I'm currently trying to start a new mission where I need to select a ""scouting squad"" to commandeer a village/town and after selecting all of my forces the game literally will not let me advance beyond that screen, thus preventing me from playing the game.

The single-player campaign is where Terminator: Dark Fate - Defiance truly shines. It's not just a series of battles but a narrative-driven journey filled with meaningful decisions that affect the outcome of your mission and the storyline. The inclusion of dialogue choices in an RTS game is a bold move that pays off, offering a personalized experience that immerses players in the world and its challenges. This RPG-like depth adds a new dimension to the game, making it not only about strategy but also about the stories we create through our choices.

Terminator: Dark Fate - Defiance also boasts a detailed destruction model that not only looks impressive but has a tangible effect on gameplay. The environment and structures play a significant role in the outcome of skirmishes, allowing for tactical decisions that can turn the tide of battle. This feature emphasizes the importance of strategic thinking and adaptability, enriching the overall gameplay experience.

But the game still has room to grow. I'm really looking forward to see more maps added to multiplayer, which will make the game even more fun to play over and over and bring in new strategies.

As with any game at launch, Terminator: Dark Fate - Defiance does have its share of bugs and issues that need addressing. However, the game's core mechanics, combined with its unique blend of genres, make it a standout title that's worth experiencing despite these initial hiccups. The developers have shown a commitment to improving the game, and the community is actively engaged in providing feedback, suggesting a bright future for Terminator: Dark Fate - Defiance as it evolves and refines its innovative approach to strategy gaming.

Firstly, the storyline does not align with the Terminator franchise, including Legion. Humans fought humans at first in the chaos after the nukes dropped. The machines slowly enslaved humans to build their factories in exchange for food and shelter. Then, the exterminations started wiping out pockets of residents. This game is too complicated for a decent real-time strategy game. I enjoyed the first couple of missions, but having to do this and that and having the entire base slaughtered without knowing what was happening. I gave up and added this to the list of disappointing Terminator games. I agree with a few other fans' comments saying they should have stayed with the original Skynet timeline.

The first three missions (that you play through in the demo) are legitimately quite good, surviving against a dangerous army of robotic killing machines and escaping missions beat up but still barely hanging in there to continue raging against the machines feels SO right for the setting. The first few four or so missions and skirmish matches (though I haven't had much time to dabble in them) showcase the game at its best and it is a legitimately solid RTS, especially if you're a fan of games like Syrian Conflict.

Unfortunately, the game drops the ball pretty hard after its solid start. 
To start with the campaign's strategic layer, each mission leads into the next, remembering your decisions and keeping your army in the state it was in last battle. If you lose a soldier in a squad, that squad will be down a member until you find a replacement, and a squad or vehicle being blown up is dead for good (including named hero units! RIP big bob). Units take up supply and you need to manage the size of your army to make sure you can keep up with their demand.

This sounds like a great idea on paper, but in execution, this leads to losses being punishing in a game with very high lethality. Battles are large, its hard to keep track of everyone, and that's troublesome when every lost vehicle or squad screws over your future prospects. An ATGM or plasma cannon from across the map obliterating your Bradley in a single hit or Rev 9 terminators eviscerating a ranger squad with pinpoint precision would be fine if units where more expendable or battles where smaller/easier to micro. Neither of these conditions are true, so good luck trying to control upwards of 30 units when trying to minimise losses for the next battle. Thankfully, the developers do provide a mid battle pause function to help, though pausing every 10 seconds to check three seperate battles and make sure my units in buildings aren't staring at walls instead of shooting through windows isn't exactly my idea of an engaging RTS. 

In battles, vehicles feel responsive and fun to control, they're probably the most enjoyable part of combat. Tanks feel like their namesake, technicals are appropriately potent for supporting infantry with machine gun fire and the various battle-trailers and weapons platforms the Movement trucks and dozers can pull are very thematic and fun to use. Sometimes pathing can get weird though, especially when shift clicking to queue up multiple orders (I find the game doesn't like shift click very much in general). You don't get a ton of vehicles, and they're limited by harsh supply requirements, but they're impactful and fun to use, right up until half your vehicles get obliterated from across the map by ATGMs and force you to reset.. 

Infantry, are, well, a mess. Like in similar games, they're able to garrison buildings and are somewhat fragile when outside of cover, so you'd hope buildings would work, but they're incredibly inconsistent. Infantry will sprint across floors to get to a window on the opposite side of where the enemy is coming from, then dash back to where they started, then go to stare at a wall and then go to some random window, which is hopefully one they can shoot the enemy from. If a building connects to another, like a prison complex being split into blocks, then don't even expect them to do anything to their enemy neighbours other than run around in circles and get their heads popped by snipers. Sometimes it works perfectly and my infantry conduct a good ambush while other times it makes me question if they aren't terminators in disguise trying to screw me over. 

So lets say you lose most of your rangers to rockets because they where too busy admiring the fine interior design of the gas station. They still killed the enemies in the end so you can just heal them up and send them back in, no need to worry about it. Except you do have to actually worry about it because you can't heal squads in the middle of combat. If the anti tank specialist gets his head popped like a watermelon by a laser sniper rifle provided directly from monolith HQ, that squad is ineffective for the rest of the battle against 80% of the legion roster, hope you're cool with your elites suddenly being a liability, where the best thing you can do is hide them in a corner somewhere so the squad doesn't get wiped.

The campaign just, doesn't fit together to form the vision of what its going for. Infantry are fragile but also most are too valuable to be used as cannon fodder, yet they can't be replenished once injured in battle. The various enemy factions are dangerous and lethal, and you're usually always on the back foot, but missions expect you to fight against superior numbers and superior technology and not only survive but win. Your supplies limit the ability to bring a huge force and instead encourage a smaller more elite warband, yet every battle expects you to be bringing the entire founders military in the opening and a full horde of movement rebels in reinforcements. 

The game had a great start and if the mechanics weren't actively fighting themselves, this could be a damn good RTS, not unlike something I'd play in my childhood, but at current, I cannot recommend the game. Slitherine do have a good track record with other RTS titles, so its even more surprisingly seeing how badly the strategic layer of the campaign meshes with the large scale battles. And what really sucks is the mission design is really good, each mission has an interesting premise and cool and unique mechanics to manage, and they would be great fun if you weren't worrying about the state of your army and if you'll have enough troops left alive for the next mission. The individual parts of the game are all individually good but everything goes up in flames once they're connected to the chassis of the game.",1708830080,1708830080,False,4,0,0.552957355976104736,0,True,False,False

Essentially if you have ever played men of war Assault squad or Gates of Hell then you will be immediately familiar with the squad tactics, vehicle repair and recovery and so on.

it essentially takes that combat system, makes it nice and pretty (lasers etc) and improves on it a bit, the campaign so far is good and im enjoying the mechanics.

if you have never played MOWAS or GoH before and are quite new to this type of game, its simple really, hold your forces back and use counters against the enemy, enemy tank incoming? send forward the ATGM squad and kill it, enemy spamming infantry? hunker down and shoot them with your own, or better yet send a vehicle they cant counter at them.

the great thing is this game essentially hits that neuron in your brain of out tactic'ing your enemy by then having you take your loot and losses between missions, do better early means youll do better later but dont get too greedy cus you cant supply everything.

its probably the most effort any Terminator series game is EVER going to get in a while and what we had before and its also a pretty nice representation of the future war.

I'm actually happy I bought it again, because the game is pretty awesome! The campaign seems like its going to be a really long game, because the campaign map itself is HUGE! Make no mistake, this game is insanely hard. I'm playing on Hard difficulty and so far I think they nailed down the ""Humans fighting for survival"" aspect, because you're severely outnumbered, outgunned, and have to use your units and position them smartly. The game plays similar to wargame, so you have a variety of units that can do various things. You can upgrade the units, and train them during the campaign map inbetween missions to give them better equipment. I like how you can upgrade humvee's or any vehicle and give them better armor, and weapons.

A few things I would like to see improved are, directions on where enemies may be coming from. Sometimes I positioned my units thinking the enemy was going to come from that direction, but they came entirely on the opposite side. Maybe it gets better in different parts of the campaign. 

Another thing I would like to see improved is the supplies. Everything costs supplies, so you have to pick and choose what units to keep and what units to disband, because the upkeep will make or break you. There's ways to alleviate it by trading, and such, but you don't really know how many units to keep, or what is in store for you going further into the campaign, so you may disband too many units and not have enough to beat the next mission. Possibly anyway, but I can see that happening. I think the upkeep is too high for the units, and should be adjusted a bit.

When I played the demo for this game, I was hooked. I was hooked so much that the moment the demo ended I immediately bought Syrian Warfare just to scratch the itch that waiting for this game made me feel. The fact that the demo cuts off immediately after giving you a taste of the persistent unit mechanics was absolutely genius marketing.

Unfortunately, reality doesn't mix well with expectations, and it was a sobering experience.

First thing's first: For the price point the game is good. It is not very well polished, units get stuck on terrain, mission scripting can go insane at times, but it's unique and topical enough with good enough mechanics that I am satisfied with my purchase. You get what's on the tin: An RTS game set in the Terminator universe, complete with online skirmish modes and a whole single-player campaign. The rest of this is just going to be nit-picks of things that I found particularly jarring so other people can know what it is they'll be getting into:

Dynamic campaign: The game features a ""free-form"" campaign where you make decisions during missions that affect the outcome of character arcs and stories. This is great because it adds a role-playing element to things, and characters that survive in missions will remain active as the story progresses. All of your units level up, they remain consistent as the game goes forward (assuming they survive) and you can equip them with different weapons, and upgrade your vehicles with various modules. It's very cool.
The issue however is the resource mechanic: Supplies and ""Goodwill Points."" Goodwill points act as your currency, and they're what you use to buy upgrades, supplies, and more men for your army. Supplies on the other hand are what you use to navigate the world map, and are by-far the most frustrating aspect of the game's campaign. You get supplies by doing missions, and these missions only ever give you enough supplies to go to the next mission location. This is frustrating simply because of the amount of locations there are to go and the ways you can interact with them. You can purchase supplies for Goodwill points, but the amount of supplies you get per point spent barely covers the cost of one day's trip in most cases, and that's after spending the maximum amount of supplies. Also, the size of your army and the vehicles in it play into the draw on your available supplies, so you are expected to maintain a small army at most times in order to keep from burning through your supplies. There are very few ways to organically earn supplies and goodwill points outside of the missions, none of which are randomly generated, and all follow a determined canonical path. It's frustrating at best, and very cumbersome at worst.

Gameplay: If you've played Syrian Warfare, then you know what to expect: The game is a ""realistic"" RTS where firefights result in high amounts of casualties extremely quickly, and there is no way to reinforce lost squad members to a unit while it is still in the mission. The main issue I had with Syrian Warfare is that the game's UI simply did not compliment the speed at which the game happened, which meant that I was constantly slapping space-bar ever second or so just so I could make sure that every squad I had was doing exactly what I needed it to do at any given moment, and what was worse was the fact that the game did not even have a unit quick-select bar like Company of Heroes. Fortunately, not only does Terminator: Dark Fate - Defiance keep the active pause mechanic, but it also added a unit hot-bar, so managing your soldiers during high-lethality situations is a lot less frustrating, but not entirely curbed.

Mission Design: I give the mission design props for being incredibly ballsy, most of the time they play out more like a session from a tabletop campaign than a typical RTS mission (please for the love of god I want RTS games to add more tools to turn them into tabletop role-playing modules I'm begging you), with various decisions you can make, optional objectives that can help or hinder you in one way or the other, and even faction politics that you can juggle around before the mission ends. The execution of these missions can range from inspiring to absolutely mind-meltingly confusing, the most notable example being the first mission you do against ""The Cartel,"" where you infiltrate one of their main settlements in order to start a slave uprising. An entire portion of this mission is dedicated to save-scumming until you can RNG the outcome of a pitched battle between one of your squads and an enemy's squad, of which you don't get to control your squad, and if your squad dies then it's a game over. It's ludicrous, and my squad died 5 out of 6 attempts on Normal mode, and that was with all the possible weapon upgrades I could've gotten for them before the fight; I can't imagine how many attempts it'd take on the harder difficulties.",1708817645,1708817785,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Still, screenshots looked fine and Terminator (strictly only 1-2) was a defining period of my childhood. Decided to risk a purchase and did I regret it? Eeeeeeh... dunna. This game is a big fat meh, definitely not for purchase now.

Don't take me wrong, Dark Fate gets many things right. Combat really feels overwhelming to the advantage of the machines, it's easy (even on normal) to get your troops mowed down, including armored vehicles of yours. It really captures that desperate, tooth to nail fight against a seemingly endless waves of terminators. It also has unit customization and unit micromanagement and me likey those a lot.

So why the negative review? To be honest, nothing is broken in it's core, it can be patched without a hickup. But this game is simply half-baked, not playtested properly and has an insane amount of issues, quality of life and otherwise. Let me give you a few examples. This game is absolutely (or at least pretty close to) zero loss and conserving your resources (troops, etc). That's fine. But even if you have the perfect plan, executed sharply, random shit will fuck you up. Namely:

- Unit pathfinding is abysmal. Vehicles will crash into each other and push them around, happily, delaying vital maneouvers and/or exposing themselves.
- Game is just overcomplicated. I lost vital units, till I figured out basic things. Like how to dismount/abandon resource points and such. Many mechanics are not explained, simply trial and error. Many elements are either hidden behind submenus, resulting in redundant clicking or just simply hard to get a grasp on. E.g. on the third map I found a .50cal machine gun, tooltip said that move a unit there to pick it up. I did it. Couldn't pick it up. Why? No idea. Tried different units to no avail. Desperately needed it, but fuck it, I gave up trying after a few minutes.
- Game is super heavily scripted with triggers left and right, some of them super broken or simply not prepared for certain scenarios. Like second mission, escort a few soldiers back to base. Did it, but it just didn't complete the step, couldn't proceed. Game has to be reloaded. Or third map, my army had to hide at one of certain places. However, one hiding spot (the primary one) didn't have enough slots for my soldiers, I was one person shot. Didn't have time to get to the other one, so mission failed. Also, still third map, I thought I am performing an optional mission (well, the fucking mission description was marked as optional), yet, it triggered the final event. While I still wanted to go around and explore.

Maybe it will be patched, maybe not, but it's pretty annoying to fumble not because I messed up something, but because of bugs/shitty gameplay system/lack of explanation. Either way, happy to change that review to positive later, but Slihetherin really has to get it's shit together for that.

UPDATE: To be frank, after spending 10+ hours with the game, it can be pretty entertaining, assuming that you accept it's shortcomings. And learn the combat system, which is totally not explained at all. Since I didn't really see any tips and hints regarding to the game, here are some. Don't expect to be exhaustive, I only got through the first few maps.

Some of these may be patched, but that's how they work at the moment.

- If you switch stance with a squad (prone/standing), it will immediately stop movement. It may be patched in the future, now it works like this for me. Pay attention, so they won't be exposed.
- Entering and leaving a building takes time, depending on the building's size, as your units will actually go through the interior. Also, if you want some units to select and leave the building, square selection (hold left click) won't work. Shift+left click, select them individually.
- If you give attack order for units in a building, they will absolutely NOT attack if they have no clear line of sight and most of the time won't even reposition for an attack position. You have to micromanage, that's especially painful with anti-armor units.
- There is no shame in save scumming, especially that if you end up with losing complete units (vehicles), I highly doubt that you can get through the campaign. Also, you may unintentionally trigger events, which you really didn't want.
- Although everyone can drive basic vehicles, their effectiveness won't be the same (especially with uprades). So only drivers should drive, as a general rule.
- Just because a vehicles gets hit badly, starts to burn and units exit, doesn't mean that it's unusable. Wait until fire dies down, enter the vehicle and if there are spare parts, you can repair it to a pristine state even.
- Resource points / units have mobile and deployed (supply) position. Units can only exit (enter) in mobile position, but resource is only distributed in deployed/supply mode. But switching between them takes time. Factor it in your plans, as some units can stuck there for many seconds, without the ability of being able to exit. Also, every unit can man a resource point/unit.
- Almost all vehicles (except ones like tanks) can carry one or more units around. House your vulnerable ones, like drivers. Also a good idea to have spare drivers, since ->
- Make sure to canvass the whole map (if you have a chance) and try to complete all of the side-quests. E.g. there is an abandoned humvee at the exit point of the second map, and at the third map you can get two military vehicles. Without the latter ones, I can't imagine how can one complete the third map. To continue this chain of thought ->
- Make sure to pick up/collect ALL of the vehicles (technicals), towable turrets, etc on the map and exit with them. Don't leave anything on the battleground, driveable/towable units WON'T be visible, unless one or more units of yours actually see them.
- BEFORE exiting the mission, make sure to round up all your units and gather the available supply trailers/oil trailers and resupply all units with ammo and oil. Even if you leave the map with a truckload of ammo (oil), resupplying between missions costs supply points, regardless of how much goodies you have in your trailers. Those only work during missions. Stupid? Yes. But that's how it works.
- After finishing a mission, DON'T go anywhere. Moving costs supply points and chances are, that you have lots of stuff which you may want (need), but you won't have supply for it. So moving in a bloated state will drain your supply excessively. Instead of it browse the salvaged vehicles and units which joined. You have two options, disband them and get some supplies or ""sell"" them at settlements (drag them to the vendor inventory at the hiring window) for goodwill credits. It's a good idea to get rid of supply hog vehicles and units before moving. However, regardless of disbanding or selling a unit, make sure to check it's inventory. They may have improved weapons and equipment, remove it before getting rid of them.
- Be VERY cautious when you change/upgrade weapons between missions. If you have a gun equipped with fully stocked ammo and you replace it with another one, you have to purchase ammo for it again. If you install the original gun back, you have to purchase ammo for it AGAIN. Fiddling around can drain your resources pretty quickly, e.g. fully restocking a high caliber gun's ammo can cost 1200 supply units (equivalent of a humvee and an infantry's daily consumption). Stupid system? Absolutely, hope it gets patched.",1708704949,1708805500,False,42,3,0.691396355628967285,0,True,False,False

Just busywork. 

To be honest, I find a lot of the early reviews very suspicious.


Many issues with pathfinding, target allocation, general friendly ai(which is very barebones), damage output of enemies,  movement of groups in general, damage models of vehicles(they are all allways cardboard), you cannot driver over ground units with building size tanks, higher terrain units cannot fire on lower terrain enemies.

It's really a chore and that is unfortunate. You will NEVER have more than a few seconds worth of actual ""realtime""(you know the R in RTS) because, in the fashion of Alien Dark Descent, you have to issue orders all the time and, most annoyingly, re-issue to actually make them perform. Units do NOT adapt on the battlefield, without orders, every few seconds, they will just hang around. 
There is a always attack mode but, hilariously, this only functions to make a unit pick a specific enemy and engage it until it is downed. Meaning that if this enemy changes position the unit will run after it REGARDLESS of other incoming fire. 
Pretty darn barebones if you ask me.

When, one day after release, the developers issues a statement, ""this will be our first of several patches"" I really feel like, 
""so why didn't you just adress these issues before releasing?"" 
Why charge for a incomplete product?

Is this a good game then? Eehhh...

It's trying to be Company of Heroes and Men of War, but not really melding the two genres together. It has a cover mechanic like Men of War but it's more to the simplistic side and not really well explained or visualised. Infantry in the middle of the road will be taken down easily, but the issue come with any other cover. Does this grassland provide any cover beside concealment? I don't know. Does having my squad around these trees/rocky terrain provide more cover from enemy fire? I don't know. How much better is a strong cover building compared to a medium one, cause my men seem to get shredded either way. I don't know. 
It wants to dumb down the Men of war cover system but doesn't provide any explanation or visualisation of this cover mechanic besides buildings. 

The gameplay is an interesting mixed bag. It wants you to play intelligently but when you do try to play intelligently you aren't rewarded, but more or less punished. In one mission, I have to take two bridges before the cartel destroys them. After you capture the first bridge you're informed that there is a command unit boosting cartel fighting ability on peninsula of the island you crossed over to with the first bridge. Easy pickings. Except it wasn't as the house before the command unit is occupied by 1 sniper team, 2 infantry squads, some AT squads and a grenade launcher just to shut down any sort of assault even advancing with smoke cover. Okay, so lets play intelligently. I can shoot the command unit from the bank across the river without engaging the main blocking force. So I move a sniper in stealthily, identify the command unit, blow their vehicle up with an ATGM team and get ready to snipe the command unit (yes, even if you completely destroy the vehicle the crew can still jump out of a molten pile of slag). Turns out the command unit is a sniper team or something because I couldn't see them. Artillery. A lot of bad situations can be dealt with by employing artillery. which means I can't really play intelligently, but the game wants me to play intelligently. And some units are just hard counters to all, like the mercenaries. Anti-infantry and armour with good health and movement. 

The game is good in skirmish and probably multiplayer(haven't tried it yet), the real let down to me at least is the campaign. I thought it would be an open world RTS/RPG from the gameplay and trailers, it's not, you go from one mission place to another with just enough supplies to get you there. And you're rewarded with the decision of either currency or supplies and you'll take the supplies because you don't have any left and would need to buy more if you take the currency. You can't go to a town and get a side quest that send you to another town with a side quest that leads to a massive reward, it's just the main missions which is disappointing.I thought it would be like Company of Heroes 3 or Wargame where you can move freely around the map. 

I just became very tired of attempting to figure this game out and how to approach it strategically and coming up with half baked mechanics taken from other games. And that's what this game is really. It's a bit like when you were a kid and maybe made some food concoction with a variety of different tasty ingredients, it ended up being meh or bad and this game is like that, it takes elements and mechanics from other successful games and tried to blend it together, but to me, it just turned out meh.",1708774144,1708774144,False,41,7,0.718864023685455322,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is rather odd, with reinforcement 'rounds' where each round gives you an apparently random assortment of options to choose from. One round you may be able to buy tanks, the next round tanks are not available, then the next they are again.

There's a lot of things this game does right but it seems to hit a wall after a certain point. I think a lot of things need to be re-balanced. It becomes so much of a slug-fest that you find yourself losing interest. I imagine they're attempting to make you feel desperate, but... it's a game... and not much fun when you're going against concrete bunkers w/ MG emplacements/minefields/artillery support towards the end of a mission and you're out of supply and on a 15 minute time limit. Units move way too slow for that - even mounted (assuming they have fuel). The campaign is on a rail and I feel like I was on it until the final Cartel side mission.

I can't speak for Skirmishes because I haven't tried any, but judging from the very small list of maps/scenarios available - it's not something they're going to concentrate on, which is what I was hoping for. It's really disappointing and didn't even seem appealing enough for me to try.

I love many of the game concepts surrounding building and supplying your own squad, including salvaging abandoned vehicles (some of which I forced the crew to run away because I set it on fire) but it is quite disheartening to see it immediately explode in the next mission from literally nowhere.

You could order your vehicle into an open field approximately 10 k's from the nearest building and see it destroyed by a 100% accurate recoiless or ATGM shot from someone you can't even see, probably while you were trying to micro your soldiers who are too dumb to prone when the first two members of their squad got killed by, one again, 100% accuracy single guy with an AK.

I like that it's hard. I enjoy challenging. However what I can't stand is a game that relies on constant save scumming to avoid catastrophic casualties that are game ending.

Case in point, there is a mission 7 or 8 against human enemies where my small squad, upon entering the mission, lost 1/3rd of their members including a recoiless fully armored van and the two hero snipers next to it because the devs saw fit to place a humvee with a gatling and a rocket armed infantry squad right in front of them. So the mission starts, I pause, and have a lovely view of the explosion and my hero squad bleeding to death.

Reload. Might assault that ATGM squad with my rangers in tha building over there, ATGM kills my whole ranger squad in hand to hand combat. Reload. Might put some snipers in the building opposite and shoot the ATGM, Artillery from half the map away destroys the building before I can get my snipers out of it. Reload.

If Slitherine updates the game a lot to turn it into a more tactical game they could have a Company of Heroes 3 contender
Pro: looks great, a lot of details of units of both sides, you feel in danger, bestiary, squads have loadouts and different guns
Cons: a bit lackluster since the range of some units is so big and combat is so deadly, not fighting terminators in a game called terminator, some weird and horrible design choices like shooting a javeling and it hits a tree, too linear
Weird: You are fighting legion, i don't care about the lore of Dark Fate but why buy the rights for the game and use the worst movie?

- camera controls are unintuitive. too far to get to controls, need to reach all across keyboard or let go of mouse - poor design. I'v reassigned the turn-right/turn-left controls to Q and E, like how pretty much any RTS does it.
- game should take note of UI options of other successful RTS games: Starcraft 2, Fallout: Tactics
- player should be able to designate movement waypoints & unit path should be displayed or toggleable
- speed of world time progression should be adjustable. ie. x0.5, x.75, x1, x1.25, x1.5, x1.75, x2
- text and subtitle size and color should be adjustable
- mouse scroll wheel sensitivity should be adjustable. Too much scrolling to completely zoom in or out.
- gamma and brightness should be adjustable
- game should have more graphics and VFX options.
- game should have depth-of-field and fog of war options - see Starcraft for war of fog example.
- game should take advantage of DLSS and texture sharpening.
- game should have keyboard profile for Logitech G915 keyboard with pre-set actions/commands for macro keys
- should be able to save the game without needing to type anything. game should auto-name saves if player doesn't enter custom names. Saves frequently end up as useless names like ""a"" ""b"" ""aa"" ""as"" ""asd,"" etc. that tell the player nothing, just so the player can save the game.
- the unit AI can be somewhat dumb sometimes
- player should be able to play game without using keyboard; mouse-only.
- game should have subtitle and accessibility options
- game feels uncompleted/not fully tested, like the players are being used as guinea-pigs to test out the gameplay and UI, and I'm offended I was made to pay $40 for it like a dumb sucker to help out doing the Devs job for them.

The game is beautiful. The modeling is complex, the injuries are realistic.
However, there are never enough resources, no ammo, and if you do have some, you have to give up because of the resource management mechanics.

but the game is pretty good! it's like a mix of a Company of Heroes and, perhaps, a Wargame: Red Dragon. It's incredibly systems-rich. You manage and shape your army through persistent units, which can suffer persistent deaths, across missions - and they WILL suffer persistent deaths, because (playing on Hard, at least), the game is DIFFICULT. Not to the point of complete failure, but to the point where (even using frequent quickloads and quicksaves), you WILL take casualties unless you're some sort of perfect brain genius RTS god. I think that's a very fine line of balance to walk, and it's really impressive to see it walked here. Missions are large, long, girthy, etc, and objectives typically evolve several times over the course of one. If you played Last Train Home recently and were disappointed at that game's simplicity and easiness, this is a good one for you.

I am left with only one, probably unanswerable question; why is it Terminator: Dark Fate branded? There was obviously a huge amount of work, and even passion, that went into this game. Does Terminator: Dark Fate still have shooters? Are the devs all diehard Terminator: Dark Fate fans? Did they achieve some sort of monetary reward for branding their game after a 2019 movie with 6.2/10 on imdb that I literally did not know existed until five seconds ago, when I finally googled it to see what it was?

On top of that is the whole 'RTS' aspect.  Enemies are not really balanced, one unit can basically shoot you from across the map if you just happen to be in the open.

To be honest, I was very excited about the first 5 episodes. Game mechanics were very nice. Story plotline seems good too. I can't say I am too fond of dialogues. Map designs are beyond great.

Then what is the problem you may ask. Well here it goes;

- Building to building combat are the worst. Your troops die very fast whilst enemies don't. A few enemy troops in a single building can destroy tanks and a few regiments by themselves. You can try to snipe them out but some of them out-range snipers. Also, howitzers don't solve the problem(especially light ones). This should be somehow balanced.

- I play on the ""normal"" difficulty, which feels around hardest. Since vision is limited, you could be easily hit by a missile or so. Don't get me wrong, I adore realism but, this is just overwhelming micro(I don't consider myself young but i did play SC-Coh series a lot). Controlling whole map, whilist looking out for every possible threat is too much. So I found myself taking autosaves around every 3-4 mins to reload. Btw, game's original autosave periods are bad. I mean really BAD.

- Weapon drops seems unnecessary, since you often have better equipment.

- Game needs some kind of a cover system like in the MoW or CoH series. Proning is a nice touch but not enough.

- Optimisation has some issues. Game drops around 20-30 fps in big maps(episode 5-7)

But overall, game is fun when you are not exhausted by loosing precious units. Intensity of combat feels nice. Side missions are worth to give a try. Haven't been able to try multiplayer yet, but story mod itself, would be suffice.

they put a character 80 miles away from anything, and then tell you to defend them with 2 snipers and a new ability, that doesn't work. I was baffled until I realized, it's simply broken. 

EDIT: I have soldiered on but I want a dev to know sincerely, I have had NO fun. The writing in this game has been BENCHPRESSING the entire experience because the devs DO NOT know how to balance a video game. At all. It's appalingly terrible in some places because of the massive difficulty spikes, and not fair difficulty spikes. I'm on the easiest setting and had to download a cheat engine to actually be able to get anywhere because each mission throws bullshit you can't predict and everything moves so damn slow!

Your units and vehicles found on each map carry over to the next missions, and so do any losses. Units have to be preserved as replenishment is extremely expensive. All units have ammunition that must be restocked, vehicles require limited amounts of fuel. Vehicles and their drivers can be readily swapped including trailers that vary between cargo, supplies, fuel or artillery. Units can change direction of fire in cover to help prevent being flanked. Weapons can be picked up off the battlefield and equipped on the spot.  The campaign map is ENORMOUS, and missions can take up to an hour if you feel like 100% them. 

However, there are quite a few negatives as well... the supply system needs a total rework. Having even a remotely sizable force is impossible and so is backtracking to previous settlements to trade, get recruits to replenish your units, finish quests, etc really kills the flow of the game and makes it very easy to soft lock. You will pass multiple settlements and stores while traveling, with no way to stop without spending even more resources to back and see if you missed something. 

Also, the AI needs some adjustments. The enemy can see you at all times and pepper you with artillery halfway across the map at an insane rate of fire. Trying to clear enemies out of cover can be extremely annoying, as you will have your entire army shooting at a building and it takes multiple minutes to take out a single enemy unit. RPG units sometimes won't shoot and instead charge towards the enemy. Vehicles like vans and technicals are so squishy that basic units can disable them with a few shots. All of this leads to lots of reloading to try again, as you are severely punished for losing units.

There's a lot of potential here, and I can't wait to see what the future holds(hopefully a dlc to play as the ""legion"")

As one should see, this game uses the same engine and gameplay mechanics as Syrian Warfare, which is nice since few RTS games exist that use this style (for now).

This game is not for everyone just like Syrian warfare was not for everyone either, even if you consider yourself a “alpha RTS gamer”. You can play straight away on hard difficulty and do well. You can miss securing the tank on the first mission (as well as the Bradley), and still do well in the next missions with the more “unconventional” forces at your disposal as you fight legion’s hordes. 

So, even when trophy equipment is missed out during the early missions, a good enough or lucky enough player, can in fact reach the later mission with acceptable losses, for example 128 troops lost, 7 vehicles, for 586 enemy troops, 48 vehicles. But that means you (the player) have massive casualties to replenish, and not enough resources nor manpower. Unlike Syrian warfare, the player isn’t given troops over time to pick and choose from, instead on the tactical map, different locations have either movement forces, integrator camps, or surviving human settlements, some can give troops and equipment, others will only give training to your troops, all will give resources for travel. Legion is the main threat to humanity, but like Syrian warfare, humans somehow have time to fight and kill each other for their own reasons and agendas.  

To be honest, reviewers who say that AI has sheer randomness of unit’s accuracy and lethality, is true, especially considering some of the obvious weapons being used. For example, the javelin shouldn’t miss unless the target has electronic countermeasures or hide in a good spot at the last minute, so the atgm team will miss a spider out in the open at least once, then suddenly hit it when it tries moving out of range of the atgm. but at the same time, who knows how actually effective it can be when 10 years of unclear maintenance programs goes on for western hardware.

Anyway, there is also the fact that on a certain mission later in the campaign, the “duels”, are completely random, which kind of works, but at the same time is literally up to chance, because the troops given are already elite rank, but supposedly have no “training perks”, so they can still die, and the mission automatically fails. 

The story is passable, if you just don’t care for terminator lore, the characters also passable, if you just don’t care and simply use them for what they are for, tank crews and free upgrade loot. The game itself is fun, especially if you like the gameplay mechanics of Syrian warfare, one obvious challenge is working with western style equipment and vehicles, but it’s possible and rewarding with the right tactics. Plus, the ability to upgrade troops and vehicles with armors, weapons, an engine upgrades is a wonderful feature that hopefully is used in the future for “Syrian Warfare like” games. 
In summary, since my personal experience with the game so far is alright, I would still recommend the game since it will get better, eventually. 

There are error issues and game freezes, for now I only saw game freezes at times when a artillery round is about to hit the ground, or a tank explodes on occasion as well. So yes, the game has issues. I would not recommend the game to gamers who are not comfortable with the different mechanics to experience from rts games like command and conquer, StarCraft, company of heroes, or the upcoming touhou empires, because the gameplay mechanics are going to be significantly different, from all those games, the only one similar enough would be COH.

All your units have ammo for their weapons, with vehicles having directional armour and components, as well as fuel, spare parts for field repairs, and an ammo pool for infantry to rearm from. Infantry squads also have ammo, and can equip a variety of support weapons. All of which persists between missions, from the very beginning; Ammo, fuel and spare parts  are replenished from a limited supply; you need to actually acquire special weapons to save them. 

Infantry casualties must be replaced between missions from the civilians you rescue during them or from disbanding other squads - with additional squads and new vehicles being awarded for completing side objectives or just found in the missions. Vehicles must be crewed by troops trained to do so - who you can freely dismount at-will if you need to crew another vehicle or avoid making one a target; many can carry passengers with a specific number of seats rather than squad slots. In the same way, buildings are garrisonable and have decent destruction. Projectiles are physical and must actually connect with their target to do damage. Armoured vehicles are very resistant, if not impervious to small arms.

The game certainly has its flaws; it's a little unpolished on the interface/controls/responsivity side of things. There are balance and pacing issues, with the 3rd mission being a huge difficulty spike - and pulling your attention six different ways at once. Make sure to get that Bradley going the second you have control over it, and, and start pulling your squads back to the central bunker and other defensive positions within the base before the game prompts you to; use engineers to set up mines in every choke-point behind the initial frontline. Get your armour crews to the southeast corner as soon as you can afford to give up the repair bay/supply depot area. In general, the more squads you manage to pull out, the better off you'll be for the rest of the campaign.

Most weapons are purely lethal to infantry, and it's hard to go through any given mission without losing a few from each squad. Vehicles can die just as quickly, and armour facing doesn't seem to account for much on the scale of things. The maps consist mostly of a lot of open ground which even the machines' most basic armoured vehicle will dominate - you're pretty much forced to crawl anywhere there's an enemy presence, to get in range before engaging and to do so safely. Unless your name's Sun Tzu I'd recommend against playing on the hardest difficulty.

 Most special weapons types can only be used by specific squad types, when the majority of them are something that - while they might not be proficient with, they could probably figure out and put to use if it came down to it.

There's only 2 infantry formations - tactical blob, and line - and wider-spaced variants of each. There's been a few situations where a staggered column or wedge wouldn't have gone amiss - but more than anything else, I wish it had a more CoH or MoW-style cover system, where troops conform to the terrain features at least as much as their formations.

Skirmish mode is very undercooked with only 4(?) maps, with a couple having versions for both modes. The domination mode ends the instant one team or the other controls all the points, which are themselves captured just as quickly with a unit standing on it.

What I like most is that past the first 3 missions, you get a lot of choices to make - speaking to characters to get quests within the mission, and multiple ways to complete the main objectives - with side objectives being meaningful and consequential.

 Voice acting ranges from decent to hammy, but never offensively so. Unit barks are good and convincing, as well as informative - and you can even overhear conversations between troops like in CoH. The game has a decent notification system for when a squad runs out of a given ammo type, takes a casualty or is wiped; ditto with vehicles being immobilised or having their weapon knocked out.

If you like the Terminator franchise or just the idea of real-time-tactics with a metagame against a robotic enemy, it's a pretty easy recommend.",1708658867,1708658867,True,38,0,0.785333156585693359,0,True,False,False

Before buying this game, I was hoping it would be more Command and Conquer, Age of Empires, Red Alert 3 beat. However this game is more Men of War, Wargame, CoH2(kinda) in terms of gameplay. As a disclaimer, I am the type to not really care about a campaign. I jump straight into skirmish or multiplayer. I did the same with AOE4, EE2, CNC and many more. So the only experience I have is with the skirmish, where there are 𝐨𝐧𝐥𝐲 𝟒 𝐦𝐚𝐩𝐬 𝐨𝐧 𝐫𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐞. 4 maps is crazy low especially for a 1.0 release. There is no base building, the game uses a reserve system like Men of War/Wargame. Except here there is an entirely different menu pop up. If you've played men of war/wargame, you can still see whats happening on your screen. Here there is an entirely different UI that takes your whole screen to display 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐩. 

Going off of the troops, I was very happy with the unit variety. One of the most important parts of any RTS. I only played the movement and the founders. Each felt unique and definitely had their own units. The graphics are great and so are the effects. But when you're in the game trying to issue orders, it feels like walking through sludge. The game is incredibly slow paced. Slow movement combines with the UI mentioned earlier to make the game feel like an eternity when replacing units. You gain these reserve points over time, but I found myself overflowing so often that I was just repetitively clicking units just to get them out there. For the squad based infantry; I would try to get them behind cover like I would in COH2, or in Men of War, or even Endwar, but the only forms of cover in the game are lying down and getting in a building. Where an incredibly long gunfight will occur.

The game feels clunky. The camera is limiting, I'm doing pop up simulator with the reserves. There are other reviews that have talked about the pathfinding far more than I have so I don't need to go into that. It does not feel like a 1.0 release, it feels more like a beta or even a late alpha. 

This is my longest review for any game I have played. I think it is because I do want this to succeed because this is a pretty awesome idea. But when I played, I felt like I was trying to get myself to like the game. I realized that isn't how its supposed to be, and I unfortunately plan on refunding it.",1708658847,1708658847,False,2,0,0.46875,0,True,False,False

To be fair  to those who are thinking of buying this game it is not even close to COC or COH because there is not base building.  This falls more in line with Commandos in that you have limited resources at every mission.  You can't just throw all your infantry into the melee like a modern day Russian assault on Ukraine because unlike Russia you actually need your troops.  

I DO like the graphics, the sound, the carrying over of experienced units, but it's hard for me because I hate pausing the game to plan out my attack and hope it works then restart after I just played the map for an hour and try again.

Ever played a [b]Rogue-like or Survival[/b] game where all the mechanics are unfairly rigged against the player and in favor of the bots?

Want to do the next mission? 

Sorry but it appears when you went to the store, you did not realize you were not given enough supplies to make it to the next location. Looks like you need to reload the game to an earlier save because you were suppose to spend your resources on supplies.

Want to save people or salvage vehicles?

Every person you save is going to cost you a fortune to keep in reserve, and salvaging doesn't remotely repay you for the cost of traveling with the vehicle. Don't worry though, those supplies are just thrown out the window since it's not spent on refueling, arming, or healing you at all.

Want to fight the enemy?

Well since you are the attacker, all enemies are invisible by default by the ""hidden"" mechanic so you won't see unmoving enemies until you are already being shot at or right in their face.

I heard you like fog of war, so we added fog of war to every enemy unit on top of your standard fog of war.

Edit 1:
I have played up to Albuquerque and so far have enjoyed most of the mechanics of the game. At this time I DO NOT ENJOY the supply balancing you must do within the campaign.

There are plenty of toys to bring to the fight to play with yet I feel punished for doing so. I daily supply upkeep for a human but why must I need 5000 supplies a day for a tank on top of needing to give it parts, fuel and ammo. What is the arbitrary supply number going? Do tanks eat in this version of terminator? Is my bradley tank sentient? Jokes aside I am frustrated trying to balance what units I keep and how many. It seems like I need to run around with a group of like 3 vehicles and 5 infantry rather than the fleet of cars and tanks and infantry I have. Again I understand this is for balance but id be able to accept the balance more if it made sense to expend arbitrary supplies on daily upkeep for vehicles that already need tangible supplies.

TLDR campaign resources need balancing and maybe a tip to let you know what is a good daily supply number to be working with as to not soft lock oneself out of a playthrough.

The units all have abilities that makes them different and all are useful so I think they did a GREAT job with the unit choices. The story is good and the voice acting is good. So far I'm loving the game, just would like to see changes to the resupply and get rid of drivers license mechanics.

Another RTT from Slitherine, with a few twists. If you've played something like Steel Division or Wargame: Red Dragon it's similar but with killer robots instead.

Playable factions are The Founders (the humans), The Movement (the scuffed humans), and sky- I MEAN Legion(the robots).

As this is an RTT, rather than build a base, you select your starting units and capture locations, then you call in select reinforcements. Pew pew until all are dead.

Humans have a neat little feature where they can man different vehicles based on a unit's driving skill. This means private Joe Shmo can drive the Humvee if the original driver gets killed. This makes human game-play pretty adaptive and on the fly. Units also need resupplying from time to time. Vehicles take modular damage at varying degrees of severity.

By contrast, as legion you stomp and swarm. Swarm your weak bots and mop up whats left with more specialized heavy bots. I love the little bot dogs, absolute favorites.

The Movement is a more ""ay papi let's kill those facistas!"" flavor of human, yet they sound pretty american. So, fairly standard really. They have a wide variety of engineers and light vehicles. I haven't used them much.

The game at time of writing only has a handful of mp maps whereas the campaign has some variety.

Voice Acting is OK and does it's job, nothing really stands out.

Music is great!

Overall, not a bad game, does what it set out to do. It's a bit overpriced at $40 though, pick it up on a sale.",1708625137,1708625137,True,3,0,0.537341177463531494,0,True,False,False

So far, totally impressed. I've played C&C, CoH, SC, Warner, and this RTS is more engaging then anything I've played. There's a true sense of survival and wanting to protect your troops. They persist (or don't) from mission to mission, so you're constantly evaluating risk/reward choices on your tactics. Replay factor is already off the chart as I've restarted several missions to try and get better results. Active pause is pretty cool. When things get hectic you can pause to queue up move orders etc. to respond to the dynamic battle.

Very detailed gameplay with stats, damage models. If you lose a team member specialized in a skill your squad won't be able to use that skill or weapon anymore. You can do battlefield repairs on the spot but takes time so best to do it away from enemy fire or with a friendly unit covering your back. You can position your squad members to individual different locations when you enter a building putting a missile guy in a front window and a guy with pistol or assault rifle by a back window etc. You can play as the Terminators in single player skirmish mode. Not sure about multiplayer though since i only do singleplayer.

Loading screens are gorgeous to look at with great artwork along with the eerie despair and desolation of the beutifully animated main menu screen.

Audio and music are fantastic fitting the apocalyptic doomsday character of the game world. Weapons and other sound effects are top notch bringing the fear as plasma fire goes flying at your units shredding them into mincemeat. Voice acting is fabulously done as your force screams in unbelievable eye bulging horror that they need back up or that they are taking anything from light to heavy damage where an engine or wheel gets knocked out needing repair. Great story and dialogue. Incredible user interface with a perfect pop up box explaining what ui icons do when hovering over them. Ammo is limited but you can control its use by telling your units not to use certain weapons at certain times by clicking on the appropriate icon in the ui.

Environment is totally destructible with many ways to destroy them from weapons fire shredding shacks into tiny wood fibers to tanks smashing thru walls because WHO NEEDS ROADS!!! Phenomenal tactical pause system which pretty much transforms the game into a turn based futuristic tabletop war game of UNIMAGINABLE DEVASTATION!!! where you can order your units to move one by one or do things like vehicle repair and restocking up on ammo from transports before getting out of tactical pause mode and seeing everything play out with the ability to pause again to change your plans on the fly when the unexpected happens or things turn out nasty.

SP is a little buggy but completely playable to my knowledge they did great in the performance and big fixing department.

This game suffers from a gross misuse of company time of resources, way too much emphasis was put into the single-player and the developers and whoever is in charge at the company clearly don't understand the fundamentals of the RTS genre and what it required normally of those types of games. You as a consumer and a player should expect a large swath of content for a $40 RTS game but it's lacking in every department other than the department that (again) nobody cares about.

Keep in mind this is my opinion, not a fact. I encourage everyone who sees this review to play it themselves and decide. 

The user interface a bit over complicated. It's not hard to learn, it just takes the fun out of playing the actual game.  If you compare other tutorials from other strategy games like Xcom or Civilisation 6, it's easier to digest. However still complex in a way. But that's just me. Play it yourself, u might be happy with it! 

However, this game should focus on making the battles more fun and aesthetically pleasing. The heart and soul of any RTS game (especially a Terminator one) are the battles, and unique/creative designs of the world and how that intertwines with game-play and worldbuilding for a more enriching experience. Sure, this game has the aspect of using the environment for a strategic advantage, but there's something lacking in this game's world building, immersion, and perhaps even the game-play design. It sucks me right out. And i feel like i'm playing a soul dead licensed game.  

In my opinion, you can't make a RTS Terminator game without the TERMINATOR FLARE. Without being up close and personal, to see the enemy face to face.  Like Xcom 2, which is a Turn based strategy game. So we can be immersed in the Terminator world.  Maybe this game would've been better as a Simulation RTS Terminator game. Almost like Total War, with a free roam camera. And replays. Maybe even a theatre mode, to watch battles after you play them. Or Real time attack cut-scenes. (Ordering troops to attack with trigger a real time camera giving the P.O.V or a wide shot footage of the exchange during NPC animation. (In a way that doesnt affect RTS gamplay of course) Then returning to the original P.O.V.
 

This game feels like a game that you play at an arcade on a Saturday night, with outdated aesthetic choices and designs. :(

One of the campaign missions is bugged, the mission where you have to protect the doctor? Yeah, I evacuated the doctor and wounded civilians. Yet mission continued to play on infinitely. Motivation to continue to campaign was pretty much done there.

The cover system in this game is weird. You can utilize buildings, cool, but you can't really hide behind rocks or downed trees. Infantry units can't take the high ground such as mountains or whatever, they can mostly travel on flat land or hills. 

Vehicle repairs were almost instantenous. Throwing off immersion. I couldn't tell what health my squads had, they'd almost instantly heal themselves to full strength. 

Giving up on the campaign, I moved to skimrish. You earn 6,000 income per (x) amount of seconds. Eventually in the battle you can call in stronger units. But overall, it becomes a cluttered mess with all the unit spam. 

I gave this game a chance, seeing how slitherine would perform in a RTS like this. Their games are usually hexagonal turn by turn games, designed for old gamers. They're usually deep and sophisticated, but not very fun. So I was a bit eager to see what Slitherine could bring to the table. 

Needless to say, I'm just disappointed. Another buggy unfinished game on the market. Really feels like RTS is dying out? I am so tired of these developers pushing gimmicky crap onto the market all to make an easy dollar. 

I guess I'm going back to gates of hell and other RTS games that feel sophisticated, engaging, and fun to play.

First thing as you open it you notice the UI is very dated and somewhat blurry/smudged, as if it was made for a single resolution and upscaled for all others. Loading into the game the game tells you what's loading as if it was an editor, waiting on 20000 objects spawning in as a incremental number. Not too much of a complaint but adding to this overall feel of a very dated game.

Game camera movement is sluggish with some stutters on powerful hardware, screen transitioning just doesn't feel right. Animations on the characters are clunky and ugly, model quality is low, everything is so zoomed out you can barely tell what is what in a game drawing strengths from its IP. The initial introduction to the story was just so uninspired with the humans sounding more artificial than the terminators. You're a cop, don't you know this is a military channel! I guess I'm taking over! Okay then! Just...very weak.

The campaign wasn't drawing me in so I tried out Skirmish and from the Terminator/Legion side it doesn't seem to be like an RTS, you're just spawning in units on a budget just like Warhammer Total War custom battles, but the UI was so unintuitive that it was hard to grasp what was going on despite having played RTS games for 21 years.

For those who played Men of war and company of heroes should be familiar with most general mechanics.
This game has similar Men of war cover based system, ammo count, and vehicle damage display with company of heroes type unit squad selection, building cover system, and reporting movement or activities.

Ammo type do play a mechanic in this game for it mainly of what caliber it is and how much can it penetrate set target.
So a 5.56 or 9mm can easily handle robo doggys and homonculis (humanoid robots). However it ain't gonna scratch a actual terminator but a 50. cal or anything thats an autocannon could put them in there place. Vehicles is pretty much no brainer, Does the autocannon damage? > yes > lawn mower them, Does the autocannon penetrate them? > no > use anything related to HEAT (High Explosive Anti-Tank) shells.

There are 3 factions to choose from with there own play styles. Legion being a slow but sturdy robot faction, The Movement being mobile but squishy humans, and The Founders being humans with actual body armor, familiar military equipment, and vehicles.

If new to the game and you're starting off the game into skirmish believe me you will get swiss cheesed cause many mechanic are reviled to you in the story campaign (which so far I like). I was one of those people that play skirmish first then play story later to get the feel of the game.

Is it bugging out? Haven""t found one yet so far
Is it worth the price? I would say well worth

CONS - a lot of things dont work, and need a patch.. just 4 maps in skirmish?? why ?? 
For example i get 8000 points every few minutes no matter how many territories i control. this does not make any sense.. the speed of points must depend on amount of territories (like in COH) otherwise what's the point capturing?
Soldiers inside the buildings become completely immortal which does not make any sense in a game which goes for realism.
Everyone moves in slo motion, too slow and not that fun.

Right there in the pantheon of personal favorites along Company of Heroes!

An amazing experience with a outstanding campaign that changes massively based on your choices and performance in battle, as well as offering massive replayability with an efficient economy on the world map.

A huge warning, this is branded as Dark Fate, but in truth, this plays like the best Future War Terminator 2 universe they could have made. Way above the film's world in both depth, immersion and credibility!
Defiance & Resistance are the 2 sequels the franchise needed, thanks for continuing the story as it deserved to be treated.
