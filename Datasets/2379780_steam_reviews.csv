It has a few tricks as to why I enjoy it.
1. There's no story or pressure to actually win runs beyond unlocking more stuff.
2. The random generation actually makes for immense replayability in this one, as it's not about mastering any kind of layouts or mechanics. Even cards you've seen a million times can have completely different meanings in new constellations.
3. The game gives you the seed to your run when you win or lose, allowing you to replay or share it.

It's not that this game will appeal to everyone, but rather that just about anyone who thought they might like it definitely did. What does that mean for you? It simply means that if you think the screenshots look interesting, then you'll almost certainly like it.

The game is pretty straight-forward. A single play-through is all it takes to figure out all of the basic mechanics. You draw a hand of playing cards, discard and redraw up to a set number of times, and try to make the best poker hands. Better hands earn more points and you want as many of those as possible. Once you earn the threshold amount of points, you get to move on with a few dollars added to your pocket.

In between each set of hands, you get to visit a shop where you can buy things with the money you've earned. Some of the things to buy include Joker Cards (which tweak the rules for the run while sitting outside your deck), Tarot Cards (which are single-use abilities, most of which modify individual cards in some way), Celestial Cards (which improve the scores of individual hands you might play), Regular Cards (which you add to the basic 52 card deck), or Tickets (which are kind of like Jokers, but don't take up one of the limited Joker spots). You can also sell off Jokers that you aren't using anymore when you're ready to pivot your strategy.

There are a ton of different cards in each of the categories and getting further (or earning achievements) unlocks new ones that will start randomly spawning in the pool every time the shop refreshes.

I saw someone else on here complaining that the game required a ton of math. That is very false. You certainly could try to work out the exact number of points that any particular play would earn you (factoring in all of the modifiers that are about to affect your score), but that level of detail and foresight is simply unnecessary. Almost always, the highest scoring play that's available to you at any moment is fairly obvious. In the rare case that it isn't obvious, it's usually because a couple of different plays will score similarly. Either way, it's normally pretty safe to act without a whole lot of anxiety or analysis. Stress in this game doesn't come from a pressure to do math, but rather the constant testing of your tolerance for risk. Should you take the Joker that gives you more points or the one that gives you more money? More money might be better in the long run, but that won't matter if you can't earn enough points to survive until you get to the next shop. These are the hard decisions.

The game is very well done for what it is. I can't think of too many ways that it could be improved. As I said in the beginning, if it looks to you like you might like it, then you almost certainly will. I have no reservations about giving it a firm recommendation to anyone who's even a bit curious.

Poker is both the game's strength and its weakness.

It's a strength because anyone with even a passing familiarity with Poker will have no problem getting into the flow, and its simplicity makes for a low effort casual experience.

It's a weakness because you're bound by the conventions of Poker, however overlaying Balatro's game mechanics on top breaks some fundamental parts of that game. For example, with Poker you'd mostly be happy with a high pair of face cards, whereas Balatro has you pulling flushes on the first roll and thereby immediately devaluing that as an achievement. If you ever have to play down a single pair in this game you may as well just about concede your entire run at that point. Seriously.

This gives the game nowhere to go for those big pay off moments, like laying a full house of 2s and 3s over the top of a couple of pairs of aces and queens. Instead, Balatro is mostly about just watching your score get bigger and bigger.

On a similar note, the odds and associated payoffs are flawed because they're based on Poker odds, they're not adjusted for this game's quirks. For example, Balatro has both much larger hand sizes and also much more capacity for draw. This strongly favours flushes, which are generously rewarded, over pairs/triples/four of a kind because there's 13 of each suit and only 4 of each rank.

The game also lacks any type of theme other than some quirky joker pictures, you're just watching hearts and clubs. (One might argue that this is inevitable when you're stuck with a standard 52 card deck, but there are many solitaire variants that make theming work really well.)

Balatro trades Poker's push your luck tension and simplicity for something that is ultimately less interesting, that is, ride the wave of higher and higher scores until the game breaks your strat by changing the rules on you without notice - which should be a cardinal sin in a game that only allows you to make tiny incremental tweaks along the way, and that absolutely does not reward flexible deck building.

Balatro isn't badly done, and it's got the usual addictive qualities of slot machines and other gambling-based games, but it's only a soft recommendation from me. Something significant has been missed in trading the satisfaction of laying down an amazing hand against the odds for something that is ultimately much less interesting - tweaking your score multipliers over multiple rounds while you play essentially the same hand, round after round, until either the game breaks you or you break the game.",1708773413,1708858628,True,85,1,0.689485311508178711,19,True,False,False

- [b] Unlear effects and numbers  [/b]
     This refers to the problem in many rougelikes where you get an item and it says something like ""Improves attack damage when an enemy is frozen"" or in some cases just says some flavor text like ""toxic"". This tells the player nothing about what the item or whatever does and it makes it very difficult to get into, many times requiring wikis open or other such things. In many cases, even when the stats and effects are clear, it can be very difficult to figure out how good it is before you pick it up, and sometimes even after you pick it up. This makes it take quite a while to really get into a rougelike because there is so much knowledge you have to learn to know what items are good and which suck.
     Balatro solves this by having each card description being relatively simple and very clear. It helps that the base of the game is simple too. The scoring system is also pretty simple to understand, to the point where you can calculate things on your own if you so choose (which I have done on a few occasions - its fun). When you play a hand, you clearly see how each joker effects your score and how they effect each other. This helps you get into the game quickly by very clearly showing you what each and every item does

- [b] Poor balance [/b]
     This is something thats hard to do, so I understand it, but many rougelikes suffer from it. What I mean by ""poor balance"" more specifically here is a decent amount of items that are either insanely run-winningly good and/or items that sound neat but end up being complete and udder trash. This creates runs where you get wins that you didn't really work for along with runs where you try to commit to a certain strategy or build that ends up sucking because the balance is off. This ties into the point above but it gets worse when something is really bad but it isn't obvious how bad it is. 
     Balatro isn't perfect about balance, but it feels a lot better than other rougelikes I've played. I've not encountered a joker that has been so good it won my run on its own, and I also haven't encountered any jokers that are uselessly bad, and even if they are, the game makes it pretty clear that its gonna suck. Even so, they usually work in some build somewhere, or have a niche during a certain point in a run which makes them useful. 

- [b] Obscure build knowledge [/b]
     This one is a real big problem with rougelikes. Many rougelikes out there are very very unclear about what builds you can go for and if they are even worth your time at all. The items may give some impressions here and there, but many times it will be difficult to tell if its worth it to commit to. There is also the case in some games where certain mechanics or calculations that are INCREDIBLY obtuse and unclear to the player are INSANELY important to the game and creating good builds. It also hurts when games try to make a bunch of items for certain types of builds, but those builds are god awful because they don't work within the game very well.
     Again, Balatro solves this with incredibly clear synergy and calculation. As I said above, you can calculate what is going to happen yourself so when you are thinking if a certain card is worth it or not, you can do the math to figure it out. Not many other games have that ability. The way the game is played, again, is also very simple which makes builds pretty easy to figure out. I've found a lot of success and fun in this game by buying a decent joker early on and trying to commit hard to building around it, and it works!

- [b] Crazy skill checks [/b]
     This could be considered a good thing I guess, but I tend to have issue with it. What I mean is when a rougelike throws a boss at you that you've never seen before and you die very quickly. Then, in order to fight it again you have to play a whole new run, get to that point, die, and then try again. It makes it really hard to learn patterns and learn how to fight the bosses, especially when they are late game or don't always appear.
     Balatro solves this by not really having much player skill involved. Most of Balatro is figuring out which build would be the best, making tricky decisions, and hedging your bets. The ""skill"" in balatro is knowing when to discard and what to discard to achieve which hand. Everything else is trying to figure out which item or card or whatever will help your build the most. It's also a chill game without any urgency which means you can take your time and think a lot if you so please. 


To be fair to other rougelikes, many games solve some of these problems on their own, and I'm sure there are games other than Balatro that don't have any of these issues. My main point, really, is that Balatro gets you to the ""end game"" of a rougelike much quicker than others do. By ""end game"" I mean when you get a lot of knowledge and experience in a game and know what you want to do and what decisions to make and what is good. 

Essentially Balatro is good and a ton of fun if you love to strategize and think about numbers. I love it.",1708845393,1708845393,True,2,0,0.537537515163421631,0,True,False,False

Good for gambling addicts looking to save money. Bad for deckbuilding players who don't want burnout from RNG-rot.

Art-style is fun, love the joker card aesthetics and the creativity to find so many variations. However, the sheer volume of variation reeks of 'what else can we come up with to get to 150' rather than a statistically-supported collection of Joker cards that encourage the player to find synergies. Instead, I feel very discouraged because of constantly poor RNG while drawing from bloated decks and bloated perk pools filled with meh perks that rarely connect together. Even if they do, 'bosses' can still be OP, especially since there's little to no time to change how your deck and jokers might play in order to compensate for a boss's negative effect.

Maybe the roguelike roll-out of more powerful perks is too slow.
But where I'm at in the game, with plenty of perks unlocked, the feeling is overwhelming that this is a grind against RNG.

I'm a fan of roguelike card games (I've enjoyed MTG drafting for over a decade now), and the art and aesthetic of this game are gorgeous. I've played daily since release! And in fact, for the first 30 or so hours, I think Balatro is a joy to play, and I'd highly recommend it.

However, the more I play, the shallower the gameplay loop feels. Without spoiling too much, there's more-or-less an ""optimal"" strategy for maximizing hand points, and once you figure it out, most runs follow the same ""arc"" -- you look for the same types of cards in the early game, the mid game, and the late game. ([spoiler]Hafu figured out Hack + Glass + Red Seal in the invitational tournament, and I was really hoping there would be more depth to the late late game than that, but sadly X multipliers + retriggers really do rule the roost when it comes to exponential hand growth. You just can't progress past Ante 12 without abandoning pretty much all +Chips/+Mult-type modifiers.[/spoiler])

There are a few really cool combos, where cards synergize super well together and feel awesome when they work (such as [spoiler]Midas Mask + Pareidolia + Vampire[/spoiler]), but these kinds of interactions are relatively rare. I found that far more often I'd encounter antisynergistic ""nonbos"" or completely useless/dead cards, leading to frustration as I reroll and pray that I get one of the 5-10 cards that would actually elevate a given run to ""viable"" status.

The developers do try to add novelty to the game (through challenges, alternate decks, boss blinds, and rare occurrences). But, I find that it's still not enough to break free from the core limitations of the engine (A 52 card playing pool, with only + and x being the main score modifiers). After a while, it starts to feel more like ""numbers go up"" and nothing more.

My main suggestion to the devs would be to minimize the amount of ""dead weight"" common jokers (there's a lot of redundancy!!), and add new jokers that foster neat interactions. Also, perhaps add additional jokers that balance the lower tier hands? [spoiler]Almost all of my wins revolve around flush-based decks, with some straights and full houses mixed in. By comparison, there's very little reward for pursuing a high card/pair/two pair build.[/spoiler] I would be playing much more if I didn't have to slog through the boring jokers just to find the small subset of jokers that create a meaningful, interesting run. 

(I'll be keeping an eye out for future updates, though, and I'll happily revise my review if it turns out that the game has more replayability than v1.0.0 does! There's so so so much promise here.)",1708834346,1708834408,False,0,0,0.433789968490600586,0,True,False,False

In the realm of gaming, there exists a term that transcends mere entertainment; it's a concept so profound that it demands attention. Enter ""Balatro"" – a name whispered among the elite, a game that defies conventional labels and redefines what it means to be truly engrossed in the art of play.

Derived from the Latin word meaning ""a jester"" or ""a buffoon,"" Balatro is anything but foolish. It's a symphony of strategy and chance, elegantly orchestrated within the confines of a digital deckbuilder. But to reduce Balatro to a mere deckbuilder is to miss the point entirely – it is an experience that transcends genres, a hypnotic journey into the heart of illegal poker hands and adrenaline-fueled gambits.

At its core, Balatro is a roguelike adventure where every hand is a gamble and every decision holds weight. The allure of forbidden poker games beckons, drawing players into a world where discovery and mastery collide. Each card drawn unveils new possibilities, each joker discovered unlocks the potential for outrageous combos that leave even the most seasoned players in awe.

But what truly sets Balatro apart is its ability to captivate, to ensnare the senses and command attention. The gameplay is nothing short of hypnotic – a delicate dance of strategy and chance, where every move is a calculated risk and every victory a triumph of skill. It's a testament to the artistry of game design, a masterpiece crafted with care and precision.

From its sleek visuals to its immersive sound design, Balatro is a feast for the senses. Every pixel is a brushstroke, every note a melody – together, they form a symphony of sights and sounds that transport players to a world where anything is possible.

In conclusion, Balatro isn't just a game – it's an experience. A testament to the boundless creativity of indie developers, it stands as a shining example of what happens when passion meets innovation.

1. Shop RNG, You need an economy joker or tag early otherwise you can't scale enough, and an Xmult joker later on to meet the high scores as +mult no longer scales enough ( Ihad a time where I spent all my money rerolling with 4 shop slots, 6 rerolls with no xmult joker, and then lost the run even though I made the correct decision)
2. Deck draw RNG, I understand it's an inherent part of the genre, but when you start with 52 cards, and can only remove 2 at a time if you're lucky, you don't feel in control and just along for the ride

Reallly difficult, as you have to manage your economy, but quite fun. Wish there was an option to review your last hand while in the shop.

Suggestions for devs:
-Add an estimate for how many chips your selected hand will score
-In game stats overlay showing stats on cards for how will you did after buying it in the past

[h2] Detailed Review: [/h2]
This game came out on my birthday and I spent more hours on this game than I did actually working my full time job. I found out about this game a month ago and didn't get to play the demo until NextFest. I put over 20 hours into the demo and completed it, but still played. On release day, I was amazed to find that it had so much content. There's over 10 types of starting decks, 100's of Jokers, and various cards/combinations. 

The goal of the game is to reach the final Ante (level). In the demo there were only 5 Antes, but in the full game to ""win"" you must beat 8 Antes. However, after completely 8 antes there is actually an endless mode where you can test the limits of the deck that you've been building. 

When you first start the game you are asked to choose a starting deck. Each starting deck has it's on starting ""ability"" and each Ante there is a Small Blind, Big Blind, and the Boss Blind. There is a set number of Poker Hands you are able to play from cards you are dealt. Usually, the rarer hands give better scores. Each blind there is a set score to reach to defeat the blind and failure send you back to the main menu. The higher the Ante, the higher the set score or base score there is to beat. Each Boss Blind features a unique Boss with special abilities/debuffs, which could immediately ruin your run. Beating a blind gives you some money and allows you to visit the Shop.

Deck building is extremely fun in this game and amount of combinations is endless. In the Shop, you can find options to improve your starting deck/run with Jokers, Tarot Cards, Planet Cards, and Vouchers for a price. Jokers have their own unique abilities that can improve your cards, type of hand played, multipliers to your score, and more. Tarot cards and Planet cards are consumables. Tarot cards have abilities to alter your deck and improve your deck. Usually allowing you to enhance(buff) your cards, generate money, create/copy card, and more. Planet cards are used to upgrade specific Poker hands that you may gravitate to (probably why they are called planets... I can't believe it took me this long to realize). Last but not least, Vouchers are unique cards that apply a buff that range from increasing your Hand size or increasing money gained. Only one can be found per Ante, but I don't want to spoil you any further!

Perhaps the poker theme (you don't need to know anything about poker) helps the simplicity of playing, but it's the amount of variables - all cleverly and carefully delivered at EXACTLY the right moment - and how they keep progressing the game and your will to play just another game.

To be clear there is no actual gambling, and it's not really poker either. Your addiction to this game will be to the mechanics, so perfectly drip-fed and the sheer playability. And it is very, very playable.

But the real game is in everything that is built *around* that concept. The careful selection of joker cards to customize your strategies. Balancing the money you spend on upgrading hand values and rolling the dice on a wide variety of interesting card attributes that change the rules of the game. 

This game takes the opposite approach to what you typically see in a rogue like. Normally the gameplay itself is where the fun is had and the upgrades and choices add flavor and interest to it. In Balatro's case the gameplay itself is really quite simple and bland. But its the upgrades and choices that ARE the game.",1708803265,1708803265,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In the demo, you play quite a few Antes up to the 100k point boss and when you beat it, the demo ends. Pardon me for assuming, but that would imply that there is more to the game than the 100k boss.
This is not the case. The full game also ends after the 100k final boss. You are given the option for ""endless mode"" afterwards, which rather than the normal linear scaling you get playing through the game the first time, you get 3-4 more Antes before you're expected to hit 100,200,000 points to beat the boss. The scaling becomes exponential. It feels designed to stop you from playing. Rather than getting to explore more of the game, trying different things out, and seeing how strong you can grow, it throws a brick wall at you. 
You are forced to have a godly set up to keep going after the 100k point boss - which I remind you, was the final boss of the demo - except now you get to pay $15 to do it.
This means the demo basically IS the full game. I have played for 5 hours now, and have beat the ""final"" boss numerous times at this point, and never once was it an enjoyable experience in endless mode. Having a really exciting set up where I'm scaling off of all kinds of mechanics, playing 300k point hands, and then the boss going from 1,120,000 -> 10,200,000 requirement in exactly 3 rounds is absurd. 
This was the first game in a long time I was genuinely excited to pick up. I kept trying and trying to find where the joy from the demo was, but the joy of the demo was the idea there was a whole world behind the curtain; I paid $15 to find out it was a brick wall.

THE GOOD:
The game is overall very solid roguelike built on the top of poker scoring rules.
It has ton of gameplay options, replayability, and fun combinations and options to deck your deck.
Some combos are really crazy.
Overall very fun and addictive.
Great visuals, card tactility, sound and atmosphere.
THE BAD
It is using poker rules, but doesn’t translate good bits from poker such as folding, betting or all ining.
There is no real foe you play against, just artificial score goals.
One bad draw can ruin a good run.
One bad boss can ruin a good run with no way to prepare for it.-Boss rerolling should be a default option.
Overall, RNG is too strong-there are too many options/Jokers to branch and too little opportunity on how shop rolling can even help you. 
The ""number game"" is too highrolly on both ends, sometimes making some runs a joke and sometimes totaly discrediting good plays simply because cicrcumstances turn them irrelevant.

So overall, a very good game in its core, unlike endless Slay the Spire clones, with very original and fun concept! Too bad it has heart of a slot machine rather than its inspiration, poker!

I would say surely worth 15 bucks, but do not give to the overwhelmingly positive reviews. There is tad bit too much focus on quantitty and shop RNG and lack of the refined number game, that the king, Slay the Spire, still wins in uncontested.",1708802916,1708802916,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've played for about 50 ish hours including the 2 demo's I participated in. My first real win that I was happy with was stacking supernova with high card and getting 18k per round. That was when I still played the game at a surface level. Let me tell you, the ways to play the game are insanely high. You wanna add 100 cards to your deck? There's a joker to help with that. You want to have exactly 30 kings and nothing else? There's some jokers that can help with that. You wanna play around steel and gold cards and holding valuable in hand buffs? Theres a few jokers for that too. All this on top of the base expected ways of playing the game.

In the demo's the way people were getting the highest scores were with getting one of the 3 ""secret"" poker hands that the game lets you use and using 2-5's with glass and red seals with the joker ""Hack"" and getting 150 billion points or something like that. With ALL of the new content and all the ways to play being increased in intensity, you can hit those somewhat regularly with the right lucky combo. You want to see how crazy the game can get? Watch some of the very dedicated content creators or follow along with your favorite creators as they begin to play it.

Without giving away too much, yes, the game is really good and can be played for hours by accident. If you're having trouble, play a few rounds of the basic deck and try to run the deck that starts you with an additional 10 gold. It's probably the easiest deck with the lowest requirement to think about. I really enjoy the game and I know most people who read this will too. If this is on sale, just remember what I said above. This is a steal of a game for base price. Imagine the value at 10% or 25% off.",1708788389,1708788389,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love that games like this are RNG focused but it just feels too RNG based to get a run going past the first boss blind.
The modifiers for the bosses are pretty stupid as well like having to win in 1 hand only seems too much unless you have a 1 in 100 run going or the one that draws cards face down so you have to completely guess what you have.
I had a run where I was upgrading cards to give me +mult and didn't see them for the next 5 blinds, i just feel like having 52 cards of the bat doesn't work but that's the nature of the game with it being an actual card deck.

Balatro is a masterpiece, everything from the music, to the unlockable content, to the difficulty spikes and challenges along the way, they all scream ADDICTIVE. The music is extremely catchy and I find myself humming along to it, I'm not even halfway done the game yet, its been a smooth 25 hours that definitely does not FEEL like 25 hours put in. 

The art style makes you feel joy and butterflies when you see a rare joker in your shop, or even the sound effects from getting something like a poly-chrome joker, everything about this game is perfect and I don't ever see myself getting tired of it. The best part, is that its super beginner friendly! 

I know most people do not know the game of poker, or the hands it holds, but this game does not hold your hand, nor does it punish you for your lack of knowledge, everything is laid out very clean in the user interface and joker cards, save for a few, are very well explained in what they do. I could keep going on and on.

This game is a must try for anyone, music lovers, rogue-like enjoyers, deck building lovers, and even just casual gamers will all have a blast! Truly a special release, thank you LocalThunk for this 10/10 masterpiece.

I won on my 5th run or so and got to Endless Mode (and lost at Ante 10 and Round 26) without getting to truly spend a lot of time with the game, hopefully it still feels replayable and I can get a lot of enjoyment out of it still.

I didn't know how to play Poker before buying this but it's really helpful for learning because I picked it up really fast.

This game is soooo complex and there's so many interactions that it's almost breathtaking, I can't even think of a game to compare it with really but it's amazing when your mind gets flooded with potentiality when you see certain cards and so on, it's extremely pleasurable to play.

My deck basically worked with the following, you'll see very quickly how strong it is:

Jolly Joker (Switched out for Half Joker later)
Half Joker (Bought very late in the run)
Blue Joker
Green Joker
Supernova
Card Sharp

Would love to be able to see a run history on the main menu and at the end of your game like Slay the Spire has.

The seed is included in the screenshots if you're interested in that.

S: Slay the Spire
A: Monster Train
B-D: Everything Else

For those that care, 200+ hours and A20 cleared in StS, 140 hours and A24 cleared in Monster Train

Balatro is definitely in A tier for me, maybe S tier. Here is my reasoning why:

 - Upcoming threats are communicated to the player in advance to allow them to prepare. In Slay the Spire, these were the Act bosses, Monster Train had the 3 bosses, and Balatro lets you view your Ante boss 3 rounds in advance. Games like Griftlands really failed in this regard imo, so I'm glad Balatro learned from those mistakes.
 - Threats are meaningful. In Slay the Spire/Monster Train, different bosses required different strategies and punished decks that were too one-dimensional (this is a good thing). Balatro works similarly, with some really nasty modifiers that can end a run if you don't leave some flexibility.
 - There are a variety of viable builds that can win you runs, or at least Balatro has variety in the first couple difficulties.

However, the thing that really pushes Balatro into the S tier for me is the spectacle. Slay the Spire and Monster Train aren't ugly games, but they aren't gorgeous. Balatro is. You really have to play it to get what I mean, but the audio and visual cues make the gameplay loop feel incredible.

Positives:
-Great core gameplay loop even if you're not familiar with poker hands.
-It's VERY easy to sit down and play this for hours and hours. There's enough variety in deck builds to keep the game fresh for probably 30-40 hours (conservative estimate) if you wanted to try every kind of build.
-The game does almost every thing right in a deck building game. It's 100% worth trying for at least the 2 hours to see if it's a game you'd enjoy playing.

Cons:
-The music loops ends less abruptly as it pulls you out of the immersion.

Request from dev:
-I wish the game was clearer on telling you exactly how the hand would play out after taking all your jokers into account. It can be hard to tell in the end game if it's better to use a card that gives you +30 coins, or x4 multiplier.
-More music loops! If you had different music for each deck, that'd be the chef's kiss on this great game.

wait... whats that? you don't like poker? Oh ummm well
DO YOU LIKE ROGUELIKES?
THEN YOU'LL LOVE BALATRO ANYWAY

Balatro is an excellent deck builder roguelike whether you like poker and/or roguelikes. I first played as someone who has not played a lot of poker, does not know poker hands and is not a fan of poker but does like deckbuilders. What makes the poker aspect to Balatro so genius is it works so well as a vehicle for the main ideas and mechanics of the game. Poker players get drawn in by the body of the vehicle while deckbuilder and roguelike connoisseurs get drawn in by whats under the hood. The demo was another genius move as while it was missing content, it felt like a full game already which draw myself and many others I know in immediately.

The music is perfect to make you feel relaxed but not distracted (although maybe unlockable records to change music could be cool), the builds in the game are extremely diverse and full of synergy, the starting decks all feel like they give you a new way to approach making a new build and the game feels different enough every run to make you want to play over and over again

Different profiles allowing people to do speedruns and challenge runs is a extra sweet bonus

There are so many pluses to this game and I am sure I'll keep finding more, I highly recommend giving this a try

If I was to give any fault to Balatro, it would be this:

1) The Arm (Blind) feels extremely punishing as just seeing it coming up can feel like your run is already over. it bodies so many builds by reducing the level before scoring and still being a x2 base. It maybe should be reduced to 1.5x. I honestly feel like every other blind can be played around but the Arm just feels like you either have what you need to beat it or you lose.

EDIT: The Arm did get patched same day I wrote this so now it can't level a hand down below lv1 so that feels a lot more fair now

2) I don't know quite how the anti calculates the next set of blinds after you beat a boss blind but I went from a 20M boss blind to a 300M small blind in endless. The jump seemed a bit unfair as it meant my build that was handily beating all blinds with a single hand of my worst hand suddenly lost immediately after using all 4 of my hands and still only being 151M/300M. My best hand was 44M. I think the jump is a tad high and means you have to have a very specific game breaking build to keep climbing. Endless in this sense doesn't really feel like endless it just feels like a test to see if your build is in the top like 10% of best builds ever made by anyone in the game.

The only reason I really have a problem with this is because in any endless mode in games where you build up synergies or builds of something whether it be decks or builds in roguelikes, defenses in tower defense games, armies in RTS etc One of the most fun things is getting the time to keep working on that build to get it to its peak. Maybe the build your playing is only in the top 50% of the best builds anyone has ever played but its a fun build that you enjoyed and to get into endless and to get utterly destroyed in just a few rounds hurts.",1708743418,1708743890,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Easy to learn and hard to master, as every good strategy game should be. After putting 40 hours in the last 3 days, I know a thing or two about the mechanics. However, run after run I find myself using new strategies and synergies that I hadn't thought of before. I was worried that this game would turn into a ""collect a card"" simulator (looking for the same combo every time), but every build has some viability to at least ante 8.

[b] YES THERE'S SOME LUCK INVOLVED [/b] I mean no crap, its a poker based game, but they do a fantastic job balancing the RNG out where just like real poker, [b] SKILL [/b] prevails in the end.

I was introduced to this by YouTuber Hotcyder: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwSifK7FTvk, and was fascinated by the idea of ""Baby's First Roguelike"", which is counter intuitive, as roguelikes aren't designed to hold your hand.  Well... Balatro doesn't.  It's tutorial drops you into the game, shows you how it works... and leaves.  It doesn't matter if you luck out to the 8th ante or fall on your face in the 2nd, it assumes you will fail, and anticipates your return.  But the beauty of this one is how addicting it is and how quick it is to get back into the fray.  You unlock Jokers and Decks the more you play that can improve your performance, and can even adjust your difficulty if you're getting froggy; they know you want to try to win big or go home.

Now, with the full release, I can say with confidence that [b]Balatro is one of the best games I've played in a very long time, and will more than likely be my personal 2024 GOTY.[/b] While this review is long, I believe it should provide a detailed look at the best that Balatro has to offer.

I would like to consider myself a roguelike veteran. I've sunk many hundreds of combined hours across genre classics like The Binding of Isaac or FTL, alongside many slightly more obscure releases like Noita, Nuclear Throne, and Monster Train, ranging well across to award-winners like Hades, Slay the Spire, and Inscryption. Of these games, I have 100%-ed Gungeon, Throne, Hades, and Isaac (with Repentance). I note this experience not to show off, but to add weight to the following statement:
[b]Balatro, to me, is the compulsion of the roguelike distilled into its purest form, and has instantly entered the upper echelon of what I would describe as the shining examples of the genre.[/b]

The game does so many things right that it would be difficult to list them all, so I'll pick out a few personal favourites.
[list]
	[*]Balatro's atmosphere, simplicity, and design are so well done that my partner - a self-confessed ""casual"" who occasionally plays Animal Crossing - sat at my computer, played two runs, and immediately went home and bought a copy on their Switch. I can't think of a higher vote of confidence, if my constant recommendations to play Outer Wilds aren't enough.
	[*]The game's mechanics are easy to understand and compelling to the point of obsession. The entire concept invites you to learn the rules just to turn them inside out. I've built winning runs around every single hand, from the lowly High Card to the heady Flush Five. You'll be putting together synergies on the fly you didn't even realise were possible, only to beat the final boss playing a single hand after carefully constructing your perfect combo.
	[*]The pixel art, with one exception, is all created by the single developer and is gorgeous throughout  - with zero exceptions. It has been a long time since I have enjoyed the art of a game so directly, presented in such an enjoyable way. Every single deck, joker, blind, and background sports art that is a joy just to look at, and every single detail is legible. Once you've got yourself that polychrome glass ace with a red seal, you won't even squint to tell it apart from other cards.
	[*]Balatro has replayability in spades, and that's an understatement. 15 starting decks all have unique and masterfully designed abilities, and each can be brought up through 8 stake difficulties, similar mechanically to Ascensions in StS. The difficulty curve is finely tuned and just right, though there is a spike between stake 4-5. If 120 total stakes wasn't enough, 20 challenge runs provide special starting scenarios with unique rules to shake up the formula.
	[*]If you're a completionist like me, Balatro might even be too much. Every single one of the 150 jokers tracks whether you've won with it on each stake difficulty, distilled into a progress bar on how many of the 1200 stickers you've collected. I'm going to be playing this one for quite a while.
	[*]The progression and rate of unlocking things is just right. The first few runs all supply you with a swathe of new content, right when the thrill of discovery is highest, and this rate simmers down as you become more comfortable with the game's systems and mechanics. At that point, you can start working towards unlocks that ask you to do more specific tasks to help fill out that joker collection. Memorable examples include discarding a royal flush, or beating the game while only playing half the rounds available.
[/list]
If it wasn't already clear, I am of the opinion that Balatro is outstanding and far beyond the quality of many AAA games released in recent times. For a single developer to have created a product as wonderful, polished, and plain enjoyable as this is a testament to the fact that there are still exceptional developers doing equally exceptional things with their ability. I cannot wait to see what LocalThunk does next, but I have to admit I hope it's a paid expansion to my favourite game since Outer Wilds.",1708733752,1708734072,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Okay, that's out of the way. Now, I wanna use this space to talk about my favourite part of Balatro: the variety of challenges.

You want to beat a normal game with a normal deck? Go for it. That's great. Your deck will probably look pretty standard.
You want to beat a game with a weird deck? Sure. Enjoy your weird deck.
You want to get to the end of endless mode? No problem, you can build your deck for that as well. Good luck, you'll need it.
You want to play a standard game with restrictions to make it harder? No problem, each starting deck has a difficulty ladder.
You want to play a game with restrictions AND get to the end of endless mode? Sure, we won't stop ya.
You want to tackle some bizarre challenges with really specific rules? Yup, we've got that too.

This flexibility is what makes the game special. Balatro is a game I can reach for when I want a quick 20 minute challenge OR a grueling 2 hour mathfest. The mechanics are the same.

Stellar game, so fun, so easy to get into but hard to master. a genuinely fun and enjoyable experience.
The only thing you need to know is what poker hands there are, and even if you don't know that, there's a button that tells you what hands there are! Anyone can jump into this and play this and enjoy it.
It's definitely a bit spicy in the difficulty department, i've won a few runs but it can be very tough.
It is fairly rng-heavy, you can easily get screwed out of a win by getting unlucky, but vice versa you can also clinch victory from the jaws of defeat with sheer luck.

Pros: Simple, A lot of depth, easy to hop into for a quick 20 min session, a lot of Joker variance, fun exciting effects/buffs.

Despite that a friend suggested I try it, and I'm thankful I did because there is no doubt in my mind this is a new indie game classic. Balatro will cause you to lose track of time, it is a joy to interact with (loads fast, responsive to input almost always), and has an aesthetic that just vibes.

If that isn't clear enough: I think most folks looking at game reviews on Steam will enjoy this game. So who would I not recommend the game for? Folks who don't enjoy deckbuilders, those who prefer roguelikes with more of a grindy progression, gamers who primarily enjoy story based games, and those primarily interested in direct competitive multiplayer games.

Lastly, here's some minor nitpicks:
1. Would love to see keyboard shortcuts for playing the game without a mouse.
2. I've only won the first couple of difficulties, but I've found nearly all runs become flush or straight based.
3. With at most 3 rounds per ante there often isn't enough time to counter play the upcoming boss. Some runs just end when a challenging boss appears in the second or third ante and I haven't had a chance to make my deck flexible yet. It's entirely possible there's a skill issue on my side, but I'm not convinced most runs are winnable even at the lower difficulties.

[h2]Balatro, on the surface, SEEMS like a fun game of optimizing and deck building and pulling off crazy combinations, but unfortunately, it actually turns into a game of ""do lots of math and equations repeatedly to make sure your score is what you expect it to be,"" especially deep in a run.[/h2] Personally, I don't enjoy doing tons of math just to play a game, so if you don't either, I advise that you stay away from this game, much as it's fun initially.

On top of that, Balatro has a very fun gameplay loop, but very poor explanation. How to win, for example, is never explained anywhere (but poker hands, something far more people will be familiar with, are explained in great detail), nor is the exact effect of certain mechanics like the significance of rounds vs ante, etc.

Initially, the game is fairly straight-forward, but the more joker combinations and consumable cards you use, the more it deviates from standard poker and into its own game. That's all well and good, but there is a noticeable lack of communication with the player, with the game seemingly expecting you to do the math by hand. A straight is worth X points, plus the points on the cards, but when you have 6 jokers interacting with it and adding +149 chips, then also +10 +5 +1.5 x1.6 multi, and whatever other different values, it becomes a nightmare of math to try and figure out how much you're going to score, and the game does nothing to help you calculate this.

I made suggestions in the Balatro discord about these aspects and was met with outright hostility. How DARE anyone wish for information clarity? I was leaning negative in my review already because of the lack of information, but that has pushed me over the edge.
[h1]If you want to do math constantly, Balatro is a game for you. If not, stay away.[/h1]
(because god forbid we introduce the OPTION to have the game give you a loose score estimate automatically, on an opt-in basis, that would be FER THE CAZUALS)

I wish I could refund my copy, but alas, I'm past the two hour mark. Hopefully, this review can help others like me who don't enjoy doing constant math from making the mistake of buying this game. It's not ""just a fun deckbuilder,"" and there's way too much ""do the math yourself or you'll be off by 10 points and screw yourself over"" to find it enjoyable after the first few rounds.",1708707922,1708708082,False,19,3,0.51805955171585083,0,True,False,False

Perfect casual game with lots to do/unlock--absolutely worth the asking price.

Having already beaten most of the higher difficulties and gotten completion marks on most of the decks (analogous to characters/classes in a roguelike), I can tell you that this game does suffer from some balancing and difficulty issues. Runs will often be crushed in the first couple stages if you don't get the right RNG, especially brutal on higher difficulties. A relatively small class of top-tier jokers (passive items) utterly dominate the tier list and you'll likely find yourself using many of the same ones in repeat wins, as the far larger library of more situational jokers often prove straight-up unusable by comparison unless you get a very particular set of synergies. It's closer to Slay the Spire than something like TBoI in this way, as the lack of skill-based mechanical gameplay underpinning the build system can make it feel a bit one-note and helpless on many runs.

With all that said, there is plenty of fun and variety to be had here--it's a fantastic product well worth playing made particularly impressive as it has all been put together by an inspired solo dev whom I fully expect to support the game going forward with balancing updates and more content.",1708704429,1708704429,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

this game has alot of potential but is ruined by the idiotic constant pair and 2 pairs showing up at 90% consistency, ive had 4+ games in a row where i start with 2 of the same number (pairs) or 2 pairs (2 sets of different numbers in pairs) so i go to change the odd useless cards and i get another completely different pair which doesnt help in any way shape or form...

im a pro poker player and while i understand the odds of this happening is possible the fact this is happening EVERY FING MATCH is not as high as what it is in this game... its literally making the game unbearable to play and unbeatable unless you lose 1000 times to unlock cards but by then you will have unlocked so many different cards most of them being ""meh or garbage"" worthy that trying to get the good cards to drop is another set of problems....

the decks you start with and unlock as you play remain the same level of garbage and dont help much more from the previous decks.... 

some of the debuffs you face might be a tad broken like the all cards are face down and while there are counters for this to be less punishing gl getting them in full release version of the game

so as much as this game can be fun, atm it is ruined by the ridiculous constant pairs and 2 pairs issue and the tad unbalanced debuffs which are 10x enhanced in full release version....

all my oohhh this game is pretty cool has been ruined and now im left with a disappointed let down of the games flaws


EDIT:  i just lost with an op deck setup where my cards were basically all giving multipliers i have like 9 or under diamonds in my deck, i had a joker called hiker which made any card i play increase in strength and i got them high and did a diamond disable boss and lost because of this stupid pair and 2 pair issue LOL

I was even shown the coding behind this game where the pairs chance was idiotically high at 88% which is fing rtarded....

While the sheer variety of builds is a strength, it is also a double-edged sword.

So, I saw it wasn't too expensive and bought it.


We played for 4 and a half hours straight, discussing builds and occasionally bashing heads on which was the best hand to play at any given time and so on.

The aesthetics, overall vibe, music, and gameplay concept are so appealing right out of the gate. Then the cool ass synergies & mental gymnastics over probability really reel you all the way in. The game starts off super addicting, watching number go up super satisfying. Then the game challenges you with unique challenges in the boss blinds, which are usually* very cool.

Despite all that, if I could give this game a rating, it'd be a strong 7. Unfortunately, the game is way too hard and a bit RNG based. I'm all about the challenge of juggling probability & risk/reward, but sometimes it genuinely feels like you were destined to lose. Every time I play this game I get the coolest synergies that I'm always super hype to play, but always lose just near the end without the satisfaction of winning a run. I think the game's base difficulty is a little too hard, in my opinion. I got a synergy all about thinning my deck to only be Aces, along with Ace synergy, 5 of kind synergy, and even tarot card duplication joker's. Yet I still lost because the RNG had decided it to be. 9 Aces out of 30 cards and I couldn't get a single one when I needed it.

In short, this game has really good high points, yet some really bad low points. The good outways the bad, though, and I feel myself getting better at juggling the probability problems every run I do.

They need to nerf some of the blinds, the Arm needs to be deleted from the game, worst blind design IMO. I had a lot more fun playing the demo, I find myself a lot more frustrated with the full game. Jokers need rebalancing, some rare jokers are dogshit, if you're unlucky you'll see only shitty common jokers into the late game and just die. Sometimes it feels like the game picks a blind to counter your current build. So many jokers are useless and not worth the cost they come with or their downfalls. 

Buff positive effects, nerf some of the blinds, re-classify or buff uncommon and rare jokers. Most grow effects grow far too slowly to be useful/worth the investment.

Really fun, but needs a lot of love before it's back to the quality of the demo, lots of the new content in the full game feels un-playtested. I love roguelikes based on skill, and churning thru run after run due to luck and or poor play testing on release is annoying. Will update if the game gets the balancing attention it needs.

The core mechanisms of Balatro are really fun and engaging. Building Poker Hands which give you points, and needing to score a certain amount of points each Round are pretty fun ideas. The way that these are modified by Jokers and Tarot cards in particular are very satisfying, though I will say that some of these are more fun than others.

That being said, what holds Balatro back for me at the moment are the following elements:

1. The scaling in the game is absurd. The amount of free multipliers and chips you can get from Joker setups ends up meaning that the actual Poker element really falls into the background. On a recent run, I found myself stressing over the fact I couldn't make a good Poker Hand, but even my ""High Card"" ended up scoring me nearly a third of what I needed for the round purely off the strength of my Jokers. The reality is that I probably reached the point where it was impossible for me to lose the round, no matter how badly I played my hands...and that was against the final boss!

2. The game very much rewards you for going super hard on one strategy. There are plenty of different types of approaches you can take, but once you've picked one, you're basically going to making the same types of hands over and over again. Often, rather than thinking about what I can possibly make with the hand I'm given, I'm just discarding the same cards over and over to play the same cards over and over.

3. Absurd balancing. This is particularly the case for Jokers and Bosses. Some bosses are completely trivial and can almost be ignored, while others threaten to end your run without much you can do about it. In the same way, some Jokers will give you a minor bonus (say +8 multipler if you play a pair), while others will simply give you completely ridiculous bonuses for playing a certain way (in one run, I ended up with +500 chips every hand and a +45 multiplier....off common Jesters). 

To be honest, I think my complaints can be summarised as...I like the game more at the start of the runs, and while shopping, but usually by around Ante 4, the Poker element itself is starting to become tedious, because I'm no longer really making decisions during it. I know exactly what I need to discard every turn without consideration, and exactly what I'll play, and I simply need to run through it.

Balatro is still a solid game overall, one that will likely improve with feedback and development, but I find myself not as captured by it as other critically acclaimed Roguelikes (Monster Train, Slay the Spire).",1708659286,1708659286,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False

Similarly to Slay the Spire, I think this game has a certain level of depth that only great roguelikes have, where it's fun enough at the beginning, but the more you play it and unlock different decks and difficulties, the game forces you to understand it on a deeper level.

It's one of the best types of roguelikes where you begin to see all of these crazy different combinations and synergies, and all of these tiny details in the mechanics that allow you to experiment, improve, and create unique and interesting builds that change your experience drastically every time you play.

With Balatro being poker based you get the infinite seeming possibilities of what poker hands you get in 52 cards. Throw in modifiers for sets, overall score, cards you have currently in your hand, etc etc there is very rarely a run that you've done prior.

For those who are not familiar with poker, there are guides in game and online showing what kind of poker hands can be used per turn. The concept of probability and applying it to how you play the game is very much a big part of poker, it synergizes well with roguelite elements

I dreamed about a poker hand-based roguelike for some time, and this is the game from those dreams, brought to life by the illustrious LocalThunk. If you're into deckbuilders, roguelikes, or the casino aesthetic, this is an easy pickup without much argument. The overall mood of the game is silly, chill, and cerebral, and there are ceaseless permutations of cards and niche mechanical interactions that'll keep you invested for as long as you're willing to watch number go up.

The biggest positive qualities I can comment on in this game are attention to detail and quality of life. This is easily the kind of game that could get bogged down by numbers & calculations, but with a fanciful UI for viewing the remaining cards in your deck without straining your eyes and consistent literal interactions between game elements, the game facilitates letting you trusting your intuition so you can play in a way that's satisfying.

Technical review stuff
The game is ~60MB download, and I think that's pretty cool, as someone on rural internet awaiting a fiber drop. Game asset bloat is a real issue, and this is the opposite. Light, great game.
For some reason, and I think it's because I have steam and Lua installed via scoop, I get a Lua error on startup unless I run it as administrator. Not sure what library it breaks having the game in a non-standard directory, but it did not like it. This is in the release 1.0 version.
It also lost sound output after a Bluetooth reconnection cycle, but that's probably a Windows/steam issue.

Now I know what Love2D can do as an engine though. I didn't know it was that versatile and fast for animations. Super well done.",1708647688,1708647688,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unlike real life, however, you can legally play hands that would be considered illegal in a real poker game. This game makes you take everything you thought you knew about poker and throw it out the window, and I'm all for it.

My only caveat with this game is this: [spoiler]The Arm's ability is busted, as it can de-level your hands below the starting level, and thus make them even worse. It seems like it's balanced around having high-level hands and/or the joker that can disable boss blinds, neither of which are likely by the time you encounter it.[/spoiler] But hey, it just means the house has the better odds, just like in real life.",1708458506,1708647516,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had a run with:
1. A joker that made all cards be considered face cards
2. A joker that destroys a card and gives me $3 if my first hand is just 1 hand (I could discard a junk card like a useless 2 which was considered a face card and get the $3. But it didnt end there
3. I was lucky enough to get a legendary joker which gained x1 mult for every face card destroyed

It's more akin to the tableau building mechanic of board games, where you are trying to create an engine based on upgrades you bought.

The game is working on two levels. On the strategic level, you have to juggle factors like increasing the base value of your cards (Chips), increasing their Multipliers, and managing your wealth. There is some deck building going on but when you start out with a 52-card deck, adding or subtracting a card isn't going to significantly impact your games on the short-term. Although there are cards that can massively alter your deck, such as changing sets of cards into a different suit.

On the tactical level, it's Poker with players doing a risk assessment with every hand. Sometimes you play a High Card, even though it'll score low, in order to get rid of other cards in your other. At other times, you want to gamble and maximize your earnings, discarding several cards in order to facilitate big plays like Straights and Full Houses.",1708643273,1708643273,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Otherwise, you must either play the round or skip it for a reward (that also be be bad sometimes), so if you are going to play this game - my advice would be to always make sure you have at least 1 Joker that can provide a multiplier or additional chips to have smoother experience.

But yeah, the amount of crazy decks I've built is shocking and I've barely scratched the surface. Some players are saying that Flushes and Two Pairs are dominating the meta right now but I just finished a run with Straight decks and was consistently scoring 250+ chips thanks to a combo wombo of Jokers I've acquired, while other on another run I focused on maximized Four of a Kind deck and it also worked! 

So yeah, game is gud, if you're a roguelike deckbuilder fan and want a quality product with a fresh new idea - check this game out. 

Also, this game was made by one dude. You gotta support those lonely hermits who dedicate their life to crafting wonderful indie games.",1708641014,1708641014,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When playing this game you are 100% reliant on RNG and your ability to reduce the RNG is non-existent. You basically unlock new cards by buying the current unlocked cards in the shop. So your entire strategy starting out should just be to acquire enough money to buy a card the first time so that it will count towards your total 'unlocked cards' which will give you access to more cards. It's an extremely grindy system and I'm already pretty tired of it quite early into the game (3 hours total with about 1 of those afk so far) and I love poker.

On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak

He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice""

So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy, you gotta learn to play it right""

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep

And when he finished speakin', he turned back toward the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness, the gambler, he broke even
But in his final words, I found an ace that I could keep

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

You got to know when to hold 'em (When to hold 'em)
Know when to fold 'em (When to fold 'em)
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run

I would mostly recommend this game, it has an addictive kind of gameplay with you easily being able to jump in and out of several matches of playing poker by yourself, as the whole point of this game is to play a wacky version of poker where everything is based on you getting enough points based on the hands you play. You can get higher points based on the deck you draft, the line-up of joker cards you have, what you upgrade, some other factors, and most of all RNG.

While it's obviously going to be RNG based being a card-game, it is still pretty unfair in that often you will lose with no counterplay simply because of a boss you fight against, as each end of a 3-part Ante has a ""boss"" and their modifiers will often instantly lose you the entire match. Losing simply to bad RNG alone is to be expected in other ways such as a bad hand of cards, but some things are too unfair.

Besides that biggest glaring issue, some cards will obviously just blatantly be better than others too whether they be joker-cards or card combinations. You mind as well often just quit the run at a certain point simply based off not getting a good enough line-up of jokers or other buffs, cause there is no way you will win at a certain point.

Lastly, the difficulty scaling is way too much often. The amount of points you are expected to rack-up is statistically highly improbable and should not be expected by the player to win. I should not need to have repeat full-houses, perfect joker card line-up, or even much better just to be able to not lose my entire run.

I would recommend it still, but I would definitely like to see some things balanced to tip things atleast a little more in our favor as the cards are already stacked against us, ha-ha.",1708629949,1708630268,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Reminding myself if I should revisit and if you should purchase.

[b]ELEVATOR PITCH: Slay the Spire addictiveness but in Poker Form[/b]
LIKED: I watched so many gameplay videos and reviews, but didn't get the appeal. When I purchased and put in my 30 minutes, I was thinking uh-oh this is going to be an addictive gem.
DISLIKED: The poker theme is approachable but may not appeal to everyone, they might be satisfied with Slay the Spire and be done with any other games in this genre. However, I strongly encourage everyone to buy and try themselves before passing judgement. Also, funky name.

[b]===== Will I Revisit =====[/b]
☑ Yes, I aim to 100% complete
☐ Yes, but only beat the game

[b]Disclaimer:[/b] [i]I'm aware 30 minutes is not enough time to properly review any game. Historically, I'm a big completionist when it comes to gaming, but my backlog will just not die and adulting obligations continue to mount. I needed to find some sense of accomplishment with my backlog other than buying them at great discount. Dedicating at least 30 minutes of play per game will be my arbitrary sense of achievement. It may not justify my gaming spending habits, but I'll suffer less buyer's remorse. Who knows, in 30 minutes I might discover a great game I want to revisit and something you want to purchase.

The dev removed the demo so I have to buy the game to try it out, see how its balanced etc.

The problem with these poker games is that aside from flush and basic stuffs like pairs, other things are simply too unreliable, so it is a challenge to balance the game in a way that makes other builds viable. The thing with this game is, they never made other builds viable. Its not like it is impossible to win with other build, its that the RNG nature of the game means you are straight up handicapping yourself by going other builds and there is no incentives aside from ""I haven't done that before"".

Other than the elephant in the room that is the gameplay balance, everything else isn't anything remarkable either, every round plays the same except for the ""boss"" which is too random it feels like bullshit sometimes and there is no storyline or anything like that to really incentivize you to play further after getting the first win. The soundtrack is forgettable too.

All in all, this game isn't terrible, it just hasn't done anything better than other poker theme games. The one game that actually kinda solved the problem I have listed is Aces&Adventures, although even that game feels repetitive after you have figured out every type of decks.",1708622066,1708622066,False,1,0,0.435292303562164307,0,True,False,False

I really want to enjoy this game,  I thoroughly enjoyed the demo, but at the moment, the full version of the game is too hard, to the point of feeling demoralising. I've played over 50 runs in game, and the only one I won was on a selected seed, which the game doesn't count as part of the ""runs won"".

I fully understand that might be a personal issue rather than a problem with the game, but I've had various friends also say the game is harder than the demo was.

If the game gets updated with some additional difficulty balancing, perhaps an ""easy"" mode for people like me who suck at roguelikes, and it no longer feels like an impossible task, I'll change my review to a positive one, but until that time, I am just unable to recommend this game.",1708527182,1708621953,False,12,11,0.452472835779190063,12,True,False,False

Also, it's very easy to pick up, and it will be even easier for those that play a lot of poker games, that they will recognize when they have a good hand quickly. If not, you just have to press 1 always available button that will remind you what is a Flush and what is a Full House. Controller Input or Mouse or Touchscreen, they all work. Music is great and relaxing. Overall a very chill card game. 

Some of the bonuses the Jokers, Planet, and Vouchers apply are sometimes not 100% clear, so some trial and error is needed to get familiar with the game.

Yes as I unlocked more and more jokers finding jokers that have synergy became much harder or trying to make an ideal run became difficult. From starting off with lets say 30 jokers and going up to 100 it became much harder to get good fun builds. Also its pretty vital to starting a run to get a half decent joker before the first boss, yet on many runs lately tarot and planet cards would show up in the shop so much I would only get one or two jokers appear before the first boss and when they do show up they are nearly always so mediocre and the odds of finding another joker to have a synergy with is now really low.

This is a very simple but different premise. The game revolves around poker hands, but you upgrade your cards and collect 'jokers' to massively change how you play and max out the score. Works really well. Super fun. Super addictive.

There's a nice progression system too of unlocks and challenges. Quite a lot of depth there.

As a time waster it wins the prize, this is a great game of Solitaire.

Pretty much immediately graduated into the ""Genre Exemplar"" category for roguelites and card games, personally.

It's full of mechanics that mesh together really well, the gameplay is amazing, and there seem to be a lot of options for build versatility and playstyle. 

The UI is fantastic (special mention to the cards remaining table when viewing your deck in game), the backgrounds are busy enough to add texture and flavor while being simple enough to not distract.

The art is lovingly crafted, immediately recognisable at a glance, highly detailed, and the shaders on the foil treatments are magnificent.

The soundtrack is good, but because the way all of the songs bleed into each other (and the droning organ pad is good but it gets a bit grating being in one of the most common tracks), it can get stale after a few hours. I'm usually a purist when it comes to soundtrack but at hour 6 I'm strongly considering muting it and playing other stuff. So far, that's my only gripe.

Awesome game by the way. If you loved slay the spire then this will consume you. Its so easy to understand even if you've never played poker. The gameplay itself is super basic so it makes it even more impressive with what the dev managed to accomplish here.

Also not as RNG heavy as one might think. While its true that the odds are always stacked against you, the game gives you plenty of opportunities to make your own luck. If you're going for a full house face or straight flush build then just keep on focusing on adding the needed cards and its basically a guarantee that your opening hands will be viable even when against a blind.

You have decks that you scoff at (like the all spades and hearts deck) and say ""that will be easy"" until you hit a boss that shuts down your hearts and it makes you realize how deep the deck building goes in this game.  There is no ""win"" button, but if you learn and plan, there is still ample opportunity for you to break your deck and get that satisfaction without it feeling cheap (like I said, the deck that seems like it'd be easiest to win with by playing endless flushes isn't just an ""I win"" deck since you still need to find the right jokers and boss fights).

The jokers, the tarot cards, the upgrades, the deck variety, the difficulty levels not just being ""get more score, dummy"" (one difficulty step I found so far does do that, but the rest actually modify the rules of the game), it's just all so perfect and has so much replayability.

Balatro is one of the most polished games I've ever played. It uses a CRT effect and smooth, hypnotic music to put you in the headspace of someone playing video poker late at night in a nearly-empty casino. You are given a hand of cards, and asked to hit a point total in a certain number of hands. You can discard cards you don't like to try and improve your hand, and you have up to 5 Jokers with various effects to improve your score further. There's a few other moving parts, but that's the basics.

Despite the number of available options the game has in total, it does a good job never overwhelming the player. There's no clocks, timers, or reflexes needed - take as long as you need. And the options available are kept simple and few each time they're offered, but many and complex in the context of all possible builds you could try out. 

For example, there's a Joker card that makes you want to avoid playing face (Jack, Queen and King) cards. This seems simple at first glance, but how you deal with that limitation is a pretty open question. Do you just discard the face cards? Get rid of them entirely? Put effects on them that benefit them staying in your hand? Or maybe all of the above. 

The game isn't easy by typical gaming standards, but by roguelike standards, it's one of the more accessible out there. I've played Hades and Enter the Gungeon for tens of hours each and never beaten a run. I still haven't beaten Slay the Spire with all available characters. Balatro's base difficulty is low enough that I could win from only a few hours of playing. And desipite the large amount of randomness in the game, the level of control you have over both your build over the course of the run and your cards in a moment-to-moment sense gives the a game a sense of being very fair. If I lose, my first thought is, ""what could I have done better"" and not ""wow, that was a cheap death"".",1708566807,1708566807,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even if you don't, you can catch on very quickly.
Drawing on most of our shared experience with playing cards, the game's mechanics are highly intuitive - make big poker hands.
Flush away all the things one dislikes about poker, for example by giving the player a hand of 10 cards to make a hand with, and allowing you to discard and redraw repeatedly turns the game into a joy.
Pair that with everything compelling about the roguelike deckbuilder genre and you have a bonifide classic.
To pair all the different enjoyable parts of card games, getting new cards - making sets of them - crafting a deck, and upgrading the cards you have, it's absolutely phenomenal.
Heart to Heart, though, some elements of the game are a little unintuitive, like how the hands you play don't need to have 5 cards in them, but the journey of discovering these little quirks of the game is part of the game.

1. No, this isn’t a poker game. It uses poker hands, which are simply card combinations and easy to track in game. 
2. This isn’t a Slay the Spire-like (great game but thank god). 

What Balatro is though is one of the best digital card games ever made. It uses a standard 52 deck and then turns “cheating” into power ups and mechanics that power the game’s deckbuilding. It’s a make number go up game, but the builds and decisions that drive that are addicting and deeply satisfying. 

See, Balatro understands what makes card play fun: variability, strategy, tactics, synergies, combos, and pushing your luck. These are elements that seen in combat oriented deckbuilders, the StS-likes, but here they are made so much more immediate with minimal text, snappy turns, and an intuitiveness that doesn’t sacrifice depth. 

Balatro really is a special, hypnotic, and refreshing experience. In a time when it seems like every month a new StS-like comes out, it’s a relief to see a game prove that not all digital card games have to be attack/defend combat games. Now that I’ve said that I’m sure it’s only a matter of time before the first Balatro-like comes out.

For joker bonuses, a pair counts as any hand that contains a pair, like two pair, full house, and three of a kind on up to five of a kind. Likewise for any joker that buffs a three of a kind hand will count for any of the previous hands aside from pairs, and so on. Planet cards are exempt from this, as they only buff the individual hand type, which can make a massive difference when even a pair of cards can be stronger than a full house.

The gameplay is really addictive and because of the numerous amount of modifiers in the game ranging from jokers, to hand levels, the amount of repeatability this game has is quite big. 

Pros:
- Game is easy to pick up, simple but can get complex later on
- It's satisfying watching the numbers go big as you progress in the game, especially with gamespeed set to max
- BGM is comfy
- As mentioned before, the replayability is absolutely there
- Huge variety per run because of the vast number of modifiers
- CRT settings for that nostalgic feeling if you're old like me (!)

Cons:
- Maybe this is just me being new to the game but I feel like some of the common jokers actually scale better later into the game compared to some uncommon ones. But then again the game does not necessarily say the rarer a card the better it is, so it's probably skill issue.
- I wish theres a toggle to temporarily turn off a display of the hand example when checking run info as I usually just look at it to see the multipliers. But this is easily worked around by just simply not hovering over the hand itself.

Everything felt balanced, bosses were genrally tricky but fair, and if you failed a run it felt like it was because you failed to make the best use of what was given to you. Playing the hand you were dealt and such. It rarely if ever felt like I lost because of bad RNG or poor design.

The full game however is a vastly different experience. It's difficult to put up the score you need due to a diluted card pool that has far too many cards that don't contribute to scoring, and several of the bosses will outright kill a run if you don't build specifically for them or the RNG graces you with one of the very few ways to reroll a boss. Most runs now feel like you're at the whim of the luck of the draw more than careful decision making. And this is on the easiest difficulty as well. Honestly, I'd rather just have the demo back but that was taken down.

I played the demo for like 4 or 5 hours the other night in one sitting, just expecting to check it out. I got sucked in hard.

I think that is lame, considering playing the demo was what made me NEED to buy the full game immediately.
I was lucky to find the demo when I did. Had I waited a day or two, I wouldn't have bought the game.
So removing the demo seems like a missed opportunity for the dev.
It is way easier for me to get a friend to try a demo and get them to want the game for themselves than it is to try and convince them to shell out money on a game based off of word-of-mouth alone.

Played the demo quite a bit prior to release and it gives good idea of the game. So anyone curioius should try the demo before they decide if they want to buy the full game
EDIT: Turns out they have removed the demo with game release. Now I don't know why they would do that since in my opinion being able to try the demo is best way to help people decide if they want to buy the game or not.

Then you throw in all of the jokers, tarot cards, and planet cards which increase your modifiers, and you can make a wide variety of broken powerful strategies that will scratch the itch of any "" numbers go up"" fan.
What makes this game so addictive is that it rides the line of chaos and control, where it always feels like you could do something to manage the randomness and come out on top.

Balatro is so excellent that it feels like it was discovered, not created. It effortlessly evokes the brainy strategies of the best roguelike deckbuilders while also tying itself back to a poker theming that all those games were mechanically riffing from anyway.

An approachable UI welcomes players who don’t know their flushes from their straights, but there’s still plenty of challenge to be found in the management of your deck and economy—all wrapped up in an intuitive package that would make your grandpa take pause and watch over your shoulder.

The result is a simple yet compelling deckbuilder that’s as infinite and as classic as a deck of 52.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3165517353

Balatro is a roguelike solitaire version of poker. Each run starts by dealing you eight cards and asking you to produce the best five-card-hand you can. Repeat over the course of a few rounds.

Rather than having a table of opponents,  you’re attempting to hit a score threshold. Each hand has its own score and its own multiplier. The short term strategy is born from Balatro’s drawing and discard rules; you get a few free per card mulligans each turn, and in a deckbuilder-like fashion you refuel your hand after each play.

Within your first minute you’re being asked to answer strategic questions about your risk tolerance: do you discard a guaranteed hand in pursuit of a better one? Or do you play it safe and work with what you got?

The fact that each card replaces itself on play makes them act as a secondary discard, too. Have a hand that’s just short of a flush? Why not open round one with playing a modest pair from different suits and chucking in three other random cards alongside them: even if they’re not contributing towards that pair and its point value, they are freeing up those hand slots and give you greater flush opportunities the following turn. It’s not guaranteed to work but that’s the beauty of it: you’re always looking for little ways to stack the deck in your favor.

That's just one example among dozens where Balatro is constantly giving you decisions in small but provocative ways.

That philosophy becomes multiplied after your first few hands when Balatro exposes you to some of its run-wide systems. You get a shop with “booster packs”, which sounds corny for a deck-of-52 game like this until it gets coupled with the game's concept of “jokers”.

These would be your “relics” or “artifacts” in a title with a more “video-gamey” theme, they’re passive bonuses that will stay with you for an entire run and you can hold up to five of them under normal conditions.

One run I got a joker that multiplied my score if I only played three card hands instead of five. Now all of the sudden I’m pivoting to a style that boosts three of a kinds and pairs, and flushes are near useless because they force me above that three-card limit by their very nature.

That changed how I looked at those “booster packs”: now suit was less relevant with flushes off the table, allowing me to target specific numbers and faces to maximize my three-card-hand potential.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3165517772

Almost every joker can warp a game in this way, so you get this long term strategy of crafting good jokers for your deck and crafting good decks for your jokers. It’s so deep and so fun, once you start to see all the pieces come together it’s easy to imagine all the ways you can arrange them to make for truly unique runs every single attempt.

It’s a time black hole, the hours just melt in front of you.

Part of that is probably because of how well produced it is, too. Not only does it have a simple, replayable little gameplay style but it also has a presentation that makes infinite play so appealing. Mechanically the ‘blinds’ are kind of like enemies, but they don’t really feel that way. You don’t get any smashing or crashing animations into them when you successfully score points, just little bleeps and the sound of stacking chips.

It gives Balatro a very non-confrontational vibe, where the focus is always just you and your cards. Each turned in hand gives you a brief animation of your cards cashing in their point values but also a little visual indicator that shows your jokers boosting their power. It makes it obvious who your load bearing jokers are and the fact that the score acquisition is so multiplication heavy gives you this big explosion of points once every card has done its little dance that makes the result so satisfying.

Beyond just being a game with immediately interesting rules and endless strategy, Balatro is also just a damn good roguelike in the conventional sense, too. The meta progression is a steady increase in options and scope. You’ll get more potential jokers, more consumable power ups, and more card types.

There are multiple ‘boss encounters’ that you’ll want to start building around, too. They apply modifiers that can be a counter to your exact strategy. One of my first almost successful runs leaned on beefing up easy hands like pairs and giving myself additional hands per round: going for consistent additive plays instead of singularly big ones. Imagine my frustration upon meeting the Needle, an encounter that allowed only a single hand to be played.

Obviously, I lost; but the lesson might not be what you think it was. The standard approach would be to have a more flexible deck next time, but there’s nothing wrong with single-mindedness in Balatro as long as you bring insurance: either jokers or consumables that let you re-roll or nullify a boss encounters’ modifiers.

There’s also thought that needs to be given to the relative strength of your deck. Maybe that consistent ‘two of a kind’ will get you through the early game, but it may not yield the points you need as the run gets tough (and it literally ups the ante). A strategic pivot into strengthening higher point value hands is always on your mind, and you need to be aware of how much hand manipulation you currently have and if you’re ready for that pivot.

Balatro isn’t just a loving ode to standard playing card decks but also a subtle homage to cards and collectables more generally. It creates intrigue in opening up a ‘booster pack’ of regular cards by sprinkling in lots of modifiers. There are ‘lucky’ cards that have a chance of giving a small bonus in addition to their regular effects, steel cards are incentivized to be held and give multipliers to played hands they aren’t in, and golden cards help boost your economy.

Holographics, foils, and more are attributes you can find on jokers in addition to their regular behaviors, which give you this exciting boost and maybe a reason to alter strategies into a joker that may otherwise be suboptimal for your deck.

[h2] In Conclusion [/h2]

Balatro does so much with so little. With a deck of playing cards and some powerups, it’s created a timeless card system with high stakes but low pressure. This game of probability manipulation and strategy is one of the best deckbuilders of all time, and its intuitive ‘playing-card’ presentation might also make it one of the best versions of Solitaire ever made, too.

I often see reviews and there is a lot of hyperbole or just completely unhelpful reviews wasting space. I thought maybe this game was a little sketchy since there were so many positive reviews. It couldn't be legit; could it? 

That's what I was thinking 11 hours ago when I was wondering why I didn't see the demo other people talked about. I put on a really really messed up film on Tubi, which lead down a really dark and moist rabbit hole of stripper zombies. I have been so horrified and scarred by the things I saw tonight, but I couldn't stop playing the game because there was movie left. Or I had to start another movie because I was on full tilt. 

I love poker, I love horror movies. I'm not sure how I'm going to be sleeping now that I have lost half a fargon day playing this. 

Definitely no complaints if I were to not pick the game back up again, I'd still feel like I got my monies worth. It really lives up to the review hype. It is the craziest hybrid but so much better than the other deck building games I've played. I played the pants out of Spire back when I bought it. It doesn't really touch this in terms of addiction. It is easy to keep playing because you unlock more jokers and more decks as you go. I finally backed out because the sun is so bright and my eyes... I shouldn't have done this when I was already only running on 3 hours sleep the last few days, but here I am. 

When I backed out tho, to exit, I did unlock like 5 more Jokers so I'm pretty excited to start playing again.",1708536401,1708536401,True,1,1,0.519417464733123779,0,True,False,False

The level of strategy, depth, and customization is far greater than what you'd expect. The main part of your deck is playing cards based on a standard 52-card deck (usually), but there's variations and modifiers that allow for over 150 possible combinations on a single card. On top of that, you have the jokers, serving as passive effects in each run. There's 150 of THOSE as well. Not to mention, the order in which you play your cards (and arrange your jokers) matters, and can mean the difference between a quick win and a rather bad loss.

That said, it's a deckbuilding Roguelike, based on poker. Luck is very obviously going to be a factor. This isn't a bad thing, but go in prepared for it.

As for graphics, well, it's meant to be like a video poker machine. You can turn the CRT effect off in the options if that's a thing you're not fond of.

I haven't played much yet of 1.0 but I have over 200 hours in the demos!! 

This game is wonderful. It strikes such a cool balance between BIG NUMBER DOPAMINE WE'RE GOIN CRAZY and actual strategy. You can sit and work out what will be better or you can just vibe it, and either way you'll have a great time. 

There's so much replayability here but even if there was only one or two decks in the game (there are a lot more) I found myself finally beating the starter deck and instead of thinking ""sweet, onto the next one"" I instead found myself wanting to run the starter deck again, but better. If that feeling translates to every deck in the game, I may never put this bad boy down.

On top of that, it's incredibly easy for the very involved and creative dev to expand should we ever get bored. Add one more deck into the game and watch everyone flock for another 3 months trying to figure it out. A handful of new jokers, or a new tarot card here and there. It is so well set up for expansion and has a dev who I think will look to improve and expand as time goes on (though I wouldn't blame them if they took a few months off!)

Hits all my endorphin reactors, makes me happy, makes me lose track of time, makes me theorycraft on public transport. All the giddy feelings I haven't had for many games over the last few years!

Endless mode is fun, but unless you know what you're doing or get insanely lucky you will get instantly crushed by ante 12 requiring a score of 300 million, which is 30x~ higher than the previous score required. There is no score jump even remotely close to this previously. If you have a deck that can actually beat ante 12, you can basically play 1 card to win any round before. If you have a pretty good but not amazing deck, it feels weird crushing everything then suddenly not coming close to winning suddenly.

[b]Balatro[/b] is a roguelite card game that combines deck-building with poker mechanics. Your objective is to defeat enemy blinds by playing strategic poker hands and earning chips. To achieve this, you need to customize your deck using various card upgrades, build a deck of Jokers to enhance each hand, and create a variety of exciting [u]synergies[/u].

It's highly original and neatly designed concept! The immense diversity makes playing this game truly enjoyable. 

And all of this in a [b]magnificent audiovisual design[/b], brimming with satisfying animations and beautiful pixel art graphics.

Another plus is the the [b]immense amount of content for hours of fun[/b]. In just the free demo, I spent 10 hours, and the full version promises unimaginably more: 15 game modes, each with 8 subcategories, 150 special cards to unlock, and twice as many other items to unlock. And all of this is available on the first day of the game's release.

All of this makes this game an [u]incredibly satisfying experience[/u].

On top of that, a really [u]attractive price[/u]!

P.S. [strike]Many people don't want us to know[/strike], but the true goal of the game is buying the Wheel of Fortune [i]endlessly[/i].

In large part, this is due to how excellently designed the game is. It nails having a ton of different systems that all interrelate and play off each other. Passives, and cards, card modifications, jokers, and consumables. Upgrades and ""builds"" are varied and well balanced- shockingly so.  

Early on, I would see passive card and think, ""Okay, this card is how i engage only with this mechanic."" Only to find out that no, the mechanic wasn't designed around any one card and I can engage with these ideas in any way I choose.

I tried a couple of poker-based deckbuilders before, and they didn't keep my attention for long.  From that previous poor experience I might have hesitated with Balatro, except for the huge rush of positive reviews pouring in thanks to their demo (which I didn't play).
I like the fact that I lost the first couple of tries - as I tend to beat the first run in most deckbuilders on first play, and I'm not really a fan of the 'make it harder for yourself without much reward for doing so' mechanic.  The third try I completed the game, which was unfortunate due to how late at night it was - although the game does have a proper save-during-run option which would normally be much appreciated.
One aspect that wasn't clear to me as I played was overlaps.  I lost a stamp when I played one on another card that had it, and then normal effects I again wasn't clear that I would lose existing effects rather than have multiple at once on a single card.  I also didn't realise that the deck won't be shuffled, hence you can't go heavy on trash mechanic which killed me on second run.  I'm not sure why this is in place, seems like we should be allowed (in the sense of shuffled deck when empty) to go heavy trash if it comes up as an option.
I love the amount of things there is to think about - jokers (and sometimes their order of sequence), tarot cards (change the cards in different ways), planets (improve multipliers of specific poker hands), spectre cards (gamble in losing a card you might like in favour of getting more rewards).  So far my initial games have been a little one-track focusing towards many of the same card leading to 5-of-a-kind hands - but that's because I didn't have jokers coming up early that would push me towards straights.
I had a calculator out on my second monitor for several hands on my winning game, working out how multiplying by 1.5 5 times from keeping certain cards in my hand, then by joker multiplier etc. will give me what score.
I also like the feature where you can see how many of different cards left in your deck to help you decide the chance of getting different cards from a discard.",1708522157,1708522157,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is one of the really, really good ones. 

The mechanics of getting to your deck to shine all feel very balanced and satisfying to achieve. Menus are clean and snappy. Tooltips are informative and mostly self-explanatory. The pixel art is quality and goes well with the CRT filter, although everything (I mean everything) on the screen shifting around feels like taking an ambien. The soundtrack wraps things together in a strange, satisfying, and hypnotic (as advertised!) complete package.

The cherry on top is that it's also very cheap.

Highly recommended.

Lots of creative ways to build your deck, with the main goal being to beat increasingly difficult scores and conditions. Pretty high replayability and it's fun finding combos and getting all the secret unlocks. Highly suggest trying the demo or watching a short playthrough to get an idea; you do not really need to know how to play poker to enjoy this.

My personal gripes:
It is lacking in atmospheric depth, just video poker with no lore, characters, motivation surrounding it. You're not even playing against a player or enemy, just a score. So it does feel like playing solitaire in a way.

The game doesn't have consistent problem-solving card text so effects can be very unclear. For example some cards give you ""+1 hand"", but some cards say ""+1 hand per round"" which is functionally the same, but because its described differently its easy to assume it does something else like maybe its a temporary effect or that the effect is reapplied every round instead of one time permanently. Some cards have unnecessarily long text that make it more confusing than it is, such as ""all cards you play gain +10 multi if they score"", obviously if a card scored then it was played, and there's no need to specify ""all cards"" because there's no exceptions or conditions. So it couldve just read ""scored cards gain +10 multi"".

Completing the ascension system requires you to beat the game with every deck with every difficulty. This feels excessively grindy having to go through all the easier ascensions with every deck multiple times just to reach the more difficult fun stuff. There is an ""unlock everything"" button in the options menu to skip it, but this also skips all the unlockable cards and secrets. It would be nice if this grind is reduced to beating each difficulty with any deck, and/or there is a separate unlock all button just for the ascensions.",1708510166,1708510179,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Balatrones were paid for their jests, and the tables of the wealthy were generally open to them for the sake of the amusement they afforded. There are various theories about the origin of the term. In Horace, Balatro is used as a proper name: Servilius Balatro. An old scholiast derives the common word balatro from the proper name, suggesting that buffoons were called balatrones because Servilius Balatro was a buffoon, though others have since objected to this account. Festus derives the word from blatea, and supposes buffoons to have been called balatrones because they were dirty fellows, covered with spots of mud from walking. Another writer suggests a derivation from barathrum, because they, so to speak, carried their jesting to market, even into the very depth of the shambles Balatro may be connected with balare, ""to bleat like a sheep"", and hence, to speak sillily.

My favourite run happened when I had a joker that gave +13 multiplier for every queen in hand. Got a spectral pack and was able to randomly change all cards in hand to a random one. I hit queens and now had 8 in deck. I would discard to find as many queens, play a single high card and due to a combination of other jokers would score 3,000,000+ every turn. I copied the seed and re-did a run with super optimisations and got to ante 12.

I've been following this game since the first demo dropped and as a lover of Poker, this has given me the fun stimulation I crave. 

Pros: Huge array of beautiful illustrated jokers, plenty of content for only 15 bucks, replayability is near infinite based on how you like to play, collection system is packed with challenges and nudges you to try different playing styles.

Cons: Honestly can't think of any right now but as I play I will update this post.

The game starts out very simple, look at your hand of eight cards, discard and redraw the cards you can't use, and then make the best possible poker hand to score points. If you can achieve a certain of threshold of total points across three hands of poker, then you win the match. Then Layered on top of this simple and enjoyable core, Balatro builds an engaging deckbuilding experience. 

In one run perhaps you transform some black cards into Hearts, add an extra Ace of Hearts to your deck, then ""level up"" the amount of points you get from a Flush ... Continue down this path and end up with a deck that contains a crazy number of Hearts and generates crazy combos with Flush after Flush. 

Then on the next run, you are offered a Joker that provides the passive effect: ""Your Odd cards score more points"" ... So you destroy some of your even cards, and transform other even cards into 7's and 9's, and then you buy a couple more 9's for good measure ...  finally you Re-Roll the between match shop until you find the Joker with the passive effect that adds additional points to any hand that contains 3-of-a-Kind (Full-House, 3-of-a-Kind, 4-of-a-Kind, 5-of-a-Kind) ... and score crazy points with Full Houses of 7's over 9's

Continue on and unlock more decks with different starting bonuses to provide more variation in your runs and increase replayabilty. As you become more skilled at making clever choices to enhance your deck, you can challenge harder and harder difficulties. This game comes with a crazy amount of content and countless strategic options. I look forward to playing this game for a long time.

Roguelike deckbuilding poker might not sound all that good, but they knocked it out of the park with this one. Jokers change the rules in strange ways, and there are always combos to be made and interesting choices to go through with them. 

Do I power up a straight flush that I'll probably never get, or pour everything into making my seven aces even better? Do I use the cards I've been dealt, or discard in the hopes of getting even better? What about my joker that loses power every time I discard, is it still worth it?

If pushing your luck and tasting the sweet sweet highs and the utterly BS totally not my fault for risking it lows isn't appealing then there are other games with more depth.

None of that is to say that this game is shallow though! There's a large helping of chance, yes, but if you push that generous serve to the side underneath you'll find a game with a reasonable degree of strategy and tactics. Some cards will require you to structure your entire run around being able to tactically play the right hand at the right time, others will encouraging engineering your deck in order to become a lean mean consistency producing machine, others will let you abandon care and dig through piles of cards in order to assemble the optimal hand.

complicating this are ""boss blinds"" which throw a spanner into the works by placing restrictions on what you're allowed to use in the fight up to them. You'll have at minimum 2 rounds to prepare but if you're going for a highly focused build there are *usually* opportunities to pick up something to mitigate bad boss luck before they show up (with the associated opportunity cost of buying something you may not need).

It's also worth mentioning that's it's presented beautifully, with comfortable and stylish visual and sound design.

Has a more straightforward progression system compared to other roguelikes... most of the stuff you unlock is just from playing, altough there are some with requirements as well.

Yes you need some poker knowledge here but only to know the hands. The game actually tells you if the cards you selected make a specific hand or not.

Worth the $15 for sure. There's a LOT of mileage here.

As for the cons, some cards have a bit of confusing text; if you loose a run it comes as a kind of shock; there's an annoying CRT effect that is OPTIONAL but I think some people won't realize that; the boss battles I think could have been a bit more creative but they're fine; it's way more reliant on luck compared to other roguelikes.

There is less meta-progression in this game than in some other roguelikes - mostly just new jokers, decks, and vouchers that you can find in future runs.

I’m a big fan of deck-builders and rogue-lites, and Balatro perfectly hits the balance of deceptively simple gameplay with plenty of strategic depth and crunchy math just below the surface. The different combinations of decks, jokers, and packs make every run unique. Runs are short enough that it’s easy to try out new strategies and combinations on your next try (although there is an option to continue on in Endless Mode after any successful run!). It’s never too frustrating when the RNG just doesn’t pan out - you just get more ideas for the next attempt. 

I’ve been playing primarily on Steam deck, and the controls are smooth and it runs great! The developer has also been active in the game’s Discord throughout the demo working on balance changes and patching bugs. 

11/10 would recommend to fans of Slay the Spire, Monster Train, Wildfrost, etc. - for me, it’s already easily up there with Slay the Spire and my top game of the year so far (and I expect it may very well end up as my #1 game of 2024!)",1708472950,1708472950,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

One thing id like to see: a way to customize cosmetic aspects like the card backs/backgrounds/idk sound effects, just for funsies. Could be either mod support or just in game. I know the ""decks"" function as run selectors, but could still have cosmetic decks on top of that! and could just have like, different patterns for the bgs, like lil waves or sparkley stuff, but it still doing all the color changing for the effects and stuff.

My ex-husband and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak girl I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the father of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The man I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

I cannot escape their haunting melody, and with each passing moment, my grip on the mundane reality of my forsaken life slips further into the abyss.

As the moon casts its feeble light upon the forsaken room where I huddle in solitary communion with your eldritch deck, I find myself ensnared in a web of obsession that defies reason. The very essence of the cards permeates my every waking hour, and I am consumed by a hunger that transcends the need for sustenance. I cannot eat; the taste of earthly fare pales in comparison to the intoxicating allure of those spectral cards.

My wife, in her pitiable state, beseeches me to attend to the needs of our offspring; to partake in the rituals of familial duty. Yet, her pleas fall upon deaf ears, for there is nothing but The Deck. The cries of our children go unheeded as I succumb to the irresistible pull of the malevolent game. The world outside has become a mere illusion, a fleeting mirage that fades into insignificance before the eternal allure, that whisper heard in the darkest corners of my mind. ""Just one more draw.""

Sleep, once a sanctuary of respite, has abandoned me entirely. The insidious whispers invade my dreams, intertwining with the very fabric of my subconscious. I am haunted by visions of arcane symbols and grotesque imagery, a phantasmagoria that mirrors the twisted reality of my waking hours.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me.

Why is Balatro so good?

-Amazing amount of content for the pricepoint and almost infinite replayability if you enjoy poker

-For people not too knowledgeable about poker, it's still easy to pick up and play, given the game gives you information on all possible scoring hands in a digestible way within a single button press

-Roguelike format works very well with the poker, making it in some cases basically a House Rules style game, with a dash of cheating (making your whole hand a single rank, etc.)

-Still has potential to grow and I am excited to continue playing and awaiting any possible additions to the winning formula

Balatro is a game where you play poker hands to beat a dealer's score (the Blind). You're allowed a number of discards - tossing up to five cards to get an equal number back - and hands to play to add up to this score. 
Score is totaled by starting with a base score for the hand, then adding the value of the cards played in the hand, then multiplying by the base multiplier for the hand. So, two jacks, two queens, all different suits? that's a two pair, which is worth 20 points with a x2 multiplier, and each face card is forty. So you get 120 points for that. Not the worst hand, but near the bottom. 

Once you beat the initial blind, you get money based on your performance to spend in the shop, which is where Balatro explodes in complexity. Here you can buy tarot cards (which modify your cards, by converting suits or destroy cards outright, for example), Planet cards, which upgrade hand base scores, and Jokers. Jokers are, more or less, equipment: You can have up to five at a time, and they do things like simply adding multiplier, making specific cards add more points, or weird things like ""if you discard a single card first, destroy it and get 3 dollars"". 

As your run progresses, you're expected to gather jokers and modify your deck towards a strategy of one form or another. Maybe you find a Joker that re-triggers played lower cards, a joker that causes fibonacchi numbers to add multiplier, and now you're tearing into each shop hoping to add smaller number cards to your deck, eliminating face cards with a vendetta, and hunting for Jokers that can allow you to play hands of nothing but fibonacchi numbers. 

Because you *will* need to enhance your deck. The blinds escalate, ratcheting up and up each one you defeat. And every three blinds is a Boss. 
Bosses are powerful blinds that come with additional rules. Some are benign as reducing your hand size - others will torment you with things like ""only one hand type for this blind"" or taking money for each card played. Preparing for bosses, whether by making your deck simply strong enough to bull through, or by subverting their rules, is part of Balatro's core. 

The feel of the game is unique among deckbuilding roguelikes. It presents a CRT, retro-esque aesthetic of ancient poker machines. The music is reminiscent of Risk of Rain. Perhaps its most daring move is to only have a SINGLE NPC in the entire game, the tutorial agent who teaches you the game and pops up at the end of each run - win or lose - to either mock or congratulate you. There's no enemies to really speak of. The bosses, even, are vague, conceptual - ""The Wall"", ""The mouth"". There's a sense of comedy and jest throughout - joker art can be anything from The Hack - a poor standup comedian giving a terrible set - or Mystic Summit, a pile of floating rocks reaching into the sky. 

The downsides of the game are few, if any. The game wears its luck-based nature on its sleeve, but as the game proceeds, it can grow more and more 'rocket-tag'y, with hands swinging harder and harder against higher and higher stakes, and so by mid or late game not getting the right hand even after several discards and hard work customizing the deck can feel pretty bad. Not getting the tools you're looking for also has an element of luck, and sometimes, a deck just isn't gonna make it - But this feeling is mitigated by the casino-esque feel of the whole game, in my opinion, as if the game is looking you dead in the eyes as it deals you a trash hand or forces terrible, cruel boss blinds on you. 

Balatro is one of my favorite games this year. It has a lot of staying power, the price is really affordable, and it's as strong as other classics in its genre. I cannot recommend it highly enough.",1708460152,1708460152,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Balatro is a one-developer labor of love and, like many of its kind, Balatro oozes of personal style: hypnotic, mysterious, and cheeky, the game feels like a wild dream in all of its art, sound design, and visual effects. 

On top of its unforgettable theming and charm, playing Balatro feels truly liberating: unlike in other roguelikes where you hope to fall into an existing build archetype, Balatro allows you to create your own synergies with its Joker system. Add onto its 150 jokers the 15 different decks, dozens of deck-modifying Tarot and Planet cards, and rare Foil/Holographic/Polychrome card versions, and no run can ever feel stale.

Replay-ability is at an all time high with the new content. Every run I completed I unlocked a new deck type and different jokers to try!

My only con I have is when I attempted Endless mode, the blind scaling was so high that I only survived one extra ante. It could just be because I'm trash.

The twist with the gameplay is the ability to collect power-ups and purchase other elements along the way which can boost your score through multi's and combo's as you progress. Some rounds can also have negative aspects so you have to be quite strategic in what to play and when.

Pros:
-Easy to pick up and play, even if you know nothing about Poker
-Large amount of contents day-1, no DLC/MTX BS.
-Reasonable price (I still think this game could do well at $19.99, but devs say $14.99 is okay and everyone agrees). Might be even cheaper within your regional price.
-""No two runs are the same"". Yep, RNG and Seeds mean you'll almost never encounter the same blind layout, tag, joker, booster packs, etc...

Cons:
-No mods supported (yet), this could really help prolonging the game's replayability.

Played demo for a few hours... I have never waited for the release date of any game like for this one. (besides Cyberpunk 2077 :P ) 
Do you enjoy deckbuilders and games where you can scale gained points so much that they punch a hole through your roof top? You NEED to check this out. 
This game is simple, yet innovative but also includes many different mechanics which are ingenious. 
1. You get standard playing deck, what feels familiar to anyone who played card games.
2. You create standard poker like hands, which give you more points.
3. Reach the goal in a few hands, or game over.

Simple? Yes. Addictive? Yes.

Mechanics:
- During your run you can buy jokers which give you extra abilities, extra cash, multipliers of your scores - more points
- You can get Planet cards which permanently for this run upgrade types of hands - MORE POINTS
- You can upgrade specific cards from your deck which will add multiplications - EVEN. MORE. POINTS.
- All of these upgrades can be bought in the Shop for money which you earn after defeating blinds (reaching a goal)
- Shops have a huuuuge variety of items, each run is different 
- You can unlock different decks which have cool starting abilities.
- You can unlock difficulty level...
and many, many more... 

If you really want to compare this deckbuilder (kinda roguelike) to Slay the Spire:
- You don't explicitly choose a path here, but you are allowed to skip minor ""enemies"" to get some bonus. 
- Unlike in Slay the Spire, all card upgrades are permanent (for the run) even if done during ""a fight"". Slay the Spire card upgrades are permanent either if it says so, or if done outside of a battle. 
- Combos here really DO SCALE. But you need to experience it on your own.
There are a lot of other differences, but I just don't want to bore you. 

There is even such an attention to detail how cards glare, have cool effects. Or when you open packs it just feels so right. 
Fans of collectibles will for sure enjoy this one. 

Depth? 10/10
Graphics? 9/10
Music? 9/10
""One. More. Turn."" Syndrome? YES.
Quality to price ratio: INSTA BUY.

Until now (a few hours in demo and almost an hours in the base game) I didn't find any bugs. What only shows how the game is polished or that I didn't understand how the game is summing the points and how it should do it (might have overheated my brain after some of the calculations)

If you are still reading...
just don't waste any more time, buy the game and play it :)

10/10 masterpiece that you absolutely must own if you are a fan of rogue-likes or card games.
No other game had me putting in nearly 30 hours on their demo. 

The concept is so simple yet so smart at the same time.
You can easily know what youre doing within a few minutes and yet still get stuck strategizing because thats just how much depth is actually in this game.

You have planets that enhance your hand types
You have jokers that change your entire build
You have tarot cards for deck manipulation
And you have spectral cards that create these monkey's paw situations.
All combined, bring a fresh take on the traditional poker card game that brings an immense amount of replayablility. 
I can genuinely see this being my main rogue-like of choice for many many years.

Plays amazingly on the steam deck and/or with a controller at your PC. Highly recommend this one if you are a fan of the genre and a truly new and unique twist.
