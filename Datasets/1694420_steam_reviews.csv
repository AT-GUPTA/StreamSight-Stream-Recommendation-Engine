Even starting with the easiest character, you always have some kind of struggle which I really enjoy.
The game has both very simple and more complicated mechanics and figuring out everything you can do is an absolute treat. It can be really challenging at times, especially due to the constant luck aspect that prevents even the 10th try with the same character to become boring. While still needing some focus sometimes, it's the ideal game to play while youre also watching TV due to you progressing time with actions instead of having it run in real time. Whether you play for one hour or ten, it's very enjoyable.

If the premade characters aren't for you, there's also the possibilty to create your own!
I'm very happy that you have to play the game before you can choose every customization there is, although it does take quite a while to be able to get every attribute, the difficulty of this game is highly customizable.
It's also nice that you can choose what to unlock instead of being forced through layers of unlocking things before you get what you want.
The soundeffects and visuals also support the fantasy of this game and allows the player to fully immerse themselves into the tropical island survival situation.

As a player who has devoted over 300 hours to this game, I've seen firsthand the meticulous attention to detail and the labor of love that has gone into its creation.

At its core, ""Card Survival: Tropical Island"" is a card-based survival game set in an engaging, challenging environment. The game offers a range of character choices, from a self-exiled individual to a mermaid, each with unique perks and challenges. This flexibility in character selection, coupled with the option to customize your own character from over 50 attributes, adds a personal touch to the survival experience.

The game's standout feature is its extreme detail and completeness. It simulates survival in a tropical setting with an astounding level of granularity, tracking about 100 different stats ranging from physical health to mental well-being. This level of detail makes every decision impactful, from managing blisters on your feet to dealing with back pain or dietary choices.

Graphically, the game uses clean, stylized graphics which make every card easily recognizable. The emphasis on functionality over extravagance in graphics helps maintain focus on the complex mechanics, essential for a survival game. The lack of music and voice-acting, combined with subtle sound effects, further enhances the immersive 'sole survivor' experience.

The user interface deserves special mention for its efficiency. The game excellently communicates states and parameters, adapting to show the most pressing needs and allowing for detailed tracking of various survival metrics. This efficient UI design greatly enhances the gameplay experience.

In terms of content and development, ""Card Survival: Tropical Island"" stands out even in its Early Access phase. The developers have shown remarkable commitment, with frequent updates and responsive community engagement. Despite being a work in progress, the game is remarkably bug-free and offers a complete survival experience, worthy of its price.

The game's survival simulation is hardcore, yet incredibly rewarding. Every action, whether crafting a tool or managing resources, affects survival. The high difficulty level makes achievements, like building a house or reaching a mountain peak, deeply satisfying. It's a game that demands strategic thinking and resilience, offering a unique experience for survival enthusiasts.

In summary, ""Card Survival: Tropical Island"" is a masterclass in game design - a perfect blend of strategy, survival, and storytelling. It's a game that challenges, rewards, and immerses players in a way few others can.

This was back when the game only cost a few bucks ($6), it had sub 100 reviews and I estimated the amount of content you could get out of it to be around 10-30 hours.
Well, 2 years of development with plenty of updates, 370 more hours played, an announced second game, several price hikes and overwhelmingly positive reviews later: I would still call it exactly that. 

If you're a fan of survival games, card games or roguelikes (and don't mind the artstyle/lack of flashy graphics), you will absolutely get your money's worth with this one.

Here's why I now also unashamedly call it ""the Dark Souls of Survival games"": 

Card Survival is a BRUTAL game,even when it comes to the survival genre. 
Before I elaborate, let me put the mind at ease for those that are not looking for a Darksouls-tier difficult game: There's plenty of *optional* customization in the game, including a safe mode that lets you restart days, and a bunch of roguelite modifiers you can unlock that can make the game much easier (or harder), and there is plenty of chill content in it too.
BUT:
It's a roguelike game about surviving in nature, and often even small mistakes, risks or lack of knowledge can send you spiralling down an agonizing few days of suffering and depression with you having to fight tooth and nail to crawl back from the encroaching abyss. (INGAME ofcourse;)
Death can come in many forms, from underestimating the wildlife to swimming in the wrong waters (usually lethal unless prepared), slowly dying to Isolation-caused depression and mental self-destruction, all the way to catching one of the many diseases or slowly, agonizingly, running out of your last drops of water as you realize: It hasn't rained in days. And it won't be raining any time soon. 

Card Survival has several interlocking systems that constantly work with each other, so even small things you didn't think mattered may have consequences immediately or a few hours or days down the line, and there's also some [spoiler] hidden...or are they? [/spoiler] stats constantly ticking in the background, becoming more difficult to manage over time.
These systems take a fair bit of time to figure out, learn and especially master. And even after 400 hours, I still feel the tension of ""one wrong step"", the pressure of the checklist of things I will have to sort out by a certain time, and the constant threat of a potentially painful game-over.
But, and this is the important part: While there is a lot of learning-by-dying, suffering and Player-Knowledge required to finally figure out these systems and start beating the game, in the eternal words of Todd Howard:
IT JUST WORKS.

Much like the ingame exploration and the day-to-day survival, the game manages to make the exploration of its systems and ""figuring out how to survive"" a frustrating, but FUN, experience.

It also makes you feel the exact same emotions as the Souls games do: Frustration, Anger (including at it's systems,sometimes), Tension, Anxiousness, and finally: 
Elation. 
When you finally get those drops of rain after clinging on to dear life for agonizing day after day of drought, or when your crippling wounds finally heal, or when you finally strike back at the wildlife and SURVIVE.
It's exactly what you would expect from a game about surviving stranded on an island. It's difficult, random and brutal enough to make you want to ALT-F4 at times, but not enough to make you want to quit playing for too long. And when you finally get over the hard times or your plan pans out, the game can take a turn and even become relaxing, too. 

While my original estimation of 10-30hours worth of content is still accurate to experience most of the mechanics, become proficient enough to survive and get one of the two endings, this is one of those games with amazing replay value aswell:
It has a trait system so support custom playthroughs with different twists or new, tweaked or removed challenges (from setting up different starting conditions or tweaking stats all the way to things like robotic killer drones hunting you down or playing as a mutated mermaid)
It has some (varyingly fun) achievements to work towards, and plenty of things you can -but don't have to- build, level up or explore, including a cave system I still haven't fully explored myself.
Just take a look at some of the hours played from other reviewers and myself. There is PLENTY of content here, especially so if you like experimenting,challenging yourself,surviving,building up things, or even just speedrunning to see how fast you can beat the game. 
Definitely way more than any AAA title that costs 3 times as much.

In my original review I also had a lot of other things to say.
I'm glad to say that all of of them except one have been changed for the positive. The devs actively listened even on the steam forums and tweaked things that felt out of proportion, and even implemented player suggestions into the game. 
And the ONE thing I still have an issue with (the amount of clicking required for some actions, especially the container system making you click more rather than less) isn't really enough of an issue to deter you from playing the game, unless you care about carpal tunnel syndrome.

All in All: Thoroughly recommended, especially for fans of survival or roguelike games or people who like challenging themselves.
One of the (still largely hidden) gems on steam with devs that listen and don't ask for too much money for too little content.",1637717408,1698090887,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

After playing Green Hell, I was looking for something on a similar theme but with more depth and I found it with this game. I got around two month of interesting and challenging play out of the game and was thoroughly enjoying it, then the combat update landed. Now the game is all about unrealistic combat with the various animals. You can't simply explore the island without considering what animals you might encounter. For instance, you may decide that exploring a grassland area might yield something useful; what could go wrong? It's grassland not the jungle or mangrove swamp, wrong! The grassland is home to the monitor lizard and these monitor lizards are not the type found on Earth, no these monitor lizards behave like aggressive alligators and there's no point trying to avoid them or fight them off because this is only possible once you have achieved late game skills and equipment.

Ever seen natives on tropical islands wearing armour? You haven't. Well where have you been? On this island it's an absolute necessity. Never mind the sweltering sunshine. I'm going for a walk on the grasslands and there's no chance of returning unscathed without my trusty armour.

Better to stick to the jungle I guess. Oh wait a minute, the jungle is home to the macaque. Now these are no ordinary monkeys. I saw one take three blows from an axe and still it kept coming. Fortunately for me it wasn't out to kill me, it just wanted some nice seashells that I'd been saving up for a necklace. I mean they were very pretty seashells but not worth a hole in the head.

This can happen from a myriad of sources

And it does not take a lot for your character to become bored, especially when you want to build a house to store your stuff so it does not get swept away by the storms
Now all this is fun and fine
you eat one too many bananas, constantly vomit, go into a stress spiral, vomit some more from stress, go into a vomit spiral, you need to eat and drink more, with constant vomiting. Which feels highly punitive for eating too many bananas mind you.

Its not easy, but that's part of the allure.  You will lose, a lot.  Even if you think you are doing well, you always have to be careful.  Get an injury without being prepared, or even with being prepared, and you can easily go downhill and lose very quickly.

Gritty, doesn't hold your hand, doesn't FEEL like a Card Game. The cards more exist as markers for what you have and where you can go. Imagine it as an extended inventory system and awareness of your surroundings.

Pros: Fantastic Depth, no punches pulled, how good is your Survival knowledge? Your survivor might have some basic info you might not, (like needing to soak and boil yams or they might be toxic) but all in all its your knowledge, time management, and a little bit of good ole fashioned luck for how far you go.. or don't go. Great replayability value, not because you're Seed Hunting trying to get a perfect start, but because you have to survive to unlock tailored Survivor experiences or COMPLETELY different situations to have started surviving in. These aren't locked behind a Paywall microtransaction marketplace or DLC, just straight up CAN YOU HACK IT?

Neutral: Some people like to have more control over the RNG than this game offers. I would argue that the lack of tailoring your island and its resources and what you might find makes it a much much much more immersive and true to life experience. Just as in a real survival situation, you must be aware of all options you could run into, and play the hand you're dealt ;)

Cons: The UI system feels a tad clunky, and it could be I'm just not understanding some of they hotkeys... but for the most part this feels set up to be even more immersive where you would really have to take a moment and ""Look In"" to ascertain what those menus tell you as the survivor themselves. An example of counter-intuitive UI design or me not understanding hotkeys would be if i want to move a whole stack of rock cards, it isnt hold shift to move the whole stack. Not sure what the key is. Being perfectly blunt, in a game this awesome these issues are only worth a half point of its total score. Game's still actively being developed so it could see some streamlining, but even if thats the final UI system used it doesn't detract from the game's Pro's enough to even CONSIDER skipping out on this title over it.

Beware if you're prone to hyper fixating: the gameplay loop here is really satisfying and perfect for ""just one more turn""... then you blink and five hours have passed.

I first bounced off the game. It's quite hard, and the learning curve felt punishing. But I no longer believe either of those things.

It's clear to me that a big part of the difficulty I felt at the beginning came from just not having expected that the mechanics here would be deep or intricate. I didn't pay attention. 

If you are not daring or curious, you'll probably be stuck dying in the first zone without much progress. It reminds me of old point-and-click adventure games: thinking of how items could interact or be modified and giving it a shot can take you really far. Noticing patterns, too, is important. 


[h1]Potential cons and how they're addressed[/h1]
[list]
[*] [h3]Difficulty:[/h3] 
The game can be played on at whatever difficulty you want. The default characters each have 1 of 3 difficulties, but even the ""easiest"" can be a struggle at first. But if you create a custom character, you can edit them to fit your desired difficulty. 

When editing a character, you can select traits and game modifiers you'd like. There's no limit nor minimum to how many you can have. These range from starting resources (none? some? all!?) through starting skills/expertises, physical traits, and even added challenges like monkeys pestering you constantly or it never raining.

To unlock more traits/modifiers you just play the game: each in-game day gives you a ""sun"" when morning dawns, and every 30 days survived in a single run gives you a ""moon"". You use both as currency to ""buy"" modifiers. That makes it a progression reward system of sorts, allows wide customization, and a potential to set your own goals (e.g. I really wanted to unlock one trait, but I needed 20 suns... so I played some more, and quite soon I could unlock and use it).

[*] [h3]'Help' information in-game:[/h3]
The game has an internal 'wiki' that gives quite detailed info on mechanics, skills, items, etc. 

When you try to build or learn a blueprint, there is a [?] icon on the ""card"" that will take you when clicked to the card's 'wiki' page. Each page explains the function of the card, what materials it will need, and sometimes more. They often include links to other related wiki pages too.

The detail is that not everything in the wiki is readily available: certain pages only become available once you advance enough. For example: I won't be able to read how crops work until I get to that point in my run. Even without the wiki page, under the blueprint/learning menu there will always be the basic of what you need to unlock anything. For instance, the card for a Flint Knife may not be available immediately - instead it'll say ""Requires Flint"". Once you obtain a piece of Flint, more information about the Knife will become available to read.

I like this because it keeps it from being too much information too soon; it'd be too overwhelming to start with every page available.

I won't say the game does a perfect job of letting you know that this is all there available, but IMO the simplicity of the UI really helps here. There are few icons on each screen, and you have most important info clear at a glance. You can get more in-depth info with a click, then super thorough info with one more click. More on that next.

[*] [h3]Stats and effects:[/h3]
Your character's relevant mood and status will show on the main screen whenever relevant: e.g. if and when you start getting hungry, the hunger bar will show up/get highlighted. If you click that icon/bar, you'll get a description of the status, its effect, why you are feeling it, and what it is influenced by. 

For example: if my character starts Overheating, I can click that status, and I'll be able to see what is causing it - it will show that it's caused by, say, the sky being clear (sun is strong) and by my body temperature; and it will show that my Overheating is also being influenced by e.g. my clothes, my hydration level, my environment, an illness, whatever is relevant at the moment. I can click each of those to get the same detailed info for each.

You also can see all of the stats in the game at any time plus how you're currently doing in each. You just either click your character then the list button, or you click any status like above then the same list button.

[*] [h3]Punishment[/h3]:
TBH the start of the game is the least punishing portion. You get zero penalties for dying over and over again, and instead actually get an incentive to keep going through the aforementioned ""currencies"" you get as you play.

It feels more punishing to die when you're fairly into your run: say, 1.5 or 2 months in or more, because once you die you have to start again from scratch. BUT: once you're reaching 20-ish days, I'd say that 99.9% of the time it'll be very clear why you died: likely a mistake or risky move that you could've prevented or prepared for. The game doesn't tell you what that mistake was, it's just evident from the gameplay. 

An example: if I try to fight a boar of all creatures while not being skilled enough, I can't be surprised that it pretty much rips me apart... but I can know how to prepare for it next time. Then again, I might never have met a boar before so I didn't know they existed! So I had to learn the lesson first in order to do better next time.

[*][h3]RNG[/h3]
The RNG is very tightly controlled. If you pay attention to patterns, you can become pretty much 'unaffected' by it. I can only think of one run of a ~hundred where I felt punished by RNG on a day - and even then, it was because I made a risky move that I didn't prepare enough for.

Main example of RNG: [b]'drops'[/b]. Each ""Explore"" action at a location will give you a quantity of random items. So how do you deal with not knowing what you'll get each roll? Well, if you pay attention you'll notice that each zone has limited possible items - and that certain items are more (or less) common than others in that zone. You don't need to know the percentages (XCOM is an example of how those can make it *worse*).

For example: in half an hour of going through the first zone (Beach) and probably dying, you'll learn that you can get Coconuts at the Beach fairly commonly. You'll also likely learn that while you can get Coconuts from the ground, Palm Trees are a more reliable source. Then, once you start moving a bit away from the beach, you'll notice that, oh, you can't get Coconuts in *every* zone.

That's how the knowledge progression counters the RNG. Knowledge curve is IMO pretty fair and well distributed as you advance. If you never pay attention enough to notice that e.g. getting Wood from the area right next to the Beach instead of in it is 99.9% more guaranteed, then you'll never progress because there will be no pop-up saying ""by the way: did you know you can find more items by exploring more?"" or whatever.

Other two examples of RNG and how they're countered with knowledge: [b]weather[/b] and [b]actions[/b]. The weather is random, but if you pay attention you'll notice how it changes (e.g. before raining the sky gets partially clouded, then fully clouded). You can also notice when dawn and dusk are, and even that there are [spoiler]stable seasons[/spoiler]. For actions, the game tells you how risky/likely any are in your current state - by range, not percentage. I't's generally quite fair yet realistic to a survival situation.

The Good.
It's hard and unforgiving. (some people like that)
It forces and teaches real survival techniques.
The first character you can play as gives you what is perhaps the best chance of survival possible for this game.

The Bad.
It's hard and unforgiving.
There's no tutorial or guidance of any kind.
You WILL die. A LOT. Even while playing with every possible advantage, you will still die a lot.

The Ugly.
It's primarily random luck for whether or not you get the resources you need.
It's time management to the extreme.
There are over 20 different gauges and bars to manage, many of which you can't possibly be aware of until it's too late.
The UI is hard to scroll through and clunky. (Feels like it's meant for a mobile device rather than a computer).
It is NOT worth the amount they ask for it. At best, it's probably worth $10, but they ask for $25.

Note for the Dev(s).
Consider labeling the free demo as a free demo. I definitely regret not scrolling down and opening the game's description before purchasing, and for not understanding that the ""first days"" was not another game, but actually the game's free demo.
Consider making and providing a handout in the main menu showing off all the interactable UI mechanics and explaining the nearly 30 different meters that we need to manage. It took me a full hour and 3 different failed runs before I even realised that I could click on my character portrait to access my equipment and treat my wounds.
Consider making some static items available at specific points like you do with finding a big stone within the first 25% of the beach. For example, let people find a normal stone on the beach for every 10% of the beach they explore, with additional stones being RNG. (I say this because I've done two separate runs now where I was unlucky enough to 100% the beach, roughly 40% the jungle, and 10% either the bay or the wetlands in the first 4 days, but I got a grand total of 5 stones and 2 long sticks from all of that so couldn't make a campfire or shelter to survive the big storm that starts on day 4 since I made a spear to protect myself from the birds and monkeys and to fish.)",1681360363,1681360363,False,4,0,0.570456326007843018,0,True,False,False

About inventory, did you know you have stuff ""on the ground"" and stuff ""in backpack"", which bar it is, you will have to find it by yourself.

I thought I was losing stuff randomly, but it was probably just that when you open a blueprint and you use the auto-place items function, it actually create some kind of container placed on the ground that hold your objects, there is some kind of third inventory that is not easy to understand as it is placed near explore cards.

Do you have to mix cards together to build stuff or look inside the blueprint book ? Well, it is both, some stuff is done by mixing cards, some stuff by using a blueprint, and some stuff can be made with both methods, it is confusing.

Blueprint icon doesn't look like anything I recognize. Blueprint button in the blueprint panel, that display what you can research, look the same as the other button (just make a + button that doesn't have rectangle border...). 

Research mechanic... it seems very important, but little about it is said, and you don't really know what to research.

There are also too many buttons, 4 filter button that could be removed by making a 2d inventory with smaller icons/cards. These filter options should only be available if you have an item related to that category. Example: no food filter button when you have no food in inventory.

Backpack inventory should only be presented to the player when moving to another zone. It is just a waste of space. you could use the space on screen to show a bigger inventory, that show both the items in backpack an on the ground. And again, in 2d space, not 1d scrollbar.

There is a 1 to 6 button that I have no idea what it is for. I also not sure which resource impact what stats, as the animation showing what stats have change, after for example eating something, is too fast, for a complex stat system. My advice, when eating something, make the time stop and allow the player to inspect exactly what changed. And there could be a ""fast UI"" option for veterans players.

The controls of the UI is also meh, who like horizontal scrolling with a vertical scroll wheel ?

I wasn't expecting to enjoy a card-based survival game as much as I do. There's no deck or anything - the cards are just representations of what's going on in the game. The artwork is fine - it's not amazing, but it's very easy to tell what everything is.  The in-game guide is really fantastic - most questions I had were easily answered by simply searching in there (and the organization/searching worked great).

There are some UI issues I didn't love, but fortunately, there are at least a few modders out there who put mods out on the Nexus.

The devs are very quick to respond to posts on the Steam forums, and the game, while complete, is still being updated.

The game itself is surprisingly complex.  There are 35 areas (if I counted right), tons of items, and a robust health/wellness system. There are many skills, and the four pre-created characters each have unique goals. You have to balance your food sources so you don't get sick of one item, and keep track of your weight so that you don't end up malnourished even when eating a lot of food.  Mental health isn't ignored - loneliness and depression must be carefully watched or you'll end up in a much worse situation than you may expect.

I'm a big fan of survival games - it's probably my favorite genre. This ranks up there for me in comparison to many other survival games.  If you don't mind the abstraction of the cards, I would absolutely give this game a try if you like the genre. It reminds me a bit of Neo Scavenger, which I think is a terrific game.

Well... this is an interesting game. Rarely do you see such an in-depth simulation in a game. Last time i did, it was CDDA, but that thing is a monstrosity and its unfair to compare any game to it.
In Card Survival: Tropical Island, you take control of a person stuck on an island. Currently, there are 4 available starting scenarios + an option to make your own scenario. All of them have unique advantages and disadvantages, together with something resembling a 'story'. I spent most of my time playing as the little girl farmer as she starts with pretty good crafting skills. Still, at first you are forced to play the 'hunter' character. The longer you survive, the more points you get, which can be used to unlock other characters as well as character customization options.
The game is set up as a card game, but you don't really have the usual hassles of micromanaging and building a deck - simply various things are represented by cards. Items are cards, locations are cards, animals are cards, YOU are a card. You drag and drop or click on cards to use them in various ways.
But it isn't just sunshine and coconuts on this island. Lemme guess, your first idea of what to eat will be coconuts yeah? Okay, prepare your AY NUSS for explosive diarrhea... yes, i'm not shiteing you - this game WILL take into account that certain things will make your stool liquid and thus dehydrate you. At least there are no poop cards... human poop cards at least. Animal manure still exists lmao. Constantly eating one food source will lead you to nausea too. So it's best to diversify - veggies, fish, seafood, seagulls, coconuts all in moderation. You also need to wash yourself after a meal - unclean body + a wound = infection... you don't want an infection.
In the 4 built-in scenarios the game provides you with various pointers on what to do as your character, what you need to accomplish. They are in short, your objectives. All of them leading to a choice - either build a raft and escape or make the island your home. Either choice requires a lot of planning and crafting though.
What else can you do? Befriend macaques, hunt lizards, experience supernatural events, be a PREGNANT FLESH EATING MERMAID WHO LIVES IN DARKNESS... i'm guessing it's some kinda weird chinese legend lmao.

I like card games, but I don't like their rogue-like nature, which most of them are.

I love survival games, but in most of them you come to a point where you can just sit back and relax in a relatively short period of time, which I think is the opposite of survival.

This game is hybrid of ""The Long Dark"" and ""Stacklands,"" which means, you always fight against nature whether that be a lizard you need to fight, or the passage of time that keeps spoiling your food, thereby you constantly need to get out of your safe zone to forage supplies while dealing with the issues the game throws at you. 

Game balance is amazing. You always have to think about the trade-offs you are making at any given moment. For example, you might be low on food, but you might also have to finish your water reservoir in a particular area of your choosing 3 days before the dry season comes. Certain areas behave differently depending on the season you are in. The Beach keeps getting hammered by constant storms during wet season, so any stuff you leave there gets lost during high waves. But if you can hold on to your body fat stores for 3 days and finish the water reservoir, you can then build multiple fish traps and drying racks to the beach, because during dry season you rarely get any rains or storms, which allows you to exploit wild life in the shores without any worries, but this time you will have another problem, which is dehydration.

This is just one example, and game keeps you on your toes all the time. Yes you can  get to a point where you can have relatively an easy time surviving, but this doesn't mean the game turns into a AFK farming simulator. It keeps you engaged all the time no matter at what stage of the game you are in.

It is a deep and complex survival simulator in ways nobody can fathom what it is until they try it.",1675951040,1675951040,True,3,0,0.51086956262588501,0,True,False,False

It feels so fresh and the gameplay systems are staggeringly deep.

It reminds me a lot of Project Zomboid where you look at screenshots and go, ""Huh, that kind of reminds me of the first Sims game."" But then you dig a little deeper and start to realize that the number of gameplay systems running under the hood go deeper than most titles on the market today.

CS looks deceptively simple on the surface. Just explore various desert island biomes to uncover cards. Then combine those cards to craft gear & supplies. Then combine those cards to create living spaces, farm land, tame animals, etc. The level of simulation is just insane.

I knew I was in for a ride when I learned drinking too much coconut water would give me diarrhea, leading to severe dehydration and possible death. Or how choosing your skin color on character creation has an actual effect on sunburn tendency and thermal body regulation.

The discovery aspect is pretty wild too. Remember when Mincraft hit critical mass and there was this land rush to figure out recopies and just how far the simulation went? That's what Card Survival feels like. Where there are practical real-world solutions to problems if you just look at what you have on hand and what you need to produce.

One example is getting water on the first few days is rough going. The above mentioned coconut milk can hydrate you but you can only use it sparingly as your digestive system health is simulated. So on my 2nd day on the island it starts raining and my thirst meters are low. I can't drink any more coconut milk. Then I look at my inventory and see that I've got all these discarded coconut shells. I interact with the shell and I get a prompt to fill it with rainwater. Brilliant! I proceeded to line up the 8 other half-shells I had on hand to farm rainwater.

It's little reveals like this that make the game feel like a journey of discovery in uncharted territory. The game didn't tell me to line up my coconut shells on the beach to collect water.

Having to balance the character's physical stats (hunger, thirst, energy, wounds/sores/injuries, etc.) while also trying to develop their skills and keep them sane (or not :P ) was strangely addicting. The lack of animation was easy to overlook because the gameplay was very engaging.

That is just dumb when my character is not even fully recovered from the previous injury, got hurt in a retreat and turns into a swine again. The game experience suddenly gets highly repetitive and boring once you reach that stage.

I mean, I can hardly imagine someone tired of chicken after having 3 cooked breasts in a day when they are trapped on an island with their second best option to be banana or stuff like that.

 The one thing I will say is it can be a bit too RNG heavy. In the early game, you NEED specific resources (stones, wood, and food are examples), and every time you explore to look for them, your character loses energy, food, water etc. Basically if you don't instantly get the item you need, your character is punished with stat drain. Because the game is pretty difficult and punishing, you can't really set up alternative sources because you're so busy having to crisis manage actively dying from not simply getting lucky. I also wish there were ways to get efficient earlier, because it does feel strange to have some late game tech but still be very reliant on the right resource just showing up. 

In spite of that though, when you DO get a run with good early game RNG and can set up your starter base, the game really opens up into a deep and interesting experience.",1671295929,1671295929,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let's start with the bad stuff first:

1) You think you have liberty in the game but you don't. Everything is intertwined in the game and there's set bad milestones that will happen and kill you if you're not prepared (which you can't know in advance unless you died from said cause before).

Amongst bad things, let's call your temperature, your weight, your thirst, your hunger, your sanity.

Those things are dependable on SO many variables that you'll have a feeling of despair when one is in red, imagine 2 or 3.

2) When you think you understood the game, RNG will bit you with a random effect and things will escalate so fast and bad that you'll go back to point number 1

Amongst things that can happen like that, let's call bad wounds because of hunting or climbing, being caught without sun after 20h00 in bad places, storms, drought and so on.

3) You think you can develop a strategy to circumvent bad stuff but in the end, there isn't many. 

For instance, you're tired of losing your stuff because of storm. You decide to rush to secret valley and build there. You'll lose so many times getting back to the beach to get sand / coconuts / palm fonds that your sanity / weight will suffer and cascade of bad things will happen.

Another angle to the previous example: you are fed up of losing your stuff to the storm but you decide to build an house, the first one (with palms) at the Bay.

The process of building said house will take a lot of direct ressource (energy, palms, sticks and so on).

But, indirectly, you'll need more ressources, like wood to heat your fire to get better yield from food to keep up your weight, you'll need to hunt to get better food and hunting requires sharp stones (that require energy) and wood (that require energy) and each of those indirect ressource need to be maintained. That takes time and effort and it gets more deep the more you go through.

Eventually, you end up finishing it up. CONGRATS! NOT! You need to maintained it too and maintenance require energy and stamina and sanity and ...

See? The more you develop, the more maintenance is required which take more energy, food, water and sanity. Eventually, you get swarmed by tasks and you slowly but steadily lose the game.

4) Dying yield you suns and moons to buy perks but they're related to custom players, which doesn't feel natural in gameplay perspective. So it's kinda meh

Good stuff:

So many variables, so many stuff to do and try to build slowly your stuff makes the whole experience enjoyable. You develop accomplishment whenever you suceeded into managing little details. Game is deep. Very deep.

The main gameplay, as the title suggested, is to survive at a no-man's island, and ultimately escape by raft or make it home. The character in the game, like real humans, has both physical and mental conditions, which provide or restrict actions the character can take. For example, salt water can be used to clean wounds. A character without bravery trait cannot do that normally. But drinking wine could make salt-water cleaning becomes available. Beside that, there are also many fun mechanics in the game. The wetness condition of a crop plot could be used as another example. At first, it may be tempted to maintain it as high as possible. But in the game, humidity makes fungi grow faster. Combined with rainy season, fungi could be easily out of control even with brimstone pesticide. So the best wetness of a crop plot is not 100 but around some middle value like 50. Both counter-intuitive and intuitive.

however, currently (1.01j) the game still some problems. The most unsatisfying problem is slow to load environments with many cards in the late game. For example, rice paddy has a high yield rate. Several rice paddy could easily yield hundreds of rices. Then, noticeable delay of loading when entering this environment will be experienced. The delay worsens as the number of cards increases. It seems that each card is a single entity in the game. 100 units of rices is 100 rice cards, not a rice card with quantity 100. Thus, this delay could be hard to amend. Also, some items lack sufficient descriptions may be another shortcoming of the game. It took me long time to discover that rope was made of two yarns, and until now, I have no clue how to make 'Aqua fortis', which is an ingredient to make dynamite. It could be helpful to have some explanations for such items.",1667560409,1667560409,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Basically you're stranded with nothing and need to keep everything your body needs (food, water, health, hygiene...) under control, as well as your mental well-being. 

Survival needs careful approaches and planning. If you go yolo out into the wild you will meet a swift end. The weather, wildlife, seasons will come at you and make things harder. 

Discovering the island is a lot of fun and often quite unexpected. I very much recommend this game and already look forward to expansions or a second one. Maybe with some more events, secrets to discover?

But - if you can overlook that, then oh boy, this game is a real gem.  This game is an amazing, deeply realistic survival simulation.

There are several skills in this game, like spear fighting, spear fishing, crafting, knapping, slinging, rock throwing, stealth, climbing, herbology, etc.  I definitely focus more on herbology, but I've seen others go heavily into farming or spear fighting.

This game has so many things that will kill you, or propel you into chaos and dramatic death.  Storms that destroy seaside bases, bugs that give you typhus which gives you bad fevers and pain, and catching cholera from being too dirty, days of extreme diarrhea and depression (because of having extreme diarrhea for over a week), infectious lizard bites, and the worst of all is still believing that reality isn't real, because I'm sick of eating coconuts.  There's also a deep mental health system - you can become depressed, overcome with stress, slowly become more and more broken from agonizing back pain.  Not to mention the soul-crushing loneliness.  (Weston the coconut makes an appearance in this game, to keep you company, and talk to you when you reach a mind-altered state!)

The mechanics are very intricate and realistic.  There's no HP meter.  You can die from any of several meters reaching zero - for example, if your blood pressure reaches 0.  Most likely, it will be your hydration meter reaching zero that will kill you, and lots of things lower your hydration faster, like your stamina being low, diarrhea, and high body temperature.  You can die from starvation - which is like a longer term hunger meter.  If you only eat basic food for too long, you'll run out of fat storage on your entire body and die of starvation.  Eventually you have to upgrade to prepped food rich in fats and sugars.  You can get lung damage or eye damage, get permanent nerve damage, your immune system can get destroyed, which makes you more vulnerable to more diseases, which most likely give you fevers, severe pain, and deadly diarrhea.  It'll all pile up, and you will die in the most dramatic and most slowest of deaths, just like in real life!  It's possible to die quick deaths too, but only if you get absolutely gored by a huge wild animal, and you don't have anything on you to stop the heavy bleeding.  At the beginning, it's more likely you'll die from an infection from being bitten by a monkey.

For every way that you can die, there's several ways you can adapt and either prevent or deal with it.    For example, you can avoid catching diseases by applying bug repellant, eating lemongrass, or making candles with bug-repellant properties.   Or if you've caught the disease anyway, you can boost your immune system by brewing and drinking ginger, china rose, or spider lily tea.  Reduce pain by drinking kava.  Reduce diarrhea by eating charcoal.  When you get bit, apply something to dress the wound, keep it disinfected with water, lye, or wet soap.  Wear shoes to prevent being bitten by spiders or stepping on sea urchins.

Runs can be customized, or you can play premade scenarios, starting off with being a native of the island, then a farmer whose farm was destroyed and must nurse their grandfather back to health (yes you can farm in this game!  the farming system is very deep and intricate as well - I just haven't touched that part of the game yet), and finally a carnivorous mermaid who must not only eat for herself, but also for her unborn baby which she is pregnant with.

The more days you survive, the more points you gain which can then be spent on modifiers to customize future runs.  You can make your own character with their own perks and downsides to adjust difficulty, upload your own picture of that character, and create your own backstory and scenario.  Uploading your picture really makes a huge difference.  (Not a fan of the character portraits - they just look so different artistically from the rest of the game.)  You can start in another area other than the bay.  You can be a carnivore, vegetarian, be allergic to shellfish!  You can be pregnant, start off naked, be a YouTuber with a cellphone and fully-clothed, be dark-skinned and therefore immune to sunburns.  And more!

While training your skills and exploring the island, you must adapt to being stranded on the island, managing your needs, reacting to crises as they happen to you, thinking and planning your strategy on how to survive, not just to survive til the next day, but to prepare for the dangers of the next season, and dangers waiting for you on the rest of the island!

You play as one of 3 pre-made character, or you can customize one from scratch. 

For exploring you draw a randomized card from the locations stack, sometimes triggering an encounter. Cards can be combined, used together or on the enviroment. It all seems simple enough but as you get the hang of it you start realizing it's all quite complex. 
You need to plan ahead if you want to survive, how to store water? Where to find food? Characters also have skills, traits and detailed mental and physical stats. ""All work and no play"", while living in a dump? Your gonna notice eventually... Stay organized and day-to-day life will be much less of a chore. As you get more skilled you unlock new craftables and items to find.

Card Survival is one of those hidden pearls that pop out from nowhere and shines in both depth and execution.

Fans of the survival genre will recognize the main loop immediately: You're lost on an island and - starting from basically nothing, you need to fend off nature and build yourself a sustainable habitat while managing a number of body-based needs. The Macguyverism is strong in this one.

Don't let the cutesy game graphics or the card based gimmick fool you. This game is abundant with both mechanics, locations, and items - as well as game customization to create the perfect difficulty based on your degree of masochism.

In its base game, the game's progression is mostly comfortable - but you will (probably) die a number of times until you learn the optimized routes - and the world gets dynamically more and more difficult as time progresses. Did I mention it's roguelite? It's roguelite. With the base settings, a death is a death and you start off from the beginning (but with more customization points to set up more fun scenarios)

Card Survival popped out of nowhere, but is an instant classic and might very well pave the way for a new genre of survival games, where deep (but accesible) survival mechanics trump huge 3D worlds with little content. It's highly recommended for people who enjoy deep mechanics over triple-A graphics.

A solid plus for the developers actively fixing bugs and interacting with the community.",1664989332,1664989332,True,5,0,0.51117318868637085,0,True,False,False

The only flaw so far is after the colon. While there is variety to play around with settings, the particular challenges you face tend to enforce a sort of meta, where there is a narrow channel of right actions, and where you can end up in the XCOM-esque situation of realizing that you lost the game 12 days ago when you forgot to collect wood.

This is an excellent card game featuring enjoyable exploration and deep, realistic crafting.  
The number of card combinations is mind-boggling!
Highly recommended!

TO THE DEVS:
It's obvious you've put a lot of work into this.  
The huge amount of art required!  The colours are realistic and the animals especially are well-proportioned.   Nice work!   But there is room for visual improvement and I'm eager to offer help and advice.

ICONS
- The status and effects icons are sketched. Hand-drawn sketches look really good on the cards, but for UI elements like the icons, I think it would look better if they were not drawn freehand.  Consider using Inkscape / Adobe Illustrator / Corel Draw to create tidy, symmetrical shapes and smooth outlines. 

CARDS: 
- The shelters and woven basket could have better perspective effect.
- Currently the lighting and shading on all objects is a little flat - maybe create higher contrast between highlights and shadows.  
- Some objects should be shiny (crab shell, edges of the sharpened rock.) and others would look great if they looked more wet.
- More detail would be great, (especially on cards like the stone axe) but looking at the huge, impressive quantity of art you had to produce, it's not surprising that everything isn't highly detailed yet.

I hope this all doesn't sound too critical - I love your game, It runs great, looks and sounds good and I'm inspired by it!  

I'd love to see it get even better - If you want some help with the status icons, I'd be happy to redo them for free, PM me.

Between flares of intense pain, the hunter could only wonder if this would be his doom.

Stacks of halved coconut shells fell with a loud clatter as he barged inside the hut and rushed to the wooden table. No time to sit; he knelt down and grabbed whatever tool was on arm's reach. Flipped it, slammed the handle down, smashed the kava roots on the table in jagged rhythm. Hissed a curse through his teeth when he saw the clay jar at the center almost tilting to the left. In a burst of clarity he reached out to stop the jar back just before it tipped over.

Water, precious water. Couldn't waste it; not with his life on the line.

Gritting his teeth, the hunter grabbed one of the coconut shells and poured the water from the jar. Scattered the now powdered kava inside. Stirred it and gave a few squeeze for good measure, giving no care about where his hands had been before. And then he chugged everything down in one long gulp.

Almost immediately the kava worked its magic, running within his veins and sanding down the agony in his nerves. The hunter poured another serving of water and repeated the whole process again, then again, exhaling in relief when the pain was reduced into a heavy but manageable ache.

Only now did he notice what he had grabbed to ground the kava. A bone knife, chipped and cracked all over the surface.

The hunter snorted. And then grimaced when his shield-bearing arm shrieked a painful reminder of his situation. His stomach also joined in, groaning and growling, no doubt demanding more food to help his body recover. The hunter carefully pulled the splint from his satchel and began tightening it around his broken arm, wincing and flinching as he did. Doing things would be difficult for now. Not good.

And yet there was no one else to blame but himself. He could just stay away from the boar. Let it wander as it wished. But -of course- he just had to let his greed run unfettered. Had to let his visions of a pristine new bedroll cloud him from the fact that his shield was nearly cracking apart. Now he got his wish and had to pay the price. And it was such a hefty price to pay. There was still a week left before the rainy season ended and the dry season began, but the sun had already glared down on him with a righteous rage. There were lots of things to prepare; lots of projects still unfinished. And now everything would come to a grinding halt.

Again, the hunter wondered if this would be his doom. If not now, in blinding pain, then days later in throat-clawing thirst.

He wondered if he made the right decision to come here.

He wondered if the Enemy knew his fate would end like this.

A rustling sound snapped him from his miserable thoughts. The hunter looked up to see the three macaques he had managed to befriend on this island, eyeing him from the safety of his old bed. On the palm-woven bedding the coconut Weston also looked at him, his round head slightly tilting to the side, the concern real and palpable.

“It’s fine,” the hunter lied. “Just need–kkggh–just need to take it slow for a couple of days.”

Weston’s silence was loaded with sympathy. Weston was kind, after all. Quiet and somewhat unfunny, but kind. Nothing like the cranky captain perching on his shelf. And the macaques…the hunter wondered if the macaques cared. Certainly they did within some levels; after all he brought them food and water. But was there more? Did they see him as a friend like he did, or was he just a provider to them? 

As if answering the hunter’s question, one of the macaques carefully jumped a few steps forward. The eldest, Friend-o. 

“What’s up, Friend-o?” said the hunter, mustering all of his remaining energy to sound harmless. “Are you hungry already? Pretty sure I just gave you some coconut this morning.”

Friend-o replied with a squeak and a tilt of his head. He jumped closer but still kept his distance.

“Are you shocked?” asked the hunter. “Don’t be–it’s just a little accident, nothing more.”

Friend-o jumped closer, head tilted as if wondering. He squeaked twice, stretched an arm forward, and the hunter finally saw that one of his hands was clenching something tight. 

“Is that a gift?” asked the hunter, warmth blooming in his chest. “For me?”

Holding back another grimace, he slowly leaned forward and offered his unhurt arm to the macaque, palm opened. Friend-o jumped on his spot and squealed in delight, handing the hunter the thing he’d been holding so fast that the gesture almost felt like a handshake before turning around and rejoining his brother and sister.

And the hunter–well. He didn’t have to look at the gift. He already smelled the foul stench coming off his palm and felt its disgusting stickiness on his palm. There was no need to look down.

Manure. Fresh from the macaque.

A loud, unbridled laughter burst free from the hunter’s chest, stuttering and heaving, unbroken even when his fractured arm throbbed in complaint. And when it was over, the macaques stared at the hunter with a mixture of awe and confusion as he tossed the freshly made gift away and stood up with a long groan.

He couldn’t just die here. He had a calling to pursue, an Enemy to vanquish, friends to care for. He had a dry season to survive through.

And to start that off, there was a boar waiting to be skinned outside his house. Maybe he would make a new knife out of its bones. It would look pretty nice together with his new bedroll.",1664748400,1664748400,True,22,1,0.643438339233398438,0,True,False,False

However, some of the things that I have experienced in just the 2 hours I have played make it impossible for me not to give this game a negative review considering the absolute wave of positive reviews it has. It is a great game. I will continue to play it after leaving this negative review, because it is 100% my kind of game. As someone who likes to optimize however, it is just so frustratingly lacking it hurts.

One of the first things I noticed about the depth of this game was the numbered flags that let you, at least as far as I thought, set an inventory to that slot and then open it without having to seek out the card. Seems like a really cool idea in theory, especially considering the character's satchel that you start with has the ability to be added to that bar. Except when I do that, I get a message saying there is no satchel here. The character is always where the character is, why would I have to take the satchel off?

There are multiple spots in the menu with the text ""The above text is a placeholder"", except this game is 1.0... As it has been early access for a while it makes sense there would be some placeholder stuff, but when you hit 1.0 you are releasing a full game. That implies the placeholders have done their job and been replaced with what was supposed to be there...

The last straw that made me minimize to write this review is, actually kind of funny, but at the same time it's extremely frustrating. I was exploring and found a crab. Then immediately after finding the crab, a seagull show up and takes it... This while I had an empty spot on my person... I feel like food should probably be added to the person if possible to avoid stuff like this from happening...

It boils down survival games to its bare mechanics, what makes survival games fun isn't a 3D character physically walking around from place to place its the choices you make, and it is their consequences, and that is all this game is.
Also cards are cool it feels like im big braining a really long convoluted turn in Yu-Gi-Oh

Both beginner friendly and still a challenge after hundrets of hours in. 

Use a small stone on big a stone to get a cutting tool. 
Use that on a coconut to peel and puncture it.

Easy, right?

Do it few more times and realise you get diarrhoea from it, loosing food and drink stats. 
Collect and eat coal from your fire place to combat that, making you thirsty.

But you've forgotten to put your coconut halves out when it rained, so you are now looking for puddles in nearby locations.
You should get out of the sun anyway, that sunburn starts to look bad. 
Parched, you find a puddle and drink to survive, even though the water looks unclean.
Now you are starting to feel ill and in search of healing plants. Or could you just wait it out?
And what is with all those bugs?

There are solutions to every problem, all with their respective pros and cons.

Card Survival: Tropical Island is a fascinating and intricately detailed turn-based survival game expressed entirely through cards and counters.  While most survival games oversimplify concepts in order to focus on action, this game has a simple graphical style and interface which is easy to approach, but difficult to master--and which disguises an understanding of survival scenarios which would make expert outdoorsfolk sit up and take notice.  It is clear that the devs have put a lot of care and thought into their game, and I dearly hope that they can turn this game into a larger series!

Edit:  After many changes and additions, Card Survival: Tropical Island has finally reached full release!

I was actually ""forced"" to buy this once I played it somewhere and blanked out for 2.5 hours, completely ignoring the outside world... 3 times in the same week.

Now that I bought it, I sincerely played it for 5 hours on the first day. I don't quite know what it is, but this game just presses all the right buttons in my brain and makes me waste time I genuinely would rather spend on other stuff.
Some improvements I loved since I last played was the farmer character, which changes things up a bit, still keeping it all challenging, but also speeding up some parts of the early game. It also makes me value much more some resources that you usually take for granted, and Safety mode, which, while gives me mixed feelings, allows me to enjoy the game much more, in the end.

Only Issue I had so far was when I found a cliff and the option to climb down said ""(Not a chance)"". I, for some reason, interpreted it as ""this is guaranteed, it has no chance of failure"" and, well, I got stranded on a beach. Just use safe mode to revert it, right? Nope, it happened just at the end of the day and, while I hadn't died, I could only rewind time to immediately after I got stranded, and there was no plausible way of returning to a safe place before dying of dehydration.

Day 55. It's raining. Both of my reservoirs are filling up with fresh rainwater, truly a sight to behold. Soon my cistern will be finished as well, granting along with the spacious and well-furnished mud hut a truly comfortable position for survival. I am feeling great!

Day 65. It hasn't rained in ten days. I still have a little over a reservoir of water left. I think nothing of it and spend my days gathering wood, nursing my grandfather, bringing home saltwater from the sea and boiling it to obtain the salt, building up an impressive stockpile of cured boar meat from boars I have trapped. I gather rocks from the sea to continue work on the cistern.

Day 70. The first Reservoir is empty. It will rain again soon and when it rains, I better have my cistern build by then. Not that it would endanger my survival if it didn't.

Day 73. The second reservoir is empty as well, I spend increasing time on gathering water from the ponds and the cave of the mudlands as well as from banana trees and finish building the cistern.

Day 74. A Macaque raids my home and tries to steal my stuff. I injure it severly with my sling and even, if my water situation worsens by the day, begin nursing it to gain a friend on this deserted island. Along with my grandfather he'll keep me good company!

Day 77. Clouds form, first only a few, then a lot. Gleefully awaiting the longed-for rain, I spend the day carving wood and practising climbing. The rain doesn't come. My last glimmer of hope vanishes along with the clouds.

Day 79. I have built the alembic, allowing me to make water from undrinkable see water, this should permanently fix my acute water issues. Excited to try it out, I walk to the bay, gathering water. Upon returning, I fill it in, light the fire and wait. I am left disappointed. The two vases of water it took me half a day to collect have become reduced to on vase full, over multiple hours, while consuming most of my stick reservers. Nevertheless, I will keep using it, as it is one additional renewable source of water I have left, and, while more labour-intensive, faster than waiting for water to slowly collect in the cave in the wetlands

Day 81. I am my lowest. Dehydrated and desperate, I have set up coconut bowls at every rotting banana tree trunk I could find. At this point all the trees in the deep jungle next to my home have been used up, the remaining trees are far apart. I spend all day walking between these and the ocean. I am currently at the wetlands when the sun's last rays vanish. It is night, I am left in the dark with no way out. I am seriously dehydrated. Everything hurts. The banana tree trunk is slowly dripping out water, which I instantly drink, but it isn't enough. Not at all. I check the cave. Here too the water is collecting to slowly. And it's unpurified. I drink it regardless. I return to the surface. I am not going to make it. No way.

Day 82. It's past midnight. I haven't slept, only rested a little bit, while frantically consuming the few drops water the tree and cave provide. Is there no way to leave the wetlands. Then I notice it. There is. I had set up a camp fire in the cave earlier to explore. I had only found bugs, but now that then-questionable decision would be my saviour. I deconstructed the campfire and reconstructed it at the surface. I tried to make a fire drill to ignite the tinder, but failed. It was to dark. I really should have thought this through. How would I even light the way from the mudlands? I have no torches, no candles, nothing. And I can't carry the campfire along the path. It's hopeless. This is the day I die. I go to rest again, awaiting the inevitable. I drink what I have, and rest once more. The sun rises. Somehow I have made it though the night, extremely stressed, dangerously dehydrated. I move  to the deep jungle to find the bowl at that regions banana tree to be full. I devour all the water that's left. Carefully estimating the firmness of my stool I drank a bit of coconut milk as well. I was once again in a reasonable state.

Day 84. I have found a routine, and am beginning to regain some hydration for myself. Not enough to start stockpiling it though, sadly.

Day 85. It started raining. I am free. After a month of draught, the gates heaven unleash a torrent of water. My hope is restored. Beginning to fill up the cistern with the water I collect from the rain using various bowls and my two reservoirs, I realize the sheer dimensions of what I have constructed. This will last for a long time and I am now in a truly comfortable position for survival. I am feeling great!",1660085326,1660085326,True,40,4,0.800979256629943848,0,True,False,True

Devs, i hope this game is making as much money as I feel it should, because I REALLY wanna see those other biome games that you've hinted at in the community section!

Edit: Well, an additional 15 hours and the game is just as fun as when i started. the newest update at the moment (character creation) adds some long-ish term goals (unlocking perks to customize future characters) and adds a lot of replay value to a game that already feels easy to pick up and play over and over again. 

I already highly recommended this game before, and 15 more hours of it didnt change anything.


OP: This game deserves a lot more hype. For as simple as its design is; its super fun to play.

Unlike most games that give you what you can craft, this game does not... mostly. It does have a tips and trick booklet that you can check and get an idea for some things, but other combinations you have to think on a survival knowledge check. They are going for realistic and it totally fits.

I want to give a better review after it gets out of Early Access because you just don't know what they will add. The developer is super active not only on updates, but on the discussion thread giving feed back and taking feedback and suggestions to add things into the game. Which doesn't just make it a passion project to him, but kind of a community project from us.

Sense it's Early Access there are certain things that aren't fleshed out, but don't be fooled as if that means it's not polished.  There are Traits that you can unlock by surviving. These traits will allow you to change up the game-play and create your own kind of scenario. These traits can make the game easier or more challenging. The world is pretty vast and the drop/scavenge of things and the difficulty of the game is surprisingly well balanced. Progression is mandatory, but this does not make it feel restricted in how you play the game. This is a management game sliced into a survival scenario and served in a card format which is kind of refreshing style of game-play.

The turn-based gameplay and the clean UI allow for a more relaxed playstyle compared to action-based survival titles, though fighting for survival against the island's many hazards can still feel properly dramatic sometimes.

[h2]1. Story & Setting[/h2]
You are alone on a remote tropical island. You can play as someone who turned their back on civilization (but brought some starting supplies), or a hardy islander with no possessions, or a stranded tourist, or even a mermaid (who can drink salt water but can't stay on land for long). Optionally you can also create your own character from more than 50 perks and handicaps.

Your task is to survive, and eventually build a raft and leave, though you can stay on the island indefinitely if you want to. That's practically all the story there is, the game doesn't have much of a narration and the sparse in-game texts are mostly just matter-of-factly explanations. For example, item descriptions rarely tell you how something looks, smells, or feels, and thus don't contribute much to the player's immersion - instead, they provide hints like ""Could use this together with mud to make a mud brick.""

That said, the game's mechanics provide a lot of hooks to spin your own stories in your head. So while I was technically just moving cards around, in my mind I was living through a vivid story where I suffered a broken leg from a boar attack, made a makeshift splint, crawled back to some water puddles to stay hydrated, prayed for rain because I had developed a fever and needed more water than the puddles provided, tried to subsist on coconut water (but it gave me diarrhea and I also couldn't climb trees to get more coconuts due to my broken leg), eventually succumbed to sleep on the grass bed in my small cave, and then died from dehydration while the rain started pouring down, because I was too weak to wake up.

My impression is: With a fair amount of imagination and some knowledge of how a survival situation may feel like, you will probably find a multitude of interesting emergent stories here even though the game does not tell them explicitly. Otherwise, the game may feel more like a complex optimization puzzle, which can also feel very engaging, but perhaps not quite as immersive.

[h2]2. Gameplay & Mechanics[/h2]
All gameplay is done through cards. For example, the location ""beach"" always has a ""sea"" card present. Clicking on the ""sea"" card gives you the option to either dive for conches, or wash yourself. Dragging a ""stone"" card on top of another ""stone"" card creates a ""sharpened stone"" card, which you can then drag on a ""long stick"" to create a ""rustic spear"". Dragging that spear to the ""sea"" card then lets you hunt fish, which will also be represented as cards. All gameplay is turn-based, with each turn advancing daytime by multiples of 15 minutes. Advancing time will increase your thirst and hunger, so you'll have to find efficient actions to satisfy those basic needs.

One of the game's most striking features is the extreme detail and completeness of the simulation. Obviously you'll not only have to find water, food, and shelter, you'll also have to deal with wounds, infections, wild animals, rain storms, and many other hazards. But even your mental state is tracked through several parameters including happiness, loneliness, and stress. In total, the game tracks about 100 different stats right down to details like blisters on your feet, back pain, stool consistency, or (say) overindulgence in crustacean food.

All these parameters are interconnected in intricate ways. As an example (minor spoiler ahead): [spoiler]You may encounter a cobra which, if you're careless, can spit poison at your eyes. That can cause permanent eye damage, which means that you may no longer be able to move around during dusk or dawn, because you can't see your environment clearly enough. You can prevent that effect by washing your eyes quickly. But if you only carry salt water with you, then - depending on your mental state - you may not have the courage to pour that into your eyes.[/spoiler]

Problems usually have several viable solutions. For example, you can build a shelter out of sticks and palm leaves, but you can also make base in a cave - or build a mud hut. You can hunt animals with a spear, build simple traps, develop more elaborate traps, fish with a rod, or try to grow crops instead. Water can be obtained and treated in a few different ways as well - and so on.

Gameplay has a strong focus on exploration and discovery. When you start the game, you'll have to explore your surroundings, which will yield some resources and (over time) unlock paths to other areas. where the process then repeats. There are currently about a dozen areas in the game, with differing resources, hazards, animals, and points of interest. Once an area is unlocked, it will remain accessible for that playthrough, and you'll eventually be able to roam the entire island. Another exploration element lies in the resources themselves, e.g. plants may have effects (beneficial or detrimental) that you can discover by preparing them in various ways.

Crafting is another major gameplay element. Obtaining new resources gives you hints about building new tools or structures. Some items need blueprints before they can be built, which will unlock either by building certain base items, or by reaching a certain level of skill - e.g. if you keep building and using traps, then your trapping skill will gradually increase, and eventually you'll unlock blueprints for more complex trap designs.

One potential issue with the current game design, is that starting several playthroughs with the same character felt a bit repetitive. You always start at the same location, your options are limited since you need to explore for a while to find other areas, and it also takes a while to develop the same skills that each character will need. While the resources that you find from exploring are randomized, you'll quickly know what can be expected from any area you've spent time in during a previous playthrough, so there isn't much opportunity for surprises. The problem got exacerbated by the fact that the game seemed to deliberately kill me several hours into my first two playthroughs - once by entering the dry season after 30 days with no warning (so I died of dehydration), and once by a fever that I also got no warning about (since the area where I found water also has a high infection risk).

To proceed beyond this point, I had to first focus strictly on water preservation while it was still raining, and then focus strictly on stocking up the means of treating the fever that I now knew would be coming. There was no way for me to overcome either issue without meta-knowledge from my first two playthroughs. While that's basically just ""learning to play the game"", I feel that there's an imbalance between the inevitability of those deaths, the loss of playthroughs with many hours invested in them, and the repetitiveness of starting again. That said, the game is still in early access, and the developers are still tweaking those elements, so things are likely to change before release. The repetitiveness of subsequent playthroughs can already be diminished by creating characters with different perks, which can be unlocked with a ""meta-currency"" that you'll collect while playing.

- The game keeps track of the amounts of bacteria and parasites (respectively) inside your body system in exact numbers, in the save file. You get sick only when they grow out of control. Your immune system is killing them at a constant rate. 
- There's a hidden stat called ""mental structure"", representing how confident you are that you're in control. It is affected by a variety of factors. Basically the less comfortable life you are living, the weaker mental structure you have. Low mental structure lowers your morale and causes psychological problems which may lead to detrimental delusions. I won't spoil too much here. It's some remarkable experience. 
- The game even has a dynamic ecological environment. Basically the more you kill certain species - be it an animal or a plant - the slower they reproduce. If you rarely touch a certain species or plant a lot more of them, they will grow more and more, and expand their habitat to nearby locations. 

Now you get the idea. The game is a lot deeper than it looks. Go, explore and experiment, die and start again. It's gonna be rough, but you'll love it.

tl;d it's a solid good game with some grind tied to the survival aspect, with some harsh but fair difficulty.

This is flag as a card game, but it's really not in the way you would think at first glance.

the card are here just to represent the item, location, actions, etc.

For example you move a stone card over another stone card to make a chipped stone that can act as a cutting tool.

Now that's out of the way, some cons :
-some tedious could be helped (at the cost of dev time). I'm not talking about changing the game itself, just the number of click involved or each action.
Looting all the trap at once (since it doesn't cost in game time, just a lot of clicking).
Having a small ""action"" icon on the corner of some card (so you can eat wihout opening the card, or make fiber, any basic action that need to be done a lot).
Having a quick way to move all small portion of water from a stack of half coconut into filled half coconut, to reduce the amount of half coconut filled with water and thus reduce the water loss by evaporation.
Filling a stack of small jar/etc from the water pool in one go instead of doing it one per one.

-some information about the gameplay is totally hidden from the player and can be confusing (how trap works, effect of the current issue you have like +15min per movement, current skill level, are you skilled enough to perform this action ...). I would advise people to check the faq/forum and ask when needed. Dev is active here, so there is little space for missinformation in this steam forum for once. I understand why it's like this tho, since it's not v1.0 yet.

-late game is limited by metal tool - and to get them you need copper. Copper is limited, i'v searched far and wide and couldn't made all the copper gear. If I lose my knife/axe, I won't have any spare and I'll never be able to do some trap & carpentry, heavily limiting the gameplay.

Now some pros :
-feel like a good survival game - no instant kill crap, no research bench that tell you exactly what you need to do to progress, no map, etc. You just try and discover by yourself, and it works fine in this game.
-Good balance overall
-some option at the start to make the game more easy or harder, with a custom start (you can unlock all options with point earned each day you survive)
-the game play fast (animations, scrolling)

 I find it really frustrating that all the steps to a recipe are not listed, so the player is unaware of how many resources total it will take up. Ex. I got all the materials for the first part of the mud hut, only to realize there were more ingredients neccessary. So I just used up 1.5 hrs of in game time for basically nothing that immediately benefits me. Additionally, I used up valuable energy to cut down enough trees for that recipe. Furthermore, some explanations of what some items do when hovering over them would be really nice. Often I would not understand what an item is and craft it blindly to figure out only to realize it was unneccessary. Before you ask why didnt I just look up what the items did in google, I didn't want to. I don't think it's my fault for not knowing what some of these items are. What the game decides is a blueprint and what is a recipe is also really unintuitive.  Like how the mudbrick is a recipe that unlocks the kiln, but the clay is somehow not? I don't think it makes the game easier to know a basic function and a borderline neccessary mechanic. Some of the features feel so unintuitive as well. Like I would never know that to get more water you have to cut down a banana tree (which can also run out of water). Water is the most important resource in the game as well, which makes this oversight even harsher. I feel like some of these resevoirs dry up so fast that it is so incrediably frustrating to operate around them. While I like the challenge the game provides, I think difficulty settings or easing up on some elements would make the game  feel a lot more fair and enjoyable. You can get several hours in a run only to die from dehydration (even when you planned ahead of time) because the water you stored evaporated or a banana tree 45 minutes away dried out.  It's a brutal, and really discouraging to come back and spend another 5 hours on another run just to get back where you left off. 

This all makes it sound like I don't like the game, but I really do and want it to succeed! I think it's extremely fun. I would just like more accessibility because while I do think it's very fun, I also find it frustrating to not be able to play the game the way I would like to play it.

It's rogue-like turn-based card survival game, and quite addicting. You are stranded on a remote southsee island and have to survive. The ultimate goal is to leave the island and return to civilisation.
Most actions (building, exploring, cooking etc) cost a certain amount of time (in 15min increments).
You can build shelters, craft a large range of items and explore the island. There are several stats (hunger, thirst, sleepiness, morale, ...) you have to watch. Doing things several times adds to the specific skill level which in turn opens new building/craft options and offers a better chance at doing something (e.g. climbing a palm tree to get coconuts).

The game is hard. Expect to die several times in the beginning until you know the game and the island better (in my first try I died on day 2 ...), but with every new start you progress further and discover more.
The game has a very active and friendly community. Don't hesitate to ask in the forum for help.
The devs are awesome, fast responding (and hotfixing) reported bugs. Until now (27.01.22) they had a weekly update schedule, from now on they do a bi-weekly update (to be able to test more throroughly and offer larger updates), which I think is a wise decision. The game runs very stable.

Just like Card Quest, this is a hidden gem made with passion worth discovering. The fundamental mechanics are quite solid, even though the audio and visual aspects are lacking, and some design elements are rough around the edge.

The good :

1. The survival, exploration and crafting themes are well merged with the mechanics, in a way that becomes quite addictive. 
2. The UI is very descriptive and clear, so getting started is easy. The game gives you just enough information to not be confused, while still letting you make some discoveries on your own.
3. As of today, the game has enough content so that if feels quite deep and engaging. It's also updated weekly. 

The bad :
1. The game is very grindy and time consuming, often in a mindless zombie way  (those coconuts...). I wish some processes were sped up somehow, to make the focus more about actual decisions. 
2. Unfortunately, the game is too ambitious for it's own UI. Managing dozens of card interactions when you only see about 12 cards at a time gets very frustrating and cumbersome. I hope they will find a solution to make the many items easier to manage.
3. The overall game length is so long that dying and starting over feels really bad.

Please, stop playing this game, have a drink of water - then return to playing.

Interesting system, moving cards (or items) on top of each other to create various actions. I really like the perk system, and the options to unlock various perks to make the journey a little easier - though not entirely simple - and a bit different each time.

Would highly recommend - it somehow walks the balance between being extremely relaxing, and highly stressful all at once :)

I look forward to ongoing development!

Edit 6/12/21

So they've now updated the game to involve some sail travel - which is equally as fun, in the same vein as the rest of the game, and added a nice little extra survival strategy. After many, many attempts resulting in death from dehydration and heat stroke - I finally built a sturdy little raft, had some chests strapped to it, full of food and rope - and sailed away from the island that had been my home for 54 days - after 10 days braving the ocean, catching fish, taking regular dips in the ocean to prevent heat stroke - I was found by a ship and rescued on day 64.

I'm not sure if I have it in me to head back to the island right now, but I'm thinking I may return for the game show made around my initial experience, and see if I can go on two win a million dollars (not in real life).",1638105988,1638744814,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Have you ever watched the youtube channel 'Primitive Technology' -- the guy who builds cool mud huts, fires clay pots and uses a million little tricks to get it all done?

The art is nice, clean and functional. The updates are frequent, fun and substantial. The devs are wonderful people - eager to respond to questions, usually just within a day, exceptionally quick to fix bugs and so, so clearly wonderfully passionate about what they're doing. They've already finished a thoroughly content-rich, soulful and gorgeous game before with Card Quest -- and it's clear that they're in this for the long haul.


I've honestly never played a better survival game - and it's a card game! Somehow, despite that, it feels more immersive than anything else I've tried - and I've tried a lot of them! It's technical without being overwhelming, it's utterly deadly and difficult without being unfair - you claw your way forward through fever, starvation and disease. You talk to your only friend on this deserted island to stay sane: a painted coconut you made yourself, complete with hundreds of different little dialog snippets to really get you into the head of your harried survivor. 


Even better, it has modular starts to keep it fresh - you can start as a fat, unskilled plane crash victim complete with an urgent, bleeding wound, a native to the islands that's well-suited to the enviroment, a soldier tragically trapped after parachuting onto the island with naught but his firearm and a precious few bullets to eke out your survival with.

[u][b] Short PROS :[/b][/u]


a) Developers are regular with the updates, open to suggestions and fast with bug fixes. 

b) Game is simple to play but has a very deep complex system simulation under the hood which gives it a lot of potential for all kinds of players. 

c) Plenty of Perks to tailor and roleplay your runs or make them as easy or hard as you will. 

d) Plenty of Content for very affordable price. If they stopped here I would be more than happy with what I got for the money... they keep adding more each week though so it is getting even more amazing. 

[u][b]Short CONS [/b][/u]


a) If you do not like turn based games. Because in essence that is what it is. Game has a long array of actions. Most taking 15 minutes, some no time at all and some more hard ones a rounded multipler of 15 minutes. 

b) If you expect high end graphics or high quality music. For now there are sound effects and graphics while cute are lacking for some people. 

c) If you are staying away from EA titles even if developers are super active. Just in case. 

d) If the game is just not your thing. 


[u][b] Looooong Impressions  [/b][/u]


Like many others I stumbled on this game on Retromation's channel my first impression was... oh what a cute game I should totally try it out and well... do better than he is doing! 

So I bought it downloaded it and started breaking it apart with what i considered was an op tactic of making dozens and dozens of Coconut Flasks so I never die of thirst. 

I played slow, metodical, safe, avoided the dangers until i was ready. I loved the fact game did not punish me for it. I could take the game in nice and slow and move further and further into the Island and deal with challenges at my own pace as long as I did not ignore the Survival Aspects. 

There are many Survival Aspects. The main one is Thirst and Hydration. Dying from thirst is a real danger on daily basis and thinking ahead is important. There are many ways to make sure you have enough when needed. 
Hunger does not do anything by itself but it will make you sad and you will waste time if sad enough... but your body weight is a thing as well and if you do not eat for a couple of Weeks you will start to look like a Skeleton and eventually become one. 

There are many others which simulate the state of your body. From Bug Bites, to Abbrasions on Hands, Feet or Sleepines and even the current sate of your Stool. Yes you heard it right you can get Diarhea and lose liquid if you eat wrong things to much. 

But is this game really so complicated...

Well yes and no.

When you start out you can play as if the Water is the only thing you care about and you can do that for days and not be punished. But the problems will accumulate over time. Bacteria in your gut.. your body slowly losing fat... bugs patiently eating away.

This game is really easy to get into but a hard one to master. While none of the problems above or any other are a huge deal by themselfs, ignore them for to long and it will get out of hand. 

ANd that is the beauty of it. You can get into it and learn in this amazing Survival game one day at a time tackling challenges as they apear. 

For example the Bacteria you will not even be aware of until you sudently get Fever... and than you will get that lightbulb moment and realize what those Plants that have Antibiotic properties are for. 

Splendid. 

I could rant on and on but trust me here and check this game out. If you are some kind of action rpg or shooter person... well you are probably not reading this right then maybe not for you... but anyone who likes this kind of survival, exploration kind of games with simple mechanics but a lot of depth bellow... well you are in for a treat. 

But back to my run. I defeated the game on first try. I took a long time because I did it slow... but I did it... and then. I wanted to play it again but this time with harder setup and do it better. Since then I think i finished the game like 3 or 4 times. Each time with some interesting twist that made the gameplay different or challenging.

Which brings us to Perks and Characters. Shortly after I started playing a first Character was released called the Unlucky Guy. Compared to a Vanilla run this dude seamed like it will be a hell to play but shortly I realized that I am much better at the game now and I can play better and more optimal and survive this helish start. 

In the meantime game got a lot of new Perks which can make the game easier or harder and some of the challenging Perks are really something to think about before trying. Fractured leg for example really hampers your exploration early on and makes you totally switch priorities to even have a chance. 

Oh... and turns out the Coconut Flasks were a bit OP so they are not in the game anymore. But that is fine there are other ways to secure water. More sensible ways than making a truck load of them.


ANd finally and most importantly. Developers are treating this as a product of love. They put regular updates out. Usually this is balance and tweaks with some new mechanics or Perks but every now and then they treat us with an amazing new Character or whole new Area to explore... but this is just the begining. 

Game is called Card Survival : Tropical Island for a Reason. If this game is sucessfull they plan to make more in different settings. If this is not the reason to believe this will not be another EA cash grab I do not think what is... they clearly want it to suceed and make more amazing video games after. 

Developers are also fast at fixing bugs and rebalancing whatever seams to be way of. It is EA it happens. It is nice to get a fast feedback and know that things are being worked on. 

I will keep playing this game and be making more videos of it. Ah yes i make videos of it :D. So if you do not trust my word for it check out some of the videos and you will easily be able to tell yourself if it is a game for you or not. 

For me it definatly is and I am happy I am experiencing this game in its development Phase. Doing silly crazy OP things that will probably be removed at some point or balanaced... experiencing it in a rough state. 

But once it is done and refined I will make a new Review treating it as it is at that point... so I guess until then.

Bye bye and Cheers!

Weekly Updates
Satisfying Challenges to Overcome

In most survival games, making a fire and shelter is an easy feat and more about creative design than function. I promise you, you will not have a mud hut by day one. Each challenge never really goes away, just becomes easier with proper management. 

I had a run where I was more than a month into it, and water became my primary problem during the dry season. I was getting by with the few non-rain water sources available until sickness struck. I struggled along for a bit more, but inevitably perished to my maladies. This is the only game I have played where when you die, it doesn't feel like something out of nowhere killed you. Everything is clearly on display, it's up to you to manage it.",1632949829,1635266561,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

So I wanted to wait until I 'finished' the game before leaving a review. Cool concept; great execution ( including the update efforts ). I died a good dozen times ( thanks, Depression... Not a fan of this mechanic ) before breaking through the sad and establishing myself. The element of surprise is always there. Shipwrecks and wrong moves prove troublesome. Risks vs Reward is something you'll have to come to terms with. Despite some frustrations, as there will be in life, I am enjoying solving this puzzle and will be starting anew once I finish this.

Some of my early concerns have been addressed in updates; happy about that. Here's a few things I've considered tweaking ( if I made my own version anyway ):

Action: Stretch. For 15m, helps get rid of some Back Pain.

Items:

Could one use a rock to crush Pretty Seashells?

Banana Peel. Obtained by eating a Banana... Can be used in Crop Plot! ( As a sub for Fish? ) Attracts insects though.

Large Stick: Either give 2 Sticks or have no duration.

Island Salad: Remove Coconut Meat as an ingredient. An extra step for so little. Reduce the Satiety a bit if you must.

Mechanics: 

New Sleep Interruption: Seems... a little harsh? Maybe limit your sleep to 4h and reduce the amount of rest you get? Kinda new, but it really threw me for a loop when it got implemented while I was STARVING. Not sure why I should die of starvation despite having eaten meat a few times. :(

Depression: Losing 2 hours in one shot can screw things up pretty hard, especially early game where every action is precious. Putting something to cook / lighting a timber / having your time go past evening; one should definitely play around this as much as they can if they end up depressed, but mechanically it still bothers me a little. Two potential changes:

1) After the depression text, your next action takes twice as long, showing the mental and physical fatigue's effects on you. Your Happy would recover based on the duration of the original action, to maybe represent the feeling of accomplishment.

2) Cut the 'rest' time to 30m and reduce the amount of Happy gained proportionately; this will interrupt a little more often, but minimizes the risk of 'wasting' resources.

Pee n' Poo: I'm surprised you didn't include these, especially since you have diarrhea. What made you exclude them?

Bugs?

Weird moment during Depression: I spotted a Seagull, then had the Depression penalty take over, then the Seagull cutscene happened. Seems weird that a Seagull would stay there for 2 hours? :)

Highlands: After the update I did a LOT of exploring and got NO copper stuff. Did I miss something?

It is absolutely unforgiving and one mistake could be the deciding factor in toppling the seesaw, but it's absolutely the game for gluttons of punishment. It has a lot of things going for it, but there's also some factors that could do with some improvement.

Pros:
1) I've never seen a game get updated as often as this one. Getting burned on abandonware on Steam is unfortunately common, but I have no worries with that here. These developers are not only dedicated to quality in updates, but quantity as well, a best of both worlds with Card Survival

2) Every run, even this early in development, is something different. The character creation update was a huge leap in the right direction for the sake of being able to start over again and again (which you likely will due to the difficulty). One run you can focus on specific skills and the next on other skills; it really gives way to being able to experiment with what works for you, and there's no one solution to a problem either. 

3) While Card Survival is hard as nails, it's mostly fair in its difficulty. Rarely while I am playing do I have something negative to me and think that it's unfair. Ofc with more updates this is likely to be an enhanced point of positivity, but the line between fair and unfair is thin with these types of games, and I think the devs are treading it pretty well

Cons:

1) While I said previously that there's no one correct way to survive, some methods/skills feel like a slog at best or pointless at worst. I remember before yesterday's update that I felt like trapping was a completely useless thing to do because it would be using precious fishing bait for something that just wouldn't pay out, or if it did, it wouldn't be worth it (I'm looking at you deadfall trap). 

2) The balancing is done pretty well, but that doesn't mean some offenders slipped through the cracks. The worst offender of this is definitely the Shipwreck. Every time I'd try to get something from it I would end up with a deep laceration, which if you're unprepared for what lies ahead is absolutely a game over scenario. Even with my swimming skill maxed out, I would get badly cut two or three times before I get something like rope or a jerry can. I feel like it could really be a great boon to the game, but it desperately needs a rework before I can call it fair.

Suggestions:

1) Upon looking at an action depending on what it is, it has a percentage of success based on its appropriate skill (i.e. Climbing, Swimming) and most of the time, the current method works since it's either pass or fail. In unique circumstances such as boar hunting though, it can either be a complete success, a partial success, or a complete failure. In this instance, it still shows up as either a pass or a fail, so it would be awesome if it showed the percentages of all possible outcomes.

2) As of this review, I feel like the sea could do with more life. While there's definitely lots you can do right now, it can definitely do with more content in that area. Examples of some things that could be implemented is jellyfish encounters, sharks, or like how boars work, you can catch massive fish that can be eaten off of multiple times. Maybe even a more ambitious idea is using a less complex version of the raft to be able to sail to a different island for different resources to make a more permanent raft that could be used to escape the island.

3) With the update that implemented the character creator, the Islander was added, confirming that there's other human life present on the island. Interacting with a tribe of natives could be really cool as it would vary on hostility or hospitality based on choices made or existing factors like how much you damaged the ecosystem or how long you've survived on the island. It could even lead way to improving skills with native trainers or even the creation of new skills such as Diplomacy or Bartering. 

Overview:
This game isn't just fun, it's really fun. For a game that's only been out on Steam for a month, it's accomplished more than what other titles have done in years. The game, even from when I got it a few weeks ago, is drastically different today at comparison, and the beauty of it all is that it's still changing as we speak. The weekly updates are fantastic and I absolutely would recommend it, even at it's current state. I'm excited to see where this game goes in its direction, and I'll be sure to keep playing it and supporting the title.

TL;DR: Card Survival: Tropical Island is unforgiving in difficulty, but it's fair about it. Every playthrough is something different and the devs implement new material weekly. I would absolutely recommend people try it, especially at the low price it currently stands at.

On it, a lone New Zealand man (John Plant) stripped down to nothing but his shorts, plopped himself down in the middle of a random patch of forest and wordlessly began to build structures, tools and equipment using nothing but what was directly around him. No tools, no foreign supplies, no help.  That channel is known as Primitive Technology.

It is very clear that Grim, the developer of Card Survival: Tropical Island, was either intrigued by or, like me, an avid fan of Mr. Plant. This game is practically an homage to the channel, in all the right ways. From sculpting and firing pots and jars, to building your own hut out of handmade clay bricks and mud. In fact, if you find yourself stuck or not able to figure out a recipe, I wager you could use the Primitive Technology videos as a reference.

That isn't to say that this is a ripoff. Quite the contrary, its a well thought-out and excellently executed challenge to anyone thinking they have the knowledge to thrive on a desert island. High praise must be given to the how the game handles the ever-present meters that signify survival.

[spoiler]
The game is generally speaking fun, but it has some elements that are just way too grindy, such as leveling up various skills. Perhaps they'll feel less grindy when the full game comes out, but seeing as you seemingly can flee with a raft already (I died like, two weeks before I would've made it to a ONE SHOT BOAR *coughgrumblecough*), I can't help but feel like the current grind should be minimized. The UI is also very, very cluttered. You have to scroll back and forth like crazy to view all your items, which, I mean, there has to be a better way to implement the UI than that.

I personally don't think the UI tells you enough either, even though it is cluttered. When I first played the game, I went all in on the coconuts. They give diarrhea, but as they're the only source of water early on, I troopered on and drank from them anyway. Turns out, severe diarrhea makes you lose water as well, so much so that you lose more than you gain from drinking the coconuts. So you're only supposed to drink some of the coconuts and perhaps find alternate food sources to cover your food needs. The UI did not inform me of this, so I effectively lost all of my runs early on to the same ailment over and over again without having a way to figure it out from the UI. The moment I discovered this, the game became a cake-walk from one moment to the next (barring the awkward UI and the ONE SHOT BOAR grrrr)

Even then, I had fun. There's a nice sense of progression and discovery through the whole thing, and the theme of survival is well implemented into the crafting mechanics. For some examples of this, you can't drink salt water, but you can get salt from it. Coconuts can be stripped for fibers that you can make clothes from, they can be drunk from, eaten from and then you can use the shells to contain water or throw them into the fire for extra fuel. That kind of versatility in the crafting is really, really nice. (One caveat, I would've wished a copper axe chopped faster than a rock one, even if by just 15 minutes or so. It's sturdier, better built and has a stronger material, which should translate into better swinging speeds and better chops, but it does not from what I gathered). So most of the gameplay does seem inspired directly from reality, which is really nice and makes the discovery a lot more intuitive.

I can, overall, recommend this if you have patience for grindy mechanics and awkward UI's, because it is dang fun.[/spoiler]",1633804037,1633804037,True,1,0,0.474452555179595947,0,True,False,True

This game is absolutely brutal, punishing, and just one misstep can sink you... and yet it is one of the most fun and satisfying games I've played this year. Every choice matters, everything slowly leads you down a new path of discovery. 

You will die, and you will come back and your next attempt will be infinitely better because of no other reason than you just gained more knowledge, and yet that is never frustrating. All the while you are applying real-world logic about survival that almost always has a mechanical implementation in the game that feels appropriate and fair.

This game accomplishes what many survival simulators try to do but many fail, it manages to really make you feel like you are alone on a desert island where resources are limited and every minute matters to guarantee your survival. 

You will have to make tough choices because every decision matters and the feeling of managing your resources & discovering new recipes will keep you wanting to just play one more in-game day time after time.

Of course, this game is still on EA and it is clear that some content is lacking, but the developer is very active both in interacting with the community and implementing new content through weekly updates so I am sure that the future of this game is bright.

Bottom line: If you give this game a chance and look past its simplistic cover, you will find a true gem. 100% recommend.",1633520426,1633599621,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Its been six weeks since launch and they have released a new update every Sunday with bug fixes and exciting new features. They are active on the discussions board and take feedback so gracefully. This is my first time buying early access where I decided to be involved in discussions and the developer answered a lengthy feedback post of mine point by point, and just days later one of my suggestions that they had agreed with was implemented into the game.  Once when I emailed them a save file to show them a bug, they even sent it back to me just an hour later fixed so that I wouldn't lose my progress!

As far as the game itself goes, its incredibly addicting - kind of like a slow relaxed version of Don't Starve. You will die early on several times as you learn the ropes and encounter various challenges, but eventually you become more skilled at preparation and managing priorities. The game moves at your pace - time doesn't pass until you take an action, and you can see immediately the impact your action has on your statuses. Making progress and unlocking new items to craft is very satisfying. 

At first glance before buying the game I thought the aesthetics were a bit amateur, but I've completely fallen in love with the soft airbrushed art in the game and the simplicity of the fonts. It gives me a nostalgia for 90s PC gaming. The minimalist animations and sound effects triggered by actions are cute and well thought out from an immersion standpoint. Despite it being completely card based, It feels like you're actually creating a story and I find myself imagining my character as doing all these things, whether its cooking fish by the fire at the beach or digging up mud from a puddle in the jungle. There is no music, just peaceful environmental noises like the waves on the beach, the crackling of the fire and crickets in the jungle, which I much prefer to a looping soundtrack and could always put my own music on in the background if I really wanted to. Even when the game is stressful, such as when you're bleeding out or starving, you can take all the time you need to plan your next move. 

As it is EA, they are still working on some balance issues and bug fixes, but right now its flowing incredibly well and I'm very close to beating it. My only major gripe with the game is that the UI is still a bit clunky. Given that it is an addictive mouse based game, the amount of clicking and dragging that is required can feel excessive. There is no automatic sorting, so if you don't take the time to regularly organize your cards to minimize scrolling (which requires a periodic investment of MORE clicking and dragging, but saves you time and sanity in the long run), inventory management becomes overwhelming. Eventually it does become second nature to be mindful about your items (especially after you do stupid things, like forgetting to empty your sack before you travel into the deep jungle to gather supplies). In the past several updates they have already made huge improvements to the functionality by adding bookmarks and rearranging item placement, so I expect this will continue to improve. 

All in all its absolutely worth the price point and I am so happy to support this kind, hardworking Dev. I look forward to the updates and will definitely follow their future projects. 

P.S. I have NOT played the game for an entire 72 hours... I often just have it open and I reward myself with an ""island day"" in between real life chores. its a good game for that kind of thing if you can prevent yourself from getting sucked in which... is not easy!

For the first time in a while, I feel like this game accomplishes what few survival titles do. It feels genuinely and organically rewarding to progress through the game. The focus is not crafting powerful items and completely terraforming the land to an unrecognizable state, Instead, it's about making strategic choices to improve your personal skills and learning to adapt to your surroundings. I am constantly surprised by how thoughtfully scripted the game is. While the UI is pretty utilitarian, the card illustrations are painterly and the sound design does its job to inform the player. The game is not in real time, so it's easy to pause and plan your next move despite how dynamic the game feels.  

Card Survival: Tropical Island is being improved at a rapid pace. (They just patched the game as of the day I'm posting this.) The game gets weekly updates for both content and quality-of-life improvements and the devs are incredibly quick to respond.
