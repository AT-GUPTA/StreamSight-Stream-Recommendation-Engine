Simon Henrikkson is no hero, no carrier of hope like mainstream or average titles. He's a very flawed human. No magic, no powers, just him. When you play, you aren't just controlling Simon, you ARE Simon. Every action you do (i.e. story choices or certain boss fights) is what you would do in that situation.

-guns feel powerful when you shoot them
-spamming voices is funny

Cons
-had to use hamachi to play with friends
-game crashed when I fixed the resolution
-ammo/guns are inconsistent between levels
-most monsters kill you in 1-3 hits and theres next to no ammunition to be found
-game runs the worst out of all my games and yet it looks like garbage even for the sorce engine
-pausing the game pauses for everyone in the server so I spamed esc and fooled my buds to think it was lagging bad, sadly when I stopped it didn't get much better
-huge open areas with multiple stories and hundreds of empty rooms getting everyone lost almost every time, at least fill those empty rooms with ammo or things to look at rather than absolutely nothing
-runs at 19fps on lowest settings even when skyrim runs at 60 on medium
-monsters are bullet sponges
-not spooky, models look silly and I would point them out whenever I got a kill, not to mention the character models are silly too

Frustrating. Absolute frustrating after the first chapter. But the small download size compensates for its poor level design according to today's standards. The AI is clumsy, getting stuck in the walls, closed doors to name a few. But the one thing which I liked is the randomality of enemy spawns. I mean if you go through a level and just died a few inches away from the door(which leads to the next level), and are forced to spawn back from the beginning, the enemies are not there where you last saw them and expect to encounter because of the random spawns. Another down fact is that the weapons. Very rare and inconvinient spawns which make the first hour extremely frustrating. I know for this genre there needs to be a scarcity of ammo, but scarcity to this degree was ridiculous where you are offered with a 6 shot single magazine and the enemies require more than 3 shots to be killed, even though you headshot them, the gun offered at the beginning does not carry out its job of headshotting properly.",1485966824,1485967121,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Really glad it's free, becuase I would've regretted paying even a single cent for this.
Only because a game is free doesn't make it good.

This game has more bugs than Hollywood made movies. Unplayable.
When a game is hard, because it literally does not give you the ability to kill an enemy, and you can only beat them by respawning (which refills your magazine) and bug-abuse/glitch-abuse it is not ""well made"" as I read it here.

- It doesn't let you carry things more than six or three
- There are no cheats
- It gives 5 save slots
- There is no auto respawning. If you die, game ends. And you may load any saved games manually then
- Terrifying atmosphere, very creative monsters, limited resources. Horror part comes from jumpscares. But besides that, the environment doesn't make you feel good, maybe the last part.
