The main issue being disappearing switch gear. Sometimes the model of the switch gear is there. Other times it's invisible but will pop up if you click your mouse when the activation icon appears. Most times it just stays invisible and nearly impossible to use, if it works at all. In one of the engines there is a indication light in behind and in between to panels. You can tell it's supposed to be a 'line volt light' icon, because there is an identical one properly placed on the pan panel. Also, they're pretty nervy charging what they do, for you locomotives considering the amount of work it takes to model one, i.e very little. With errors in them yet! This is to name but two problems with the game. There are many more. Thankfully I purchased this game on sale. There is absolutely no way this is worth what they're asking at the regular price.

Dear developers of Train Simulator, if you happen to read reviews and actually care what your customers think of your game; you require direction, organization and some basic business ethics, feel free to contact me. You're simulator is a joke. You need help polishing and completing this game. My consulting fees are very reasonable.

Second day with this ""simulator"" and I can tell everyone to just walk away. Do not purchase this so called game. There are way too many bugs and glitches. It's not fun. it's just frustrating. Purely aggravating. It's as if someone let a bunch of elementary students loose with a crap game engine. I can't believe adults had the bald faced audacity to release this drivel to the public and actually charge money for it. Even if this was a free simulator I would consider it a waste of money. I feel like Dovetail should pay me for the time I lost with this inferior software. $133.77 should just about cover my base frustration. Plus $10.00 to $50.00 for every bad emotion after frustration.

1st of all, the academy is so bad that I needed to search and learn the rules by searching on Google. 2nd, To make matters worse then I thought the game is so bad optmized. Even Euro Truck Simulator 2, with better graphics, all in high!, has a better performance. 3rd, you made a tab in the menu saying ""Tutorial"" but nothing was shown, so I really don't know what's the point of it. 4th, I learned very well the controlls, but why can't I increase the brakes level? I have used all the ways you teach, but no matter what train, no matter what scenario or difficulty, the breaks never increased. 5th,why doesnt the TGV speed up after I stop it?  I had always to stop the engine and start it again, and that was the only way to speed up normally again. 6th,  in one of the missions (4 or 5 counting from the  beggining) in career mode, you tell us to move the container carriages to one of the lines, but one thing? all of them? To that line? the why you tell us to move them to another line? is it supose to move all of them? which one then? why do you have so many numbers after ""Marshall"" ? You don't explain that?

I'm just a gamer, I shouldn't need a degree to have fun while at the same time learning the train mechanics, this game does a poor job in that departmen. And my point is, once I can refund, I wouldn't recommend the game meanwhile you don't fix this problems.

Firstly, there is little content in the base game and the DLCs are expensive for this game. Sometimes the DLC is more expensive than the game itself.
Secondly, this game runs disappointingly poorly for the amount of money they are charging for it.

This game has problems that Dovetail wont fix.

Reasons why you should not buy it:
1. Game crashes frequently
2. Trains use same horns as others
3. Quality isn't as good as TSW 3. It feels too dark.
4. EVERYTHING IS EXPENSIVE!!!
5. THE GAME IS EXPENSIVE!!!
6. Just lacks quality.
7. All the train horns are from 2015 and older.
8. A LOT of bugs.
9. After refunding your locomotive or route, it just stays in your library.
If i were you, refund it or just don't buy it.
10. Game crashes for no reason.

Reasons why you should buy it:
1. If you don't mind all the problems, it can be fun.
2. There are tons of trains
There are really no good things about the game.

heres my thoughts 2k hours on.

If you like trains its brilliant...but the content on steam just isnt good enough 
to get the most out of the game you need to be spending hundreds of dollars.
the AP Sky and weather Pack is a game changer but even still i cant say i recomend this game even on discount. i really do want to say its a good game but its still lacking so much. the game even on a 5800X and RTX 3080 still crashes and runs at around 80fps. my biggest gripe is the crashes sometimes it crashes just by placing a loco. 

in short
if you like trains and have the money 7/10 but if your thinking of buying it for the discount 3/10",1545343306,1704010410,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is no base game, you're just buying a license to use their game engine. Then you need to buy the DLCs, witch is the locomotives and routes. Everytime you buy a locomotive you need to be sure it is compatible with the routes you have (or you can buy a locomotive + the route it's intended for). Good thing is that often they sell package content, so you can buy a route with lots of locomotives for this route. If you are unsure on where to start, just search for a route that you know, a country that you want to try. Every route and locomotive comes with a manual that you NEED to read. There you will have route's history and description, and how to control the locomotives. This is a simulator so there is a learning curve that you need to go through.
This game is looking beautiful nowadays with their engine update. The models are old crap. So buildings and cars and etc will look like you are playing a 2000s game. But overall it's still beautiful when you play it (I think it's the lightning system).
One major let down. A LOT of missions are broken. When you buy a route or loco, there will certainly be a mission or two that will be broken somehow. Consequently not all achievement are gettable.",1476811496,1702174300,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When Train Sim World came out, I significantly reduced my playing time of this game as the newer title made this game feel incredibly outdated.

The controls of the game are supporting of an Xbox Controller as well as a mouse and keyboard, and I prefer to play with a controller in ""expert"" mode which I find easier than the simplistic mode. My only complaint is with the door opening. Looking down at the platform does not always work, and it makes the service I am playing late sometimes.

I am sure I will continue to play this game whilst I wait and hope for the Chatham Mainline & Medway Valley Lines to go on to Train Sim World. Would I recommend this game from 2009 in 2023?

DLC is a big part of this game, base price is too expensive, definitely wait for it to be on sale. The quality of DLC ranges from great to unusable so seek out reviews for the specific DLC you're looking at. 
The community for this game is great, lots of scenarios and routes on the community hub and a lot of good mods you can find online.
If you are looking for an accurate simulator, this is not it. Some trains do an alright job of it but a lot of them are really screwy when it comes to the first person controls, gauges, valves, etc.

You may also need to buy a lot of routes to not get bored, or maybe even make your own. For QUALITY routes, however, i suggest looking at 3rd party created routes, by developers like JT (JustTrains), TTB (TrainTeamBerlin) and so on. Also, community websites are great for repaints, route enhancements, patches, bug fixes etc etc etc. I recommend rail-sim.de. Its got a wide library of content.

Pros:

Realism: Train Simulator is praised for its attention to detail and realism. The game provides an authentic experience for train enthusiasts, offering realistic train physics, accurate controls, and detailed recreations of real-world routes and trains.

Expansive Content: The game features a vast amount of downloadable content (DLC) that includes various routes, locomotives, and scenarios. This allows players to customize their experience and explore different aspects of train operations.

Graphics: The game has improved its graphics over the years, providing detailed train models, realistic environments, and dynamic weather effects.

Community and Mods: Train Simulator has an active modding community. Players can create and share their own content, including routes and scenarios, enhancing the overall gaming experience.

Cons:

Cost: The base game itself is relatively affordable, but the cost of additional DLC can add up quickly. Some players feel that the pricing structure for additional content is on the higher side.

Learning Curve: The game's realism can be a double-edged sword. New players may find the learning curve steep, and it might take some time to fully grasp the controls and operations, especially for those not familiar with real-world train procedures.

Performance: Depending on your computer's specifications, the game may demand significant resources. Players with lower-end systems might experience performance issues or need to compromise on graphics settings.

User Interface: Some users have criticized the user interface for being somewhat clunky and not as user-friendly as they would prefer.

Conclusion:

Train Simulator is a solid choice for those who have a genuine interest in trains and want a realistic simulation experience. The game's attention to detail and the extensive library of downloadable content contribute to its appeal. However, the learning curve and cost of additional content might be drawbacks for some players.

I would recommend this game if it is on a discount but full price I would give this game a turn, and if you think that Train Sim World is better then turn away from that too, they release a new game every 5 minutes and its always the same game (with the exception of about 1 or 2 new feature(s).) Train Sim World 3 is the best option other from this game, and don't go with any other Train Sim World games yet as TSW 4 is a likely a buggy mess at this point (I don't know exactly as I declined buying TSW 4.) and other older Train Sim World games don't have mostly up-to-date DLC.

If you are not into trains, this game will put you to sleep because they don't condense anything. Every route is recreated 1:1. Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner takes 3 hours to go from LA to San Diego, and it will take 3 hours in this game.

Most of the gameplay will be you trying to balance the Throttle and the Brakes to achieve that perfect speed. This game has a reputation of having the most expensive DLC on Steam and while that is true that there is a lot for a lot, you don't have to buy every single thing.

Some things I would like to see added to this game are; 
1. The Coast Starlight, because I used to take that train when I was a kid.
2. The Class J 611 Locomotive. One of the most iconic Steam Engines ever made. It's a crime that it's not on here.
3.An occasional car stuck on a track would be interesting.

The driving is easy sometimes now and then you hit the emergency brakes and the train doesn't want to move again. The building part of the game is still annoying with the constant fiddling around and wondering why the tracks won't connect or why the platforms don't have a ramp at each end. Signalling can also be a problem you give a train a timetable and it might use one point to crash itself into another train by driving on the wrong side of the track. The game itself the graphics don't look nice Some trains look like plastic and the lighting is at most OK there is also not a lot of field of view while driving so you can't see all the buttons in front of you. The most annoying thing I have found about this game is how you can't change any of the controls I hope this has helped some people out about this game.

The great thing is it has a massive community who provide both freeware and payware, with a fair amount that exceed even DTGs standards, including AP, Just-Trains, ATS and more. I personally only really drive UK stock so I cannot speak on behalf of other regions, however I see that Europe and USA get a lot of love, and there are a good amount of Asian routes to play around with. The game itself has a very simple premise, which is to drive trains. DTG seem to reuse a lot of stock, which does make sense as why do you need to recreate a train that exists? However there are some older stock from the Kuju days that really need to be brought up to date, such as the HST and Class 165/166.

I personally really enjoy making my own routes for my enjoyment as opposed to driving all the time, and that's what I love about TSC. It gives you the creative freedom to do whatever you want. You can make good scenarios for routes you play, and base them off real or fictional timetables. You can also create real or fictional routes. If you want to  you can even make your own train and assets, however I cant do that, it's too complex for me lol.

There are quite a few things which are made to a questionable standard, such as the 700 which was released not too long ago, but payware developers like Armstrong Powerhouse provide good EPs, which not only greatly improve the sounds and physics, but can also improve the visual appearance by improving textures. If you aren't happy with APs 700, Semaphore Sims have provided a freeware pack to further enhance the trains.

I highly recommend it to every railway enthusiast on the planet.
There is a myriad of routes and trains from all over the world available for it on steam, at third party developers' shops and also to some extent freeware portals.

[u]Now a little foreword before I continue:[/u]
I've been a tremendous fan of Microsoft Train Simulator back in my teenage years and even created a little bit of content fot it; the whole file structure was easy and accessible enough to figure out.
I've also been a big fan of Auran's, now N3V Games', TRAINZ franchise ever since TRS 2004.
I got my first copy of, then branded as Railworks, Train Simulator back in 2009, when my machine couldn't really handle it.
Gave it another go on my next machine a few years ago and it didn't run to my expectations.
Now oddly enough, on my current and actually graphically less powerful laptop (!) it does finally and suprisingly run well and I've been stocking up on all the add-ons I've missed out on in the last decade.

I am satisfied with TS [u]now[/u].

In the past I was a student, so I didn't have much money, barely enough to get by. So add-ons for TS were mostly not affordable and therefore I wasn't really getting my needs satisfied on just a few standard routes I never even knew in real life.

Train Simulator [b]is[/b] a fun pastime [b]if[/b], and that's a [b]big if[/b], you can afford rather pricey payware on a regular basis.
If you're a student, an apprentice, stuck in a low paying job and don't have the knowledge, skill nor the programs to create your own content, you're far better of with TRAINZ.

Contrary to TS, TRAINZ has a built-in download station with over 600,000 assets on it for free (if you don't mind really slow download speed without a pricey subscription) plus a wide array of freeware assets on thrid party community platforms from around the globe. Its filing system is as understandable as the old MSTS one, modding content is easy as fishin' so to speak.

Yet TS provides you, at least if you're looking for german content, the realism of at least 3 different safety features in the cab. Granted, there was a custom TRAINZ version by a german publisher that featured these as well. That was nearly 15 years ago though, there won't be any new content for it by the publisher ever and they stopped producing ten years ago.

When it comes to content creation using the game itself, for routes, consists, scenarios, TRAINZ provides a much more intuitive and fast route building tool in my opinion.

So having played both big franchises for decades now my final recommendation is:

Got cash and in your spare-time want to pretend your second job is train driver:
[h1]Get Train Simulator.[/h1]

Short on cash, don't wanna pretend your second job is train driver and just want to create layouts, see the world, tinker with content or don't have the space and money for a model railway layout:

The trains look plasticky and the environments are bland and lifeless. The game also suffers from poor optimization, and even high-end computers can struggle to run it at a smooth framerate.

The gameplay is also quite shallow. There are a few different scenarios to play through, but they are all very repetitive. You will spend most of your time driving trains from one point to another, and there is very little to do in between.

The biggest problem with with this is the sheer amount of DLC that is required to get the most out of the game. There are hundreds of DLC packs available, and each one costs around $10, you will need to spend a lot of money.

Overall, Train Simulator Classic is a disappointing train simulator game. It is outdated, buggy, and shallow. The only reason to buy this game is if you are a die-hard train fan and you are willing to overlook its many flaws.",1630122651,1690714264,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Game crashes... alot. You just switch the program, it crashes. You press a button in the scenario editor, it crashes it can get very annoying but I don't mind it that much. 

The Add-Ons are expensive. Even to get 1 train it can cost up to 20 dollars where as 1 route can cost from 20 to 40 dollars which is quite expensive, even more than the game itself.

But those are my only gripes with the game, yeah sure I could say ""Ohh it doesnt have this or that train and makes me feel sad"" but that isnt really an issue for me. Yeah sure there are trains that I wish were in the game but aren't (yet) but that doesn't ruin it for me.

Would I recommend the game? Well this is a hard one for me because I love trains but for a beginner i'm not sure. It is quite expensive to get new Add-Ons and since I don't have any other train games (besides TSW 2 that I got for free on Epic Games) I don't have a comparison.

The only way you can find some sense of enjoyment out of this game is emptying your bank account and buying the $8.5k in DLC.
The last time i've seen a price for a game like that was the Nintendo world championships 1990 cart.

And dont even get me started on the fucking graphics. If I wanted to play a game with graphics this bad, i'd pull out my damn atari 2600. And even that thing runs better than this god forsaken game.

While yes, this game is for the simulator fanatics out there, I found this game to just be a quick cashgrab in an overpriced shell.

In conclusion, this game is nothing but a crappy shell of a game with with EA levels of DLC ontop of it.

Edit: I just wanted to add a bit more context. A lot of the trains purchasable through DLC have buttons that are just for show but serve a purpose in the actual train. This is just lazy. I've played sim games such as Assetto corsa where modders charge $3 for an F1 car with absolutely incredible amounts of detail and physics. This game's DLC on the other hand charges almost triple for sub par quality.",1547344900,1688441770,False,4,1,0.506242573261260986,0,True,False,False

The first and most obvious issue with Train Simulator is its outdated graphics. While the game does offer a wide range of routes and trains to choose from, the visuals are often muddy and unattractive. The textures are low-resolution, the lighting is dull, and the environment lacks any real sense of life or vitality. This makes it difficult to fully immerse yourself in the game and detracts from the overall experience. Another issue with Train Simulator is its lack of gameplay variety. While the game does offer a large number of routes and trains to choose from, the actual gameplay itself can be quite repetitive. Essentially, you're just driving a train from one station to another, with little in the way of obstacles or challenges to overcome. This can make the game feel quite dull and uninspired, especially after extended play sessions.

One of the biggest problems with Train Simulator, however, is its pricing model. The game itself is relatively cheap, but in order to fully experience everything it has to offer, you'll need to invest in a large number of pricey DLC packs. This can quickly add up to a substantial amount of money, and it feels like a blatant cash grab on the part of the developers.

In addition to these issues, the game is also prone to bugs and glitches, and the AI can be quite frustrating to deal with at times. Overall, while Train Simulator may have some appeal for fans of the genre, it's difficult to recommend due to its outdated graphics, lack of gameplay variety, and aggressive DLC pricing model. There are certainly better options available for those looking for a train simulation experience.",1633870481,1684245812,False,154,43,0.855874717235565186,0,True,False,False

I am writing today to complain about the current update. 
Dovetail Games, has just broken the game with this update. They have broken the game for people such as myself who purchase 3rd party content from this very site. Dovetail games has not given any verbal communication as to when or even if this 3rd party content, that they sell as DLC will even be up and running again.

STEAM, in my opinion should immediately suspend the Dovetail Games store site on their platform, until these issues are resolved.

IMHO, with more than 3000 hours on record, I would not pay for this game in its current state, and I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT PURCHASE ANY DLC until Dovetail games (or their new owners) fix the issues with DLC.

Again, I ask STEAM to suspend this store page until they fix the issues involving 3rd party DLC, which they continue to sell, knowing full well that there is unresolved, game breaking issues with the update and the DLC.

[ EDIT 1 ]

Still selling DLC with FULL KNOWLEDGE THAT IT DOESN'T WORK... 

STEAM...For the love of all gamers and simmers out there....HALT ALL SALES FROM THIS STORE UNTIL THEY FIX THEIR STUFF

As a trainspotter and train hobbyist myself, I can confidently say that this game is one of the most realistic and immersive train simulators available today.

The attention to detail in Train Simulator is truly impressive. From the authentic sound effects to the meticulously rendered locomotives and routes, the game is a true homage to the world of trains. As someone who has spent countless hours observing and studying trains, I can say that the level of accuracy in Train Simulator is unmatched.

The game features a wide variety of locomotives, from historic steam engines to modern high-speed trains. Each one is faithfully recreated and offers a unique driving experience. The controls are intuitive and responsive, allowing you to truly feel like you're in the driver's seat.

But what really sets Train Simulator apart is the routes. From the bustling streets of London to the scenic countryside of Germany, the game features a diverse selection of routes to explore. Each one is rich in detail and offers a unique perspective on the world of trains. As someone who loves to travel by train, I appreciate the attention to detail that has gone into creating these routes.

But Train Simulator isn't just about driving trains. The game also offers a range of scenarios and challenges that will test your skills as a train driver. From navigating through tricky terrain to dealing with unexpected obstacles, each scenario offers a new and exciting challenge to overcome.

And let's not forget about the community. Train Simulator has a dedicated following of players who are passionate about trains and train simulation. The game's modding community is also incredibly active, with new mods and add-ons being created all the time. This community adds a new level of depth and immersion to the game, allowing players to customize their experience to their liking.

In conclusion, Train Simulator is a game that is sure to delight any train enthusiast or hobbyist. Its attention to detail, diverse selection of locomotives and routes, and challenging scenarios make it a truly immersive experience. As someone who loves trains and train simulation, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who shares my passion.",1682728161,1682728161,True,5,0,0.562874555587768555,0,True,False,False

Seriously, TSW 2 and 3 are good, but have issues with new DLCs until patched., I do like 3, I don't play 2 anymore because 3 is better. As for classic, it is the length, challenge, and depth to the routes, and scenarios means I like spending more time in classic now.  By the time you grab some of the outstanding community content, RW enhancer pro, TS tools plus a real long visit to Armstrong  powerhouse https://www.armstrongpowerhouse.com/  and Alan Thompson https://alanthomsonsim.com/ , and https://www.trainsimcommunity.com/ plus a huge amount of others, and of course Steam workshop, you'll find an amazing amount of content, stuff that really makes Classic Train sim stand out.  Watch for those sales and grab some interesting routes, TS Classic is like iRacing, you don't need to buy everything- just what you want to play, and over a longer period of time. With this in mind I love that classic has so much content, I just bagged the Japanese routes, fantastic I love them. It will be interesting to see the changes in Train Simulator now that Focus owns Dovetail.  I recommend Train Simulator classic, collect stuff over time, tinker with it to get the best from it, accept that the trade off for so much content, and so much free content, the variety, length and depth of scenarios, will be a few bugs, a few crashes, ( I use large address aware and 4gb patch for ALL older games so its much better.) chill out with a beer after work and have some fun.

On the downside, some players have noted that the game engine is outdated, as the game was originally released in 2009. This can make the game look and feel like an older title, which may not be to everyone's liking. Additionally, the basic version of the game only offers three routes, which some may find disappointing. And for those who purchased the LIRR trains add-on, they may feel disappointed to find that there are no corresponding LIRR routes to use them on.

However, on the positive side, Train Simulator is a great game for train enthusiasts. It offers a vast array of trains, routes, and scenarios to explore, and players can easily spend hundreds of hours enjoying the game. Some players have reported spending over 250 hours on the game and loving every moment of it. Others have found themselves unexpectedly addicted to the game after trying it on a whim.

Moreover, while Train Simulator may not be as realistic as other train sims like TSW, it still offers an entertaining and enjoyable simulation of the real world. Players can customize the controls to their liking, and the game can be played with or without DLC. Additionally, some players have noted that the game provides a safe way to experience the thrill of rail fanning, without the danger of being out on the tracks.

Overall, while Train Simulator may have its shortcomings, it remains a great game for train enthusiasts who are looking for an immersive and enjoyable experience.",1681164365,1681164365,True,9,1,0.59927600622177124,0,True,False,False

I hope better competition will come soon for train simulators because all tho I really enjoy this game it has flaws that dovetails games gets away with because it has a monopoly position on this type of simulation. 
For example, you really need to look at which routes or trains you want to buy some of the routes are badly done or have a lot of issues and don't even get solved same goes with some train models some are incredibly detailed and well done and some don't have the correct sound are have other issues… So really look at the reviews on the products. 

What I also think is a weird choice from dovetail is how the scoring system works in this game. If you drive even 1KM too fast you get points taken off very rapidly and if you choose for simple controls like I did when I first started playing you don't get ANY points or checkmarks that you're done that mission in career mode. Why can't I choose in which mode I want to play this game, why you get only a checkmark and points when you play on expert mode, It's kinda silly to me. 

But besides the negatives the game is excellent for the Train hobbyist it still looks nice in its own way all tho train sim world looks way better, train sim classic has its own charm on it. So buy the routes and trains you like and are a fan of and enjoy what this game has to offer because it's a lot all tho it has problems which mostly comes from rushed projects I think which is still very clear in train sim world also, so I think is a big problem at dovetail Internally. '

EDIT: 

I did leave a positive review here before but the scenarios are gonna make you mentally ill if you do them to much with how they are designed and how the point system works. I took a big break from this game but after a few days of playing again this game is just frustrating instead of it being a fun experience. When the missions fails for bullshit reasons or when you are almost done with the mission and it gives you some red signal shit at the end. Its just insane you do your best to keep on speed hold your points so it feels atleast rewarding what you have done but even the slightest mistake and its gameover. what a terrible fucking design really.",1680342023,1681027304,False,0,0,0.554698765277862549,0,True,False,False

Wonderful driving experience when the locomotive actually performs properly and you can complete the scenario without penalties that are literally out of your control.
If someone told me that quality control tests are performed on each scenario, I'd laugh in their face until they broke down crying, and superglue their eyelids wide open while showing them a UP Big Boy that can apparently propel itself like a jet with brakes still applied and throttle at 0%, a BNSF train with brakes that either fade away instead of maintaining pressure or just lock up and cause horrible drive quality, a Norfolk Southern train that doesn't brake at all, and as a bonus how about a UP FEF that just loses steam before even getting out of the yard.
Why did I buy this again? Why did I buy so much DLC for this? Why did I bother trying this instead of staying loyal to Trainz? These are questions I'm not even sure I WANT the answer to, because I'm only going to get even more infuriated and embarrassed.

Positives:

1) Base simulation engine is solid and smooth under most conditions.
2) Allows great scope for varied scenarios.
3) Some excellent DLC.

Negatives:

1) Scenario editor returns nonsense errors (e.g.: Line blocked by train which has been deleted; ""Unknown error"").
2) Unclear or absent instructions.
3) Defective pathfinding AI.
4) Defective dispatching AI.
5) Defective base physics modelling for wheelslip, steam production/consumption rates, injector operation.
6) Low-detail graphics for background features.
7) Frequent signalling bugs (e.g. signals displaying permanent Danger aspect when line ahead clear).
8) Frequent collisions due to defective pathfinding AI.
9) Frequent scenario initialisation errors due to defective dispatching AI.
10) Numerous startup crashes with unusuable .dmp file output (han't found a .dmp reader that actually reads these things so far) (since v59.2a, may be corrected).
11) Accurately-modelled vehicles etc. only available by DLC.
12) Defective modelling of structures (e.g. rain passing through solid roofs).
13) Unindicated pathing restrictions (i.e. unidirectional line not marked as such; passenger/freight-only line not marked as such).

In summary: A basically decent game that has been released in a state best described as half-finished, and which you will have to fight tooth and nail to make work properly. When it does work properly, particularly when using some of the more advanced DLC, it's excellent. Much of the time, however, it's a shoddy, bug-ridden excuse for a game which milks its customers by ensuring the content they actually want is only available via DLC, bugs be damned.

Edit: After yet more play I've decided it's ridiculous not to recommend the game, warts and all. It's a mess, but it's still a basically enjoyable mess, and when it does work, it works well. Just don't go mad on the DLC.",1500850256,1680138302,True,0,0,0.717888295650482178,0,True,False,False

They seem so modern and fast, but do they have the same charm as my good old whistle and smoke? And then there were the routes! Oh my coal car, there were so many routes to choose from, I didn't know where to start. Should I stay in my familiar UK routes or explore the tracks of faraway lands? And what about the different time periods? Should I stick with the present day or take a journey back in time to the golden age of steam? And don't even get me started on the controls! There were so many buttons to press and levers to pull, I felt like I was trying to crack the Enigma code. I just couldn't figure out how to make my train go faster or slower, or even how to stop it properly without crashing into the buffers. I must say, Train Simulator has left me feeling quite bewildered. While I enjoyed the chance to play with trains, I just couldn't wrap my funnel around all the options and controls.

The problem with that is that there are invisible speed limits making you loose points.

The game is just made to make money, there is nothing made for the experience. If you buy the game you get a few scenarios that lasts for a few hours. If you want more content you can kindly give them your hard earned money for badly designed routes and scenarios. I made the mistake of buying additional content.

The redeeming factor is that as it is so old, there are a plethora of different routes (of differing quality), and it feels ironically more immersive to me than TSW3, and the limited routes and rolling stock over there. 
Train simulator sees your RTX3080, 11th gen i7 and 32gb ram, and chuckles. it does not care how good your PC is, it WILL run like trash, and you will like it.

The way I would describe this is like a life size train set, allowing you to assemble your own train and cars and drive around either on set paths (quick drive) or free roam scenarios. The biggest asset this game has if you ask me is the tremendous amount of DLC available, I've only dipped my toes in so far but it gives you so much variety in what to drive and where. 

Full disclosure I'm not a train driver or even a train enthusiast so I have no idea how 'real' the physics actually are, but coming from someone with no prior experience they definitely feel real enough. Trains feel and sound powerful in a very satisfying way, but also have a tremendous amount of inertia as I imagine real trains would. That's the real challenge, managing energy. 

The graphics are of course sub-par for 2023... let's be real they would be sub-par for 2013, but it has a good 'visual' if that makes sense. Also this game has been a bit idiosyncratic at times, but I haven't seen anything majorly broken. I would definitely suggest checking out the community hub, there's a lot of useful guides and help there. 

The game Runs fine on my machine, which is an I5 6600 and GTX 1070. I will point out I have not run into any of the massive stuttering issues I've seen people complain about. The one big technical issue I do have is that I can not alt+tab at all, the game crashes if I try to switch windows. Somewhat major issue but the only major one I've had so far.

In summary, if you're willing to put up with an old looking, slightly clunky experience in exchange for great freedom and a massive collection of add-on content, the game is definitely worth it, even at regular price. I will point out though, as with any Dovetail property, sales are common and generous so you can get an even better deal if you wait and keep an eye on it.",1677042149,1677042149,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I used to play this as a kid back in 2013- 2014, back then with an old pc it ran great. Few years later with a new pc (2023) I tried to run up this game again and I ended up spending 5 hours trying to create my own train but it kept crashing, even with the 64-bit version. 

I think this game has reached its time, it seems like in a few more years it will become darn near impossible to even get the game to load the menu screen. I mean just look at the steam release date; ""2009"".

the base game is barely anything more than a demo, you then need to pay more than twice the amount, to get anything worth playing. the base price of £19.99 does not keep you interested for nearly as long as it should.  less than 23 hours of game play before i exhausted any real new game play, when compared to many games and sims priced in the same bracket that can provide a new and interesting game play aspect many years and hours later, this is not a worthy investment.

Driving the train is fine, but everything else I dislike.
I hate that I have so few choices of what trains to drive or what routes to use without buying a lot of DLC, I hate that I can't get community routes to even show up 90% of the time.

The most important thing: When you put out a fragment of a game, what is essentially a playable demo, and expect your customers to continually pay for DLC in order to get the whole experience then A) I'm not doing that and I'll just uninstall your game, and B) I won't be buying anything else from you either because I just generally don't like how you operate as a business.",1673174048,1673174048,False,183,7,0.87606126070022583,0,True,False,False

One of the things that really annoyed me about Train Simulator is the fact that so much of the content is locked behind paywalls. It's frustrating to see all of these cool trains and scenarios that you can't access without shelling out more money.

The graphics are also a bit underwhelming. While they're not bad, they're not particularly impressive either. It's a bit disappointing given the high-stakes nature of simulation games.

Overall, I can't recommend Train Simulator. The constant need to purchase DLC and the underwhelming graphics make it a sub-par experience. There are probably better simulation games out there.",1672787209,1672787209,False,7,1,0.567348480224609375,0,True,False,False

Just give me a train sim that I can easily run and not have to be a train engineer to even  understand the basic concepts of how to move the blasted train forward and do a manual track switch.

That got me back the consist editor for a short while. But eventually, the game will get to a point where it will fail if you have too much content installed no matter what you do. Not long after losing the consist editor again(crash to desktop, out of memory) and trying to pare back some of the content I had installed to make up for it, the game started crashing as soon as I tried to load anything up. With this game being targeted at enthusiasts the way it is, it disappoints me immensely that people who spend years acquiring content will eventually suffer the fate I have. The issues regarding out-of-memory crashes have been known for a very long time now and DTG has dutifully ignored them, instead pursuing the visually stunning but less interesting Train Sim World. With Train Simulator officially being marked as ""Train Simulator Classic"" they really ought to take the time to iron some of the long standing bugs out of the engine.

Pros: 
It has a wide selection of routes from different countries. 
It has community created routes, locos, rolling stock and scenarios (missions) that are beautiful to look at, listen to and drive. 
There's third party content from people like Victory Works, Digital Traction, Caledonia Works and Smokebox that are brilliant. 

Cons: 
Some of the DLC's are Overpriced, siting at around £11-£24. 
The third party content can be hard to download if you don't what to do. 
Some parts of the game can feel unrealistic a times. 

Final Thoughts:

Basically, it's a DX9 title and as such is designed for hardware of that era, dual and single core CPUs. You could be running a threadripper or Intel 1000th gen and it will still run like crap.

As for the sim itself, you can drive many different trains on many different routes. You can add new trains, new routes, you can even make your own route or scenario, adding in AI trains on schedules.

Also the game looks awful graphically, and runs like sh*t. And it's a train simulator. So you just kinda sit there and do nothing except monitor your speed and occasionally couple two carriages together.

What I like about the game is that it is pretty chilled out and relaxing. You get to actually drive the trains which is awesome and you get to actually use the controls inside the trains which makes operating the train an interactive experience. I also enjoyed doing some of the scenarios where you pick passengers up and take them from A to B and freight cargoes from A to B as well. I also like that you have to keep an eye on the fuel and you get to use fuel stations to replenish the fuel of the locomotive you are driving.

Now for the negatives

I am afraid I have more to say about the negatives than the positives. For a start, you don't get many official scenarios unless you are willing to use mods or buy DLC. In short, you will not get so much when you only buy the base game. You have to pay a lot of money if you want to enjoy this game to the fullest. I understand that the devs need to make money, but they could have added a lot more to the base game instead of having to pay large amounts of money for DLC. It's a disappointment to be honest with you. This ends my complaint about the paywall.

Another issue is the game keeps crashing and saying that I need to lower the graphics settings, and I did so but it still crashes. I also played the 32 bit edition and it still crashes.

On the academy, there are 2 tabs: Academy and Tutorial. While there are missions in the Academy, there is absolutely nothing in the Tutorial. I find this somewhat unhelpful and silly. If the tutorial is in the Academy tab, then get rid of the tutorial tab or add things to it.

While Free drive is nice and relaxing,  you don't achieve anything for them. This is ok if you don't mind that and you just want to enjoy a relaxing drive of your favourite locomotive and you don't have to worry about points and score, but it would be nice to gain something from the experience.",1669242778,1669242778,False,11,0,0.627559840679168701,0,True,False,False

When you do spend half an hour on a train the game won't save it properly
When you finally do get your train working the train creates a routing that routes you into other trains
When you go to fix it, the game crashes, and saves nothing despite you saving multiple times.

Don't waste ANY money on this game. It's on a game engine barely updated since 2009, and the graphics really show that.
The DLC are stupidly expensive for the quality for the most part, there are a few good creators out there, but not enough.
There is basically no support for this game, and crashes are constant, but DTG support always says,""It'S YOuR sYsTEm, Not tHe GaME!""

Pros/Cons:
- Fairly high graphic details of the machines / Not so much of the scenery due to the fact that it is still on an old graphic engine technology
- Large amounts of third party content / But they often require purchase of additional DLCs to use them
- Lots of available DLCs / If money is no factor... I saw somewhere that you can easily spend over $10k if you were to buy them all. Also, you cannot run just any train on any routes, so often enough you will be required to by 2 separate DLCs in order to play the scenarios. One for the scenery and one for the locomotives
- Have decent amounts of controls, buttons and levers to interact with / No support for custom controllers aside X-Box type, meaning if you have ""joystick"" types, none of the control levers can be mapped to axis functions. Also, no key mapping available.
- Decent variety of scenarios (although all very similar in actions) / Lots of mismatch consistencies, especially with the signals and what the scenario expects. Example of that which was the most frustrating to me is when the scenario dictates a certain speed but the track signals tells you something different. Meaning, do not get surprise to be penalized for over speeding due to a reduction of max speed in your current zone, although no signs were telling you this on the track. Or, the track shows an increase to 80, but your scenario keep you stuck at 50.
- The routes (game scenario) are fairly long / The needed interaction is pretty monotonous (accelerate/decelerate, accelerate/decelerate, accelerate/decelerate and maybe a stop or two, and repeat, repeat, repeat).

Was it worth my $34.99 for the USA Delux edition? Yes, but I will not buy any more of the DLCs due to the Con factors above.

What do I mean for 'Awful-Compatibility' 
You have to buy all of the DLC's, Install all the third parties assets and Install a bucket load of 2012 files just to play one scenario that only last... 4 hours which is split into 5 different scenario and if you don't have the all of the 'requirements' installed. The gameplay will give you a box saying 'What's missing' and gives you a 'clear indication' on what you need. 

I say I would rather jump off a building then sitting down to at least spend more than 2 seconds on this game. However if you are sad, lonely and obsessed with trains. Good news, this is your game that ticks every box on your whatever board or list. To the other people, Please do not buy this and kindly look for something else that is more appealing towards your eyes. Trust me, You will fall down onto your keyboard after 20 mins of gameplay as that's how boring it is. Train Sim World series is nothing but the literal copy and paste from each version. I recommend you of buying Euro Truck Simulator or at least have the sensations of the beautiful fresh air outside.

old review below.
I just can't reccomend this simulator. it is so overly buggy that it will crash at the slightest hiccup, even on machines well within minimum specs. the DLC is overpriced, and also extremly buggy. Scenarios that regularly have you sitting at a red light for half an hour, to realise it is a bug that you just cant get around.
I have sunk a lot of hours into this, its one of my most played steam games. but I do not recommend anyone purchase this simulator, as it is far too crash-happy to accurately simulate anything other than a nerd at his computer wondering what to do!",1503253324,1667255884,False,0,0,0.523473620414733887,3,True,False,False

I bought Train Simulator Classic after using Train Sim World 2 for 1.5 years and I somewhat like it. The Interface is ancient but surprisingly easy to use. The maps are bigger than what you get in TSW looking better detailed and busy with working excavators etc. and if it is a parking lot it has a hundred of cars, no less. The graphics wasn't too advanced even in 2010 when the first TS was released but detail level is actually very good as the game uses basically the same models as TSW (at later routes at least) with only difference being the renderer itself. Of course it is prehistoric and struggles to keep FPS over 30 due to its one-threaded nature and legendary lack of optimisation but somehow delivers quite a nice picture (you just have to increase contrast, sun light and add a bit of ambient occlusion - they put all the necessary options in this final version). The good consequence is TSC's so light on your system you can basically keep it as a background process, such a contrast with resource-hungry TSW. 

Of course there are bugs (12 year old ones) but not much as most of major ones were corrected. Of course it's the same old cash grab but you don't have to buy all the DLCs, get a few ones on sale or get a bundle (UK or Germany are good).

The only real drawback of all the TS series is there's no playable timetable services and there're no passenger rides. More missions can be downloaded from the workshop just within the game but free roam isn't available at all, sorry.

So what's the verdict? If you are bored with all this modern power-hungry 3D technology then try the good old 'Classic', you may like it. Among the latest games promoting bright, high contrast agressive picture it looks way more natural and offers a variety of vast routes, a lot of different trains and scenarios for any taste from 15 minutes to several hours long.

P.S. Steam installs 32-bit version by default but I recommend you to launch 64-bit from the game folder. it is somewhat quicker probably because it can use more memory (and can handle more AI trains for the same reason). And add -FPSLimit=61 -fastload as launch parameters.",1661145385,1666505873,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Updating my review on October 5th, 2019. Nothing significant has changed, especially the technical problems and game crashes. The game has frequent crashes, and eventually stops opening altogether with the message ""out of memory"". This crash has existed nearly since the game was released. This crash, and several others like it, have continually plagued this game. When it works, it can be a lot of fun, but unfortunately Dovetail Games doesn't seem to have been able to keep this game stable and/or functional.

[h1]PROS:[/h1]

- Convincing simulation: In cab controls (lots of dials/switches/buttons), conducting each train feels different and unique enough to be a new experience
- Built-in scenario/map creator
- Difficulty scalable from practical free roam to very strict failure
- Trains are modeled nicely, pretty to look at
- Variety of camera controls
- Tutorials (can even learn a lot about how trains function IRL)
- Tons of DLC to add variety (this is a PRO assuming that money is not an obstacle)

[h1]CONS:[/h1]

- Base game feels bare and stripped of content, DLC almost required to keep interest
- Sound is unpolished/unfinished: trains virtually silent, very little ambient/cabin sound (no immersion via audio at all)
- Graphics specifically pertaining to scenery are awful (trains look great, but you're going to spend hours staring at fugly low quality scenery)
- Performance: even on a high end machine, you can count on regular FPS drops and chattering of all sorts
- Game play (almost by nature) is very repetitive, with long periods of do-nothing.  After ~20 hours, I'm done with it.
- Technical difficulty galore... occasionally patches will break the game and leave it unplayable for months on end.
- Very little to no developer/community relationship and communication

[h1]GOOD BUY?[/h1]

I regret buying this game even at the sale price at the time.  If you absolutely love trains, I would still wait for a deep deep sale.

[h1]RECOMMENDATION SUMMARY[/h1]

I can't recommend because the cons outweigh the pros by a fairly large margin.  The core of the game is great fun, but where the idea is nice, the execution and details completely fall through.  Adding salt to the wound:  terrible community relations, technical support (most of my emails/tweets/communication went completely unanswered - still have pending support request unresolved from a half year ago).  Even though the game has its fun moments, it's fraught with holes, and is not good value.",1387597671,1663449454,False,13,0,0,0,True,False,False

However -- Overall I wouldn't purchase this game anymore. The graphics aren't great and the variety is somewhat too broad if you understand my reasoning. Definitely wouldn't by anything from the store anymore as I've already spent hundreds of pounds on this game, and the developers have already came together and made two extremely greater game than this.

The game is still wonderful don't get me wrong, but I think people have missed the optimum time of purchasing this game.

The Pros: 
- Steam train controls are as comprehensive as they can get, from the simple reverser, combination brake and regulator to the  injector valves, vacuum ejectors to the damn cutoff levers for boiler water level.
- The train physics are quite realistic from what I can comprehend.
- The maps are quite large and open so you can just hop into a Black 5 and drive around the Riveria line in a Freeroam session.
- This game despite being 8 years old still has an open modding community that specialises in making models for trains and scenarios of which are to very high detail (hell you can even get the Billinton E2s somehow).
Unfortunately, thats where all the positives end. The negatives are:
- Money hungry developers. They have essentially thrown this game under the bus and buying every DLC for this game is enough money to afford a 2012 Toyota Kluger. To include as well, they recently released a Train Sim World 3, when the 2nd game was remotely even complete. Kinda sets the tone of these devs.
- Very very very very very poor optimisation. The game just does not like high frame rates and that is somewhat of a big deal breaker for me. Enough to play the 2nd game even if it only has 2 steam locos available for driving.
- A lack of detail and inconsistency. This game has gems of locomotives, such as the GWR 57XX Panniers or the LMS Black 5s but some locomotives just don't give as much control as you would like. Some trains lack realistic water feeding into the boiler as you literally just click a button and water is just fed with minimal consequences. In something like an LMS Black 5, you have to prepare the train for water feeding by adjusting the injector and tender feeding valves inorder to get an efficient flow of water into the boiler. Whilst doing that, boiler pressure goes down so planning beforehand is essential. This makes the game challenging but without it, it just becomes boring (like diesel and electric locomotives). This problem persists as DoveTail games contract or outright buy DLCs from other developers which leads to this inconsistency in detail. Another fact is the maps. I wish they looked better and I wish they got a refresh but apparently they won't. Old textures, very weird looking water, etc.
Honestly, the only reason I will recommend this is because it has detail in the real gems of steam locomotion and one of the only decent interpretation of that fact into a playable and fun game. If you do not want to spend that much money for some DLCs, look else where because you may be disappointed.",1662591656,1662591656,True,15,0,0.652686655521392822,2,True,False,False

Overall, as a railway enthusiast, the game is very good. There's a wide variety of available routes and stock from several countries for players to enjoy, with a range of focus points - Shunting, commuter, high speed and freight - there is something for everyone. I racked up over 1000 hours playtime just playing on a really poor laptop with absolute minimum graphics and framerates no higher than 15 - I now have a decent PC, managing high graphics settings and averaging between 30-60fps. It is much more enjoyable.

What are the negatives? 

Firstly, the game can crash quite often, which is frustrating - however I haven't experienced this for quite a while, but it is still a possibility.

Secondly, the price of the DLC compared to the quality of the product. Quite often products are not consistent - Some older add-ons include features which perhaps some newer add-ons don't include. Enhancement packs are available from third party developers for purchase which enhance the simulation and user experience - this further adds to the cost for content as some add-ons are simply of such poor quality that for some are considered unplayable without the enhancements.

That being said, all in all, it is a good simulator - having played since 2012 and watching how far things have moved onwards since then. 

Definitely recommend to any other railway enthusiasts, transport enthusiasts and simulation gamers.",1434724707,1662068496,True,5,0,0.521675169467926025,0,True,False,False

Pros:
Free Version Update in September/October
Good Chunk of Content is in Steam Sales
Mod Friendly
Good Marketplace/Workshop Content
Good time Killer(for me)
Low amounts of storage
Cloud Backups of Game Progress
Somewhat Laggy but Ok 

Cons:
Visually Unappealing outside of the Tracks
DLC is expensive
Horn blast length on some engines (The AEM-7) are Not Controllable
Very Sensitive Alarms/ATC on Locomotives
Non-Accurate Horns(Example: The Metro North Shoreliners have what sounds like a Nathan K5LA Instead of a Leslie RS2M)
No Free Roam Sessions(where you can pick from a selection of trains on a route)
Difficult Route Creation Tools
Some Engines were Confusing/Difficult to learn the Operation of the Cab(The M2/M4 Was one of the hard ones to Learn. Even while reading the Manual).
Certain Lines are not Accurately Represented/Missing Elements
Routes are Glitched(for me at least)
Not fully Controller Friendly
Low Levels of Detail
Some engines are Missing/Take nearly 5-8 years to be made for a route
Slow acceleration on some engines

Basic Review/Tl:DR is: Good if you really only care about the trains and running them and not about any of the other details. But if you really want something that fits a little more into these categories, More detailed and has the right effects,Locomotives,content, timely DLC releases and more, the three games i can recommend are Train Sim World 1, Train Sim world 2, and Trainz Railroad Simulator 2019",1635516719,1659975531,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It started off so well with superb graphics and sound effects and slowly got worse with use over time. The first sign, was how it began to slow down the computer, then it took an age to load and now it won`t load properly and freezes itself and the computer when it tries. When this happens, the only way that I can restore use of the computer, is to turn it off and then on again.

Its silly overlaid messages drive me mad as well. I`ll give you an example. In the early days, I was about to leave the platform with a train when the doorbell rang. The visitor stayed for about half an hour and I then returned to the game. There was a message waiting for me saying that the train had left the station without closing the passenger doors. It hadn`t moved an inch in the previous half hour, so this message was ridiculous. There are others that are just as ridiculously false.

First of all the variety is limited when buying the base game making the price a bit expensive. If you want to enjoy variety and realism you'll have to pay a lot more. I have spent a lot of money enhancing my game in many ways and at the end of the day it is defiantly worth it but requires a lot of commitment. As TS has been on steam for many years don't expect the graphics to be amazing. This depends on the route as newer DLC have slightly better graphics as stuff like newer textures have been used . If you are buying DLC that includes the trains i'm afraid to say this is where Dovetail games really lack. Dovetail games have been known for the poor sound quality when making stock. There are costly alternatives to this such as Armstrong Powerhouse who make high quality products. I also recommend RW Enhancer which is a software that enhances the sounds and visuals for TS. I best recommend this game during a sale as there are defiantly some generous deals. 
This game can be a bit buggy as well as FPS drops but overall not a hard game to run. I recommend you have reasonable memory for your pc and you should be fine.

To conclude this i will defiantly say TS is worth it as long as your willing to sacrifice some money if your wanting a better experience. If your just buying the game do not expect a wide variety of routes and trains.",1657397646,1657397707,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,2,True,False,False

It's a game I've played for many years ever since I owned the original Rail Simulator on disc. As far as train sim games go, it's the best, no other series/games have really come close in matching the appearance, feel, and features of this game. But I still don't recommend for a few reasons, which are almost all the fault of Dovetail Games.

[list]
[*] The amount of DLC for this game is obscene, as is how much you'd have to spend to get it all (I believe it's somewhere in the thousands of £'s). When you consider that the stock game is fairly barebones, you're gonna want DLC to pad it out, and it can cost a shed-load. If you're strapped for cash, it just isn't worth getting it.
[*] DTG's inconsistency is ridiculous. Sometimes, a new route will be well-made, with great liveries, no bugs, and a wealth of scenarios. And then, the next one will be missing assets, buggy as hell, and with nothing to do. You can never guarantee that a new route will be any good, which is especially frustrating as there are some routes/locos I desperately want, but which I refuse to buy since numerous users have complained of game-breaking bugs and issues related to them.
[*] As mentioned before, a lot of trains and routes are just broken. Trains don't work, scenarios don't work, it's immensely frustrating. There is a loco you get in the vanilla game which is missing its AWS alert system, which means it'll simply jam on the emergency brakes randomly without warning, which makes it pretty much unplayable. It's ridiculous that stuff like this is still an issue and hasn't been fixed, with DTG instead just churning out more and more add-ons which get released in a buggy state and never get patched, because patching them doesn't make more money.

Before the game can be somewhat playable, not gonna lie, money will need to spent on DLC. There are a few freeware routes out there but many use payware DLC. If there are 1 or 2 routes you would like, begin to build your route and loco collection. There were even a couple of humble bundles that included a tonne of DLC so keep your eyes out for deals on DTG website and steam also. Could save hundreds if you are patient and look around.

On the whole have had hours of fun on this, a few hours of not so fun, when things go wrong, but that isn't often. It ""can"" look incredible, with the right mods and routes and does what it says on the tin. Scenarios can add unlimited hours of challenge or just freeride around, choice is yours. If trains are your thing, invest in some DLC and off you go. If not, avoid.

I prefer this over TSW2, despite its age, it gives you more freedom and fairly easy to mod. TSW looks great but its quite linear, cant use all trains on all tracks, amongst other annoyances. It's very geared to the console player with its achievements and gameplay. Get TS classic if you like simulation and variety.",1656679794,1656680273,True,6,0,0.601187288761138916,0,True,False,False

The railroad crossings. 
They're great, they function properly, but in the middle of a train going through, the gates go up. I feel like there should also be a variety of crossing sounds. All we have is the basic mechanical bell, and I think it would be amazing if they added a variety of mechanical and GS e-bells.

I have already spent quite a few hours on this sim, because i like it.
From the days of MS train sim i loved this kind of niche market.
Too bad that the Marias pass DLC was not available for the Netherlands, otherwise i would've bought this game a long time ago.

The immersion is quite good, i love the US tracks/trains. I also like the european variants, but not as much.
I have not tried everything in this game yet, i loved the audio and graphics so far.

I think it is absolutely nice (and educational) to have the possibility to see working signals and such. Having some ""live"" traffic from other trains make this much more realistic.

The menu feels a lot like MS train sim, so i felt at home quite quickly.

Few downsides:
I have not found a way to save multiple games.
The transfer from dark to daylight is not realistic, it's like someone flicks a switch every ten minutes or so.
Maybe there is an option to change this? 

Another thing, when i select a german diesel loc and US wagons, there is a button that can fix the coupling issues. (it says that)
But this button does not do anything, it cannot even be pressed.

Not many options in weather. When selecting rain, it is rain and it is quite heavy. There did not seem to be any changes either, it stays the same.

It does not like alt-tab. 95% chance the game will crash on my pc.

The game often ends up as monotonous and boring after the initial ""new factor"" of getting DLC as most of the routes are so linear.

The game has a downright AWFUL model for DLC. No, seriously, it's one of the worst. The company shoves out DLC on a very frequent basis and the trains most of the time have unrealistic physics, sounds, consist formations and a lack of features. Routes are usually short, linear and offer the player to drive on...about 1 or 2 full services. This turns out to have very little play time on the DLC. Very disappointing for how much you have to spend.

Most of the features, such as Career Mode, serve no purpose. It is very punishing for no reason and many scenarios can be Career only. The XP points you receive do the nothing at the end of the day.

The game takes long to load. Like very long. I can boil the kettle and make a cuppa by the time it's finished to load. Sometimes the AI just randomly decides to have crashes and give you a game over screen if you don't test scenarios for hours and the points just decide to derail you when you go over if you SPAD. 

If you go on them in real life, the trains and sometimes routes are quite unbearable because of incorrect details, bad sounds and physics. Unfortunately, you have to spend even more money to make the sounds and physics good by buying Armstrong Powerhouse 3rd party DLC. They are damn expensive for what they are, but they sound quite nice.

It was fun 10 years ago, but not now.

I bought the game primarily for the main line between Birmingham and London.

It is not too bad but I cannot seem to be able to have and free roaming access or be able to explore the route... I cannot throw the points or set my own routes.

It seems we are restricted to playing the scenarios given by the game and that is it.

Is there a way to say... for example, drive the class 66 from Euston to Birmingham or vice versa?

(Maybe on the expensive side for just the base game, and then the DLC I'm eyeing seems to be as expensive again or worse than the base game) so, maybe if it goes on sale? My opinion is perfectly balanced, I'm afraid.

-- Using just a mouse, for the most part, you can drive the trains in the scenarios (I haven't yet done free play or quick drive yet.) However, just using the train, while I like it (and am tempted to see how this would handle in VR) there are several buttons that don't function (and are otherwise required to use via the minimal/maximum UI or keybinds that you have to learn) or are posted in the train's cab but do not operate at all. (The very second scenario driving the DB BRR442 Talent 2 or something has 3 icons that look like they operate the door controls on the train when you're at a station, but they don't do anything and thus I must rely on the T hotkey or click on a platform.)

--The game sometimes has a memory leak, this tends to be when I'm running it in 32 bit, so I have to run this through Steam's library (not the bottom right short cut) and change it to 64 bit or otherwise use another shortcut to specifically enter 64 bit, otherwise Steam automatically assumes 32-bit is the best. (Thanks, #Steam...) This, I don't blame on TS, but along the similar line, there [i]are[/i] many typos and mistaken instances, etc. in just the ""train driver academy"" that I feel like the game could have handled better. However, the most annoying I've encountered just now is that I recently finished a scenario and the game fails to recognise that I even completed the scenario at all. (And last I've [i]seen[/i] is that the game's dev team has last bothered any sort of patch since mid-summer 2020. Two-years later, these issues are still present? I doubt it'll ever be fixed.)

That being said, it comes down to weighing the pros/cons of this game. (Or I understand the team is working on a TS2? So [i]maybe[/i] go check that out instead.) However, the game is playable and I'm content, but I [i]REALLY[/i] wish the price was overall cheaper all around.

only problem is, the game has an annoying constant frame drop. if you mess with the settings, or, you are used to low fps, it should be fine

The cons I have with Train Simulator Classic is when I'm playing in certain routes, I've noticed many errors with some of the backgrounds, such as missing buildings and structures, certain objects not moving, such as people in certain stations, and a few missing textures on certain points on the train that I am currently driving (For the locomotives and rolling stock). But a severe con I have is trying to make my quick drive scenarios as realistic as possible, but the programming on service trains just sucks from time to time. Almost every time I try to set up and program a service train, or AI train, to run alongside my player train at different departure times, it keeps telling me that my player train can't go anywhere I want it to go.

I did give it a 7.8/10 back in late 2016... I can't even give it that anymore. In fact, I can barely give it over a 4. 

The game is a timesink, that's the good part. The problem is, it's also a moneypit. So much DLC and more coming out monthly of varying quality (with the 700 being one of the single worst DLCs of all time, but that's another review for another time).

The game looks incredibly dated now. The Railworks 3 graphics just do not hold up nowadays and it's really noticeable now. Not to mention there's so many bugs that just don't get sorted, and the fact that even with 64-bit so much just doesn't work. 

At least they're not going to update in yearly with a number number (I hope), but man, I've owned this game for over 7 years now and it's actually quite embarrassing how little has actually changed. 

Dovetail need to do a lot of work on this game. Resting on your laurels isn't acceptable anymore, and I've watched it get worse for half a decade now.

As I had previously purchased this particular route and found it disappointing I was interested to see if promised improvements and updates had been made. Well the answer is sort of. Scenery looks to have a bit more detail and the brakes are working better on the locos. My biggest disappointment with the original version was that the signals did not work correctly and this was supposed to be one of the things fixed. Well again sort of. Signal masts with only one head now appear to show all indications. Unfortunately any mast with more than one head is another matter. The best indication you can expect is a yellow, never a green, even if the track is clear for blocks ahead. Red does show when you pass.

The other problem is the locomotive headlights. They do turn on but when viewed from lineside they only show light when viewed from a distance. As the train gets close they appear to turn off. Whats with that. I guess this is just another route rushed out the door from developers who may know computers but their knowledge of trains appears limited and there Quality Control even more.

Train Simulator 2022 is going to look old. It's an ancient graphics engine that dates back to 2009 or some such and it's been updated year after year since then. It looks nothing like it did then, it's far better! But it's still exactly modern. The base game comes with a slew of training scenarios to get you going and several DLC to start with. Here's the thing about TS: The base game is basically a free upgrade every year, but if you buy it, you get a lot of new DLC at a very large discount - sometimes more than 75% depending on the package. 

This version of TS comes with 3 routes that I'll detail briefly here. If you want one of the ""bigger"" versions, check the reviews for those individual route DLC's. 

tl:dr - Two really REALLY nice routes with modern electric locomotives. Both are a pleasure to drive and everything works well. One route that's pretty and well detailed with nice locomotives, but at least one related broken achievement and one scenario that can't be completed with full points. 

Please don't get hung up on the plethora of DLC's. No one expects you to buy all or even most of them. Some are just plain bad, some are great. Check the reviews! The idea behind Train Simulator is to figure out what kind of train and/or routes you enjoy driving. Buy those DLC. If you want more recommendations, feel free to ask in the comments. 

Now the details!

- Frankfurt - Koblenz: This is a really fantastically designed route. It's unusually long and well detailed. The locomotive you get to drive is a modern electric and is relatively easy to drive. There are 7 scenarios that are roughly between 30 and 105 minutes in length. They all work fine. All the related achievements to this route trigger properly. 

- Birmingham Cross City Line: Lichfield – Bromsgrove & Redditch: Another really well designed route. It's a modern electric locomotive also. It's sounds are good and it drives well. There are 6 scenarios ranging from around 30 min to nearly an hour and a half. The timing is quite tight on a couple of the scenarios (If you're late you lose points, but it doesn't stop you from completing it) but they're doable. It just might take more than one try. One of the achievements relating to this route is currently broken. 

- Northeast Corridor: Washington DC - Baltimore: Sadly, this route is kind of a mess. It's recreated nicely with good detail but I feel it was rushed out the door for a couple of reasons. It is advertised as having 5 scenarios. This is less than routes normally come with. A clue is given away in that there are actually six, but the sixth has problems. You can finish it, but not with 1000 points. I expect they meant to remove it. Further, there is an achievement for completing scenario 7 which doesn't exist. Likely another broken one that WAS removed - but they forgot the achievement. Sad but true. The other 5 scenarios do work fine. While the problems with this route seem very sloppy, overall, you will get enjoyment from the 5 scenarios that do work. There are two modern Amtrak electric locomotives that you drive. Both are nice. One has a speed control which makes it more relaxing to drive. You don't have to turn it on however, if you want to be more interactive. 

One real downside is that there's no steam or diesel locomotives included in the base game. Usually every TS release has something of all three major locomotive types. Aside from that, there's not a lot to complain about. I'm usually a fan of diesel locomotives but enjoyed everything in the base game this year.",1417413515,1650435904,True,1,0,0.511163771152496338,4,True,False,False

Though, the routes they give you to start off in this version are well detailed and decent scenery, I want to buy another train and actually use it. Another reason why I don't recommend this game is because this game and the add-ons are too expensive. Just for one train, $19.99, that's insane, after the $29.99 the actual game is.

What really disappoints me is the routes. There are few if any routes that come with the base game and the only way to drive someplace else is through downloadable content. It definitely is not a game built on micro-transactions model. Micro-transactions are a few bucks for content that will help you buy your way to success in a game. Having to shell out $20-40 for EACH new route and having it be no more than 50 miles long (why does the Amtrak Northeast Corridor sell in pieces and not the whole thing?), that is a MACRO-transaction! This is very disappointing. The main reason I chose this over Train Sim World is that there are freeware downloadable routes (if you can find them) that people make using the route editor. Even when I find DLC routes on the Steam store, I can't get any detailed information like a route map.

If they want TS2022 to be a top-notch game, they can start by being a lot more transparent about the routes, and their backgrounds, where they go, how long they are, and stop charging so much for them. There's no reason why someone should have to pay as much as the game itself just to add some 20 mile route and then we don't even know anything about it.

I spent time in training mode patiently trying to learn the controls but when progressing to the main game, the locomotives I learned were not there. So I just pressed buttons on this one train, got a constant annoying warning tone and left it.

You can buy what you like and leave what you don't - just check the reviews first and be sure to treat each product as a basis to potentially customise and make your own. As with the physical world of model railroading, some products you buy in your hobby store are hit and miss, but for all those misses in Train Simulator, there are usually fantastic upgrades made by passionate people such as Armstrong Powerhouse to breathe life into them and make those products more exciting and, above all, more personal to you.

Yes, there are still some issues with UI and a few crashes here and there being a system often struggling to accommodate as much legacy content as possible ([b]turning your wifi off before you start the game will immediately eliminate many of the memory related crashes[/b]), but even with these issues, it's still such a reasonable, wonderful way to thoroughly enjoy the railroading hobby alongside (or instead of) the more physical, space consuming model railroading side of things many of us also enjoy too.

If you love railways, Train Simulator in 2022 is a fantastic way to chill out and enjoy your passion. With such a giant selection of content that can be purchased both on the Steam store and through many excellent third party creators, it can be as personal and as bespoke as you want it to be. And, if like many, you want a break from creating structured scenarios, the free roaming functionality takes your content and turns it into possibly the largest digital model train set you could imagine, allowing you to place any purchased trains out on your desired route and jump between them dynamically providing almost limitless options - it really becomes a completely different game at that point and I encourage everyone to give it a go!

Some bugginess, a hellish menu interface, some hit and miss over whether broken routes will ever be fixed to satisfaction. People with zero interest in playing it complain that there's a lot of content.

Allow me to let you in on a secret - that €10k of content?
You aren't forced to buy it all to have a complete experience.
I think it's physically impossible in one lifetime to fully explore the entire extent of routes and scenarios that have been created for TS.

Here's another secret - there's actually even more content for sale here than what is available on Steam. Completism and trophy hunting have led people to believe they would have to acquire all of this to see the 'full' game, which is just not true.

The way to approach this is to view it as something of a model train set.
You buy the basic foundation and stick what you want on that.
If you're not a hardcore railfan or simmer just want to dip in and out of various routes, you'll be fine with one of the packs that come out each year.
Go back and find an old version on a reseller store if you don't want this year's version.
If you're more interested in train travel and sims, you'll probably already have a specific interest in one area, so you'll concentrate on acquiring routes like that.
US freight, British passenger transport, Austrian mountain routes - there's a rich amount of content in all these areas, and with third party improvements such as those from Armstrong Powerhouse it's quite clear why there's still life in this, 12 years after its first incarnation. So much, in fact, that as I write this simulator is above its supposed successor,
Train Sim World 2, in current players on Steam.

TS is an easy target for cheap jokes, and there is an infuriating habit among the modding community (though many do sterling work for free) of utilizing obscure and useless DLC packs in their mods (hello BR Blue pack, hello long-deleted 101 Pack), but for every official release of a train without working headlights or essential safety systems, there's impressive content made with care and attention. Bossman's Welsh Marches, Dovetail's own Semmeringbahn and GTrax's criminally underrated Suisun Bay route are 3 examples of the best of these, and then there are the devs making incredibly complex simulations that Dovetail would never have the freedom to attempt. That's one reason this game has lasted so long - to their credit Dovetail made modding and route-building accessible, meaning third parties work on everything from fun content like Story of Forest Rail to those full simulations, allowing DTG themselves to concentrate on the big crowd-pleasers.

In short, don't blame Dovetail for simply adding a number each year and rarely significantly improving the product itself. Blame those of us who have looked a bit deeper and found almost everything we could want from a train sim, and despite ancient graphics and out-of-memory errors, are quite happy where we are, thanks. It's a nice community too, one of the more helpful around - you're very welcome. - Kamandur_kAy",1453686227,1642440437,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm going to say that this game is awesome and probably always will be.. While me personally I'm not a fan of TrainSimWorld, Train Simulator is nevertheless fun with what it provides for routes, scenarios, and editor. Though however the editor could definately be improved. I'm very in love with the Google Maps API provided in the editor in this game, but like I said the editor could be improved as I have problems just trying to make a simple route. But other than that, just as you'd see in the thumbnails, you can select a variety of routes of your likings.

If you only starting out as a railroad enthusiast, I'd say go for the Train Simulator 2018 ($39.99) which will give you railway scenarios from different countries with a variety of different trains. If you have been a railfanner for a while in a specific regions, I'd go for the bundle. I selected TS US Classics because I love American trains.

I DO however prefer you wait for a sale to buy a bundle/DLC instead of spending a lot of money as these can get a bit pricey at times.

The game is good for what it is, but it's old and severely out dated - it badly needs a graphical and technical overhaul. It's a buggy mess.

As far as the price of DLC's go, they sell reskins for a premium and they're honestly overpriced, the only reason people in the Simulator Community are ok with it is because they're likely hobbyist who'd end up having to spent thousands on a Model Railroad anyway. 
TS is a cheaper alternative to doing that. TRS isn't much better in this regard.

As far as Trainz vs TS, it's very much a pick your poison, Trainz will offer you alot of variety, but suffers from similar problems, Trainz isn't exactly Plug and Play, but is incredibly modular with a massive community behind it. While TS is more Plug and Play and has a higher visual quality over Trainz, but almost no community additions outside Maps, Scenarios and a few Third-Party tools.

Both TRS and TS have multitudes of DLC, but TRS has a very passionate community - When I buy DLC for TRS Official or Third Party, I know I'm supporting a Community Member, not the Company.

If you're a train enthusiast/hobbyist, I personally would recommend N3V's TRS over DTG's TS, but, I don't see a real reason not to get TS on Sale, other than the questionable business practices from DTG, it's a solid game for what it is, but, it's not good either, honestly, this is a better ""Simulator"" than TRS, while TRS is a virtual Model Railroad with a simulator element.

I recommend this over Trainz for its simplicity and general quality over Trainz, but I certainly have my issues with it. - TS was outstanding in 2012, now it just feels like a chore just to do anything.

This game is a strong neutral ""meh"" from me, but, I honestly can't give it a positive score, I've recommended it and preferred it for years, but after recently returning to recreate a Scenario for my 10th Anniversary with TS - I've grown to detest this game.

Reading this review, it's made it clear there's nothing good to say about this game other than it has a decent visual and audio quality and even that's subpar at best, the only redeeming quality is the Simulator element but that's it.",1369699827,1641428549,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some bugginess, a hellish menu interface, some hit and miss over whether broken routes will ever be fixed to satisfaction. People with zero interest in playing it complaining that there's a lot of content. Allow me to let you in on a secret - that €10k of content? You aren't forced to buy it all to have a complete experience. In fact, I think it's physically impossible in one lifetime to fully explore the entire extent of routes and scenarios that have been created for TS. Here's another secret - there's actually even more content for sale here than what is available on Steam. Completism and trophy hunting have led people to believe they would have to acquire all of this to see the 'full' game, which is just not true.

The way to approach this is to view it as something of a model trainset. You buy the basic foundation and stick what you want on that. If you're not a hardcore railfan or simmer just want to dip in and out of various routes, you'll be fine with one of the packs that come out each year. Go back and find an old version on a reseller store if you don't want this year's version. If you're more interested in train travel and sims, you'll probably already have a specific interest in one area, so you'll concentrate on acquiring routes like that. US freight, British passenger transport, Austrian mountain routes - there's a rich amount of content in all these areas, and with third party improvements such as those from Armstrong Powerhouse it's quite clear why there's still life in this, 12 years after its first incarnation. So much, in fact, that as I write this simulator is above its supposed successor, Train Sim World 2, in current players on Steam. 

TS is an easy target for cheap jokes, and there is an infuriating habit among the modding community (though many do sterling work for free) of utilising obscure and useless DLC packs in their mods (hello BR Blue pack, hello long-deleted 101 Pack), but for every official release of a train without working headlights or essential safety systems, there's impressive content made with care and attention. Bossman's Welsh Marches, Dovetail's own Semmeringbahn and GTrax's criminally underrated Suisun Bay route are 3 examples of the best of these, and then there's the devs making incredibly complex simulations that Dovetail would never have the freedom to attempt. That's one reason this game has lasted so long - to their credit Dovetail made modding and route-building accessible, meaning third parties work on everything from fun content like Story of Forest Rail to those full simulations, allowing DTG themselves to concentrate on the big crowd pleasers. 

In short, don't blame Dovetail for simply adding a number each year and rarely significantly improving the product itself. Blame those of us who have looked a bit deeper and found almost everything we could want from a train sim, and in spite of ancient graphics and out of memory errors, are quite happy where we are, thanks. It's a nice community too, one of the more helpful around - you're very welcome.",1640401098,1640401098,True,81,2,0.750160872936248779,0,True,False,False

Once you have completed these you can add more routes, trains and scenarios to your collection from third party developers and from Dovetail.
Be aware not all DLCs are free many cost money and some free ones require payware content.
This hobby does require some investment of money.
Pros
. 3 routes and 13 trains included in base game
. Varied selection of extra content from steam to electric trains and New Zealand to American routes
. Great community post free content daily on the workshop
Cons
. Graphics are a bit dated (to be expected from a 15 year old game) enhancements available like RW enhancer
. If you want to own every item of content it cost around £10,000 including all third party and Dovetails
. Requires a rather powerful PC to run well

Here are a couple of DLC I would recommend in no order
Routes
.Train Simulator: Midland Line: Aickens - Springfield Route Add-On
.Train Simulator: Welsh Marches: Newport - Shrewsbury Route Add-On
.Train Simulator: Frankfurt High Speed: Frankfurt – Karlsruhe Route Extension Add-On
.Train Simulator: Battle For Sherman Hill Add-On
Locos

.Train Simulator: New Zealand DJ Loco Pack
.Train Simulator: DB BR 10 Steam Loco Add-On

Pros:
- Reasonably good graphics
- Options to play quick drive and career mode
- Can create your own scenarios in build mode
- Sounds are ok

Cons:
- Requires DLCs if you want additional locomotives/routes (can be expensive)
- Can be laggy depending on your system specs
- Some of the AI passengers walk through the train/across the tracks
- There's only tutorials for a few trains

it runs (somewhat) well on older machines.

The price of all the addons is quite outrageous.
the community can be quite toxic

2019 UPDATE:

Pretty much nothing has changed. Routes are short, equipment selection is limited, and god forbid you drop more money on better routes because they offer some of the most appalling value propositions I've ever seen. 7 scenarios for a $15 route, with ""many more hours of exciting gameplay on the Workshop"" which is disingenuous at best and a more accurately a big fat lie.

Why? Because just about every single ""free"" scenario out there calls for a laundry list of additional DLC worth at least $50, including $10 for a bloody hopper car whose job is to just sit on a siding while you whizz past at 50mph.

My original criticism and recommendation against buying into this kind of business model still stands. Support another company like N3V Games or SCS Software.


2021 update:

While there have been several QOL updates since, it is still the usual circus show since the early days when DTG was still called RSC. Add a couple of new routes, slap new fancy cover art on it and sell it as a new version. Most other DLC (oh look it's this again) released even today are wanting in either detail, performance, realism, quality control or some combination of all. I looked at reviews for over a dozen routes that piqued my interest in the latest Autumn Sale, and nearly all of them have negative reviews going back *years* about trackwork problems, session bugs and other gamebreaking issues with little indication that DTG of the developers in their ecosystem have any interest in rectifying.

Thus, the Dovetail ecosystem is still as slimy as ever:
1. Develop cheap and rushed DLC full of bugs and errors. Package it with ancient content.
2. Release said DLC for an unreasonably high price.
3. Wait for suckers to buy it at full price, and non-suckers to buy it on sale.
4. Ignore bug reports and feedback.
5. ...?
6. Profit. Rinse and repeat.

Absolute scum of a developer. The only money I can conscionably recommend spending on this trash heap of an ecosystem are the rare, legacy routes with good reviews and an established set of free content developed for it (such as the Alan Thompson or DPsimulation mega route merges) and even so, you're still likely to run into the age-old ""freeware needs more payware to function"" issue.

2/10 would recommend Trainz 2022 instead.


In response to Jay:

I wouldn't think twice when buying DLC from an honest developer who has a track record of quality, bug-free work that takes user feedback and ideas into account, and general behavior that accommodates or even cater to the third party modding community. Even when there are bugs, they are fixed quickly and properly. For these devs, I insist on nothing but buying their DLC at launch, at full price, sometimes even if I don't have time to play them right away.

Dovetail's DLCs are expensive, low quality, lack support, lack aftermarket content, lack replayability, and are generally one of the worst ways I can think of to spend money on the train sim genre. It doesn't matter how large of a catalog you have if all of them offer the same disgusting value proposition which is close to nil. You might argue: DTG doesn't create most of these. To which the response is: sure, but you're also taking a cut of their sales and hence have zero incentive to encourage anything other than gross dev practices that simply prioritize quantity over quality and just churning out more garbage DLCs.",1518488926,1638371184,False,2,2,0.486944377422332764,1,True,False,False

It is graphically impressive. I've often been late completing tasks in the scenarios because I am taking screenshots on the rain reflecting off the boiler of the steam locomotive I am driving. 

It has a huge fan base. Even if you complete every scenario you own, there is plenty of content to keep you going in the Steam Workshop and through third parties making content for Train Simulator. 

Don't be discouraged by the negative comments referring to this game as a ""DLC Simulator"".

Is there an abundance of DLC? 

Yes. That isn't negative though. It allows you to build your Train Simulator game the way you want it.

You can't expect to be given the whole Steam Store's worth of DLC for 30 dollars. 

Instead, you get a few routes, scenarios, and locomotives to start you off. If you like what you see you then have the option of buying DLC based on you interests.

There are things you need to know about this game. Bad things. Basically: it's old. Every year there is some small update to the core game (which is, by the way, free for all owners), a package of new routes (which you may choose to purchase or not), but this won't change the fundamental fact that the engine is more than ten years old and it is already pushed beyond its limits. It's not pretty. If you look for pretty, go for the Train Sim World, a newer game of the same developer. It's not well optimised. It does not use the modern hardware efficiently. Contrary to what you might expect, it will not run smoothly even on a state-of-the-art gaming pc in detail-heavy routes. Did I mention it's not pretty? Yes? Then I also need to mention it may crash every now and then. So there it is. Technically speaking this game is TERRIBLY outdated. 

On top of this, it is definitely not very approachable. You have loads of DLCs of varying quality, from total rubbish to absolute gems of modelling (within the engine constraints). Manuals in many cases are poor to say the least. There is a lot of errors in many DLCs. Ah, and yes, DLCs. There are thousands. And if you want to really have some fun playing you will need at least some of them. Learning curve for this game can be steep. I personally had three attempts. One after I bought it originally in 2016 I think. Then somewhere later. And eventually around 2019, when it finally caught.

So why would you even want to consider this despite all of what I just said? Because what is hidden behind this not-so-beautiful surface is a very decent railway simulator. There are newer and prettier games, but none which offer so many opportunities. Opportunities in terms of creating and finding addons and scenarios. It's like the MS Flight Simulator on rails (well, except not all areas of the world are well represented). If you are a hard core railway fan and have time to learn how to use it, the TS is still an unmached (even if deeply flawed in many respects) environment.

Be aware, that to use its potential, you will need to invest into DLCs. Either time or money. Or both. There are wonderful freeware addons for this game. Some are outstandingly complex, comparable to the best pieces of payware (Skoda 109E locomotive is a wonderful exapmle of that). But finding them and making them work takes time. On the other hand there is quite a lot of good payware. Some of it also outstanding (like products of Railworks Austria or Virtual Railroads, mostly available outside Steam), but also quite expensive (30-40 € for a loco isn't unusual). Then there are also pretty decent cheaper and older addosn, many of them available on Steam.

There are ways to make up your collection at reduced cost. Sales are frequent, I hardly ever buy my stuff outside sales. Older content, which can be very good, may become available at a pittance. Outside steam you can find old packages of Train Simulator 2013, 2014, 2015 etc., which today act as inexpensive bundles of really decent older routes. So there are ways of making your bill lowER, but ultimately you can easily sink a lot of money in this game. 

Is it worth it? Well, if you are a real railway fan, and you want to give it a try, best wait for a sale (or buy some older low-cost package from other retailer) and check for yourself. There is just a chance you might love it. But be aware, this is definitely not a product for just any casual gamer.

If you look for a more casual and less rough product, just to do some easy and pretty railroading, I'ld recommend the Train Sim World instead. Game with more limitations of what you can do in it, but much more of a ""plug and play"" type. Also prettier and more modern. Which, however, will never fully replace this one.",1635779037,1635779037,True,12,0,0.6008719801902771,0,True,False,False

Not really a train enthusiast but I like simulation games and driving things around. Had some fun on this game.
Overpriced DLC's, the optimization in this game is... non-existant, my game runs like dogsh*t, I didn't encounter that many bugs but the FPS.. Man..
I guess wait for a sale, paying the full price for it isn't the best choice considering optimization, bugs, etc.

Update 8 October 2021, 471 hours of playtime
So uhhh... I've played this quite a bit since then ^^' 
Yeah, the content from the devs is pretty meh, especially the french DLC's which are pretty disappointing... Thankfully, the community mods are what make this game worth buying, there's endless content, both free and paid, from the community that's way better quality than the dev's content.
The way the devs handle this game is pretty pathetic but you can always count on the community to do their best.

1) Graphics - It's pretty good, but the engine is old, and it's not as good as other recent train simulators (TSW, Railsim etc.)
2) Realism - Well, it's pretty simple. It really lacks a lot of features of real life driving, but it still keeps the medium level realism. A lot depends on creators. Some routes and some trains are really amazing, others are pretty bad and also bugged. Some Steam locos are masterpiece of scripting and some other trains are just plain basic. Unfortunately there are many limitations in the engine.
3) Accessibility - The game is aimed mostly at occasional players. There is simple controls mode. Still more advanced players can have a lot of fun especially with Pro Range add-ons and some steam locos can be very challenging to drive.
4) Routes - Reading points 1-3 one may think that the sim is pretty mediocre. Indeed, it is but why it wins on the market is because of how many routes and stock it has. There is no other sim that allows you to drive for 5-6h straight (London to Penzance, Linz to Lindau etc.), no other sim has so much diversity, starting with XIX century steam finnishing at TGV and even Maglev. Of course nobody can afford to buy all of them, but there is really a lot to pick from, especially in UK, USA, Germany and Austria.
5) Workshop - A lot of people are creating stuff for the game. There are plenty of freeware routes and scenarios which keeps the game alive. We can also create stuff pretty easily ourselves.
6) Third-party tools - There are tools like ThirdRails which track your journey on GPS and gives you real life shcedules. There are many possibilities to extend the fun of the game outside of what it was designed for.
7) Timetable mode - Unfortunately, the game lacks a timetable mode. We can only use premade scenarios, Quick Drive, which is pretty basic run from A to B and Free Roam mode. The latter allows us to explore the route, but without other moving traffic. Therefore, it's hard to drive realistically. We can use real life schedules in QD mode, but other trains will be random with very rarely any red light stopping us.
8) Hudless driving - The game comes with a HUD which displays incomming speed limits, stations etc. Still it is possible to drive without a HUD, like a real train driver would do. This of course requires some route learning or making notes. Some routes are very easy to drive HUDless, some require a lot of preparation, but I must admit that it works very well. Good for immersion.

To summarize. Any train fan should try the game. The basic package comes with only a few routes, but it's pretty good to start and see what the game has to offer. Later one can decide if he wants to invest in more routes or quit. This map shows all available payware and some freeware routes (there are however much more freeware routes to be found): http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/train-simulator-2021_252726

It's usually wise to explore one region for example extending what we already have, but some people may decide that they prefer more diversity and buying completely different regions.",1633696225,1633696225,True,3,0,0.541666686534881592,1,True,False,False

-Not every train has a different sound, I would understand if 2 different trains had something like the same horn, for example, the M8 and the M7. But hearing the same horn on every cabcar is annoying.
-Not all the sounds come from the real trains.
-Suggestions aren't taken too often.
-The Graphics are okay, but its not too friendly to lower tier devices, as it will occasionally lag on a low tier laptop on starting
-Alerters are annoying and confusing, when you depart, the alerter will enable, slowing you down and making you late

The Bad Section.
-Derailments happen too easily
-Penalties have little to no context
-The game crashes by tabbing out of it onto another tab
-Most of the trains are gated by a paywall
-There's not enough free routes
-Every time you get a DLC, you have to update the game, which could take a while
 
Theres too many good and bad things to name but heres my solutions for the bad things and okay things.
1. Have more free routes, at least 10, 5 can be freight, all from around the world, and the rest of the 5 can be passenger service from around the world.
2. Reduce the DLC prices, everyone has to wait months for a sale just to get a DLC they want.
3. Give more context when a penalty is handed, like a timeliness penalty, it can either be good or bad.
4. Try and script derailments better.
5. Take more sample sounds from trains.
6. Fix the alerters, Make them have a cooldown.
7. Have Low Tier Versions.
8. Have a website where you can drop in suggestions, where they are all read every friday.

The rest, I have no idea to fix because I haven't developed a big game for a big game platform, but please take this feedback, many railfans enjoy the game but there are some things that need improvement.

But in all, I don't recommend it if you're looking for people looking for pure quality, but I recommend it if you're just looking for a game to have fun in when you're extremely bored.",1627432224,1633221927,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

This game has not received very many updates over the years, so it certainly shows its age. DLC can be hit or miss. DLC is a bit expensive in my opinion, so I wait for sales before I buy anything for this game. There is also lots of great third party content (some you have to pay for but most is free) that helps make this game enjoyable.

The few hours I've played it were mostly frustrating. The game runs between 20 - 40 FPS on medium settings with a GTX1060 and i7 (6k series).  This fps range varies between tracks, but it's never a clean 60. Controlling a passenger train feels pretty lifeless, static passengers waiting at a station to get in and that's about it.

[i]Who would I recommend this for?[/i]
For train sim fans out there that have a fat wallet and a beast of a PC, by all means try this game out. Or perhaps if you have a favorite route that's available in one of the many DLC's, it could be worth the experience.

I have to start doing reviews more often about my favorite games. First off, Train Simulator 2021 has the best train simulation sound effects one could possibly ask for. While it may not have that many rolling stock sound effects, they are the best sound effects you could ever hear. To make things even better, there are various dlcs to satisfy your locomotive operation cravings. Even the base routes are pretty expansive, but you will have to eventually forfeit/fork over around $20-$50 for a route. Even the bad routes are great routes. For example, one user claims that the Canadian routes aren't even elevated. The fact of the matter is that I highly disagree. Even though I do not yet own any of the Canadian routes, I can't just sit there and believe that one ungrateful steam user's claim is correct. Sure, Train Simulator 2021 isn't as graphically polished as Trainz Railroad Simulator 2019, but what it lacks in graphics, it makes up in content, realism, and fun. And additionally, the graphics aren't grim at all. They're actually very realistic, even if the sun's lens glare may not look all that colorful. The amount of rolling stock isn't as exactly as varied as N3V games' TRS 2019 with over hundreds of rolling stock and locomotives if you bought every single dlc route and dlc locomotive and rolling stock, and over thousands of rolling stock and locomotives and routes if you actually take the time to browse through the game's built in download station where over hundreds of newly created user content is being uploaded almost everyday. 

The good stuff:
-Realistic sound effects that usually vary by train car
-Realistic locomotive sounds and operation
-Over 600+ downloadable content items to purchase and play around with
-Very balanced colors that may make the game grim, but far more realistic in comparison to other train simulating games
-Millions to billions of hours to invest in content from the steam workshop and dlc items from the store
-Varying railroads to operate in routes available for the game
-Professionally revised DLC versions of base locomotives that can all be purchased on Steam
-Multiple opportunities for shunting, switching, sorting, passenger runs, freight runs, steam excursions, and more railroading
-AI train programming that is very easy to use
-Simple and realistic modes that are fun and challenging
-Tons of routes to play around with
-Tons of railfanning opportunities in almost any free drive, career, or user made scenario
-Tough and almost challenging grades that are fun to overcome
-Realistic railroad operations 
-Highly detailed routes, locomotives, rolling stock, and scenarios

Bad stuff:
-Not enough rolling stock sounds
-Rolling stock isn't really varied and is instead just repainted train cars
-Not all locomotives have operation manuals
-Some dlcs are faulty or malfunction
-Some locos have the same horn
-Some scenarios have bugs or are broken
-No scenic railroad or tourist railroad routes (e.g. Cass Scenic Railroad State Park) to play with
-Steam locomotive whistles don't always work the way they're supposed to (e.g. you can't really use the whistles like real steam locomotive engineers do) 
-AI trains don't honk their horns, blow their whistles or ring their bells when approaching railroad crossings, backing up, sitting, waiting for signal clearance, in distress, or other situations where horn sounding is required
-AI trains don't have minds of their own (don't really do anything unless they're given commands)
-You can only operate one train at a time in free roam scenarios making it impossible to make runaway train events
-No extinct American locomotives feature as downloadable content
-Railroad crossing sounds aren't varied and designs are not at all realistic
-Only a handful of American railroads feature in the game and dlcs
-Not all locomotives are fitted with their respective bells, horns, whistles, or engine sounds
-The Cumbres And Toltec Scenic railroad isn't featured

Edit: The railroad crossings are highly inaccurate in this game. Their designs are questionable, lazy, and less varied. Improve your railroad crossings Dovetail Games. Stop being lazy.",1630804545,1633202619,True,2,1,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

This game, is CRASH PRONE. It's due to 2007 Oldness (First 2 years it was on discs and owned by EA), the biggest and most common crash you will get is an out of memory error, and it happens everywhere. You can do ANYTHING and the game crashes, and when i say anything, i mean it, you can do NOTHING and the game crashes as well. DTG isnt exactly the most helpful either. They normally just say that it isnt their fault and you need to turn down your graphics. Well excuse me DTG, I didnt know my RTX 2080 Super, Intel Core i7 8700 @ 3.2 GHz, and 64 GBs of ram is NOT ENOUGH. Maybe it has to do with the fact that you use only one core (btw thats the reason). The DLC is insane, and the Deluxe version of the game gets you like 2 things more. This also applies to TSW2 btw (besides the crashing issue)

This game as i said is 14 years old, and it shows, and DTG year after year just changes the number and like 2 things with the routes and thats it. When this new Train Sim https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422130/SimRail_2021__The_Railway_Simulator/ from SimRail comes out, hopefully it gives DTG the real wake up call that they truly need. I hate to say it, but steer clear of all of DTG Products until they get their act together. (Cough 1 Core Issue COUGH)

I would say positives, but here, its not worth it. as this core issues have gone unpatched for years and DTG blames the customers.

The game is also a bit of an odd runner, i have 32BG RAM at 4600Mhz yet i get memory crashes when it only uses 3GB.
This games inbuilt route builder is in DIRE need of an upgrade but if you try you can get used to it.

Good things:
Its got amazing realism when it comes to driving (when u get 3rd party content).
The graphics look good for a decade old game (with 3rd party content)
Therte are very realistic trains to drive (if 3rd party content).
There are good routes (no actually the routes aint that bad if your blind or u can have 3RD PARTY VCONTENT)

yes this game is only alive today because of third party content. and what really bugs me is they dont add 3rd party permissions to TSW2 like brUH your just limiting us, and i know its because of money but imagine how much more popular the game would be if AP made trains for TSW2.

I would only recommend if you are a big rail fan and that you have many timne to spend. 

Tbf us rail fans are really deprived of a pure rail game that has nice graphics for 2022 and has a 3rd party community... oh wait that reminds me of a game, its called TSW2. WAIT nvm i forgot armchair bird games say ""NO"" and their games gonna die like TSW2020 lol

Overall: I would be in the middle of the game like a 6.5/10 cause it was not that noob friendly, it just plain bad.

Edit. I am amazed this is still going it been like over 12 year already and they keep release ""DLC"" this become like an EA stunt move than anything. No great change just release some lazy dlc work for a couple train. 
We are in 2021 we expect more graphic change like better tree, realistic graphic, better update.

Updated.......
Normally, with a game, you play a challenge and at least it is possible to finish with practice, however, this game has bugs that physically stop you finishing some challenges.

This would be OK if you hadn't just spent an afternoon on the challenge, then find it is totally impossible to finish!

Think very carefully and have a nose around the forums BEFORE you invest in this game.
It's DLCs are above average cost, still with bugs though !


Updated yet again...............
Then you start to find all the bugs etc. bit of a pain, some you can get around, others you can't do anything about it.

Seems there are lots of fanboys around so be a bit careful how you phrase questions or claims of bugs, LOL or you will be ganged up on like a children's playground ROFL.....

ancient graphical engine, early 2000's era yet every year its a ""new"" edition with zero added content. 

almost nothing functional, not even a near sim quality anything.


speed and signage mismatch all the time from the hud.

paid for DLC missions broken for YEARS never addressed... some making the mission unplayable. (see norfolk southern coal route, starts you off at never ending red signal and an manned engine sitting RIGHT on the switch in front of you that never moves! you have to cheat and request clearance then PUSH it out of the way... very realistic....)

graphical gliches everywhere... entire parts of the train go invisible all the time.

water looks worse than playstation 1 renderings.

sound clips start and stop abruptly, track editing is horrible. especially bad with repeated sounds like the horn and bell.

no way to even edit the controls to what you want?!?!

no support for ANY other controllers except xbox and the stupidly overpriced raildriver??? so no using your own throttles or joysticks!

*Revisited after 40-ish hours. Sticking with ""No"" as there isn't a ""maybe, but with caveats"" option.

It still looks like an old game, but there's more going on here than meets the eye.  There's a huge back catalogue of routes for this thing, and absolutely loads of user created scenarios for them.  There's definitely a lot more to do here than the scant handful of activities that each route comes with by default, but it still lacks the full 24 hour service mode of it's successor. 

There's not much here for the more casual player, but there is definitely a lot to like if you're a train fan, and it does have steam traction which is a big plus over TSW/TSW2.  UK signalling seems to be more accurate as well - TSW has *still* not properly implemented turnout signals for instance. PZB seems to be pretty shoddy though, so if you're a fan of German traction bear that in mind.

Approach it as a digital train set rather than a conventional game, and keep an eye on the store tab as there is almost *always* stuff on sale.  

Difficult to recommend to anyone who isn't a massive railfan.  Recommended to railfans who simply want more trains than TSW currently delivers, especially if you tend to stick to one region/country.",1615560159,1632236172,False,3,2,0.517158806324005127,0,True,False,False

(Even after 600 + hours, I couldn't tell you a single train model number or even manufacturer). However, it was on offer so I snapped it up and I'm glad I did. 

You don't need to be a ""trainspotter"" type to enjoy this game, although if you're interested in trains then this will be an added bonus of course. This game is great to relax and unwind to due to it's slow pace (although changing speed limits and station stops etc keep it interesting). The routes and scenery (the latter not being very realistic however) are varied and challenging, especially if you use the steam trains.

The game features a ton of (famously overpriced) dlc from Dovetail and add-ons from 3rd parties such as Just Trains. There are some really brilliant routes and trains available that blow the stock content out of the water so I would advise setting some extra money aside to purchase those! Everything from a fully functioning steam engine (see Smokebox) to the latest electric trains with functioning switches etc, through to London Underground/Overground routes, HSL, US routes through NY and routes around the Swiss Alps to name a few. In fact, I would say the stock content is pretty unplayable after you've played the add-ons (the trains more than the routes which are ok but short. Most of the controls/switches etc in the stock trains are non-functioning whereas they work in the add-ons usually).

There is also a route creator which enables you to make your own ""scenario"" on an existing route or even lay down your own track and make your own route. It takes some getting used to (especially making your own route) but allows you to theoretically create any route you like (assuming you have the skill/time/patience).

+ Pretty unique game (not many other train sims out there like this)
+ Easy to learn, difficult to master
+ Routes are realistic
+ Realistic controls/gameplay
+ Loads of DLC trains/routes/stock from Dovetail and other 3rd party vendors. Most prove a massive improvement of the stock content.
+ Massive longevity (I've got over 600 hours and I've not played every single route/scenario even)
+ Custom route and scenario editor

- DLC and add-ons are very expensive. There are also so many you would need thousands of £ to get everything. They are also far superior to the stock content which makes avoiding buying them difficult. 
- When you buy an add-on route, it comes with scenarios. These scenarios are usually tied in with another add-on model meaning you have to make another 2 or 3 purchases to get the trains required in order to play it. This makes it very expensive. (The key is to get the route and create a custom scenario using a train you do have by loading it into the editor. Or ignore scenarios altogether and do your own thing).
- Slow pace won't appeal to everyone (no speed up time either)
- Railfan scenarios seem ridiculously boring to me. You don't drive the train, you are a passenger and just go on the route. If that appeals to you then ignore this bit.

Want to build your own route? Forget that, too! You have to go through a million steps to even find out how to make a damn switch.

The first reason is obvious, Train Simulator has a ridiculous amount of DLC. I mean just mountains and mountains of DLC. Some are made very well and are enjoyable, others... not so much. Some are so lazy that they have missions that are not even possible to complete and achievements that are impossible to get. There is one thing, however, that all the DLC has in common: It is all insanely overpriced, and many of them are overpriced even when on sale. The other thing I really dislike about the game is the graphics. They just really don't cut it, especially when the developers keep relabeling the game every year as if it is a new product. This is a 2009 game, you are a fool if you think there is actually such a thing as ""Train Simulator 2021.""
     The gameplay itself is also somewhat lacking. When you boil it down, there really isn't a whole lot to do in the game. Sometimes you just have to sit in front of the computer for two hours until you get to your destination. In other words, if you do not like trains, you will think this is one of the most boring games ever made. Even if you do like trains, this may still be boring to you. The game tries to make itself more interesting with the career scenarios where you get graded for your performances, but the scoring is often frustrating or in many cases even broken. 
    This last grievances with Train Simulator is more of personal preference than an actual problem with the game. There just isn't a whole lot of variety in the content. Most of the DLC is themed of modern day British and American trains, and I personally am not all that crazy about that kind of stuff. Why do they insist on churning out the same kind of stuff all the time when there is literally a whole other world of trains that they have ignored in the decade that this game has existed? China built and operated steam locomotives into the 90s, wouldn't that make interesting DLC? What about Mexican railroads? I mean they used a lot of American equipment that is already in the game so it wouldn't be that hard. They just aren't very creative when they choose what DLC they should make. 
   So, if you bothered reading this far, you are probably wondering why I do recommend this game. Well, it's simply because there isn't anything else quite like it. There is Train Sim World 2, but that doesn't have as much content as this and what little content it does have is pretty much DLC that this game also has. There is also Trainz, but I just don't think the driving aspect of that is as good as in this game. Trainz is better if you want to actually build routes yourself and is more mod friendly. Of course good old Microsoft Train Simulator is still around, but I don't really see that as being better than this game. Is this a good game? Well, not really. Is this the best game of its type? I would say so.",1630472400,1630472514,True,220,5,0.939279854297637939,10,True,False,False

This is a game from 2009, they are just rebranding the name every year with new overpriced DLC's.

DLC's are highly overpriced, models are lacking a lot of work and are not completed. As I said it is better to play with community models.

Still not talking about how broken the game is sometimes, many out of memory errors.

DTG should work more on the game than releasing overpriced DLC's with lack of work.

If there wouldn't be community models, this game would have died already.

If you want to play this game, definitely get it for cheaper it's overpriced.

Some things from my original review have not changed. This includes the game looking pretty poorly but also running like a turd on a treadmill. On the one hand, the game engine [i]is[/i] like over a decade old, but on the other hand this is a game that is still getting new content and updates in 2021 and is, y'know, called TS2021 (name changes each year) so its very easy to leave the game with some terribly missed expectations if one doesn't do their research. 

BUT!

With lowered expectations in the graphics department, you can actually have a good time with this game[b]*[/b]

Asterisk? What asterisk? Oh, that one... Well, one's experience with this game is [i]highly[/i] dependent on the content they get to go with it. If you are not interested in buying DLC for this game, [b]do not bother with this game[/b]. If you want a train simulator with more content in the base game, go get TSW2; it looks WAY better and has a lot more to do in the base game, and Derail Valley is also highly recommended.  However, if you can reason with yourself and your wallet to occasionally get additional content for this game, then you can actually [i]really[/i] enjoy this game (wait for sales. No, seriously, [b]wait for sales[/b]. They happen fairly often and are often rather generous with discounts, and the bigger ones have a majority of the DLC on some sort of discount). But more importantly, DO YOUR RESEARCH when buying DLC. 

I did not do my own research, and when I bought the Sherman Hill route and the Big Boy locomotive (not Smokebox's, it wasnt even close to being out yet), I was let down harder than a girl who's prom date didn't show up. That Big Boy locomotive... even for 2013 it was pretty sad, but in 2019... theres a reason I think its been removed from the store. Add to this the game gives you very little information about which graphics settings are the most influential on FPS, and I had a game that looked like garbage, a locomotive that looked like garbage, and a route that is good on its own but can be hard to appreciate when you are driving a sad excuse for a steam train at 25 fps. There was a 6 month gap between me buying and being disappointed by that content and me writing my original review for this game, and even then it had been like 3 or 4 years since I had played the game before getting that content in 2019. 

""Okay, but what has changed since then that has made you change your review, you idiot??""

RIGHT! Well, a number of months ago I bought some more content. Instead of basing my [i]purchases[/i] solely off of what had a cool name and what had cool pictures, this time I looked at the reviews for the DLC that caught my attention before buying. I bought the Montana Hi-Line and Marias Pass routes (I'm not Montana born and raised, but Montana has stolen my heart) and the FEF-3 steam locomotive from Smokebox. The routes are fantastic to drive (though the Hi-Line route does take a certain kind of crazy to haul freight on with a steam train) and like all Smokebox locomotives, the FEF-3 is totally, entirely peerless among steam trains in Train Simulator... well, until he released his Big Boy this summer. If you are a steam fan and live in the USA or at least have a fascination with American Steam, Smokebox's locomotives (especially the FEF-3 and Big Boy) are [b]must-haves[/b]. The two routes I got are also very good, but you may not like mountains/Montana, and so long as you look at the reviews for any DLC you might get, you should be able to separate the high-quality routes from the low-quality crap and still be left with plenty of DLC to pick from. 

[b]To sum up[/b], my original review for this game was thumbs down, and rightfully so because DTG is not averse to releasing utter crap for this game as paid DLC, and I was one of the unfortunate people who bought the original Big Boy DLC loco. However, I have since gotten new locos and new routes and actually really enjoy this game now. For prospective buyers, don't be overwhelmed by the extreme amount of content available for this game, rather explore it all with excitement because its very likely you'll find plenty to enjoy, but you [b]must[/b] look at the reviews for each and every DLC you think about buying, because there are some [i]real[/i] turds out there, and there are also some real old DLC out there which might not live up to your 2020's expectations. Do you research and temper your expectations to be in-line with a game engine from the 00's, and you should be able to find some content for this game that you can really enjoy",1590598229,1627945934,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It really is not like driving a real train. There is no ATP (Automatic train protection) and the signals have no bearing in the game. My last game i went full transaction and only received a speeding alarm. I ignored every Caution signal and SPAD every Stop signal. No ATP dropping my air and no emergency stop radio calls from a panicked OCC. Truth is the Stop signal is not even relevant because there is no conflict/danger points when you do SPAD. 

Train/track physics are not really realistic because i was going over set of points well over 100km. In the real world i am train not to exceed medium speed (35km) for any points. If i was to go over a set of points at 110km my train should be in the dirt. As i progress further with my real world training this game is becoming more and more a joke. This game is clearly design for the Gunzels and not people who wish to taste what a real train feel likes. I will keep to the $2 million simulator we have a work as that is an actual sim that will not ignore SPADs.

The biggest problem I'm having, is, when trying to edit the awful default sounds the dlc comes with, I noticed that now instead of all the audio and railvehicles folders, there just an adobe bluepring, and an AP file. Thats's it. Nothing else. I can't edit any DLC by DTG. Why. Am I the only one with this problem?

Edit: Now 2021 and the game brushed aside by the Devs, I can say this game is decent for what it is. I did finally figure out how to edit sound files (7zip and Winrar), but of course I'm not a code master so it doesn't work time to time. It has some decent replay-ability, and I find myself going back to it like a toxic ex. The game almost never changes with each ""update"" but at least everything stays the same with no changes to the UI or controls, and you don't have to buy the entire game again like TSW2.

I own a few DLCs, probably 5 or 6, I usually buy when they are on sale.

Overall I enjoy the game and 200+ hours of entertainment is good value for money.

However, you'll see a lot of people slating Dovetail for releasing an old game with just a few tweaks every year and it does feel a little bit dated.  Graphics and sound are really OK, the engines do look good but scenery etc doesn't look like 2021 visuals and could use a little work, overall I'd rate it 6/10 for graphics and 7/10 for the sounds.

It does feel fairly realistic, driving a train isn't simple but it is also not too hard so you can enjoy the game pretty much as soon as you start playing.  It is tricky to get a 100% score for the career scenarios so there is a challenge if you want that.

I think value for money is quite good, people complain that it would costs thousands of pounds for all the content, but you probably wouldn't live long enough to try every mission if you bought all the DLCs.

I have probably spent less than £100 in total and had over 200 hours of entertainment, that is pretty good in my book.

I will continue to play the game as I have only played 2/3 of the scenarios so far, but I would love a proper 2021 version with fully up to date visuals.

I find it kind of therapeutic playing this and it is good for escapism, when I am driving a train my problems go away for a while!

Then MSTS, which I played but didn't Build, that morphed into Train Simulator and the rest is history. 

Driving is fun but Route Creation is the reason for Train Simulator. TS2012 I think was the first one with yearly updates to TS2021.

I have had 10 years of building with no results as a result of poor Backup procedures.

Poor backup procedures are the cause of thousands of hours (I have nearly 10,000 hours of playtime) of effort being lost but the enjoyment value pays handsomely for the losses.

If you enjoyed Meccano and such, Train Simulator is for you.

Start at TS12 or the earliest available and thoroughly exhaust all you can from it and move up year by year. The Simulator does improve with time.

Have thousands of hours of fun !!!!

In my own option this is good game, I like how it plays and the range of routes and train that you can play, and for the most part I can happily play this for hours or in short sessions. Sometimes playing the same routes that I enjoy. I feel like this game has lots of replay value for me and I will probably play this for years to come.
However, I think the that the main issues for this game, is the price of routes and trains, I have only brought stuff on sale and even then it feels a bit much, even buying a few keys from other places to try keep the cost down, I feel like the prices are bit too much for me personally and I will wait for a sale to add different DLCs when they are a good price. 
Then I think the games takes itself a bit too seriously sometimes, don’t get me wrong I love a good level of challenge and have often got top scores in a few routes or just lost a few points, but there are a few levels that just are a bit too challenging and difficult for me. Which isn’t a bad thing, but there has been moments where I have quit the game because of difficulty or silly mistake, but I always keep coming back to it.
Then lastly, the bugs. Dear lord there is a few in the game, depending what routes and levels you play. Some are minor and I can look the other way. But then some are bit more noticeable, like the stations or parts of the map not loading or appearing, creating holes in the map. Then random and sudden speed changes that aren’t shown on the map at the bottom, which is going to cost you an unbelievable amount of points because you didn’t know that there has a speed change, in fact one DLC is unplayable because of that reason. It somewhat takes away from the simulation part and that real world feel.
But overall, I just love this game and with recent world events, so to say. It has been a fun way of seeing the world whilst not leaving the house. I think it is solid game overall, but you are going to have to put up with a few little things here and there, plus the game is quite old now so the older DLCs look a bit worse then then new ones, but they cost a lot less and they are still pretty enjoyable and playable.

So, upon my first runs on the sim, I was instantly hooked. Hell, I didn't even care at the time how much it was for a route. I remember being hyped for the TS2014 Update (at the time I had no idea what would become of TS). So around December 2013 (from what I can remember), RSC rebranded as DTG, and around that point, The sim began it's ever so slowly fall. At first, I didn't notice, I was too busy having fun while reading over the other players problems via the forums (i'm no longer subscribed to them as they got annoying). Around mid May 2014, I finally started to note some issues, and finally decided to give in to a negative review. The review, did NOT last very long, as when TS2015 came out, I was instantly happy to see a Class 801 (which nowadays serves no purpose, YET) and the upgraded Acela. This was the point I had met some friends who knew and had to deal with the current issues with the sim, until I started to do so as well around December 2014.

When TS2016 was announced, I was nevertheless, expecting just a update, untill I found out you had to pay for it......... I ended up dropping $38 bucks to get it to work (as my TS kept crashing when the free TS2016 update came). Other than that, it was just a rehash of TS2015. The same goes for the TS2017 update, and again in the TS2018.  Now here we are with TS2020 and this game lives on for now, although with DTG losing licenses and having to remove content one may wonder how much longer we have......

Now, enough of this nonsense, let me just cut to the chase.

One problem that REALLY annoys me is the constant dump files (when the game has crashed). The 64bit update back in TS2019 also didn't fix that.  Another problem is the amount of money for DLC, some of which are just bad. I think I've spent over $3000 on this game for bad DLC. DTG keep messing stuff up, like reusing Class 455 sounds on newer trains. Even with the newer DLC my friends have lag issues, one of mine can't even get his game working anymore, and had to go back to Run8.

If you think that's not bad, wait till you meet the TS Community. Back in the day it was just 3rd party devs, but now we have the reskinners and the freeware devs. I'm not going into detail here on how much of an issue this is becoming.

To sum it all up, make sure you have a super computer, and try to have around $100-200 during the steam sales, which is the best time to purchase DLC.

Overall, it's a 0/17. I still enjoy driving trains, but I can't recommend it due to all the flaws, which may never be fixed.",1375192913,1625364151,False,8,2,0.60856330394744873,0,True,False,False

I knew that the developers just rename ist every year after making just small improvements and therefore, that the ""Train Simulator 2021"" technically is a game from 2009. Therefore I didn't expect much - just a chill train game with at least realistic controls in the train cockpit. What I got was much less than this, as I saw after just somer minutes of trying it.

Controls:
You don't actually use the controls of the Dashoboard of the train but some arcade-like Hub that is layed over those controls - mainly one slider vor the level of the engine power and one for the choice between back- and forward. Don't know exactly if you could turn of this stuipid immersion-killing hub, but it didn't seem like I could.

Camera:
You can choose between various camera modes. The free roaming mode just sets the camera completely free, regardless of any collision control whatsoever. As I switched to that, I got inside the head of train driver.

Maps:
I wanted some beautiful Swiss maps. The first I tested was the Gotthard Line. The draw distance of trees was really short and there were no options to change that in a graphics menu or something. And now the biggest disappointment: the trees were just 2D-sprites. I felt like I was in a game from the early 2000s or something. I knwer expected top notch graphics from this, as the core of this game is from 2009. But I didn't expect to get reminded of early 3D graphics in computer games either. I checked other train simulators on youtube after testing this and found that the Microsoft Train Simulator from 2001 (!!) had comparable graphics to the things, I saw in this particular map. 
There may be other maps, which are better, but then I would expect the developers to hold the maps at least remotely up to date in terms of graphics considering how high the prices for those maps as DLCs are.

Al in all: I would consider this okay for 5€ or something. But not for 20€, which is already the price in sale.
This feels more like a scam for thatprice.
Therefore I asked Steam for refund now.",1625084957,1625084957,False,3,0,0.510662674903869629,0,True,False,False

As for PC requirements, it helps to have a good GPU and RAM, but it will also run just fine on a normal laptop, such as my Lenovo IdeaPad S145. The only thing I really have against this game is the fact that to unlock new routes, you have to spend something like 20 dollars otherwise you are just stuck a limited number of lines and locomotives. There is also this annoying glitch with the southwest trains where it will constantly play this loud beep, and the only way to turn it off is to mute the game.

-Clinchfield
The SD40 on the Clinchfield route is completely broken, the brakes don't work at all, let alone like they should. The sounds are very basic and rather nasty, the model is very basic (the radiator fans are there but they don't spin), the cab has nice textures but very few controls that actually work. TS has published better than this, I don't know why they chose to use this model for their ""big yearly release"". And being a DTG thing, there's no useful documentation at all in the readme, just the absolute basics.

The route has very little in the way of track or car sounds, you can improve this a bit with mods if you're willing to wrangle with third-party tools and text files but DTG doesn't want you messing around, they make things just difficult enough that most people will give up before they get to something simple like replacing the horn sound. It's totally possible to mod this game (and that's where the real good stuff is, lot of it for free, made by railfans who, y'know, actually care about this stuff) but you have to get through the needless obfuscation first.

It's also not a good look when DTG can't change the description of the GP7 from ""GP7 Pennsy"" before publishing the route. Makes it hard to say it's not shovelware. Which it totally is. I haven't run the Geep or the F7 although they're also very old, basic models. If they had expanded on these since they came out in 2012, they could deliver a much more immersive experience... seriously, just make a few more of the buttons work and redo some textures and these could be really nice to drive.

More issues-- the brake gauges in the caboose don't work (this model is recycled as well and I've seen them work properly on other routes). Some of the wheels on the freight cars aren't quite round or not centered right, which is really obvious if you're using the free cam near the ground to get a perspective like you would in real life. 

The route itself is scenic but quiet (as in there's very little in the way of sounds) and the 2D trees start very close to the track. Runs OK framerate-wise, which isn't surprising as it's, again, pretty basic. Bridges and tunnels and trees. Looks alright and makes for some nice screenshots. But you never get the sensation that you're driving a heavy freight train through the Appalachians, just that you're playing a half-finished simulation of driving a train through a forest. I bought this (on sale, mind, don't buy anything TS at full price) for this route and I was sorely disappointed. Could have been way, way better even with just a little more polish.

-Fife Circle Line

... so you put the Class 68 on the splash screen and then you only use it in two scenarios.

The bridge is well-done, but just like the Hell Gate on NYNH, I feel like they spent more time on the bridge than the rest of the route altogether. It's not a terrible route and the Class 158 is pretty good, but that's it. The Class 170 doesn't even have a passenger view. The cab textures on the 170 look awful, very few of the controls work. The Class 68 has power/dynamic on one handle and the ""increase/decrease"" type brakes like the Class 66, so it's a bit different and fun to learn. But you only use it in two scenarios.

-Norddeutsche Bahn

German routes, you have to know the signal system or don't run with PZB on, you'll just keep getting emergency brakes and not knowing why. You can turn this off (and it's off by default) but interacting with signals is one of the key parts of driving a real train.  Penalties for late stops are usually severe (~30s late and you lose points) and you can't make up time since 61kph in a 60 is treated like 61mph in a 60, even though 1mph is a bigger speed difference. In some cases, it seems like the timetable doesn't understand the restrictions placed on you by the signal system (where on most routes it does).

For this route, the framerate tanks frequently, frequently enough that it ruins the experience. The scenery is probably the best out of the three routes but if the route isn't playable on settings that make it look good, there's not much point. The other kicker here is if the framerate tanks while you're accelerating, you can easily end up overspeeding and losing points once the game recovers. The DMU controls are like the Hamburg S1, power/dynamic brake on one handle and air brakes on the other. The air brakes won't stop the train in the distance you think they should, so you have to learn how to use both to make the kind of stops you'll need to to keep up with the timetable. This is neat and starts to get towards the ""driving a real train"" feeling until the framerate tanks and ruins it, and then the game penalizes you for trying to drive too close to the timetable it wants you to drive exactly.

--

Overall this was disappointing. There have been better ""Train Simulator 20XX"" releases in the past, this is mostly just warmed-over content from many years ago to try and get you to buy it. Maybe worth it on sale if it's less than $20. I bought it for $20 and I felt ripped off.

As a game, TS is kind of OK if you go outside the ""official"" releases. Lots of 3rd party DLC to be had which is generally quite good (although usually paid), and you can make the junk DTG pushes out better if you're willing to work at it. It's the same game it's been for over a decade and the ""TS2019"" ""TS2020"" ""TS2021"" stuff is just a ploy to confuse people into buying it. That should tell you something about the publisher. The community is pretty good, although not as extensive as MSTS used to be. For the US, you'll want to check out Railworks America for freeware mods.

To sum it up: A few years ago, DTG's big thing was ""WE ARE RAILFANS"". They're not. They're cash fans. You have to search out the actual railfans (3rd party devs and the fan community) to get this game to be what it claims to. Driving the train is OK for a while but if you know anything about how railroads or trains actually work, you'll quickly be seeing the issues and wishing for better. It's even more maddening if, like me, you work on or with the real thing and know what it's supposed to do and why. DTG will not fix, patch, improve, etc., so you have to do it yourself. That being said, they're pretty much the only game going, so you don't have much choice except to buy their product at some point if you'd like to drive a train on your computer.

Without 3rd party add-ons such as Armstrong Powerhouse, then I probably would have uninstalled TS2021 a long time a go (when it was TS2018). WIth 64-bit and other key core updates, TS2021 is actually quite stable these days. 

Dovetail games seem to make their DLC's half-hearted and we (the customer) have to spend another £11.99 or so, to make their half-hearted DLC to work correctly or sound and feel more realistic. This is bonkers, no other simulator or content creators' business model would ever allow this, but what choice do we have?

If you have time and money to spend on this Simulator, then your end experience will be far better than the 'vanilla' base game. 

There are a lot of people in the community that create videos, how-to's, etc. So worth researching and looking about for any tips or hints. Join a Facebook group, too. There are a few to choose from and members are usually very helpful with any issues you may have.

Pros: 
Loads of DLC's (You probably wouldn't even get through half of them)
Detail to the scenery, (It's not one of those games where the scenery looks good up close but bad when you go outside of the game bounds)
Cons: 
Same engine used for 11 YEARS now, it wasn't even called Train simulator then,
Terrible train engines on most routes (Although there is some decent or even good ones if you lucky)
Lack of realism: As expected for a early 2000's engine. The movement for the trains is unrealistic and virtually terrible. 
Passengers just disappear into the train other than walking INTO the train and sitting down in their desired seat. 

If you like buying DLC's and loco's to make the game more free and selectable, then this game is for you.
If you like Realistic and highly detailed games that can be compared to in real life, then this game is NOT for you.
Overall, the game is okay, but they need to stop advertising it making new people thinking it's new.

I picked this up on Mid-Week madness for $14.00CDN, as well as the Canadian Mountain Passes  route on sale for $17.00CDN. 4 routes - one of them being insanely long for about the price of one new route. It was a good deal for me.

I came over to PC from console not long ago, with my only rail sim experience prior to this being in TSW and TSW2. I've been a lifelong fan of North American freight, having grown up in the heart on CNs steel industry in Southern Ontario. I also lived in Lake Louise, AB for multiple years and got to witness the Canadian Mountain Pass route in real life almost daily. Needless to say, I like freight and that's why I own these titles. 

Regarding a quick comparison to TSW(2), and how freight is presented - I feel much more at home here. I appreciate the complexity, the route length, the short message from dispatch at the beginning of a scenario. All of those small things that TSW lacks. I like to know whats happening and why its happening, and what I might be able to expect out on the line in terms of traffic and other important information an engineer would know. TSW is supposed to be a highly realistic recreation of locos and routes, however it always felt very empty to me. It's usually just A to B with no real information on anything you're doing. 

I'm happy to say that with TS2021, the majority of those voids are filled. Now please keep in mind this is from a strictly freight perspective with only a few hours on this title. I know its still not 100% accurate in every sense, but to me this is a huge difference. 

In terms of performance, I'm on the higher end of the medium range spec running the 64-bit version. My PC runs this title way smoother than a lot of other games despite the occasional frame drop or lag from busy areas. For me it's not as bad as the reviews but thats with a modern rig. I personally don't mind the old graphics here, simply because there is just so much more. Building and vegetation textures actually look better to me here than they did in TSW. And I do have TSW running in full ultra as well. 

TSW looks great but there just isn't as much more to it than that. Obviously TS2021 being a PC exclusive with access to the workshop, mods, third party content etc is a somewhat unfair comparison but that still does not change my view that TSW is very much confined to the limitations of Xbox and Playstation. 

I'm sure if you're reading this you're well aware of how Dovetail games operates. Everything here is locked behind DLC and transactions. I guess it just comes down to what you see as most valuable, and how you plan to use the title. In my case, I'll probably be happy with what I've purchased for some time to come. But I know for a fact how repetitive and boring it can get driving the same route/loco over and over again. At some point you're going to want to switch it up and get something new. It's just how it goes with these things unfortunately. I don't like it any more than others but at least we have somewhat frequent sales like the one that is going on at the time I'm writing this review. 

There's a lot of reasons not to pursue these titles and that's totally understandable but at the end of the day if you like trains, and you want to drive said trains, this is the place to do it.",1622125585,1622125585,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

For newcomers, I would say 'get it and prepare to be entertained', and don't worry about the apparent cost of DLC, because it takes a while to get through what you already have, and there are some pleasant surprises during the Thanksgiving, Xmas, Easter and Summer Steam sales. This version comes with  'really good' iconic routes which also feature more locos than before, with new effects in the game engine, and is arguably the best yet. The Steam workshop is busy with route mods and new scenarios, and along with 3rd party freeware and payware, the choice is now amazing. The only criticism I have of this version is the actual organisation of the front screen. I would like to be able to segregate the routes and stock into regions, so that I can easily get to particular models and routes of say the UK as opposed to have everything jumbled together.  
                               In terms of  development, which is probably a completely different aspect of the game, the tools are sometimes difficult to access. Route building using the world interface as it stands is generally made complicated, and was easier in MSTS. Track laying is over complicated and would benefit from, perhaps, a scripting tool so that some of the bad things the tool does in the world view can be edited textually. I would like to be able to lay simple track pieces the way MSTS accomplished the task. The scenery population would be helped by availability of text based macros. For track laying, a tool which could convert track plans (text or visual tools) into world view layouts would be extremely useful. I would really love to do more route building, but without some less time consuming methods, the chances of this happening are quite low. I have not got a few spare years to accomplish new routes. In addition, the modelling tools are now quite complex, so new buildings and general infrastructure take much longer to do, and the modelling tools themselves are very expensive, unless employing Blender.
                               The views leave me wondering where the sim will be in a few years time, and what I may be writing about it then.",1442676546,1621598403,True,4,1,0.487328261137008667,0,True,False,False

I came back this week to see whether it had been updated............ My goodness, it is so badly maintained/updated and rehashed every year as a ""new game"" when it is not. If you want a game that is based on code from about 1990 then buy this game but do not fall for the fact it is renamed Train Simulator [insert year here] and it has anything like what you would expect in 2021. It is so laggy with mind numbingly bad graphics that will suck your CPU/graphics card out of all of its juice. I have a high end pc that easily plays todays latest games on full high graphics/resolution but cannot cope with this to any good degree.

Onto the simulator itself. Do not expect any sort of realism folks. The stations may be named but do not think that they will look like anything they should. Also, all of the scenarios are based out of peak, rush hour time so hardly any trains and so no enjoyment or challenge. The timings are all out and you will be lucky to complete them in the time they state without a penalty because they are unrealistic. The trains are the same no matter what DLC you buy they just look different on the outside. Trying to use the editor to make your own scenarios requires a degree in tediousness and about three years of your life only for it to fail. Most mods and other DLCs require you to buy a lot of other trains you do not want or need to play them and then sometimes they still crash. Loading times can be anywhere from a minute to half an hour so have a book handy!

Buy the game if you want to pretend to be a train driver [from the 1990s with little control due to the stuttering graphics] and do not mind any realism whatsoever.

So far, the issues I have experienced are:
- Not being able to move the camera when sat in the cab. I am supposed to be able to move the camera so I can look around and interact with the controls in the cab. I have been unable to do this, and the view is fixed facing forward through the window. No matter what I do, what buttons I push on the keyboard or mouse, what game controllers I plug in, nothing works and I can not move the camera. I then have issues controlling the train, and therefore playing the game is affected. 
- Some times, the controls of the train just don't work. The accelerator, or the brake, or something else just does nothing (sometimes the accelerator wont go up, it keeps resetting to the bottom position). There is nothing to indicate why this is happening. Again, this means I can not control or move the train, and need to leave the route. This only happens with some of the routes, while other routes the controls work normally. I believe this is a bug. 
- Un-optimised. I don't have a top of the range gmaing computer, but it is a fairly good computer which runs most of mu games at high/very high graphic levels with good frame rates. TS2021 is not optimised, and runs very poorly. this is odd, considering how poor the graphics are. I've seen mobile phone games with better graphics running more smoothly than this game. 

I would get a refund on this game if I could, but I have spent so long trying to get it to work, that I can not get a refund and am stuck with it.

This is a good example of a good game gone bad.  The game engine and coding is really dated now.  Lots of VERY long load times (you sit forever while it loads, even for a ""replay"").  I have played 2021 for only 6 hours now but have had 3 game crashes in that time due to what the game called ""out of memory"".  If it was out of memory its due to the messed up game code...my computer has enough memory to run a small city!  I'm sure the reason they don't fix it is that they can't find anyone willing to spend a lifetime unraveling the decade of mix and match coding in this game.  It really needs to be totally re-done and actually made into a 2021 game with new engine and new graphics.  Calling it TS 2021 is probably actually pretty close to criminal.  Adding a new tree or plant to the game each year is not ""updating"" the game in my opinion.  So, if you don't mind super long load times and a game with bugs and crashes then by all means go ahead and buy it.  The actual game has the potential of being fun.  I won't bring up the over priced and endless downloads (oops..I guess I just did).  When you buy the game your just getting a very basic game with basic trains and routes...to get the ""good stuff"" you have to pay a lot more.

To be honest, not recommending this game is connected to my view of DTG as a money grabbing group of train enthousiasts. I don't know another game that has DLC all over it like this game. And with Train Sim World (and Train Sim World 2), that only became worse. Gameplay is very linear, the world is dead, although the scenery isn't too bad. The mechanics are nice though and I will probably fire up the game now and then to drive around in a steam engine. The immersion is at a reasonable level for a game of this age.

If you want to start in the train simulator world, don't buy this game. It's outdated and DTG probably turned its attention to Train Sim World 2. TSW2 does not have steam engines though, and it looks like it will take a long time before they have that implemented. So if you want steam engines, go ahead, be very picky in your choices and try to wait for sales.

I didn't understand why there were 2 main games out there both coming from the same studio, and watching videos on comparisons didn't exactly give me answers. I have taught game development using Unreal Studio which TSW2 uses but an attractive game has no bearing on playability. I enjoyed TSW2 but noticed that some of the routes I wanted to drive on were only on TS so I waited for discounts and ended up buying TS2021 and a few lines. 

Having now played both I can say that TS2021 has a huge amount of content available. It may not be as attractively rendered as TSW2 and the gameplay seems to be a bit more in-depth on TSW2 but I've thoroughly enjoyed the routes TS2021 has to offer including the workshop add-ons which I'm just discovering. 

I'd like to hope that Dovetail do some sort of deal where updated content for lines that you may have purchased for TS2021 are available at a lower price for TSW2 as this can get very expensive with all the DLC available.

You might at first be turned off by :

- Bad optimization, some routes can run better than others though. 
- 10+ years old graphics in some older routes
- The vast amount of DLC's to buy
- The lack of a '' Carreer Mode '' to get your though the game
- Bugs that can be scenario breaking in some rare occasions

You might be tempted to leave the game and never touch it again... but you might also, just like me, slowly realise everything this game does right and better than any other train sim. I mean, there is a reason why this game is still running after 10+ years on the market with the same engine.

You will never find another train sim that :

- Offers you so many possible hours of gameplay without never doing the same scenario twice. 
- Offers you over 10 000 hours of gameplay with the additions of DLC's and Workshop Mods.
- Has a modding community really active after 10+ years. Thousands of free scenarios are available and some are still comming out to this day and every day. 
- Lets you create new scenarios yourself and upload them to the Workshop for others to enjoy.
- Has a vast 3rd party Payware modding community. With some luck you might find your hometown train mapped out and ready to be added to your Train Simulator.

I really love this game for being able to play for hours and hours and never do the same scenario twice. I also enjoy Special Hunting for DLC's, the steam sales are always the best time, and may I encourage you to also do some google searching to find your favorite DLC, I have found some for under 1$. There is no reason to think this game will cost you thousands of dollars. No one buys the whole DLC list. Pick what you want to run and explore every modded scenario people have made for it. You will absolutely feel like you will be getting your money's worth of every DLC you choose to get. 

I thought this game was a scam when I saw the price of all the DLC's, but I can assure you it's a great Train Sim, even in 2021. Buy the base game, it will give you enough scenarios to get started and you can go hunting for more for free on the Workshop.

You can get routes and trains from all over the world from every imaginable era. So you'll probably have your favourite trains, eras and routes and wont be interested in anything else.

 I bought the game in a sale a few years ago just for a laugh. I had no interest in trains at all at the time and now many hours of play later im addicted to a train themed crack cocaine. 

The game play for me at least is very calming and completing routes and challenges issues a certain sense of accomplishment. Sometimes I sit for hours watching videos of trains going by on YouTube and I probably have a problem and perhaps need therapy. But the game is fun and I enjoy it. 

Over the years you'll add bits to your train set every time there's a sale, and there are lots. Also there's an editor and lots of free scenarios in the workshop.

For a former player of Microsoft Train Simulator (2000) and Trainz (2009), this game sure was an improvement, but as of 2021 it looks (and feels) awfuly outdated.

Graphics-wise, the game uses a completely outdated engine. It's absurd that they still slap the 29,99€ price tag on new content because, even if it's brand new content, the fact that it's built around an outdated engine makes that price tag a complete rip-off.

The DLC policy used to be a funny meme. Now it's just a sad and never-ending truth. Some routes need two items: US Loco & Assets Pack; and the European Loco & Assets Pack - which up until 2014 came with the core game. Now, if you need those DLC's, or you're lucky enough that the route comes with the needed content, or you'll need to spend an extra 13,99€ to purchase only ONE of those items.

On the content variety it's starting to get better, now that some Swiss and Australian routes are being released. But the fact that this game centers around mostly the UK, Germany and the US, when the game has a worldwide playerbase is somewhat disappointing, when you're expecting something new and DTG releases the 9999th route in the UK/Germany. There's more to Europe (and the world) than just those two countries.

The only thing that gets me hooked on this game from time to time is the fact that I'm a massive railfan. What this game should be is what Train Sim World is - but DTG decided to milk every penny out of their fans and make 2 different tittles. In doubt, just wait to see what SimRail 2021 is going to be. Right now, it's the simulator that is getting me the most hyped for some fresh air in this scene.

Free roam does not work, and am told by community members that DTG doesn't use it, (then why is it still in the game?)

I like the graphics, and the train detail is good, but the missing features, and lack of speed realism is not. I finished a scenario in the SD40 in which I derailed the train because the speed limit went from 30 mph to 15 mph and I never saw the 15 mph signal. Being thrown 200 feet into the air while spinning was interesting. When I came back to the ranked screen, there were no global stats, or friend stats, or anything to compare my score of ""0"" to, just a spinning blue light chasing it's tail.

For someone interested in railways who wants a feel of what it is like to drive trains, it is good fun. The physics isn't entirely accurate for those types of traction of which I have personal experience but it isn't bad by and large.

Some comments have focused on the cost of DLC, complaining that it costs thousands of pounds to buy it all. That complaint is laughable. Yes, there is a lot of DLC but you don't need to buy it all. The game as purchased comes with a decent amount of content. Thereafter, you should buy routes and rolling stock that appeal to you. Buying it all would be a waste of money - it is unlikely you would ever find enough time to play all of it.

Having said that, there are some negatives with this game.

I wouldn't recommend attempting to run it with a computer matching the official minimum specification. Mine was above that spec when I bought this title but it didn't perform adequately until I upgraded the graphics card. Even then, simulations still juddered regularly (with time in the simulation going much slower than real time for a few seconds) and had other strange effects on some routes until I massively increased the amount of memory and switched to SSD storage.

The biggest problem with this game in my view is Dovetail's poor quality control on the DLC they produce. If you visit the forums you will see lots of complaints about this. Far too many of the career scenarios are broken. This includes:

- scenarios where the timetable is not achievable even if there are no delays (i.e. the time allowed between timing points is insufficient to allow you to cover the distance even running at maximum line speed throughout)
- scenarios where signalling delays and the like make the timetable unachievable (e.g. a London-Oxford scenario where a signalling delay near Didcot means it is impossible to reach the next station on time)
- scenarios where the points available don't add up to the maximum the game thinks you can achieve (e.g. a scenario which thinks you can achieve 1000 points but there are only actually 996 points available)
- scenarios that don't save your score, showing that you've scored 250+250+250+250 points but making that a total of 0
- weirdly, on at least some scenarios the clock used to judge your timekeeping is different to the clock displayed, so you arrive on time (or even early) and get penalised for being late, with the log showing a substantially later arrival time than you actually achieved
- scenarios where the physics for the traction is badly wrong, leaving you woefully under-powered

A few years ago, Dovetail posted a request to the forum, asking people to tell them about broken scenarios so they could fix them. As far as I can tell, no scenarios were actually fixed.

There is a new version of this game every year. However, on the whole the new version includes little or nothing in the way of updates to the underlying product. When a new version comes out I would recommend checking out the bundled content. If it includes content you want and is cheaper than buying the individual items, go for it.

Pros:
The trains are well made
The routes are very accurate
The world editor is easy to use
Cons:
The base game and every DLC for this is too fucking expensive (Yeah I do know that DTG lowers prices when there's a Steam Sale.)
You don't get that many stuff if you only buy the base game
[/strike]If you want to make a custom route then you need to choose a route template which only lets you build with those objects made for that route template[/strike] You can use every asset from every map but DTG never tells you that!
When I play on scenario it's just feels a bit dead because there's only like 1 or 2 trains in that route/scenario

Conclusion: Buy it if you want to have 'fun' or play on any of those routes. But be aware that if you want new content for this game then you either buy the DLCs or get content from for example: Armstrong Powerhouse.

I quickly learned tabbing out actually crashes the game, and sometimes your entire system. God forbid I wanna check something.

This game is the embodiment of that joke people make about DLCs costing more than the game and there's a lot of them for what is essentially base content, except this game isn't joking and actually does that crap. I didn't pay for the DLC, I can use my money on better things.

Why is it for a 2009 game (it's not 2021 graphics, even Black Mesa looks better than this) that I get horrible lag sometimes with an RTX 3080 and i9 processor? What did the devs test this game on, a Mac?

The gameplay itself is pretty much what you'd expect. I can't give it flack for me not knowing how to start a train for a while, because I did skip the tutorial. Though I didn't play for long because I don't have the patience for 20 FPS anymore.

It's really sad too, I heard this game was completely fine up until like 2020 where they did all this stupid crap. I played a much older Train Simulator as a kid, one where everything was included with the game, and you could put trains in any scenario without an error. It was CD-based and old, so likely wasn't this game. I found myself preferring the one I played as a kid over this one, because it didn't have all the issues.

I won't pretend it doesn't have issues. Loading times are dreadful, especially if you're using newer routes with lots of trains. Third Party scenarios are worst for this as they try to base of off real life timetables.

Many of the trains also don't sound great. The BR Class 303 has no track run sounds IIRC, so it's almost completely silent everytime you take off the power.
Fortunately, many of the British trains have third party sound packs (Armstrong Powerhouse, SamT, Steam Sounds Supreme etc.) that greatly improve not just how they sound, but also how they work as a whole (at least as far as AP is concerned), so it's good to be a British railfan when playing this game.

However, there are few, if any, similar sound packs for the trains of the other main nations included in TS, so you'll be stuck with naff sounds on most of the German and American locos.

The game's vast library of DLC is often mocked, but it's not expected of you to buy literally everything on offer. Only buy what you want. Prefer the British routes and locos? Only buy the British DLC then. American railfan? There's plenty of American stuff to choose from.
The main complaint about the DLC is that it's typically quite expensive, usually £11.99 for a loco, and £24.99 for a route. The very old stuff is cheap now, but looks terrible and generally isn't worth buying anymore.

If you are a British railfan, I absolutely recommend this game, but be warned the cost of the DLC and the relevant third party sound packs can add up quickly.",1615143292,1615143292,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I mean it is your own fault if you buy it twice, but it is somewhat ridiculous to wine about it afterwards. All you had to do is load Steam to check if you already have it in your library.
While I like the game, I would recommend taking a look at TSW 2. It looks better and is more focused on playing scenarios in my opinion.",1614810903,1614811915,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

that being said if you are a huge train nerd (like me) and want a good rail-based experience on your pc then this is a pretty great game for that. in particular, the british railway network has a HUGE amount of representation in this game and it's very much catered towards enthusiasts. yes, the game can be a broken mess. yes, the quality of the content can vary wildly but theres so much support for this game, even outside of steam, and there are many third party developers who produce high quality content for this game. even DTG gets it right sometimes. and honestly, i have to say this is definitely one of the better train sims out there.

Three routes are all you get and a tiny selection of locomotives and rolling stock. It's a DLC cash cow. Even one DLC pack costs as much as the game.

Q1: Is there a route builder function?
TS: Yes
TSW2: No

Q2: Is your scenario creator capable of making something that looks like a payware one?
TS: Yes
TSW2: No

Q3: Can you access workshop without ever leaving the game?
TS: Yes
TSW2: No

Q4A: Is selecting the route you want to drive quick and easy?
TS: Yes
TSW2: No

Q4B; Why?
TS: Because you can choose which route you want to drive by scrolling down the scenario list until you reach the route you want to drive.
TSW2: Because when you select a route, it takes you straight to the tutorial, even when you've already completed it.

Q5: Can you select a train to drive in some scenarios?
TS: Yes
TSW2: No

Q6: Can you explore the route as a passenger without having to be the driver and pressing 5 on the keyboard?

It has the potential to become a hobby rather than just a game, as sites like ATS have proven; packed full of 3rd party content.  Almost all 3rd party DLC content is superior to DTG's efforts which tend to be lazy and lacklustre.  For a massive boost in immersion, check out Armstrong Powerhouse's train fleet and enhancement packs.  TS, although much older than TSW provides TrackIR support which is a must for me, whereas the newer TSW franchise does not.  I also use TS with hardware controls for things like the power and brake levers (albeit via a freeware interface that makes TS believe I own the 'Raildriver' hardware! ... rather than natively).  Again, TS's newer cousin TSW has no capability whatsoever to use hardware - it's keyboard and mouse only.

I now have Train Simulator 2020 and Bah there are still no differences just a different year.

When the game is loading look at the bottom left corner it says 2019 :-(

I actually prefer Train Sim World i just wish it had more freedom.

And it would cause them a bit of financial distress if mods became the entire game.  Just like everyone else; they are a business after all.

Most other simulators to me, look in a way ""toyish"" as in the graphics, to me, just look too fake. Either that or they fall in the spectrum of over realism, making the game too real to be fun. This simulator falls perfectly in the middle. things look real and operations are simplified, but not too much.

The downsides to this game are becoming more and more known as i have played this simulator more and more.

the main downside is the hastily made, and WAY overpriced DLC. Most, if not all DLC has a deal-breaker qwerk. most of the time is is either locomotives not having set notches of power or the most prevalent. inconsistent breaks quality. the breaks either take ages to come on or ages to release this making operations almost impossible. while i am not in the railroad industry personally to know how they work in prototype i am sure it doesn't take as much as 2 minutes for breaks to come on or off. there are many MANY other little things a veteran player will come across that make you wonder why you just spent so much on something that doesn't behave properly, or behaves so poorly it becomes unplayable, good thing is we have 3rd party developers working with steam that can create consistent DLC. 

other than DLC issues this game is great to play and is very relaxing. it is a Great platform to learn the basics of the basics of railroad operation and i would definitely recommend this simulator in the future.",1383168954,1611610755,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I absolutely love trains; I have loved them since I received my first Amtrak H.O. scale train set at 7; I was hooked for life. This game is a giant train set on your PC and almost infinite in scale, do you remember that very first locomotive be it steam or diesel that you were just in love with??? This new train sim can bring you into the engineers seat of that train for a ride that you could never have imagined, even better you find new locals that you'll fall in love with like the Swiss DLC (Talk later about those lovelies) that bring you through the Swiss Alps offering spectacular views and very unique locomotives and coaches; the Swiss are not the only ones with great views many other places are absolutely outstanding, I was left in awe by some of the sights seen in the short travels I've made. 

Enough with me gushing about the great pros of this game because ALL games have CONS. This game as far as I can see is the DLC pricing. You can spend 1,000's of dollars on these things getting content and forbid you don't like what you have purchased. The only way to squeeze the most of this game is to wait for the all forgiving sales that come along here and there; you will still spend quite a bit of your hard earned dough but you will get many more DLC packages for the price of just one. 

To conclude I love this game because I love trains to the end of my days, but this one can be expensive; so be tactical in your buying of this one and you will be fine.

I bought a disc for Railworks 3, Train Sim 2011, due to my own interest in the route construction and my own overall interest anyway. At the time, the game looked good, it ran on my old desktop at the time fairly well and I enjoyed just roaming and having fun. Over time, the game updated and got a fresh lick of paint every year from Dovetail. This game hasn't changed since 2009, small engine tweaks don't count.

Pros

If you do enjoy route variety, then TS as a series will probably be a good choice for you.
3rd party software from companies like Armstrong Powerhouse is top notch and getting to the peak of this poor old engine's capabilities, but they have brilliant functionality.
The community around this 12 year old game is still great and supportive, really great people.

Cons

Updates do little more than add to the every growing DLC list to fill Dovetail's pockets and change the number on the title screen.
This engine is far too old now to get anything worthwhile for any new players, it had its run back in the early 2010's where I played it most.
There are alternatives with far more features, Dovetail's own TrainSimWorld for detail, Run8 for multiplayer while holding graphics similar to this, or if you are like me and enjoy building, Garry's Mod has some amazing communities like FC&N.


I love this game I really do, I probably have more hours than stated, offline play etc. If you really want to experience a classic train sim, then go for it, but I think it's finally time for this game to really rest, there are others, do your research.

If your computer/device can not handle Train Sim World/2 and you're willing to give out an arm and a leg for more content, then be my guest. 
     Now on to my dislikes about this game, D L C. The very fact that some DLC is considered worth more than the base game itself should serve as a red flag. Idk about you, but $60 for a loco and route seems quite pricey when you can get AAA games for that price. I am aware that simulators and in particular, train simulators are quite a niche market, but in my honest opinion I don't find that the routes I buy, have $40 worth of enjoyment. Even though I have near 700 hrs on this game, this is very much a relic of the past. Unless this is your only option for a train experience, knowing what I know now, I would consider other options first.

EMU's example, high voltage's switch: VCB is not funtional.

2. TGIS: Train General Information System, displaying is not functioning.

3. EMU starting sequence is not available. other locomotives are the same problem.
Depends on train's manual, I know one of the EMU's initiating sequence. This is why I said this game is very casual.

Master key is set position > Checking voltage of batteries(maybe DC 100V) > Checking displaying TGIS: Train General Information System > pushing ACM(Auxiliary Air Compressor) and checking pressures of ACM > Checking all kinds of relays > Input VCB: Vaccum Circuit Breaker > Checking breaking system > Checking notch(driving throttle) > Checking security systems(Security Break, Emergency Break)......

Therefore I rely on the ribbon to let me know what speed my train should be going at. But once again the ribbon hasn't been play tested for this. Its really annoying to be 40 - 50 minutes into a route only to find that you're over the speed limit when the limit is posted 500m down the track and you are already decelerating. Its plagued this game for years. The Fife circle line seems OK but the others are all over the place with the limits. In the real world its easy to see a speed sign up ahead, on a pc monitor it flashes by in a split second. It isn't difficult to get the ribbon running right and I can't understand why Dovetail haven't managed to do it for years on so many lines.

If this was just tested a bit before release this would be a much more accessible game for many people.

The game does not run at a playable quality on this machine. I was forewarned about ""lack of optimisation"" and this is certainly evident. Even the flagship routes sold with TS2021 are rendered in quality more befitting a game from ten years ago, and the framerate is well below what I'd expect from a ""2021"" release of a game. The graphical detail is very poor compared to TSW; there's no value for me in calling up a familiar route if the route looks nothing like reality.

I appreciate that TS is an older product and that's the tradeoff you take in order to get access to a larger range of DLC, but compared with the realism and quality of TSW I don't feel that my purchase was good value for money.

The physic are not the best, I know I've been in more locomotives in the USA then most railfans, but the way the engines ""load"" are beyond bad, you move the power handle and power right off the bat, no way of the engine loading up into the train, and the engine takes off whether you have a passenger train or a mile long coal drag. The Build tools which I got this for are alright, but buggy buggy buggy. I have a I7 10700K with a 2070 super GPU, more memory you know what to do with and every ten minutes or so the game crashes with a out of memory error even in the 64 bit version. But from the cons to the pros, I had this game for just over a month now and already 75 hours of game play, trust me you won't get bored.

Bare in mind this is coming from a player who has been playing since 2015 and has had experience in many other train simulators railway based games.

The Base Game

The base game costs £20 - £50 (on Steam), and generally includes 3 - 5 routes depending on which package you opt for. The routes on the game are extremely terrible and a waste of money, being under 50 miles, linear, and only including a few trains, For example the GWML is 50 miles and includes 2 trains (with there being 8 trains that operate on the route) and doesnt include the Heathrow express, Greenford Branch or Windsor Branch. With most others being boring and thus results in only being used a few or no times. The game engine is also terrible and leads to those with even Extremely powerful computers having random lag spikes, lower than 30FPS, and having random crashes during route building.

Route Building

With most routebuilders on this game being from the United Kingdom, this leads to many routes being based in the UK. With the United Kingdom being very densely populated this means that route builder have to spend hours and hours to make just one or two miles. With the terrible business model of this game being that of double EA this means that things like Station furniture, buildings, construction models and other assets being locked away behind unneeded paywalls. With a quote from Mr Maverick Hunter Daniel, ""With these unneeded paywalls a routebuilder is being denied to have their freedom to build a semi-realistic route."".

The DLC & Third Party Content

So, the biggest problem with this game is the DLC (Be ready for a big paragraph). With this being a train simulator, there will be many different lines and trains that people will be biased to and want to drive. But, if you actually want these trains and route, you will have to fork out more than 26% of the average salary in the UK. The cost of all DLC is as near as makes no difference £7800. So for example, if you wanted to drive on my route, you would need to own: Kent High Speed (£25), South London Network (£15), London to Brighton (£15), Class 68 (£15), Town asset pack (£7), and Class 375 Blue (£5). So that is £83 for a single scenario / route. It is absolutely appalling the way that DTG treat their fans and consumers with these prices and the way they deal with criticism. But its not just DTG producing content for this game, there are other devs like AP, JT and ATS. AP are probably the worst TPCC as they pump up prices for literally zero reasoning, silence all criticism, and lie to everyone. Just Trains are somewhat decent as most of their old routes are average with Chiltern Mainline and Western Mainline being absolute trash, but their new routes and trains are pretty ok, Like Plymouth - Penzance and Sheffield - Derby (kinda). And ATS is meh, most of the content is free, but there are some paid packs and addons. Most of these are terrible and have absolutely no reason to be payware, Not to mention the ripoff Subscription thing.

The Worst Community in History

The fanboys and the regular community dont get along very well, with death threats, police warnings and alot more.
Thats all you need to know, dont get involved.

Piracy

After hearing all this (I hope) you probably dont want to buy this game, and you will probably start looking for another train simulator, here is the problem: there isnt one. As they are in a competition of one it is impossible for them to loose, they will keep keeping their prices up until people stop frantically throw their money at them like the worker at KFC when I held them at gunpoint. I would recommend pirating this game, as you end up being better off when you do. if people stop giving them money, they will listen",1526415377,1609023576,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Get a decent amount of equipment supplied with it. Though it’s already been around and repeatedly sold in some form or another. 

Really would have been nice to see something new and fresh other than the piecemeal of a route we’ve received. 

Bad: to be expected, right? Of course I have an issue with the length. Considering the latest WCML route was given a good 113 miles to run on. Sure I recognize this company is based in the UK, and that it can be difficult to get certain reference material. But it’s not like we’ve never gotten decent length routes before. 

I would go as far as to say there’s certainly some level of favoritism. And also that the America market is being milked. I guess that’s business. 

However, I would have happily waited longer for this route if it meant we’d get to Philly. Hopefully the people intending to extend it will remain as committed to finishing it. 

I do also wish the US 3rd were as enthusiastic about finishing this corridor and or doing more commuter passenger based content as we are literally swamped with mostly freight content.

Pros: Easy to get into and understand the mechanics in a short space of time, overall graphics look pretty good and look exceptional with high res settings, super in depth game play and controls, and really fun plus addicting.

Cons. My major gripe with this sim is the add on's and lack of content within the base game. Fair enough you do get enough to sink your teeth into at the beginning. But the fact the base game is £25 with only like 6 locomotives, a few select routes and yet add on's range from £5 to over £30 is pretty criminal if you ask me. And there's like over 600 add on's.

But there's no way in hell am I paying for an add on that's priced more then the base game, and it won't be often that I will buy one either as I can't justify it.

[h1]Why buy this instead of Train Sim World or TSW 2?[/h1]
One look at Train Simulator will probably make you think ""wow, these graphics have aged like old milk"", and that's a pretty fair judgement to make, but the original Train Simulator's allure comes not from its graphics, but from its content library. While Train Sim World has stricter limits on route size (although TSW2 seems set to fix that), Train Simulator wasn't subject to quite the same restrictions - although routes still rarely exceed 90 to 100 miles in length, which is fine for most anyway. 

Train Sim World's more limited content library makes it much more gameplay-focused than Train Simulator seems at times, and that's due to the fact that the sheer amount of content on offer makes this both a game to play and a game to cultivate a collection with. Amassing a huge library of content over time is pretty easy when there's loads of official content on offer, more constantly being released, and an equally immense library of non-official stuff. Train Simulator is, then, a worse game with a better content library.

[h1]What's the content like?[/h1]
Your mileage may vary. Steam addons for Train Simulator come in 3 ranges, those being Classic (old stuff that hasn't aged well), the standard range (generally alright) and Pro (expensive and harder to use, but much more immersive). Steam content isn't just Dovetail's either - there are a few other popular developers, like Rivet (I personally haven't tried any Rivet stuff yet), Just Trains (mediocre in the sound department, great at everything else), Thompson Interactive (good routes but poor trains), and the legendary Armstrong Powerhouse (specialising in sound packs and trains, although they've made routes before). 
Most of your content will be Standard, which is fine - hell, Train Sim World's older stuff isn't much better than Standard, although more recent TSW DLC does match the TS Pro catalogue's levels of immersion. Safety systems are generally well-implemented - AWS and TPWS work well on British routes, PZB and LZB generally work well on German routes, TVM works perfectly on London - Faversham's CTRL section, and also on Marseille - Avignon, that kind of thing. Vigilance systems are often left out - although most German trains have working Sifa systems, the DSD/DVD that many real British trains have seems strangely absent unless you get something from the Pro catalogue.
Train physics are also varied in quality. Some trains accelerate absurdly fast - the DB Class 423 and BR Class 220 are examples of this (please don't torture yourself with the Dovetail 220, get the Just Trains 220 and 221 pack, pick up the AP sound pack and never put your wallet anywhere near [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/258679/Train_Simulator_CrossCountry_Class_220_Voyager_DEMU_AddOn/]this abomination of a DLC.[/url] like I did.)
Others, however, are much better. Armstrong Powerhouse's physics are top notch, and you can give them a try with their Class 90 (either in GEML livery only on Steam or in multiple liveries on their own site), or any of the enhancement packs or sound packs with physics patches on their own website. Generally, the newer a train is and the higher its range, the better its physics will be.

[h1] Okay, okay, we get it. The game is varied in quality, we know. What about the gameplay?[/h1]
Uh... bad news, this varies too. 
Pro products are basically flawless in their gameplay experience. Nearly everything is simulated, and if you're really lucky you'll get stuff like announcements (e.g on the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/896715/Train_Simulator_Frankfurt_UBahn_Route_AddOn/]Frankfurt U-Bahn[/url]) or random train faults (e.g on the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/222597/Train_Simulator_GEML_Class_90_Loco_AddOn/]GEML Class 90[/url]).
Most people won't mind standard content either - it's not bad enough to annoy you, and a lot of UK stuff can be improved with a little Armstrong Powerhouse magic. Classic content has its charm, but it's not great in terms of quality, so it's generally a bit naff if you're playing for immersion above all else. That said, there are a lot of freeware enhancement packs for classic routes if you know where to find them.
Physics are pretty good - wheel-slip, sanding, etc. Again, train acceleration and deceleration are subject to the number one rule of TS - that being YMMV - but newer content and the Pro range as a whole are both generally good in that regard. 

Also, external controller support for stuff like the Raildriver! Yes, really! You can stop foaming at the mouth about TSW not having it now!

...no? you're still mad?

...okay then. Hey, TSW 2 is due to get Raildriver support soon enough, but Train Simulator is a great companion to the Raildriver right now.

[h1]The endnote[/h1]
To summarise, Train Simulator is a worse game in most regards than Train Sim World, and that's fine. TSW was made to be both a big change for the better and a more console-friendly experience. Train Simulator is not that, and that's where its appeal lies. If you're [i]really[/i] into train simulation, you'll put up with the poor graphics and optimisation here, because when Train Simulator's capabilities are truly harnessed, it is a [i]much[/i] more immersive title than Train Sim World will likely be for a long time.",1477117112,1608410827,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

TL;DR Don't get this train simulator unless you are really desperate. 

Pros: 

As it is an older title there is a lot of content developed for it, most of it are overpriced DLCs however and not worth your money. I recommend that if you really want to play this particular simulator that you wait for sale and [u]read the reviews[/u] because a lot of the add-ons aren't even that great.

Cons:
- Graphics are pretty lackluster, it certainly does not look like a game from 2021 and that's because it isn't. This game is old and it shows.  

- Performance: Now I could potentially forgive the outdated graphics if the simulator had awesome performance. However, this simulator runs like garbage. The framerate is all over the place, going from 10-15 to sometimes 60fps on all the routes and trains I have tested so far. It's kinda ridiculous how little optimisation has been implemented in a simulator that gets a new shiny badge every single year to advertise it as a new product.  
- Bugs/Crashes: You would think that they had managed to get rid of these by now but sadly there are still bugs and crashes around to this day. 

Overall I would not recommend this outdated game to anyone.",1608291001,1608291154,False,4,0,0.551282048225402832,0,True,False,False

It's not that I ever disliked it, just the way DTG do their business (i.e rushed and incomplete content is something that's not changed, though credit for the WCMLS route and the clear fact the dev team are very passionate about it all).

I've played this sim since it was Railworks and damn has it grown. Grown but still remains to be at times a very frustrating experience. When it all comes together though, it might be a gaming niche but as a bit of a geek it's near perfect even with it's flaws. To get to that point isn't as simple as buying TS2020 though. Or as cheap.

If you really want the true experience from the sim then be prepared to spend. A lot. It might be worthwhile in the end if you can afford it but let's just say that DTG content is often no good for anything other than a platform for other developers to create DLC to compensate for how the game should be.

Sounds, scenarios, trains, so much of what is released even now will come with generic old sound effects that to anyone serious about the sim (I doubt many who play are not rail fans IRL) will always notice. For me, the brake squeal is the one that has always stood out for me, as you come to a halt the stock audio of a train stopping is (was) immersion killing. I've heard the sound in TV and film before so no doubt just pulled from a royalty free library in the early days. Forgivable back then but now in 2020 they could have at least chucked money to one of the 3rd party devs they work with to give up a new generic sound to replace it. Why haven't they?

The eco-system surrounding TS is what keeps it going, they cut corners because in reality, they can't justify to their paymasters that it's worth spending hours at a train depot with high-end recording equipment as Armstrong Powerhouse do in their amazing packs. Between them, Just Trains and a sub to Alan Thomson Sim they all come together to create a masterpiece that still stands above TSW2 and Trainz offerings. Not bad for it's age, shame the engine doesn't handle it that well though. Even high end systems struggle still, it can only be assumed when they created the game engine they didn't expect it to ever still be in use over a decade on.

So to sum it up, if you want a simple quick and cheap experience of train driving and don't care about hours of playing it or the detail and choice of the routes close to where you live offered by spending more on top then great, I encourage anyone to give it a go as it's surprisingly enjoyable to some who wouldn't expect it.

To those like me, it most likely requires no introduction anyway, if you haven't tried this yet for whatever reason and don't mind spending many hundreds on it to make it near perfect it will be worth it. Pick up contend in sales and it's not so bad. I've spent hundreds, more likely thousands over the years and I don't regret it at all. I want a train sim with all the sights and sounds that replicate the real thing, nothing else offers that chance so i'll pay for it!",1391089678,1607948015,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But it seems too easy to crash it, sometimes with out of memory errors (with 32Gb available) or 'Failed to create vertex..'. It then takes ages to restart when it does fail even with SSD drives. You have to remember to save often.
The UK semaphore signalling system is pretty unrealistic. It takes no account of a train's intended route or its direction of travel, whether actual or intended. On a bidirectional track, signals for the opposite direction to the train's travel will clear as it passes them which is horribly wrong, or signals at the exit of a siding can clear even when there is no train in the siding. If a train's orders have it terminating somewhere or changing direction there, the signals ahead will still clear even though it's not going intended to pass them. Much of the signal behaviour is inherent in the signalling system - it's basically just based on how the pointwork is set and whether the line ahead is clear. That much is reasonable but is not nearly enough to allow prototypical signalling to be simulated. All but the most basic scenarios require the tab key to be used at least once to get round problems with the signalling system. To be fair, many faults are down to the signal models and scripts supplied with a route,  Weardale and Teasdale, for example, which is a graphically excellent route, has several faults - distant arms clear even when the home (stop signal) on the same post is at danger and even two conflicting home signals on adjacent converging lines can be seen to clear at the same time. Some route creators have done some amazing work on signal scripts to try to make them realistic (e.g. Glorious Devon) but success is limited.
Overall, it's an excellent game but it needs a lot more work if it wants to be called a simulation rather than just a game.",1607649619,1607649619,False,2,0,0.517240047454833984,1,True,False,False

The routes that made the game fun originally are still fun, but a large number of the DLC that I have bought since acquiring the game has been sub par at best.
In fact my last purchase ""North London Network"" almost finished me with the game, broken scenarios, missing consists and appalling physics of the locos featured.
Verifying files, re-installing the game from scratch, neither made the slightest difference to issues experienced in the game or other routes.
My computer is capable of playing any route at maximum settings, yet the broken bits still remain, and that's the bottom line, the game has atrocious quality control, routes and locos etc are rushed out without seemingly the slightest care as to whether they are fit for purpose, and when one does complain, no solution or fix is forthcoming, it's all very much a case from DTG of, oh dear, how sad, never mind.
Some notable examples of shoddy build are as follows.
Northeast Corridor, bought in good faith, never worked and is full of missing speed signs, broken consists and scenarios that can't be finished due to AI issues.
Then there are the Chinese routes, they are to sum it up, dross and unplayable.
Again with many of the German routes, missing locos, speed signs, broken scenarios and random derailments.
At present there is no real competition to the DTG game and this has allowed DTG to release the most egregious dreck and ignore the moaning customers.

The game still has its virtues and if one is careful when buying routes and reads the reviews, you can be assured of some real fun; sadly the misery and disappointment of the purchase of a poorly made route can really knock the joy out of it.

In conclusion an 8/10 for play value and 3/10 for build quality.
I'm dubious about buying further routes just in case they're cack like the ones mentioned above, or as truly abysmal as Return To Maerdy or the Chinese high speed route.

It seemed so realistic and the sound design was great. People seemed to be enjoying it. So I said to myself, ""Fuck it."" and bought the game with several of the american steam loco dlc. I get into the game and find out the models are not very well designed, the sound design is terrible (A horn/whistle continues to play like 3-5 seconds after you release it, wtf?) Not to mention the lack of content in it. I bought the game about 9 years ago with ts12 and it came with more! I looked at the videos again to see what I am missing. It turns out they are playing with modded upgraded trains, I said, oh well and tried to install them to find out that they were for 2020. 2021 changed how audio files worked and thus these mods were unusable. 

Short story, I am getting my money back. What a rip-off for such an expensive game. Honestly is there really nobody who makes a quality train sim? TS here has went to shit, Trainz is way outdated, a lot of the smaller sims are not fleshed out. Derail Valley seems to be the one beacon of hope, but it still is in the early stages of work.

There are some things this game does very well. To this date, TS is the only game I ever played in which the bogies and wheels move and turn independently and the trains answer to the laws of physics in a realistic fashion. No damage models, but still, disregarding the signals and speed limitations does have consequences. The trains themselves are lovingly sculpted. Plus it's quite fun to drive a train, when it works like you intended.

Some things the makers/distributors could do better:
- Making sure all the needed assets are packed & tested for a release. My playthrough was plagued by missing assets disfiguring the landscapes I travelled through. This ranged anywhere from some missing overhead wire supports all the way to the entire New York station missing, leaving me to look at the underside of skyscrapers clipping through a lo-poly landscape. 
- When setting up a custom drive scenario, it would be helpful to have a map with the location names -- those location names only make sense for people who often travel there irl, anyone else has no idea what kind of journey they're planning. I often found myself sitting through those awful loading times for a trip of just a few km.
- The train selector, once filled with dlc, is extremely cluttered with different versions of the same loco or wagon scattered all over the place, thanks to the several naming conventions in use. It would be helpful if we could choose an engine or car type and [i]in a separate sub-menu[/i] select its proper version and skin.
- Some trains have special systems on board, but there's no way to learn about these in-game. You're supposed to memorize the controls for those from a pdf file buried amond the dlc files. Not my strong point, I'd rather they mapped those to the default TS functions as much as possible.
- Most importantly, this game is too outdated, especially its graphics, to still be costing this much. I already sank ~€168 in this game, so I'll only buy further addons if they become dirt cheap. And I mean that in the literal sense: cheap as dirt. For DLC to still cost €20 (or €8 at a generous discount) in 2020 is completely bonkers.",1603548480,1603548480,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's not the graphics or the amount of content or anything like that. It just seems to be overall from the game play to the physics and such. This game has been out for a very long time, giving small updates each year and letting you stay up to date with the current version (unlike another train simulator series).

I feel really weird saying this, but I honestly have more fun playing the train games on Roblox than I do with this. It's very hard to pinpoint why exactly, but I do know a couple of factors are in the UI and controls. The controls are starting to feel aged and sometimes the trains feel unresponsive. Simple controls don't work for every locomotive, which is a bit weird to be honest. I prefer playing with simple controls because I kind of just want to drive a train like it's a model train, but the simple controls feel restricted in some way and just don't feel like they're letting you drive the train the way you want. Passenger services tend to be difficult even on easy challenges because sometimes your train will just decide it doesn't want to go faster on this hill. Then using the brakes to stop at a station is all over the place as when you apply the brakes the train takes a moment to even respond and then it starts slowly applying the pressure of the brakes. I know for those that like realism this is perfectly fine, but for people like myself it seems we need even simpler controls.

The UI takes up way too much room on the screen. It could very easily be reorganized so you can see your train better, especially on wider screens. I can't get close to my locomotive without the bottom half of it being cut off by the UI, but I also can't be zoomed out too far or else my camera gets pushed around by objects and terrain, forcing me to constantly adjust the camera distance, which is *very* annoying with the camera controls being on the arrow keys. The camera distance is only affected there and not by the mouse wheel, which controls the FOV. 

It's just getting strange at this point that the AAA train simulation games have these things that just ruin the game for me, yet I can keep going back to indie and roblox train games even when they lack a lot of the features of the AAA games.",1382892183,1602539871,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With third party support, it provides for me, the best simulation experience currently available. There are other programs out there with better graphics but as simulators go this is number 1.
Pros:
Workshop support with a vast array of free software
Third party support that often provide superb products to support this game
Extensive routes that range from the steam era to modern day.
Graphics quality varies but can be made to come up to an adequate level, especially with the latest product releases and third part enhancement software.
An extensive route and scenario building tool. External programs make this even easier.
Very good simulator that receives annual updates so far.

Cons
There are simulators with better graphics out there but this game has to support products that cover a decade or so and so will always have limitations compared to a new game.
The list of products is extensive and but there is no real support as to what products are best for you, which means a lot of searching. Also be careful as products on steam may be available via a third party and there may well be differences between them.
The products available on Steam run from the good to the bad in quality.
Bugs - this game still has its fair share.
Slow load times
Frame rates cam drop very badly in places. This can be due to poor route/scenario design or simply a transition from one tile to another.
This game is a power hog and requires some knowledge of computers to set the program parameters up correctly. There is a lot of help on line though.
Expensive - Unless you are happy with the base program and free software, expect to sink additional funds into additional routes, scenarios, locos and enhancement programs.",1602538141,1602538141,True,0,0,0.474452555179595947,0,True,False,False

Times have changed though and in modern times I'm now able to play this game at high settings on a relatively standard laptop; 8th generation i5 and integrated Intel graphics. Technology has advanced quite a bit since this game came out and now most standard desktops and some more expensive standard laptops can play this game at comfortable graphics settings. Of course, a dedicated GPU would give you the best experience, but the price of such computers has recently increased quite a bit, and weren't affordable to begin with.

In terms of content, the 2013 version of the game happened to come with some of my local routes as standard (HS1), so I was happy for a while, but I quickly wanted to drive on more lines. Unfortunately, DLC for this game is quite expensive, although more recent DLC seems to be better value for money, and some older ones are going for less now. I've recently come back to this game because of the release of WCML South, which is one of my real-life favourite routes, not to mention the Pendolino is probably my favourite train of all time. For £25 it seems like a good deal considering you get 5 modern trains and over 100 miles of track; some DLC with less content goes for £30. TS is one of those games that has become much better to play later in it's lifespan than one that was at it's best in it's first few years.

Overall, in the modern day I'd recommend this game to any train nerd like me: It's easy to play yet has realistic challenges that mean you don't get bored, and a large library of DLC to choose from (although you need to be careful about spending all your life savings by accident). If playing with mouse and keyboard gets too disorganised for you, this game fully supports Xbox controllers (I use an older 360 one although I'm sure it supports Xbone too) which I find are a far better way to play the game than keyboard and mouse.

Dovetail Games' Train Simulator is one of the most well-known simulators of that kind. Despite this, the game engine is outdated, which results in poor graphics, bad gameplay and unrealistic physics.

I have played DLC that is phenomenal, but I've played DLC that is very lackluster (to say it nicely). I have enjoyed playing this game and I most likely will continue to do so, which is why I recommend this game.

I have had a great time playing this game, but some issues sometimes spoil what would be a best in class game- better environments and town/city areas, updated npc models, camera improvements and general graphics and sound improvements. To be honest, you shouldnt be noticing that stuff if your driving! Just sometimes takes a chink off the immersion. DLC's and additional routes/locos needs to be cheaper, unless some of the above gets addressed. If you wait for sales and buy various other routes and locos etc, the scope for this game is unlimited, i have had a real good time with this game, i would say its a 7/10 at present but still a must buy you like trains, just dont expect AAA graphics/shine but  expect plenty of trains and routes",1601286710,1601286710,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you want to build routes easily, I'd recommend Trainz.
I have spent over 30 hours trying to build basic routes, the controls/menus are extremely confusing and inefficient, each time there's a different problem that you cant find an answer to online, the game crashes losing all your progress, sometimes locomotives you place will turn invisible and become un-deletable, making your entire route useless because every time you try to use it theres an error that says ""invalid consist"" and forces you back into the editor, even though you cant interact with the ""invalid consist"". Connecting two different pieces of track is incredibly harder than it should be, sometimes turntables you place will become invisible and you have to restart the entire game. When most trains derail a message pops up instantly preventing you from seeing what happens or whats going to happen, if you want to turn that off you need to go into  every engine file and turn it off, it'll take hours to do. And i'll add that the DLC is pretty expensive so if you want to get good routes and engines you'll have to spend a lot of money, hell even on some routes if you wanna do a quick drive, you'll be unable to finish because an unchanable switch track is activated, or an AI train is blocking your path.

However, about the game updates, Dovetail is a total hypocritical. Why? Because if a person buys the game in the year of 2018, for example, they only will get the game content (trains, routes, scenarios) relative to that year. Knowing this game ""updates"" every year, for example: TS2018 - TS2019 - TS2020 - TS2021, the only thing that changes in the game is the name and banner, nothing else. If you think every year you will get an new update of routes, trains or scenarios, im sorry but you will not. 

Dovetail games uses a unusual tatic of marketing that I consider being hypocritical: they only change your game's banner and name. If you buy the game this year you will only get the content of this year. Next year, they will add new content that you will not be able to use without paying and worse, the name and banner of your game will still change to TS2022 and you will be using the same content as TS2021.

First of all you can't just slap a new number on your old games and claim that they are ""Newly released"" when they look and feel like something made a decade ago.  I understand business needs to release new products, but please try to do so in a non confusing way and make sure that if you release something as new that it is actually new - looks new, feels new, has new tech that wasn't possible before etc.  I.e. an improvement in ALL WAYS over the previous one.  Leave the old titles and DLCs as they are to be less confusing.

This game is not ""New"" nor is any of the over 600(!) addon packs which are all ludricrously expensive.  I would warn to stay away from any DTG products as they are all like this now, IDK who took over as their head of sales or product director but something changed a while back and they are just trying to money grab and be very confusing with their marketing strategies now.

I still have no idea what this game is, how I ended up with supposedly a ""newly released"" ""2021"" game in my library, how half the DLC says it was added in 2008 or 2013 etc.  I obviously played something in the past but now am so confused, it's even worse than when they updated Train Sim World to 2020 and messed around with all the DLCs that people had paid for, giving some for free and others not.

DTG are not getting any more of my money on any of their products until they pull the plug on this ridiculous business practice and release proper NEW titles, with proper game-engine updates and improvements worth paying for.  Why would I want to play a train sim game called ""2021"" with graphics and crap looking assets from 10 years ago that in total costs more than my rent for the month?

The first one is the graphics. Graphics are not that great this is due to of how big the game is It cover the whole almost world. Including Europe USA Parts for china/Asia However The devlopers were focusing on the Content more

Now if you have bad graphics on game menu click settings and select high 

The next one is, The DLC Price's 

Obviously my opnion is they need the money to keep the game up with aka Developers, Developing programs. And these sought of stuff

Lastly, The FPS. Fps sometimes drop this is due to the how big the map is, Well Sometimes it lag's due to a lag brick so if you face it. It lags.

YOU HAVE TO BUY EVERYTHING!
If you thought you can just get the game and feel like that's enough, then think again. After you have completed the scenarios that you get with the base game, it's really boring and you have no CHOICE but to buy the DLCs. Once you've finished playing THOSE DLCs, you feel like you have spent waay to much on a £25 game, so you turn to freeware 3rd party content. I was kinda surprised to find that there is a complete lack of freeware trains, so you have to find the routes that include the trains you already have. You find a route that looks quite promising, but after reading the readme file, you see that you require something like 5 EXTRA DLCs just for the AI, and there's no easy way of deleting that DLC content that you don't own in that route.

I've finally gotten the official raildriver software to work with the game which gives the controls such as the brakes, throttle and reverser to have way better calibrations so that's fun.

The routes can very on how good they are just depending on what you buy. Personally, I've bought mainly classic scenarios (classic being old TS20XX/Railworks, not classic as in 1966) and they're pretty fun and detailed so I can only assume some of the newer routes are the same if not better.

Optimization is pretty good, I'm playing with a MSI GeForce GTX 1660 Super, an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X with D.O.C.P enabled along with 16 GB of RAM, with the settings on a mix of High/Ultra, I get 80 FPS on average with dips to 50-60 depending on the location, route, and rail vehicles which is perfectly fine for probably everyone because you're not gonna really need 144 FPS at 1440p for a simulator.

I also have to say, they've continued this game for almost 2 decades probably and are still releasing content for it unlike some other games... so, if you want a train simulator, I'd say go for this one. It has literally THOUSANDS of dollars worth of content with possibly hundreds of routes, locomotives etc. If you got the money, the patience, and optionally a RailDriver (which I do recommend) then go for this. One of the best if not THE best train sim out there.

Also, if you want to know what a RailDriver is, either go to PI Engineering's website or look up videos. It's essentially a controller, for trains. It has a Reverser, Throttle, Train Brake, Independent Brake. A horn, Sander, Bell, Alerter buttons, headlight and wiper switched along with 28 assignable buttons, a D-Pad, a half D-Pad (don't know what it's called) and a LED thing for a speedometer. It's also got speakers!

Hell I even like the amount of DLC there is, so much content in a game is great, where you could potentially play for possibly thousands of hours and still have new content to experience. But the DLC is just so overpriced, and it's $60AU for stuff that looks like it should be more like $10. And on top of that, there seems to be very little difference between the 2014 version and this new 2020 version. I came into this game this year for the first time since 2014 expecting a bunch of new content, but the only new content seemed to be just more tutorial. And the game feels like it needs way more content in base game, like, 3 routes to play on doesn't seem like much. The old Trainz Simulator games from Auran I used to play felt like they came with more than what this does, but those games were generally worse than this in basically everything so not much competition there for me. Although I think what you get in 'base game' depends on what version you buy and when you brought it, since all of the base game content appears as DLC for me.

Don't even think about getting all of the DLC for this game. As much as it would be awesome to have all of it, the price for all of it is insane. I can make my own recording studio and record bands with professional level recordings and make money from it for less than all the DLC in this game. And to me that is just insane, that you can pursue a career such as that for less than it would to have all the content in this game. But perhaps it is better to think of the DLC here as like mods for Skyrim; it would be absurd to have every mod for that game even though most mods there are free. So of course, just get the stuff that you want. But even when getting the stuff you want, it's really overpriced, and there are things in there which cost lots of money which kinda look like they're free mods much more than paid DLC. Even with these DLC being overpriced and with me leaving a negative review, I am thinking of getting some anyway though, because I do want to get more out of this game. And that's the exact reason why having this DLC so expensive works isn't it (as well as this being a good simulator), people like me want to buy some anyway.

And also; the tutorial shows off that the game feels really realistic and has good sound design and has good quality, but then you drive outside of the tutorial and the quality of everything feels much lower. But that could just be because I'm playing content from 2014 and a tutorial which is possibly really up to date.

Other then that though, I do love this game. It's fun to play for me, in a way that I can't even explain. Driving virtual trains just feels cool. It's a type of game I loved when a kid, and I still seem to like now. I don't even mind too much that the game isn't as realistic as it could be.",1411476450,1595684043,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I'll add an explanation at the bottom of my review.

Well... This is actually an extremely fun game for someone who's a true nerd. If you're looking for jam-packed action, derailing box cars, explosions, and hijackings... Well, this ain't for you. If you're a fan of realistic sim games (especially public and commercial transportation), then this will be right up your alley. Beautiful scenery, detailed trains, incredible cab visuals (you can reach down and flip the switches, etc), great sound... Yeah, I really like this game.

It does irritate me a little that if I wanted the DLC, I'd basically have to spend 13 billion dollars. Just take a look at the list - there are countless routes and locomotives you can buy... for TONS of money. Yeah, I might buy some new routes and locos from time to time.. But I'd probably have to sell my house, cash in my 401k, empty my savings and investment accounts, and begin begging for change on the street to buy them all. It's a little absurd.

Also, the menus aren't that highly polished. It's weird. For a game with absolutely stunning visuals once you're driving, the menus look like some kind of Windows 95 reboot. That's not really a complaint... It's just weird.

The scoring system keeps things very challenging - you have to make sure you drive just right to get to your destinations on time, do everything right, etc - but don't go TOO fast, or you'll get fined for speeding! Oh, you've got to be pretty invested to get this done right... I've had it happen plenty of times where I was building up a very nice score, only to accidentally miss a lower speed zone, and boom - I've lost 100 points. And that's after like... 45 minutes of driving. (Yeah, these little runs can last a while - maybe 30 mins for a short one, over an hour for the longer ones.)

I also really enjoy the screen shots. In many of the sim games I play (like American Truck Simulator) I absolutely love taking pics of the stuff I'm driving against the background.. this one makes it pretty easy.

So yeah... If you're looking for tons of action, move along. If you really like a nice, relaxing, realistic sim... It might be worth cashing in on this one. (Although I'll be honest - I waited for it to go on sale. Having played it, though... I'd probably buy it full price.)

EDIT: Ok, so while I do really enjoy this game, as I buy content I'm realizing that what others are saying is a little bit true. I still GREATLY enjoy this game, don't get me wrong - very relaxing, very beautiful. However, there are some things that aren't 100% polished... For example, on some locos, when I honk the horn, I feel like I'm double-clicking TRAINHORN.WAV, if you know what I mean, lol.. Not entirely polished and smooth. Not a big deal to me. The one thing that DOES bug me, though, is the slightly buggy gameplay... So far, it's nothing I can't deal with, but there are certain scenarios where things happen in a slightly unfair manner, and I find myself having to ""remember"" these things in order to score well.

Example: Scoring is done based on how well you handle your driving. (For example, following signals/speed limits, smooth acceleration/deceleration, being on time, etc) In one scenario, I just have to 'remember' that certain things happen along the track that will dock me massive amounts of points if I don't remember those things. An example: I'm cruising along at a high speed, and see a 90MPH speed zone coming up. I begin to brake. However, if this was your first play-through, you wouldn't know that due to an upcoming track switch, you're actually going to switch to another track which has a 75MPH speed limit (rather than 90). So you're down to 90MPH when you need to be... switch tracks... and all of a sudden it's informing you that you're ""speeding,"" since you're now well above the 75MPH speed limit. The HUD should be able to see this upcoming track switch and 'know' that you'll need to be down to 75, not 90.

It gets frustrating when you don't just 'know' these things - you'll have been carefully driving for like 45 minutes, making sure to keep everything well in line, and all of a sudden you just lose 500 points for pretty much no reason, with 10 minutes left in your drive. You go ahead and finish out the scenario, just for the fun of it, but you're telling yourself, ""Ok, next time, even though it tells me to slow down to X speed, I know I'll actually have to slow down to Y speed instead.""

Bugs aside, I will still play this game, and I have purchased several routes and locos while they're on sale.",1592613692,1594812786,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the one thing i dont like is that this company seems to be some money grubbing freaks .
They are just milking every single DLC and charging as much as they for every other train and Rout.
this while so many other developers sell the base game and then Give people DLC for buying the game.
Maybe one expansion is cool but they are getting a little rediculous.,

So i would say just get the base game and play that.

What score would I give it? I'd personally say an 85 to an 87 out of 100. 

It works well within the constraints of its older engine and software limitations of its time while giving more sophisticated graphics and features you'd rather have in a modern simulator, all while giving you more creative freedom than many newer sims. 

If you're looking for a cheap train simulator that has the same amount of flexibility...I'd suggest OpenRails. It does most of the same things, except with a different coding language and some idiosyncracies carried over from MSTS. That being said, the price is my only major gripe about this game. However with what payware in general--or for that matter, model railroading costs these days (a half-decent HO setup costs as much as an Accucraft Ruby or a Plum Cove Boxcab these days! What is the world come to? I miss the days of Athearn Blue Boxes lining the hobby-shop shelves!) TS20xx is par for the course, only beat out by purchasing limited amounts of payware in MSTS / OR, going the all-freeware route with OpenBVE, and matched somewhat by Trainz's freeware / payware blend. 

Overall, the graphics are what you'd expect from an engine developed in the 2010s - pretty, but not Unreal. I've seen uglier (anyone else remember when cruciform trees were a thing?) so maybe I have more of an appreciation for the newer graphics. Support for normal mapping and advanced shaders also sets it apart as the most advanced of classic ""big four"" of simulators as well. 

The physics is close to the real thing, although steam and freight weren't exactly considerations in the model initially. This is where OpenRails runs circles around TS20xx with its meticulous steam physics and calculating slack and resistance over a long freight consist. Even then, some third-party developers like Smokebox have found ways to work around the quirks and there are freeware patches for many of the stock models. 

The vast majority of my hours are in the editor. It compares very well to actual CADD software, with the only exception being a lack a tool to create of spiral-equipped fillets without some kludging in the editor. This aside it's possible to make very detailed scenes and it has all the positives of both MSTS and Trainz, and improves on both some as well. The biggest plus is the precision of the editor, along with its WYSIWYG approach to configuring complex signal links. It also leverages its relatively modern game engine to provide more procedural functions from track to vegetation, which again is fairly advanced for the main four simulators. 

On a typical system these days, it doesn't break the memory bank. If you're running a basic laptop with an integrated GPU, this game could work at lower settings and by accepting a hit in framerate. For what it's worth, on both a typical PC and a middle-of-the-market laptop with an integrated GPU, the game still performs as well as OpenRails at the same overall settings. 

I haven't delved into the back end of the game, but at some point I'll have to because of my route-building endeavors. I can't speak as well to how to script or set up assets, but like MSTS, it seems daunting at first. Pretty much the only train simulator without a significant barrier to content creation these days is TRZ. I'll provide a follow-up to this review once I can speak to the complexity of it.",1594357361,1594357361,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

lets kick this review off with the most common complaint that i've noticed and that this game is very crashable and i can say for sure yeah it is very crashable but, I did able to decrease the amount of crashes with doing a lot of things to fix it or just driving the train a bit more carefully as i can (yes i am counting moving with doors open error that seems to happen randomly if your not careful to fix it).

1. with the game being very crashable you do have to use the steam verify a lot more then another games i've ever seen on steam as there is always 1 - 3 files that need fixing a lot but, I can play the game about 4-12 days before i have to do the steam verify to fix the game or to just keep it stable.

2. minimum memory i would say is wrong am using 4 GB but even tho i decressed the other crashes i used to get so much offen, I always still end up getting the out of memory crashs from time to time, I've tested over and over am not having any memory leaks or anything you should really play this game on 8 GB or higher, I sadly haven't been able to buy some more memory for my pc yet but, It's got to be better then what i've been playing the game on as I most likely get this out of memory crash once i've played an hour, so i only get an hour with this game before it may or may not crash on me what does get me angry when am near the end of a mission and it shuts down on me.

3. with so many DLCs for this game and very pricey, I mostly recommend you either use the in built store page in the game, even if its slow to go though like over 500 DLCs or still use the steam DLC page but, do not go to any filtters on the steam DLC page like the USA locos or other world routes why? cause if you filtter it on the steam DLC page about 35% of all the dlcs that should show, will not show for some reason idk why, but yeah when i stop going to the flitter i noticed some UK route DLCs that were not shown on the uk route filtter so yeah its best to go to the browes tab and just browers away at all the DLCs or like i said before the in game store page. I also really don't like the prices to these DLCs and with over 500 i feel the dev team are very greedy with they prices (estermated about £5000.00 to buy all the DLCs to this game if you was that mad) It should be way cheeper and i recommend you only get DLCs on sales rather then the full price if you can cause these prices are outrageous there are some that are pretty acceptable but, most are way over priced in my opinion.

4. building in this game hasn't changed much from the 2014 erea of this games history, what i feel really needs a upgrade in places and so its still hard to get the hang of building in this game, If you want to build you're own maps, Its best to watch SpacialKatana vidoes on it of the best tutorial videos on the game that i've found even if its 2014 footage like i said it hasn't changed much even the youtuber has made a playlist packed with his 2014 tutorials but, they is a thing that really puts me off from building my own lines in this game, Is there are some restrictions with building you're own station, I wanted to make a roof like the brighton station i got the walls up around the platform but, when i was trying to find roofs i found out i had no station roofs out of the DLCs i have as of right now, I still don't have any station roofs to use at all for builds you can't even use the brighton roof from the DLC  >:(  and i don't know what DLC that has some station roofs to use if there is any but yeah, you most likely be building open to the outside stations unless you're making underground stations or even tho i don't like to, you could use the pre built stations but they would have the station name on the signs and that most pre built stations you can't customise (pre built stations do not come with track they should do cause its pretty hard to get the track lined up on curved pre built stations) so yeah have that in mind if you plan to build you're own maps.

5. (the last point to make) you really got to like trains/driving them cause most of the missions are 50 mins - around hour and 15 mins just to finish one mission these are the 45-60 duration mission any above 70 duration i haven't played yet but, It will for sure take more then 50 mins - hour and 15 mins to finish them i've been very much put off by the 100-130 duration missions but, yeah there are low duration mission but not many, so you could play a short mission a bit but yeah, not much of many of them have a fast mission to do, in all the dlc i have, just don't have many low duration missions either so don't think when buying a dlc that they be many fast missions to do what i guess you could see that as a good thing when buying it. The duration rating isn't accurate for every mission so it may say it would take you a hour but it would really be around hour and 15 more minutes what feels like it just drags on and on sure not a high number but, when doing one mission for an hour and then have to go longer really does feel it drags on and on and to me gets a bit boring.

Thats it, If all of the points i pointed out seem alright to you then go ahead and buy the game if you wish cause it may have some flops but is still a pretty good train sim. :3",1594198603,1594198603,True,4,1,0.569791018962860107,0,True,False,False

Driving down from New Jersey to the Newark was very cool the first few times in the game.

However, the game would seem to run very poorly; I have a mid-range gaming PC, a GTX1060 6GB with 32GB Ram on an SSD, and the load times and FPS drops are really bad, sometimes going as low as 10FPS on medium settings, which it really shouldn't be considering I can run most games at around 40-50FPS on High, such as Dishonoured or even Doom. 

Dont just take my word for it, you can google ""TSW2020 Low FPS"" and you'll find dozens on dozens of threads about the issue dating back from 2017, youll find people with GTX 1080s getting 30FPS which is absurd.

The game itself has some content which is pretty engaging, however much of the content is locked behind a massive wall of DLC. You get about 9 trains and 4 routes, so if you're looking for a bit of fun on the side from another game or juts to start and see how you feel, its alright for that, but If you want more intensive hours, you're going to have to start to pay up for it.",1594167336,1594167529,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, many things need to be fixed. Overall, the game is reasonably priced and has good graphics.  But they, as I said earlier, need to fix somethings. Here is a list of things that, in my opinion, need to be fixed, should be added:

-Check old and future routes for floating/missing objects.
-Fix the numerous amount of bugs that many people have already alerted you to.
-Don't price your locomotives and routes too high.
-Don't sell routes or locomotives that aren't finished.
-Fix the career and standard scenarios that are broken.
-Add more standard scenarios. 
-Try to bring your future locomotives to life by allowing players to interact with most of the controls in a locomotive cab.
-Add more unique sound effects to locomotives that don't have any.
-Fix some of the scenery clipping into things/objects.
-Add a voting system that will allow players to vote, or suggest, the content they want to see in the future (Or just simply put in a polling place on your website).
-Fix lighting issues.
-Fix some of the audio issues related to locomotives.
- Expand upon your route varieties. We don't have enough good South African routes. We don't have a lot of Chinese and Japanese routes. We have no Australian, New Zealand, Russian, Italian, Brazilian, Chilean, or Egyptian routes. Allowing your players to purchase a wider variety of routes and locomotives, that are well made and for a reasonable price, will draw in more people. To me, it's a win-win for both DTG and the players.
- Add more LRV (light rail vehicles) routes.
- Add a cold start option to all locomotives.
- Improve train AI.
- Please don't add the same route twice but with a different locomotive, a few miles of extra track for $40, and expect players to buy it.

As a community, we want your game to achieve greatness. If the game is doing well, then chances are, the community will be thriving. It is incredibly important to listen to us, too. We are here for a reason, and, ignoring us won't help your game. Please, listen to our suggestions, fix the bugs, add more routes from around the world.

Some trains have unrealistic and poor quality sounds, braking and acceleration can sometimes feel too drastic and don`t expect to be able to interact with every button, switch and lever in the trains as most are there but are not simulated.

On the positive side, there is some nice third party and community created content (freeware and payware options) which can help improve/expand on the game developers content, with additional route scenarios, route improvements, train reskins and even some more advanced stuff like RW Enhancer, sky and weather improvement packs and all kinds of stuff. Even though this game has been around for a while it still has a decently active community and playerbase. Trains are visually overall realistic to their real life counterparts. I do enjoy playing some of the older released routes that I manage to run smoothly.

(If possible) it just would be great to see this game get some major tech upgrades and improvements and some more of the bugs fixed that do exist.

It’s just an ugly, outdated, clunky experience. Most of the content is locked behind expensive DLC. Nothing in the base game makes me feel any of the DLC would be worth the price, because if it is graphically on par with what’s in the base game, then it’s at least a few generations old. I’m talking the xbox 360 had better quality graphics than this thing. It’s almost insulting with how bad it is, considering they’re slapping a 2020 tag on this. 

I spent a little time in the editor, trying to build a layout. It’s really bad. The whole UI design and the experience of trying to use it, is not enjoyable. Navigating around feels clunky and awkward. You don’t really get a preview of the assets to be placed, just the names, so you don’t even really know what you’re looking at. I couldn’t get any sort of main menu to come up, and I’m not sure what was up with that. I had to alt-tab to windows and force quit it, to get out of the editor. I’m sure that’s not normal, but it does help illustrator the issues with the UI and usability. A number of the items I looked at in the editor looked like they did when those original games were released. 

The game as a whole feels like the developers were trying to Weekend at Bernie’s it with the corpse of those original game sims. This game isn’t alive. It’s not 2020. It’s a dead corpse that they’re trying to paint up as if it’s still something. 

I’ve been playing a little VR train sim called Derail Valley. Graphically, it isn’t that great, but where it lacks in the pretty pixels, it makes up for it with a solid and simple gaming experience. It really highlights to me how bad this simulator is, because this game attempts to pack in so much more, but at the end of the day it’s just not fun. It’s not an easy game to engage and get into. I can recognize the depth it might give to some hardcore train fans, but it shouldn’t be a chore to get there. I feel that the people that give a game like this a positive review, are just starved for something better. I guess when all you’ve got is a dirty glass of water, and a glass of human excrement, that dirty glass of water starts to look pretty nice.  

Train simulators are a bit of a niche product, but they don’t have to be this bad and clunky. There’s plenty of fun niche games that work exceptionally well, and as Derail Valley shows, even a train simulator can be enjoyable, as niche as it might be. 

The legacy of where this game came from was a great one, but nothing about it has advanced into the modern age.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT 21/6/15
It is absolutely the finest train sim out there, with high quality content and the work put in should be noted.
But I have rated this down because of the very high cost of add-ons and then the bugginess of those expensive add-ons. And the general crashing of the main program after a few senarios. Loading is very long, but I realise that the whole line is rendered to minimise loading whilst driving....but still make the game simpler to reduce loading, I think the balance between gaming experience and high end sim has been lost. I dread going into the game sometimes for this reason.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And if I'm paying £14-£25 for 1 DLC then it had better be working and frankly have sparks flying out of it's rear end to boot. I have purchased most of the DLC in sales, and even then felt the product was not worth even the sale price.

At the moment this has been an expensive error on my part, but I hope this will change.

BTW: my current 118 hours play, I can truthfully say that at least 30 of those hours was spent in loading screens or freezing in awful crash-hangs.....just sayin.

The best train sim, but it will frustrate you at every turn.

UPDATE 20/2/2016 
I thought I would give it one more go and tried a very simple passenger senario and the senario kept telling me I had not stopped at a particular station every time, no matter where I parked the train.

So I am uninstalling this massive waste of money.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT: June 2020
The application itself is now much more stable (64bit) and thus very playable.
But my thumbs down still stands as the DLC is still astronomical, full range comes in the range of £1500 which in a games setting is hilarious.
And by god surely they would sell so much more if they were half the price , and therefore promote the game and encourage new and varied content.",1419608469,1592936921,False,2,0,0.512195110321044922,0,True,False,False

EDIT:
Even with the steam summer sale, the DLC still costs about 3000$~, just for about 100+ trains.
EDIT 2: Also, when i had this, it was TS - 14, not 17.
Pros:
Neat-o map and trains
Realistic Controls
Okayish Graphics
Cons:
DLC in total costs around 5.9k/3k (mattering what DLC is lessened by, i.e Steam Summer Sale)
VERY laggy (even on a very powerful computer, i tend to get FPS drops, results may vary.)
Tends to crash
Constantly changes its title to look ""new""

I waited for a sale (which are quite frequent) and then suddently prices went down. For example I got the game plus a few other packs (featuring routes and trains) which add on to the main game for around £45 (originally it was about £100) so for anyone moaning about price just wait for a sale and buy it then.
The controls and sounds are realistic, the routes are pretty nice and as said realistic with lots of little and minor details added as you drive along. The steam engine controls are amazing, featuring various controls such as: injectors, sanders, blower and the coal shovelling to make it truly authentic, the diesels / electric locomotives are also a pleasure to drive.
The only thing that I would say is that it can take up a large chunk of storage space and it makes your battery life a bit poor, but nethertheless providing you keep the battery charger plugged in that isnt a problem.

I hope that this review has helped you, all I can say is buy the game because to me its pretty good.

This is an 11 year old game. The engine is about as efficient as an emaciated gerbil trying to pull the titanic into drydock. It runs like absolute garbage, choking any system you throw at it. You have various options for AA; FXAA FXAA MSAA FXAA SSXA to round the list about 10 deep. problem is, none of it really works worth a damn. The highest setting somewhat tames the game artifacts down, but at the cost of burning up a supercomputer in the process. So you have to scale it down and just live with it.

Graphics artifacts are galore. Flickering textures, fuzzies, shimmering, pulsating objects are the norm. They typically change with the position of the sun so it goes from epilepsy inducing madness to just annoying madness. 

The bloom is completely broken, requiring another program to buy to tame it down. whatever, just another 25$ into the pot!

The scenery rendering is what really murders this graphically. Anything further than say 300 meters becomes 1 huge single poly blob. Mountains are just blurs with color swirl. Awesome! 

Map errors are constant. Random vegetation on the tracks is normal, confused switches, wrong singnals, indusi/aws systems that do their own....  and that's with the good DLCs mind you. 

Train systems are basically non existent. Few 3rd party locos have some working screen buttons that show some info but most of it is just a blank textures starring you in the face screaming YOU WISH YOU COULD PRESS ME DONT YOU!!! Between engine limitations to code and laziness of developers, you get no systems at all! And what you get, acts as realistic as carmageddon's physics.

Onto the actual physics.. oof. Bad. Very bad. No track joins, no  track vibration except for the random slamming into some select curves (i consider it a bug as you have to overspeed to trigger it), there is nothing. The tracks are lazer etched and the rolling stock follows it with equal precision. There is no suspension at all. 0. 

Sounds are bad. Worse inside than outside.. Complete lack of immersion. Most is just random terrible loops that stutter or have unwanted noise in them. Again terrible from the inside, a little less so from the outside. 

The routes are short. Somebody said the absolute maximum hard limit is 400km, but that doesn't factor in complexity. In reality, you are looking at 120km sections AT MOST. Annoying because all the content is just little snipplets from here to there. Nothing is actually complete... Thats due to the editor being absolute horror to work with and the game engine just not liking complexity and size in general. 

Nothing is done to this game.. nothing is fixed. Each year it is rebranded as a new date and up it goes again. After all, if the name suddenly changed to train simulator 2009, would you buy it in 2020? Doubt it.",1591342912,1591342945,False,86,21,0.81417161226272583,1,True,False,False

If you want a more realistic approach to a train sim, go and buy run8 Train simulator, you will get more realism out of it then you will get on this game, on the other hand, you get more beautiful scenery in this game then you get in Run8. Dont expect to buy this game and think ""Oh im going to play the most realistic train simulator in the world"" no, you get something pretty lack luster in my opinion. On a good note though there are some good mods for this game Ex: Searchlight simulations content. They make some pretty good locos and rolling stock that fill that realism gap. If you decide to get their (IMO) Best product the AC4400CW (Which I Believe is coming to steam soon at the time of writing this) you get some pretty good damn simulations with that loco, if you get that loco expect some pretty awesome detailed runs with the loco. Though is not made by DTG(the creators of TS2020) Which shows that they need to up their game. Apart from that you can get some pretty damn good looking routes Ex: Canadian mountain passes, Steven's pass (I dont have it because its US only which is pretty sad(On bnsf's end of course its not DTG's Fault)) And a lot more.

-It has real routes from around the globe
-There are a lot of sales 
-Most of the trains are very detailed and have good sounds
-its easy to install mods
-its easy to drive the most trains

This is not good:

-The routes are expensive (30 euro per route WTF)
-Slooooow FPS: on big routes the game even crashes 
-Graphics are not really good, if you want good graphics and real simulation, then buy TSW
-Dovetail doesnt listen to the community what they want: people want routes from around the globe, and dovetail almost only makes routes from Germany, UK and USA. and thats BORING. we want something else once CMON

PS there are only 3 Japanese routes and that a bit shocking, because Japan has the best railway system of the world!

That said, if trains are your thing, it's very enjoyable if a little clunky at times. I have a pretty decent setup and it still flickers and judders at times. but not too much to ruin it.

My biggest issue by far is if something does go wrong, you're very reliant on the forum to sort it out (they're a very helpful bunch) as the company is very slow to respond to issues and not greatly helpful especially as you're likely to spending quite a bit of money on this in the long term.

And don't get too used to the DLC you buy functioning (especially DLC routes). If a change they make breaks it... it won't be fixed unless you go in there and fuck around in the editor long enough to figure out what you need to do to fix it.

edit: after another 2 years of development the game is still full of gamebreaking bugs. The game crashes randomly when i try to minimize it. Locos stop working when i try to detach them.

But don't but it. This game has been nickel and diming its way for about 5 years now. I know the DLC price has become a meme around video game circles but it is  a blight to anyone who plays this game. Oh whats that, you want to play on this route, well you better be willing to pay $40 BLOODY DOLLARS to play a map, that at best, has one or two issues in its route layout or scenarios. At worst, you will get a terrible route that is rivaled by the spin-offs of roblox or the old routes of TRAINZ 2006. That isnt even getting into all of the other knick knacks that you need to buy to get the full experience of a map. You will get stuck in an endless loop of buying a route, not having everything you need, paying up to $100 for everything only for the whole experience to be a buggy mess. This game desperately needs a new engine. If it isnt crashing the second I close the tab or try to get onto another bloody mission, the game chugs like the steam locomotives they sell for $20 a pop. Thats not even getting into the missions that dont work. I imagine the same people who play test these routes and give it the go ahead are the same people who kept shooting eachother in TF2's MVM play testing. If you have the money and willingness to pay hundreds of dollars in this game, go right ahead. I wont stop you. But if your strapped for cash, DONT BUY THIS GAME. I recommend the Trainz series.

Since then it has been tweaked and upgraded to what it is today. It is a simulator and if shoot-em-ups or racing games are your thing you will tire of it very quickly.
For those of us that love railways it is a superb simulator and with such a vast range of DLC available, whatever period, country or traction types you are interested in, there will be content that appeals to you.

Those who complain that it would cost far too much to buy all the add ons are missing the point. You only buy the stuff that interests you and in terms of pounds spent per hours of play, the game offers fantastic value. 

There is also a vast range of freeware out there and since the game comes bundled with a full set of developement tools you should never run out of stuff to do.

Although it requires a reasonably high specification PC to run at its best, the age of the core game means that even those with a less than state of the art games machine will still be able to run it.

If you like trains and simulators, then I cannot recommend this game enough.

Its very disappointing that no real progress forward has been made with TS. On top of this, it crashes often and your really limited to what locos you can put into a scenario. The bigger the route, the more assets used the less locos your able to put into a scenario before it crashes. The DLC is hit and miss, with the sounds and physics been awful 9 times out of 10. Routes are decent as well, again hit and miss. For example, DLC from third party is in a different league for both sounds and physics and they price them according whereas DTG just have a set price.

So apart from that, I will keep playing until another good train sim comes out. However, I may switch to a Plane sim and give DT games a year to figure their schhhhtuff out.... You know like Summer.

It does. Kind of. Enough to keep suckering me in, and enough that I bought a few scenario packs in addition to the base game.

But here's the bottom line: to quote, ""It is buggier than a big bug, bugging out in a dune buggy."" There are scenarios that straight up crash to desktop. There are steam locomotives that randomly game over the scenario because they ""ran out of water"" (no it didn't. It had 1000 gallons in the tender and 76% water in the boiler). The GP38-2 brakes like it's connected to 20,000 cars. There are scenarios you can't complete because one of the instructions is the opposite of what you're supposed to do (load cars at an unloading station). There are scenarios you complete perfectly fine but then the game doesn't check off that you did it because of an error box that appears for 2 milliseconds and then disappears. The workshop module spams errors if you don't have all the necessary DLC installed, and the only way to get error boxes to stop popping up is to quit and restart. 
There are oodles of complaints in the forums. Every complaint I've listed has been noted before, years ago, and have still not been fixed. In particular, the Norfolk Southern GP38 having terrible brakes has been an issue since TS2018, and that specific scenario pack was included in TS2020 as a showcase. Why was that a good idea? Dovetail has acknowledged a few of them, but nothing seems to be done about the bugs; people seem more occupied on making more content for it instead of refining what it has.

Oh, and the graphics chug like a cottage cheese margarita. I've got a GTX1080, and it drops frames constantly, as bad as 4 FPS. 

In brief: This game has potential. It could be fun. But it needs to work. And I really really recommend spending your money somewhere else, because it doesn't look like the developer is interested in repairing their experience.",1587228005,1587228005,False,23,6,0.686073958873748779,0,True,False,False

Dovetail continually put out new content which sounds pretty alright. But over $8000 in first and second-party dlc for a game that feels like it is held together by a metaphorical shoelace is really sad to see. 

The game runs like garbage on anything less that a supercomputer and crashes more than a drunk child driving a car. 12 YEARS! and the most beneficial update to the games stability came out in 2018 in the form of the 64 bit update, which quite frankly seems to be just a placebo and a terrible one at that since the game crashes the same amount as the 32 bit version if not more. I constantly get errors related to not having enough memory despite having 16Gbs of RAM and 6Gbs of VRAM, and heaven forbid you alt+tab in fullscreen without saving your progress. The optimisation is just terrible and this game gets ONE update a year, too change the name of it (this has been the same game since 2009). The problem is only going to get worse from here unfortunately, with devs like Bossman Games putting out ultra high detail models becoming more common. 

If you asked me, i say that dovetail should drop everything and just work on making the base game experience itself better, because at this point they are riding the coattails of third-party content creators that actually make the game bearable to play. I hate to rip on something that has brought me endless joy but someone at dovetail needs to get their priorities straight before this game goes to far under.

Bottom line, do i like this game: yes, yes i do.

Would i recommend it to other railfans: yes, but only because there is no other alternative.

Should you even get it: only if you have cash to spare. everything is crazy expensive but thats understandable for reasons i wont go into here. i get the most joy out of third-party content where i know my money is going to help make their next release even better.

Unfortunately I get too many frustrating bugs. For DLC that has been around for years and has had lots of time for the designers to kill the bugs, they're still there. Like cockroaches running around when you don't fumigate your apartment.
Examples are derailments out of the blue and for no known reason. Another is the emergency brakes coming on suddenly, as if lightning has struck (although I've figured out finally how to start the train again). This is probably the most annoying glitch.
I would definitely recommend the game but I wish they would get rid of the bugs.

I am not going to review any DLC here because I tried to do that separately. Each DLC is unique and deserves a unique review. The only one thing I can actually say is how I feel about the game itself so here you go. 

Well, it is expensive, but I can accept that. What I can't accept is a buggy content (bad timing in scenarios, random car decoupling, passengers on platforms walking through your train, etc.), frequent crashes and literally no hope for fix. Dovetail is already working on new game (TSW) and as what I understood, they kinda never fixed something old, they only add new content (with no improvement). The combination of unfinished work and extreme pricing is just awful. 
If you are more a railfan than a gamer, try the game when it is discounted, make your oppinion and probably take a look on TSW (Train Sim World 2020), because it is simply recent...

Not because of the DLC policy, as i think everyone who buys this knows the pricing - you would have to be an idiot to not see that. My thoughts are, if you are really into trains, then sure, why not by as much DLC as you like. If you don't like the DLC policy or its pricing, don't buy it. Seriously, it's not hard.

However, what is not absolutely clear when you buy this is that for a game which is marketed ""2020"" version, the engine is unbelievably dated and poorly optimised. The graphics (dx9) are pretty crappy, and, frankly, embarassing to look at in the year 2020. Not to mention the UI that has sections/tabs that simply don't show or do anything? If you click on those tabs it crashes the game. What is that?!

The loading stutter and wildly fluctuating framerates are very annoying and immersion breaking (e.g. I go from 120FPS down to 30FPS, and back again in the space of 5-10 sec). The anti-aliasing is utter garbage and grinds even my i7 7700k/RTX2080 down to sub 40 fps. NPC's just float around or disappear off the platforms. It's just so half-arsed.

The tutorials (the ""academy"") is pretty basic and lame, and it even has obvious spelling errors. It's like the developers seriously don't give a rat's knob as to what they re-label and churn out every year.

Going back to Euro Truck Sim 2/American Truck Sim - just think people, imagine how awesome a train simulator would be from SCS (the developers of ETS2/ATS) and then compare it to this cranked out trash?

Could you imagine what SCS could achieve compared to Dovetail's lame excuse for a simualator?",1582198123,1582198123,False,4,1,0.52800828218460083,0,True,False,False

If there was the option to remain neutral, I would opt for that rating but as there isn't I will choose a 52% recommendation. Here is my reasoning:

Positive aspects:

1. It's fun and there are enough trains/routes on the basic game to keep you going for a few hours (or more).

2. Scenarios are often enjoyable and you'll quickly see that driving a train is more involved than just going forward.

3. The academy guides you through the train operartion, signalling, coupling and other basics you'll need to understand before completing a scenario with full points and no penalties.

4. Passenger trains and cargo trains are included yet each requires a different appoach when driving. 

5. You can drive, steam, diesel and electric trains covering different periods of time, routes and within many countries.

6. There is also the option to simply do 'Rail Fan' mode where you can observe trains passing and take pictures/screen shots, for those that enjoy that part more. Not my cup of tea though.


Negative aspects:

1. Some of the official scenarios that come with the game are bugged where you'll be penalised for speeding when even though the current line shows a higher speed. ie: on one scenario it showed a 50 speed limit but going over 30 got you penalised.

2. Occasionally you'll get an annoying siren in your cab that can't be disabled unless you save the scenario, close it down then select resume to clear it.

3. There is an insane amout of DLC's for this game which will set you back over £6500 if you wanted them all. Many simply are overpriced for what they offer imo.

4. The steam workshop offers a lot of extra content but be aware most will require certain purchased DLC which adds to your costs too.

It's you choice, like it or leave it. It would be good if the developers sorted out some of the issues and stopped focussing on releasing more expensive DLC just to line their pockets. As for better train simulators, I can't say as this is the only one I have played so far.

[2020 notes...]
So i'm editing this because Dovetail like to slap a new label on this every few years, but trust me, it is not worth a new label.
All the existing issues with no changes (again) that i can perceive.
Snow inside tunnels..???  Models with holes in them.
People walk off the platform across the tracks seemingly hovering mid air.
People spawning and de-spawning on platforms.
Signals that are missing theirs posts or supports that just float mid air.
Holes in scenery.
Nothing has really changed, same garbage from a lazy garbage developer.
[end of 2020 notes]


You’d think in 2019 and after the failure of Flight Sim World that dovetail might have learned a few lessons.
I’ll cut to the chase, here are the issues.

[*]Long loading times on fast storage & hardware.
[*]Slow and clunky menu
[*]No direct input joystick support (this is insane!)
[*]Uses TrackIR (head tracking) with no option to disable it.
[*]Incredibly clunky controls for keyboard & mouse.
[*]Graphics and visuals look > 10 years old.
[*]Boring and repetitive scenery.
[*]Extremely poorly animated people.
[*]Cars go through train crossings regardless of train crossing.
[*]Essentially looks like the previous version with a new title.
[*]Massive DLC fest, one of the worst in the industry.

From launch to jumping into the cab the load time is far to long for a mid-high spec PC with NVME SSD storage.

The big 'Fisher-Price' menus are poorly laid out and you end up clicking in all different places of the screen to get around.

I have a perfectly fine Throttle quadrant here (Thrustmaster Warthog) with 2 nice big levers and a smaller one that I’d love to map as throttle, bake and reverser, alas as with several previous versions there is not even the most rudimentary generic support for Direct Input devices.
I suspect this is to sell more of the proprietary controllers.
Problem is, as many flight sim enthusiasts custom build panels and sim pits, without direct input rail enthusiasts cannot do the same.
I’m aware there is or was some obscure, unsupported 3rd party mod that was just about impossible for me to track down and get working, to don’t comment on that.

A moment of delight when without configuration Track IR worked was ruined by not finding a way to disable it. It’s all good and well to be able to look around, but when you want to just sit in the cab and do your job without having to hold your head in a rigid position it’s annoying.

The keyboard and mouse controls are disgusting, really, they are.
No ability to fine set throttle and brakes, levers snap at certain almost random percentages.
The ability to use a scroll wheel on the levers would be greatly appreciated.
Playing this sim with a keyboard and mouse is so exhausting and cumbersome it’s insane.

The models of the engines are acceptable, but the repeated cars with the same textures over and over looks bland, would be good to see mild variation in the wear and paintwork on them, after all there isn’t a massive variety of things to simulate in a train, and the train might as well look as good as it can.
As for the surrounding environment there is a great deal of room for improvement.
Automobiles should probably stop at a train crossing… Just saying…
Animations and variety of models are extremely limited and basic in all things.
These badly need work.

Looks, feels and plays like previous versions with no changes that i can perceive.

The breadth and width of payware DLC for this is astonishing, and disgusting.
Take a moment to remember Dovetail acquired some kind of rights to develop Microsoft Flight Simulator X code into what they were going to call Flight Sim World, and essentially limiting the 3rd party addons to have to be bough/sold through their own store. Flight sim enthusiests won't put up with this and voted with their feet, and FSW died a death that could have been avoided with a different attitude.

There isn’t really any anything good to say.

However TS has the most routes and rolling stock out of any other Train Simulator and that is why I recommend it.

The evolution to this game is Train Sim World which has stunning graphic quality, is much more comprehensive with more driver duties and you are in first person and in ultimate control.

Main advice: as a new player, browse DLC a bit, then jump to the forums, introduce yourself and ask for suggestions.

The positives:
- Fantastic variety of route types and trains. Flatlands and mountains, deserts and grasslands to lush forests, mainline rush and branchline servicing, fast to slow, steam to electric. Overwhelming focus on countries with a fair market potential. Don't buy it all, you need eternal life to play it first.
- Ranging from casual content to Pro-labeled content where you have to learn startup sequences, manage many handles, particularly steam locos.
- Ranging from simple graphics adequate for weaker computers to rather nice, but demanding ones. (If you want nigh-realism, move over to Train Sim World or very recent Trainz.)
- Since the 64 bit upgrade the game is fairly stable, hence the recent positive review trend.

Workshop is a mixed bag, it can extend your game with further scenarios and routes, but often at the expense of a purchase spiral (due to lack of filters). In which case you have enough content and don't need workshop.

There are issues with the game:
- Maintenance is minimal, even for game breaking issues. Sad when it breaks things that did work.
- Almost all DLC has some kind of issue: some are visual, but a set of US rail cars tends to disconnect and fail scenarios all too frequently. Timetables are often often impossible to meet so don't stress about it.
- Workshop tends to break the game, and the menus get slow as you add DLC (TS 2019 was good).",1470601238,1581253222,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There are a wide variety of locomotives and routes (Steam, Diesel, Electric, UK, Germany, Japan, US, etc.) to choose from, ranging from all periods of locomotive history (late 19th Century to 20th Century Steam, early to modern diesel, and electric). However, these are NOT FREE. You have to buy every locomotive and route save for the very few that you get with the base game. There are over 500-some DLCs in the game currently, and the total amount for that is over $5000, with each DLC costing anywhere from $15-50 (essentially the price of a game on Steam), so let that sink in before you go dipping into your wallet. 

You can kill some time and get screenshots in the ""Quick Drive"" menu, and carry out objective-based runs down the line in the ""Career"" menu. You can also build your own railroads too, which is neat. 

If there's one issue I have with the game though, it is the lack of training that the tutorial gives you, and how the game hands out penalties. The tutorials are too short, and somewhat vague in certain scenarios, such as the stopping at stations and unloading/loading passengers tutorials. I was doing a run on the Chatham line where I had to take the Class 375 at night to pick up passengers, and each time I stopped and opened the doors and then departed not long after, I'd get an error message saying that I didn't give passengers time to align and load up, and that I should refer to said tutorials, which had me do THE EXACT SAME THING THAT I ALREADY DID. I have also been penalized a number of times for not acting on the conductor's alarm fast enough, triggering emergency brakes and making me late. 

TL;DR It's a decent game if you ignore the massive price tags, semi-poor graphics, lack of helpful info in tutorials and multiple penalties. I wouldn't make it a game that someone could play for 4-6 hours though, I'd get bored after a while.",1581039475,1581039475,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the best trains in my opinion in this sim are the ones with the one lever for throttle and brake. and i find it such a dissapointment that ts2020 doesn't support anything like hotas throttles and anything analog. 
not even a key rebind option. 
there's 3rd party software ofcourse but some are old, or you need half a degree in computer programming to make it work.
so you end up using the ui and i find just keeping to the speed limit like that is like trying to thread a needle with a numb hand.
hell, they made it track ir compatible so why not some basic controller support.
and then theres the near 1400 euro's worth of dlc.. don't get me started on that..
it's basicly all expensive, so the best you can do is hope it is on sale or, and this is the best tip i can give you, go for the dlc that does not mention the line ""requires <dlc name> as seperate purchase"" this will mean you will only have to buy that pack and it will probably only set you back 30 euro's as the ""requires <dlc name> as seperate purchase"" line will swiftly increase that amount .
i get the feeling that dovetail made the base game and is now more like a publisher for dlc made by other companies and that results in a sort of mixed bag. i have a few scenarios on routes that have massive bugs, z-fighting scenery and assets that blink in and out of sight.

You know, I'll forgive quite a lot in order to get good gameplay.  I'm used to buggy games from small dev teams.  I don't expect something like this to run like a Triple-A title.  But Train Simulator has opened up vast new uncharted horizons of mediocrity.

By rights this game should operate something like Digital Combat Simulator - an old free-to-play platform that's continually updated by a small team and populated with a quality mix of expensive 1st- and 3rd-party content.  Except the TS platform seems to get about 1/10th of the updating that DCS does, so the old platform just keeps getting older.  And TS isn't free-to-play, so Dovetail ought to have more resources at their disposal.  While Train Sim does have a lot more trains than DCS has planes, the quality and especially depth of most is comical in comparison.  I even get the same frame rates in both, which is outrageous given how much worse Train Sim looks.

But I'm okay with all of that.  I will deal with the 2008 graphics and the cost and the terrible performance, as long as I just get to have the experience of driving a big steam engine over the rails.  Well, after about 3 days of VERY buggy gameplay (frequent crashes, missing ground textures on all routes, etc), this game just decided not to load at all.  Freezes stone dead the second I go to launch any scenario or quick drive or free roam, or try to edit any of the above.  Basically anything besides menus.  I've spent more time now troubleshooting why it won't play, than I have actually playing.  I've re-installed it a couple times, as well as trying a bunch of potential fixes from the hoards of other people who have fought this game, and so far nothing.  Now, when/if I do get this going again, we're already at the point where it's been unacceptably unreliable.

The saddest part is that this hot mess is still the best train sim option around.  MSTS and Trainz belong in a museum between a stegosaurus skeleton and a paleolithic flint arrowhead.  TSW looks excellent graphically but has all the content and depth of your average preschool swing set.  So if you REALLY want to drive some trains and it's not one of the few in TSW, be prepared to fight tooth and nail to get this thing to work.  When it works it's legitimately really fun.  But man is it a struggle.  Consider volunteering for a vintage rail preservation group if there's one in your area - maintaining a real steam engine is probably easier than maintaining this game.

EDIT:  Dovetail's support team did manage to resolve my issue (the freezing and the missing textures).  The game was being a princess because Windows was not updated to the newest version (even though I did update it before contacting support, thanks Microsoft).  They were able to figure this out and fix the issue very quickly, and I have no complaints about their support; they greatly exceeded my expectations.  That said, this was still the only game that was sensitive about it, and everything else I've said about the old platform and poor performance and high cost remains.

I added a couple of add-ons to get things that were relevent to me (i.e. London & UK), but in reality you get a lot less than they make it seem as the listed DLC is misleading. It seems a bit buggy (recent example a train stops taking power with no obvious reason why, and no help from the game) especially as for me the sound often doesn't work. Additionally, there don't seem to be many scenarios at all (forcing you to buy more DLC to expand).

The worst thing about it? The academy. Instead of giving a proper tutorial such as a 10 min, start/stop, forwards/backwards, load/unload, it is all separate 5 min scenarios. So you sit and wait while it loads, to move a train about 1 mile forward and stop it (not even in a particular place, so get used to missing stations at first) - then close and load the next scenario to do the exact same but with a different train.

Maybe it's a good game when it gets going.

Unfortunately, I've spent over  a $100 in DLC that enhanced the game and did make it enjoyable. It was fun. And then 2020 released and the game has been a total piece of sh*t ever since. The game crashes within minutes of opening the menu interface with the same error: ""Out of Memory, try 64 bit... blah blah blah"". I've only ever run 64 bit, because I haven't had a 32 bit system since Windows XP was mainstream. And I know it's not my system; this same system ran the 2019 edition without these ""Out of Memory"" errors, though unstable and somewhat playable. Running i7 6700K, 16 GB RAM, Nvidia GTX 680. What gives? 

UPDATE: 1/19/20 - Since Steam as asked me to add/revise my review...
The game is now completely unstable. Was it an update? No idea. I've run this game on multiple high end computers, with the same result. Same thing no matter what. I open the game, it runs for approx 30 seconds, doesn't matter what I'm doing, and then it will crash in one of three ways: 
1). with an ""Out of Memory"" error, which is nonsense
2). Complete and total lockup of the computer, forcing a manual reset
3). With a generic Windows prompt saying the program is not responding. 

UPDATE: 1/25/20 - Persistence pays off. After troubleshooting my graphics settings, PC settings, and finally this game's settings, I've concluded the problem was hidden in the Workshop  Scenarios that game lets you subscribe to. The game will crash if there is something wrong with a Workshop Scenario, ie something did not download correctly or an item supporting the scenario is missing, or the scenario is old and the recent updates of this game no longer support certain aspects of said scenario. The corruption will crash the game, but the only error that comes up is the  dreaded ""Out of Memory"" error, which ironically, has nothing to do with the cause of the crash, but is the best error the game can come up with to tell you there is something wrong. 
At least for me, the proper fix is to unsubscribe to all Workshop Scenarios, use the NameMyRoute.exe tool to clear anything that has missing links, and then re-subscribe to selected Workshop Scenarios one at a time and see how the game reacts. I found that one of my favorite scenarios was killing my game and was the cause of all the instability if I managed to get past the menu screens. Too bad too, because it was a fun scenario. I got this solution from the community forums. It works and the game is fun again!
Big thanks to ""stevenridpath"", post #69 of the ""Out of Memory Crash"" thread: https://steamcommunity.com/app/24010/discussions/3/1629663905414589274/?ctp=5 in the Steam Forums for pointing this out. Good job man!

This game is now enjoyable. Tune the settings of your graphics card to get out some aliasing of the graphics and the trains look great. I will even so far to to say the crash I experienced is not the fault of the TS2020 or even the TS2019 version. It is more the fault of progress. Meaning, as the game matures, certain aspects are enhanced, modified or removed. Some of these aspects may have been integral to the Workshop Scenarios created years ago and that when these aspects are different, the game's current version cannot support that scenario. I no longer blame Dovetail for this, as they are not in control of third party creators who have the utmost intent of expanding the enjoyment of this simulator. It's not a perfect setup as time points out. 
Perhaps one way to fix this is to subscribe a favorite scenario and clone it using the Build function of the game. This should update the scenario to current aspects for the game to support. I'll experiment with this and give an update later.",1574015310,1579986740,True,0,0,0.502169191837310791,0,True,False,False

I even had a model railway once. The problem with a model railway is although they are great fun to build and collect, in this day and age the space for a decent layout is nigh impossible and you don't get the thrill of going anywhere with a model railway either. Now you can, with Train Simulator!
You get the privilege of sitting in the cab or footplate and drive some of your favourite locomotives or Multiple Unit trains. You can travel from city to city on an express or take charge of a local branch line train through the countryside. Whatever you choose, you have to follow the rules of the line, obeying speed restrictions, signals and other hazards such as coping with poor weather conditions and gradients. In some respects this will be the closest many people will come to driving a real train. This simulator doesn't disappoint, it taught me some of the disciplines of the real railway, and fired my imagination to go on to drive a real heritage train.
You can purchase some really excellent traction from all eras in time and even drive trains and travel routes that no longer exist.  Some of the add-on routes will be very familiar to some people and you really feel that you are travelling from place to place.

I also know it was in the bargin bin for a couple bucks, but uno, I think the fact the game wouldn't let me play with it at all, or pretended that I didn't have it, I think you can humor me Jay, and be a good sport about that. I don't have to make noise about it, but the more that are aware of this, will only make your problems stack higher like compound interest.

I have a 2019 computer that had the latest graphics card, the best fiber internet service, and suddenly my system doesn't operate correctly.

My external disc drive will randomly auto-play the holiday songs of three wise men I've had in there since Christmas; Frankie, Deano, & Sammy. . . . I am not bothered by my high sense of good taste, it's the feeling that it never played whenever it felt like it. I am running virus scan as I write this review, a mild suggestion.

I can only imagine a little kid that enjoys trains, seeing this sale festival of trains getting excited they could even afford to now play the core game. I would like to show the 72 minutes of footage from the player.me recordings I had when I timed this game review, they are fragmented from the frequent fatal errors, crashes, and restarts. I have a youtube channel of the same name that I post reviews pretty much of games that I LIKE. So no, even if I could get it to upload, it would not be a positive review, it would be highlighting what I've been telegraphing to the audience. At least with Lionel's, ""Double Crossing"", you had fun as a family with a product that was true to it's word, as being of the Snydley Whiplash aura of...""anti-villain""? At least he makes the opera cape look good, possibly a misunderstood character that needs his own movie, about being unfairly chased by the ruthless authorities of Canada; I digress. 

 No kid should feel perplexed, or feel cheated from not being to be able to play with a toy train.

$10, $20, you can start collecting simple freight cars, many new and in the box off eBay. Maybe $25 to $50 for an engine that runs well and has been tested. I mentioned to someone else as a joke that instead of taking out a second mortgage to collect every DLC, I spent $40 for an orange and White 8030 Illinois Central. Is it a line I know anything about? No, but I liked the train and got a promised delivery of goods. You have kids? They will remember a physical toy train and the time they spent with you more than whatever this is.

There, I wore my heart on my sleeve, yet it would be more fitting if I collected the Seaboard line...",1578819920,1578819920,False,8,2,0.549488067626953125,0,True,False,False

Turning the graphics up tends to result in Out of Memory errors, which I find hard to believe with 6GB 1660TI and 16GB of RAM (whichever memory it's complaining about, I've got lots!).  The good news is the game doesn't look much different on Medium settings anyways.

As for the game, it has crashes sometimes, bugs with the camera at times, and failing to complete scenarios if you Resume from a save which definitely removes any usefulness of having a save.  Some locos have ungodly squeals to them that kill the ears.  Everything is over priced so wait for a sale.  Also, when buying DLC make sure to READ ALL THE WORDS because most DLC requires separate DLC to work.  If had some content that didn't work for years until I bought an add-on route associated with it.  Lesson learned.

So, that's a whole bunch of complaining but why do I still recommend the game?  Well, when you buy your favorite content, and the game is running properly, it's a nice relaxing train game.  I personally find the Free Roam to be a bit boring but for some reason having scenarios makes the game a lot more interesting to me.  I definitely don't think this game is for everyone, sometimes when I'm on a long stretch of track and I have nothing to do but watch wheels go around, I begin to question how I got here, but other times I'm just relaxed and having a great time watching Steam engines come back to life.

I'm not really a train geek, just never lost my childhood interest in the heavy engineering, noise, and complexity of them. Having gotten a bit bored of the excellent Euro Truck Simulator, I thought I'd finally give it a go when it came on sale. I'm comfortable with DLC, as it means I could just concentrate on the bits that interest me - specifically my train commute for 20 years from Brighton to London Bridge. 

However, 27 hours and *some* content later, I'm not a happy customer. 

Cons:
- The engine is old... very old. My PC will happily run anything you care to mention at max settings with plenty of room to spare. TS2020 is 32-bit and looks like it only supports single core - runs okay, until you get speed/weather/scenery happening simultaneously, then we get lag. I could forgive this if it were a visual feast but...
- PS2 level graphics. Some of the DLC is nicely rendered, but the overall graphics level is very poor - you can count the pixels on some of it. External scenery is low quality and repetitive
- Bugs. There's hundreds of them. Some of it silly like DRA functioning when it feels like it, some of it completely game breaking (currently, Workshop crashes the game if you've got any scenarios in it, which don't work anyway)
- Poor Sound Quality. Some locos sound great, others sound terrible. Trackside and atmospheric sounds also vary wildly. 
- DLC (apparently) can't be stitched together. Example, buy London-Brighton, add South London and Bedford-St Pancras... which gives you the pieces to create the Thameslink service from Brighton to Bedford. Except you can't... or least I've not found out how to do it. No scenario editor (unless someone points it out to me, which is arguably even worse if it is there and I have to go hunting for it)

I could go on and on. so let's just move on to the Pros;

- Quite cheap in Steam Xmas Sale
- DLC for most things you could ever want (the complaint about DLC costing thousands is a moot point - just buy what you're interested in). That said, if I wanted to make TS2020 UK edition with all the British lines and trains, it would end up being expensive. Something made worse by the apparently inability to connect the DLC into one seamless map.

That's literally it. 

It's not complete rubbish, but it is old, buggy, poorly optimised, and not worth the money even in the Sale.

If you want to haul transport around, go get Euro Truck Simulator 2. It's everything TS2020 could have been..,

I won't complain about the price of buying every DLC as it could be said of any simulator game. You need only buy those you are interested in, and every other week there's a great selection on sale so you can expand your selection for not a huge outlay.

By far, the worst criticism I have though, is the performance. 
Marketed as TS2020, it would be more accurate to call it TS2004, because that would better describe the graphical fidelity of most of the routes and trains available. While the textures for the train cabs and exteriors isn't horrible, it looks like they were plastered over models created 10 years ago, and just lacks the kind of fidelity or depth you'd expect from a game released in 2015, never mind one claimed to be up to expected standards in 2020, and that's not to mention the front facing sprites used for almost every piece of background scenery, the ugly and blurry buildings, and the passengers? Don't even get me started...
Despite looking at least a decade old though, it will still run like ass, no matter how powerful your PC. I have a 390X and a Ryzen5 1600 and even with details reduced somewhat to make it more playable, I will still get FPS drops from 70~80, to 15~20, for seconds at a time.

(that all cost extra) That being said, Dovetail consistently implement insane and unjustified designs and restrictions that just prove to frustrate the player. The controls are set. You can not reconfigure them. At all. It is undoubtedly my biggest complaint about the game but I could go on. Driver aids are over sized / designed with constantly changing scales of distance (depending how fast you're travelling), you can not customize them or make them smaller or crop out all the useless information you don't need. The game is poorly optimised, my old rig struggled with a GTX 650 my new rig has no problems but might wanna think twice if you're buying the game for a kid to use on a more basic family computer. What really makes me angry is Microsoft Train Simulator (about 20 years old) had NONE of these problems. Dovetail bought the franchise from Microsoft reversed the default throttle up and down buttons and then decided not to let the player ever remap them. They've had YEARS to implement this very basic feature and haven't, they just churn out a steady stream of expensive DLC. The DLC quality varies massively. Just Trains develop the best ones IMO, dovetail inhouse content you never know if you're going to get a real labour of love or a rushed out weekend project. For all my many (many) complaints, there is no other game that simulates such a wide variety of the worlds railroads at such high levels of realism (on most routes, there are some truly shockingly terrible routes) if you've got a decent gaming rig and want to have a go driving a train, I have to recommend this game if only for lack of alternatives.

Here are some Pros and Cons because i'm too lazy to go into detail.

Pros:
LOTS of content, 7,000$ worth of content
Graphics are decent
Reflections and shadows look great.
Many different reigons and countries to drive in.
Trains are detailed and look good.
Fun and Addicting

Now for the Cons
Game Crashes a LOT even with the 64 bit launcher
Certain Weather settings on certain routes crash the game
Some routes are buggy
Trains fly up in the air if you crash sometimes
Sounds for most locomotives are TERRIBLE (UP challenger,Dash 9,Big Boy)
Rolling stock  sounds are pretty bad  but there are exceptions (NS coal district, Sherman hill)
Editor is hard to use and more than likely will require you to google how to use it

That concludes my review of railworks. Overall i'd give it a 6/10. That sounds bad but for a game like this that is buggy and has many quirks. It's fun and addicting and a relaxing game.",1494031311,1576423489,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The poor optimization of this game also curses this game, most times not allowing the user to minimize the game while playing otherwise it will lock up the entire computer and force you to restart it. I run a Ryzen 5 2600 3.4 Ghz CPU, 2 x 8 GB Kingston Hyper X Fury DDR4 RAM (16 GB total) running at 2666 Mhz, Gigabyte B450M Gaming Motherboard, Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050Ti 4 GB GPU, EVGA SuperNova 750W PSU 80+ Gold, and 2 x 480 GB Kingston A400 SSD's. 

To put that into perspective I can play Halo Reach in maximum graphics at 70 FPS while streaming, or Grand Theft Auto V on maximum graphics at 70 FPS while streaming. So the reason this happens is unclear, but I put it down to poor optimization, I've had this game since 2017 and nothing really changes except the title and the amount of DLC just increases meaning by the time you read this the total price for all DLC content probably ranges around $8,000 USD. 

It is a very expensive game to play, and doesn't really deliver much quality for the price you end up paying for it in the long run, so I would advise you and all others to not buy this game and instead purchase their more recent game Train Sim World which is far better than this scrap heap and probably runs a lot smoother as well.",1514338196,1576420542,False,0,0,0,5,True,False,False

Manuals are normally available for each download and are generally good and informative.

I don't know if it's just a coincidence, but every time I try to pick this game up, it's buggy as shit. It crashes, it freezes, it prints debug errors to background info boxes which blocks all mouse inputs.

For a game that has hundreds of dollars of DLC you want to encourage people to play, it sure does push me away every time I concider it because I can't get through the ****ing first 5 minutes of gameplay. 

I'll update this review the next time I decide to scratch my train driving itch (you know, assuming it's not buggy as shit then too)

So Update: I really want to like this game. But even when I get it to run for any period of time (which I can now... so improvements!), I might spend an hour meticulously running a 100+ car train through the mountains, only to have it suddenly unhook the last 4 cars.

I've also experienced a number of game stopping bugs which have still yet to be addressed. The developer does not seem to be have much energy or enthusiasm to address these.  

In terms of value for money this game is incredibly poor. The locomotives and routes are overpriced and lacking in quality. In order to prolong your experience in TS 2020 you are expected to by add-on's which start getting pricey. 
The locomotives themselves have only got basic features modelled most of the time (wipers, horn, headlights, Instrument lights etc). If you're looking for more advanced features like cold start ups or programming GSMR devices you have to start looking into third party add-ons. (again, you'll be spending more money)

The game engine is old like it still runs on 32bit tho you can run it on 64bits

The graphics are also very poor well if your not running at all max but even then they could still use an update and what i've found works the best to fix this is RWenhancer (https://www.rwcentral.com/store/product/4-rw-enhancer/) it gives you a lot options in terms of graphics so thats always good but it does cost 9.99€

*Update* 11/27/19
I find that the game is getting only slightly better due to the release of a ton of third party content.  This is most likely that DTG does not intend to allocate as many resources to the product as in years past with TSW now picking up steam (without any steam).  Only get it when it is on sale and same thing goes with the DLC.  I often will purchase third party releases through their own sites and if it is an exclusive to Steam or the DTG store, I will buy at full price.  Otherwise, I will wait until 50% off or greater for the product anymore as DTG releases often would only pass a QC in 2012 in terms of quality and accuracy.",1510861927,1574882104,False,3,0,0.543323397636413574,0,True,False,False

I initially bought it because I played a train simulator years back and thought it must be good by todays standards... boy was I wrong.
There are a lot of tutorials which is good and necessary to handle the trains correctly, however using the knowledge in the first session was horrible. Stopping at the correct position to open the doors to let passengers in seemed to hit a specific point. On the first stop I had to go back and forth just a few meters to check if I'm in the correct spot. After adjusting it like 6 times I eventually hit an ""Game Over Error"" noting that the train moved while the doors were open... let me tell you THE DOORS WERE NOT OPEN. At least not visually. There was no feedback why the doors won't open and in this moment visually there were not open.

So to sum it up, if you hit a tiny mistake you will get hit by a ""Game Over Error"" which throws you back to the main menu. Worth mentioning that the loading screen takes longer than taking a dump, so if you make a minor mistake and get thrown back to the main menu - have fun loading the game again.

If you just compare these aspects with the price they want it's just horrible. I'm never ever going to try a train simulator again.",1574595976,1574595976,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Back when I first got the game I had trouble with one of the levels. As I played I got further and further behind schedule. Finally I restarted the level (AN OFFICIAL LEVEL) floored the pedal so to speak, (This causes you to get major speed penalties) and noticed that I still got further and further behind schedule.

I posted a comment on steam to see if anyone else had this problem and even got in touch with the developers of the game. Players took screen shots, posted the problem and it seemed like they where going to look into it. Several months go by, and no response from the developers on this issue. The players however found out the problem was it was a passenger train level with a passenger time frame but with freight train speed restrictions.

The PLAYERS have posted ways to fix it and made patches that make it possible however this prevents it from counting as the mission, (no trophies, completion, etc.) I have found out that many of the OFFICIAL routes you can buy have issues like this. (They must not test them?)

Fast forward to 2019, six years later, and it still has not been fixed. To make matters worse I have noticed even more bugs now than I did back then. For example, you have a button you need to press in order to confirm messages like speed changes or if your inactive too long. Problem is this doesn't always light up or make any noise to alert you and will randomly apply emergency brakes.

The track switch levers sometimes are invisible making it hard to change lanes in freight yards.

These issues make it hard to enjoy the game. It's been 6 years and I have logged 51 hours in that time. Considering the levels I play last 1 to 3.5 hours that's not alot. For comparison, I bought a new game last week, and already logged 44 hours in it.

Long story short, the developers rush half baked and untested levels out to make money. They don't fix there bugs, or do any customer support. Every year they claim they are giving you a free upgrade to the latest game witch I can't tell the difference from the game I got 6 years ago. No free DLC for being a loyal customer for so long. Not easy trying to make your own levels or routes. $100 gets you the base game and 3 routes, 1 of witch is bugged and impossible to beat (get Gold, or Silver star on)

I tend to play a few hours every year or so in hopes that they finally fixed the bugs with the content I paid over 100 dollars to play. This game could be fun if you got rid of the bugs.

1. If you want to drive trains, and don't care about completing any missions, then you might enjoy this game

2. If you don't care about collecting all DLC ($10,000+) or getting all the trophies, then you might enjoy this game

3. If you don't care about bugs that make the game hard to play, (They will NEVER be fixed) this game you may like

Otherwise, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!

I'd only recommend this game if my package cost ($20 not $100) and the DLC only cost ($5 not $20)

Even then, I would expect the levels I buy to actually work.",1574049443,1574049443,False,16,2,0.628726422786712646,0,True,False,False

I got this game (my first on Steam actually) back when it was Railworks 3: Train Simulator 2012. This game was amazing back then. It was the best Train Simulator out there at the time and I absolutely enjoyed the heck out of it (hence the 300 hours in the game). Then as time went on, I got a few DLC's (Northeast Corridor and Donner Pass were by far my favorites) and kept on playing it for a good while. Then 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and now 2020 and it just seems the same. The same trains, the same physics, the same overpriced DLC. Just. the. same. I wish there was a little change. I got super excited the first time I saw the number go up from 2012 to 2013. Now its just a new realization of extra DLC they want you to buy. Don't get me wrong, the game is O.K at best and is fantastic if your a kid who loves trains but if you've grown up like me, you just want to see some change in this beautiful game. Dovetail has provided some great memories for me and I just wanted to see something new. Hope this review helps some people :)

However, there are 2 reasons why I cannot recommend this game: Bugs and Value for Money

Every single time I start the game I have to delete cache files or it will freeze, and heaven forbid you want to tab out while playing because that crashes the game too. Even just accessing the workshop in game often freezes the whole PC. On top of all of that, 99% of the crashes cause the whole system to freeze, making it impossible to access Task Manager or close the application, the only way to un freeze my PC is to sign out from Windows altogether.

Support from Dovetail is minimal at best and nonexistent at worst, which considering the amount of money I have put into the game is a real slap in the face. Bugs that have been known and identified for years still remain unfixed, and since Dovetail have replaced the game with Train Sim World it's highly unlikely they ever will be.

All of that wouldn't be so bad if the game and its DLC weren't so unreasonably expensive for what you get. Routes that cost £25 will offer you perhaps 10-15 hours of playtime, obviously depending on the specific route, but the overwhelming majority of them will disappoint you if you were expecting £25 worth of content. The cheaper routes unfortunately aren't much better as the graphics and details are very dated and lacking most of the interactive features of newer more expensive routes.

One of the features intended to extend the gameplay hours of the content you own is the Steam Workshop. There are some very well put together scenarios that can help the DLC not go stale so fast, however the vast majority of them require you to have many different DLCs in your library, and if you don't have one of them, the whole scenario won't work. This means you will have to spend even more money buying DLC you didn't even want just to play anything other than the default scenarios. This presents a significant barrier to entry for anyone wanting to use the Workshop, expect to be required to buy 2 or even sometimes more full price routes as well as 3 or more extra locomotives (priced anywhere from £5 to £15 each) for the most popular scenarios. Even finding scenarios can be a challenge as the filtering system is not operational (the drop down menu has a graphical glitch) and the search bar will return ""no results found"" unless you know what you're looking for, as well as the fact that unless the publisher lists it, there is no way to see the required DLC for each workshop scenario before downloading it, meaning you end up downloading and deleting a lot of scenarios before you find one you can actually play.

So in summary, the game so has many issues that make it difficult to play, even for the most dedicated enthusiast. The only way I could ever recommend this steaming pile to you is if you are: technically savvy enough to fix broken games yourself, have heaps of cash and nothing better to do with it, and love trains enough to go through the most infuriating process just to play the game. If any one of those things doesn't apply to you, save your money and time for a better, less broken game",1573148329,1573148329,False,16,3,0.60681527853012085,0,True,False,False

    Right off the bat, the game is great; a wonderful feeling of the weight behind you, sunlight flickering through the shadows inside the cab, and great scenery at somewhat reasonable graphics delivery.

    The whole shebang is not unlike how Microsoft Train Simulator used to feel. Cycling through the views feels right at home and then some, along with a great majority of locomotives' physics. There exists a varied and plentiful selection of routes and locomotives from many points on the globe. No one route is outlandishly difficult from one another...so far. Which is nice.

[i]The only gripes (2) I've continuously had:[/i]
○ The sounds on many addon locos flat out suck or at least snuff out the immersion in the game. On some tracks, the sounds are fantastic, but for the price of some of these routes I would expect the included rolling stock to have its own distinct sound set.
○ Not a huge deal. When running with multiple monitors, the game has thrown an empty error message and crashed after alt-tabbing out of the program. Again, not really a big deal! It's probably just my VRAM running dry.

It's far from straight forwards and really is a skill developed over many, many hours. Some of the 'Workshop' content is mind blowing and there are many individuals out there investing their own time for no other reason than bringing joy and happiness to complete strangers with their own work.

Yes there are similarities around the world, fine, and I think we understand that. However there are many differences that can cause one to lose appreciable time trying to research online and decrease the fun of the simulation. True in both the track side signaling and also signaling is some more modern locomotives.

One can go on line to look up signaling for specific railroads world wide and that can be time consuming. It also will lead to less enjoyment in the game and in the end loosing customers. Steam and Dovetail are in the business of making money, not loosing customers. This true of those coding the Apps as a business and those who love railroading.
 
The folks developing the simulations/apps already know know what the signaling is because they display it to me the user and expect the appropriate actions to be taken. Merit for the right actions and demerit for inappropriate actions and sometime game over.
 
Can not the developers provide signaling information with the simulation/app? That could lead to a data base that could be available to TS Community thus making the experience better.

Now if this info already exists then I have not looked in the right place withing Steam or Dovetail (my bad).
Maybe that I can be directed to correct place.

I only ""took what I needed"" from the laughably overpriced DLCs and used them ad nauseum. Then I came for others, and absolutely could not justify spending what they were asking for even just one route or locomotive pack, even on sale. If you enjoy choice and variety in your simulation programs, you will get bored very fast playing this. If, however, you enjoy using the same stuff over and over and don't mind paying out the nose for mediocre pieces of digital content to be used in a program that hasn't changed in years, have at it.

The ""take what you need"" defense is 100% laughable, and does not need to argued by anyone anymore unless you just enjoy embarrassing yourself. If the DLCs were a few dollars a piece, I could maybe get on board with it. But when one route costs as much as or more than the base game itself, that makes this whole scheme absolutely impossible to defend. I am simply astonished that anyone would pay upwards of $40 or more for one route or one locomotive pack. I don't care if that's all you plan on using, you are a 100% bona-fide FOOL if you allow yourself to be swindled into putting that kind of money into this simulator. The Dovetail execs are lounging on a beach chair in Cancun sipping an overpriced pina colada at your expense right now, snickering at how easily duped you are. Stop defending this scheme, seriously. This is NOT HO-scale model railroading. For the love of god, stop pretending it is, and stop acting like having some ""hobbyist"" mentality somehow makes submitting to this scheme a smart idea.

Furthermore, this simulator has not changed in years. The functionality, graphics, and features are all the same with minimal to no improvement. I won't get into specifics- you can find those in a bunch of reviews- but I think it's pretty telling that Dovetail continues to rebrand this program every year without changing it.

Bottom line: the criticisms are legit, the defenders are wrong, and unless you have some kind of fetish for highway robbery, look elsewhere. It's pretty telling that the top review on here makes the same pathetic ""take-what-you-need"" argument but the reviewer disabled comments; I certainly would not want to have to defend that position.",1513925285,1572124226,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I started from scratch strictly with EU & UK lines only. Fail and error was the name of the day. All the way I have been impressed with the realism and details of the lines. There are some faults, but I am not sure who to blame? In the back of my head is the ghost of the sloppiness of the game creators. Anyway there are 2 mischiefs, in UK lines the borderline of a speed restriction (points) are often moved forward. Also in many games the platforms and likewise it out of sync with the HUD. In German lines it is unmarked not always apprehensive speedrestictions. Cost a bundle in XP. As a game creator I could think out some less childish challenges, ie your stopping line at the platforms, signals etc.
The biggest flaw of TS is the game quality. It is a paradox that there are some brilliant games - especially with freight trains, and then it is a downhill avalanche to amateurism - and often games that are not quality controlled. Too many mistakes. Rock bottom of lack of creativity is a HST timetable for a DMU, or timetables that are totally unrealistic.
And now to the kill of a product. DVG service/support is non existant. Waste of time. I purchased a line after I had purchased the needed locos. The games can not upload. I have 30 other games on different lines with the same problem. I do not bother to try DVG again.
Nevertheless I had a lot of fun and challenges even though that TS (DVG) is an overpriced third class product.
I will end with an oddity, my score: Level 86  - 561,520 XP - 559 gold - 18 silver and 9 bronce. If you make a mental calculation, f.ex. 560 x 1,000, then you do not have to be a math genius something is wrong. The explanation is simple: Some lines/games do not credit the won XP to your total. Only the medal. How much is the game worth then?

ALOT more expensive as well. I've played it, the trains are much better but it's basically the same exact thing but with a few more stations.

Quality varies alot so just check the reviews and maybe look up a video or 2 so you know what you're in for. Some are good while others are pure ass as if someone dragged their shit stained asshole over their keyboard and called it content.

The sounds are decent depending on the train, I never really cared much for sound mods until I started playing American freight routes. Personally, I think they're unplayable without them since it seems that American freight trains have literally no soundproofing in their cabins so you just get earraped the whole journey. The SD40 is the worst at this in my opinion as it's ridiculously loud inside and out, the engine sounds don't even vary, sounds as if you left a truck in idle and just made it 1000% more obnoxious and loud.

If you're voting thumbs-down just for that, then you don't know how to write a review. These reviews are supposed to be about the game itself, not what you personally think of their marketing techniques. I don't need a review on Dovetails' business practices, thank you very much. I'm buying a game, not stocks and bonds.

Having said that, do not let the huge amount of DLCs dissuade you from buying this game. Of course, if you're into high-action, explosion-a-minute, twitch games, then give this game a pass. You won't like it. This is a game of laid-back relaxation, a game for those who are train hobbyists or simply for people who like to get away from fighting bad guys all the time. It's not for everyone and if it's not for you, then you should stop giving the game a thumbs-down just because it isn't your cup of tea. Not every game on steam has to cater to your specific wishes, ya know?

As for the DLCs - no one expects you to buy every last one of them. This isn't like most games where you strive to get all the expansions and add-ons. If you approach the DLCs with that kind of mentality then, yeah, one might be inclined to whine and moan. But rail enthusiasts often know about the different routes, the different trains, the different eras - and they pick the DLCs that they like best. 

If the base game included ALL of those DLCs, it would be prohibitively expensive. Instead, Dovetail, broke the game up into a bunch of DLCs so it could be affordable for most people. Complaining about the DLCs is like complaining because the game has *too* much variety and diversity, *too* many choices. Complaining about the DLCs is basically saying, ""The game should ONLY have as many routes as can be stuffed into the base game and perhaps a couple of $10 expansions and half a dozen $5 DLCs, but NO MORE!""  Why should anyone deny the massive amount of choice and customization this game offers? Are you just greedy and upset that you can't buy ALL the DLCs? 

Now ... I will admit that some of the DLCs are rather pricey and expensive. Do I like that? No, of course not. But they're expensive because you actually have people in the field surveying the routes, other people designing and creating trains and their characteristics, still others are building thousands of graphic models for the scenery, and still more are dealing with the game mechanics itself. This kind of game is NOT cheap to make - this isn't some slap-together game where everything is approximated rather than made as real as the game can make it. Yes, I wish I had the money to buy all the DLCs, but I will have to content myself with buying just a few - and a few more here and there when money allows.

As for myself, I'm glad there are a lot of DLCs because that means there will almost always be a new route to explore, a new little journey to undertake. As I said, if you're not into games like this, to each his own, but to bash the game for its DLCs is really the wrong attitude to have. My only gripe is that some of them are rather expensive - but - wait for a sale. Simple as that.

Are there some bugs? Sure - here and there. I've not encountered anything game-breaking. And by all means, show me a game that doesn't have bugs even years after its initial release and I'll show you some beach-front property in Kansas you might like to buy. In addition, the base game should come with more routes - that I will admit - but even that isn't enough for me to give the game a thumbs-down. I've read some of the reviews here that talk about this game as if it is a buggy piece of trash, some impromptu game with bad mechanics, bad AI, bad graphics, blah blah. 

All of that is false. Yes, it is slightly - slightly, mind you - aged. But so what. If a game like this, which has to load textures and graphics quickly, had 2019 photo-realistic graphics, only the very best and most powerful rigs could even run it. 

As others have said, if you like trains - even if your interest is rather casual - and if you enjoy a game now and then where you're not always saving the word and being attacked by something every time you move, I'd recommend this to anyone of like mind. Ignore the mouth-foaming negative reviews that are mostly about the DLCs than the game itself.

The only other piece of advice I would give to anyone considering this game is to read carefully the DLC description or anything you might download from the workshop - make sure you own any necessary DLCs before hitting that purchase button. Otherwise you might end up buying and/or downloading something you can't use. Yep, I'm speaking from experience here.

So, without further ado, allow me to extend a welcome to the rails for those first-time buyers who decided to take the plunge.",1569691106,1569691106,True,9,1,0.487889736890792847,0,True,False,False

Even now I am taking a break from sketching up another draft of a HO scale container and iron ore layout. But this game…it has major problems that will never be addressed sadly. For one, the prices are absolutely absurd. There is no reason for the DLC to be as priced as it is. Shure maps can be big an expansive but there is nothing in them. Detail is very low and I am no even going to start on the absurdly low-resolution textures. IF Train Simulator wants to tout itself as being 2020, then it needs to go back and fix the established problems. First of all, Old DLC is just that, old. It needs a graphical overhaul if it wants to be on par with later stuff. Some maps do not have a free roam option for some entirely unknown reason. Not there are larger completely unaddressed problems in specific maps. The “Ohio Steel 2” rout add on, (what happened to 1 by the way?) consistently has structures, track, and bridges missing, graphically bugged, or plastered with the wrong textures. “Corris Railway” Rout also has this to a lesser extent. “Doncaster Works” is an actual nightmare. Turntables not working, freight cars sailing off into the sky on a tap, objective related wagons being completely intangible so you drove right through them, and the trains rocketing off into the stratosphere if they tap buffers. Speaking or turntables, could you PLEASE fix your game so if I rotate one, it does not make the load on it sometimes just fall over because a 200 ton diesel should not just fall over because of slow rotation. Some trains like the “OBB 4023 ‘Talent’” have no simple controls like everything else and must be run realistically.

I bought this when it was on offer a few years back. It had, like it does now, various DLC included (Hitachi high speed train, test track etc in my case) whch was fun. Imagine my surprise when it upgraded to next release and all the extra bits that came with the game disappeared from the choices available. 

Yup! When it upgrades to the new version (which it will automatically unless you tell it not to), you lose access to those extra trains/tracks your version came with. They're still installed (you can see them in the ""DLC"" section of your library) but you can't use them. And, of course, you can't install the old version to get your content back either.

Similarly, you don't get the new DLC which are listed on the store page for the new version (e.g. the SNCF train in the 2017 version). After the first year, you're left with nothing but the base game and content, and no alternative but to buy DLC again if you want to have the same trains/tracks that you purchased the game with.

Another niggle is that you can only use specific trains on each route so if you want to drive a diesel on the Dorset line, or a freight train on the West Coast line from Paddington to Oxford, you're out of luck. Same track guage, no go on the driving.

The interface isn't great when choosing a train/route combo either. When I was doing a free drive, I managed to confuse the system so much that I couldn't get the list to show all the trains again so I had to restart the game completely.

Other bugs I've found include (but are not limited to):
- Showing trains that, by all accounts are installed, but choosing one of them selects a different train (Big Boy 2-10-0 selected a German train)
- Being able to choose a train and route which you haven't actually purchased but still allowing you to drive the route in the train, but with no scenery (Chatham to Victoria with the HST give you invisible tracks, no grass/bridges/signals etc)

The only improvement I've found in the 2017 release is a major improvement in loading times. I don't now have a chance to make a cup of coffee

This game is listed in the 2017 Guinness Book of Gaming Records as having the most expensive DLC (if you buy all of it). It's already out of date - it's listed as only having about £1300 worth. It's over £3000 now!

To sum up, if you want to simulate driving a train, visit your local model store and start splashing the cash there. At least that way you won't lose stuff that you've paid for when you buy a new train. Alternatively, become a member of your local heritage train line and go down that route - you'll get more satisfaction from it

[list]
[*] Maintaining two games in parallel (Train Sim World) doesn’t make sense. DLC is not compatible between them
[*] Class 20 re-released more than once
[*] Class 66 re-released more than once
[*] Class 158 re-released more than once
[*] Class 390 re-released more than once
[*] Whenever these re-releases occur, they make old DLC redundant, including all scenarios that include them
[*] Routes routinely re-released as ‘bigger, improved’, but require full price payment. They effectively make previous purchases redundant. This could easily be avoided with incremental\subsidised discounts for existing DLC owners
[*]  Little investment in graphics engine since release over 10 years ago (lighting within tunnels, assets ‘floating’ off the ground etc) – The developer answer will be to switch to Train Sim World, which would wipe out any existing investment in DLC
[*]  Asks if you’d like to play the recently added 64-bit version every time it starts up. It’s 2019.

To be honest, I am not overly interested in trains and see them merely as a way to get form A to B. However, I was won over by the attention to detail in the scenery and wanted to give it a go.
Overall, I am doing much better than I thought I would; mostly, for me, though, it is enjoying looking at the scenery that makes it an interesting game. Based on this alone, I would give it a thumbs up.
However, there are two glaring problems I am facing; one of these issues I will guess is down to my lack of knowledge regarding trains; the other definitely is not.
Firstly, I seem to be having issues with speeding despite scrupulous attention to the limits - even to the point of being a bit overly-cautious. My issue is when a speed limit is imposed without it showing on my information overview in front of me. For example, I was moving down from 100 KPH to 60 KPH which was the next indicated speed limit. I was well within limits and was going to comfortably be below 60 KPH by the time the limit became valid. Then, without any notice, or any indication, the limit changes to 50 KPH. This means I am now speeding but there has been no indication on the tracking information at all that this limit was going to come into effect. I am probably missing something but, I have to say, I feel a bit cheated.
The second problem is what has convinced me to give this a thumbs down - the doors. When stopping at a station, I let the passengers depart and alight and physically watch the doors as they close before commencing the journey. More than once I have then failed the game because I have started to move with the doors open! I mean, I saw the doors close so how can this be?
Very frustrating when I was halfway through an hour-long game only to have it ended by what I can only assume is a bug.
Frustrating, as this could be a nice way to pass an hour or so if not for these irritating problems.
If anyone can suggest what I am doing wrong that would be a big help and might change my overall judgment.",1563535812,1563535812,False,4,0,0.533565759658813477,0,True,False,False

Crashes and Bugs
The Game crashed sometimes (not very often but annoying anyway), restart of a track/task results in not working controls, track preview is not consistant with train control system which leads into guiltless penalties - the worst for a train simulation

Pros:
- A lot of selections of trains and routes ... A LOT!!
- Realistic routes with goggle maps GPS for tracking
- Realistic feel of having thousands of tons of freight behind you
- Cheaper than buying/making a Train set at home  IE. : Hours of set up time - Maintenance of track, trains, wires, and dusting
- Easy to play
- Some very complicated Engines (FEF-3 - author ""Smokebox"") if you want a challenge
- Hours of play
- Your kids can play (ages 5 and up)
- Can watch movies while playing and not DIE.
- Can be very relaxing
- Can customize your own routes or add scenarios to existing routes

Cons:
- Can be expensive if you want to ""catch them all""
- Graphics can be one level above ""minecraft"" at times (5% or less)
- Sometimes the objectives don't work correctly (5% or less - very dependent on publisher)
- Friends will make fun of you for playing train stimulator for hours
- Can take up a lot of memory

Summary:

If you can get past the simplicity and understand that owning a train set at home costs more than what this game offers for a fraction of the price. Hours of fun anywhere you have a computer with steam. I was even able to drive a Train on real route with a laptop while riding a train and beating the train to destination.

There is a massive community to this game where there are literally of thousands of additions to the workshop with scenarios that can be interesting and fun (from what I remember) 

However, if you have any issues with money then avoid this game at all costs as you will be spending around £10 just for one single bloody train that you will most likely get bored of in the near future. The routes can be very expensive as well where you will find the newer additions cost alarmingly more than the routes from the times of 2012 e.g. Paddington to Oxford. During sales. yes the prices can be dirt cheap and we are talking grannies pocket money cheap but that is only in the sales REMEMBER!

Overall, this can be a great game if you enjoy your trains but once you hit that stage where you get bored of it you will most likely regret buying everything for this game.

Normally, it's over $9,000. That's over $900 a year for a game that is a decade old at this point. And you will need at least a handful of DLC to really flesh out the content that is part of the base game. I would actually recommend getting the three Holiday themed DLC packs (one Halloween and two Christmas), you get the most bang for the buck with those, and don't even need the base game to play them. One plus is that I originally bought the 2017 version of the game with a sim bundle and was automatically upgraded to 2019 when that released on Steam, so if this continues, that's a plus.

That being said, right now, TS2019 is the premier Train Sim out there, along with TSW. You need to be very careful in your choice of which DLC to purchase. Each Engine pack usually comes with 3-4 scenarios to play, but at $20 a pop, that is still pretty expensive for a bare minimum amount of content. The scenario packs generally have a handful of routes to drive, but the problem comes when you need a specific route DLC AND a specific Engine DLC (or two) in order to have access to every route that is included. So a $10 scenario pack can wind up costing you $40 or more in order to play everything included in the pack. Another issue is that almost none of the routes/scenarios in any of the DLC are drivable in all four of the game modes.

There are four games modes that you can drive in:
Quick Drive - you can pick a route and an Engine and just go from point A to point B anywhere on the route.
Career - A points based version of routes where you are scored on your ability to follow the rules of the rails and complete assigned tasks.
Standard - A non-points based version of Career mode.
Free Roam - Just like it says. Pick a route and just drive the train without having to worry about the rules or the need to complete any tasks.

That offers a lot of possibilities, but as mentioned, almost none of the scenarios and routes are available in all four modes. So if you have a favorite route you like driving, you may only be able to drive it in Career mode or Quick mode. Or a route may only be available in Standard mode. For the cost of the DLC, there should be no reason not to have each and every route available to drive in each mode to its fullest extent.

In the end, I would recommend this game. It is fun to experience the ability to command a variety of engines, and learn the differences between driving a classic steam engine and a modern electric engine. However, you will need DLC to really get more than a paltry base amount of content, and you really need to be picky about what content you want to add to the game.

+ Graphics
+ Models 
+ Physics
+ A lot of 3rd party reskins for in-game add-ons

Cons:
- Quite resource demanding, especially on older setups
- The add-ons, more like their price in some cases
- The lack of a free upgrade every year, in my opinion people who already own the game should get the yearly release add-ons for free

Some routes are better then others for instance the U-Bahn Frankfurt that just came out recently has a lot to it. Trains have information systems and passenger systems on them. This is great for atmosphere. I wish many of the other routes had this as well. I drive the ICE trains a lot and wish they had these information systems on them.

I have written several issues and things I would like to see in the sim.  but I get told oh its not possible or something like that when thats been proven wrong.

what to do on a sunny summer morning. of cause checking out the steam summer sale and deciding to give your train sim a try.
as a flight simmer I guess there is always time for a change.
which brings me to your product. 
I always figuerd that inthusiats are the most capable people in trying to recreate their beloved hobby into an pc game.
thats why I was shocked to find out that your game lacks ""sooo"" much love to detail.

gameplay/physics: are you really sure that locomotives behave that way? terrain inclination? air resistence? 

sound: since i am a sound designer myself, i find your lack of affort very offensive (train passes by in the opposite direction: great sound for that, but when it passed by just nothing? tunnels: nothing ? why? not to mention the constant noise floor of something) HIRE ME ! 

graphics: since this game is somewhat expensive, it would be great if its visuals were appropriately, dont you think?

over all, if this would be a platform for open source material like some other kind of sims, so you could add some content from people who care (more!), I would be tempted to play it again... 

in the meantime I think I`ll pass.
