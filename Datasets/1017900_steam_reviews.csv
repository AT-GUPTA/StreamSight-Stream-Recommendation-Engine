I would suggest either:
[list]
[*] Getting a copy of the original and installing UPatch for running it on modern Windows. That also formed the basis of DE's balance adjustments, should you want those.
[*] Playing Return of Rome. It only has some of the original campaigns (that may be ironed out overtime), but also has three new ones, enjoys many modern QoL and amenities from being ported to AoE II DE's more modern engine, and is otherwise the current version maintained.
[/list]

'Full coverage of all the campaigns but in fresh paint' is otherwise the only thing going for AoE I DE in the meantime, and even then it has heavily altered or even replaced many of the scenarios; your mileage may vary. It is intentionally also more conservative than Return of Rome, but that version ended up adding things that people actually wanted in DE.

There's plenty of content to enjoy throughout the ten campaigns, starting from the [i]Ascent of Egypt[/i] and [i]Voices of Babylon[/i], and ending with [i]Enemies of Rome[/i] and the [i]First Punic War[/i]. Each campaign consists of between four to twelve scenarios, providing a satisfying amount of gameplay.

The gameplay itself is enjoyable, despite a few flaws. There are instances where units may experience pathfinding issues, leading them to become confused or go in the wrong direction. This can be frustrating, especially when it results in the loss of valuable units. There's also situations where it's difficult to find a unit standing behind a tree.  Additionally, the game mechanics can sometimes be unclear, leading to ambiguous victory conditions, or victories while there's still conditions to be met.

Despite these issues, [b]Age of Empires: Definitive Edition[/b] still offers hours of strategic fun and satisfaction in building civilizations, managing resources, and engaging in epic battles or journeys. If you enjoy Real-Time Strategy games, and can overlook its flaws, this game is definitely one worth trying out.

[b]REVIEW:[/b]

[i]""Age of Empires: Definitive Edition""[/i] is not just a remake of a classic but a lovingly crafted monument to the glorious era of real-time strategy. As a game that shaped my childhood, I was curious to see how this remake would blend nostalgia with modern enhancements. I'm delighted to say that it has succeeded in preserving the essence of the original while introducing fresh elements to captivate even new players.

One of the most remarkable features of [i]""Age of Empires: Definitive Edition""[/i] is the revamped graphics. The 4K resolution and improved textures make the game world appear more vibrant and detailed than ever before. Exploring the tiny details in the cities and experiencing epic battles in stunning graphics is great. But the beauty of this game lies not only in its visuals but also in its gameplay. The mechanics feel familiar yet have been refined to ensure a smooth gaming experience. The balance between resource management, construction, and combat remains engaging and challenging. It's amazing to see how well the fundamental principles of the game still work after all these years.

Another highlight of [i]""Age of Empires: Definitive Edition""[/i] is the soundtrack. The iconic music that once shaped the atmosphere of the game has been masterfully remastered, adding an epic touch to every match. It's nearly impossible not to hum along while guiding your civilization through the ages.

However, what truly sets this remake apart is its attention to detail. From small animations to historical background information, the game provides a wealth of knowledge and little surprises that will even astonish long-time fans. Especially for lovers of history and historical settings, [i]""Age of Empires: Definitive Edition""[/i] comes highly recommended. Through the game, players gain insight into many fascinating backgrounds of different epochs and civilizations, enriching the gaming experience even further.

Overall, the game is a triumphant remake that captures the magic of the original and brings it into the modern age. It's a game that transports me back to my childhood while also showing that timeless games retain their fascination and finesse even after all these years.

And sadly, the two remasters are uncannily similar.  Mostly just a way to get the old game to run on modern hardware, but a lot of the UI issues, unit pathing, odd (but thankfully uncommon) bugs that have units refuse to move when ordered to etc. are still there.

I'm not going to attempt a refund, this game brought a lot of memories and I can relive them, but, you know, Grim Fandango Remastered felt like the devs put more effort into it than this or Starcraft 1's, despite that game also being more of a minor graphical update and way of having it run on modern hardware.  Sad.

The game itself is [i]as fun[/i] as usual, keywords being as fun.  If you never played Age of Empires 1, get this on sale.  If you have, then it depends on the strength of your nostalgia.

I used to own this version on Microsoft Store and it was awful, the Steam version is MUCH better. There is also no ""HD Edition"" or GoG version, so this is the main way to play ""original"" Age of Empires (except for emulating the original in VmWare of course).

It is very nostalgic, has 100% of the campaigns from both the original game and Rise of Rome expansion, the music aaaand... the clunkiness.

I think AoE DE was more of a trial run before making the excellent AoE 2 DE. In that regard this game is great since it paved the way for the sequel, just like it was all those years ago. Age of Empires 2 in 1999 was a massive leap forward from Age of Empires in 1997 making that game obsolete.

I still like the setting - the ancient bronze age era period, as well as Roman era. I always had a soft spot for the Egyptian stone age intro which felt very ""cozy"" for lack of better word. The original manual was awesome, thick, and had some minor history book texts about the civilizations, as well as some of these texts in game at the start of the campaigns (still have these in DE, yay!).

Right now the final nails in the coffin are being hammered in for this version since a reimagining is being made as a DLC for Age of Empires II Definitive Edition - Return of Rome - with currently 3 of 5 original campaigns having already been done and ready to play. As well as 3 brand new campaigns (AoE 2 DE truly got all the love).

Two quality of life improvements in Return of Rome makes this version obsolete: Pathfinding and formations. The ancient era (the Romans, come on!) had some seriously well made formations in their units, but due to technical difficulties this didn't exist in OG Age of Empires to everybody's detriment. When it was implemented in Age of Empires 2 this feature alone made AoE 1 a dinosaur after only 2 years.

Pathfinding is terrible in this version just like the original and is a huge source of frustration.

PROBLEMS

This version has some serious issues. 
- The scaling seems a bit off 
- Placing buildings kind of ""glow in green"" which seems strange and unimmersive
- The menu is very basic (just like the original of course, but it's way better made in AoE 2 DE - Return of Rome)
- The water splashing against the shore line is just really, really bad and unimmersive.
- The pathfinding is still horrible (of course 100% original)
- No formations

THE GOOD
- Has all campaigns
- Music is more nostalgic
- Voiced campaign intros (these also exist in Return of Rome)
- Good graphics in general.",1704105145,1706986103,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's nice they are keeping a classic alive. The only things I remember from the game are the tutorial missions. I still remember being surprised that you can actually walk over (shallow) water to get to the berries on the other side. 
I think what made the OG AoE1 great are its music and graphics, which have now been updated, its time period with well known figures like Caesar and Hannibal, and intuitive units. A 7 year old can understand you use archers to take out melee, cavalry to charge at enemy archers, siege to destroy towers and buildings, etc. This makes it relatively easy to get into compared to sci-fi or fantasy settings. The only confusing thing is that weapon and armor upgrades are in the storage pit.
Also, the history notes in the campaign missions were quite interesting, which span all the way from hunting and foraging to the Roman Empire. 

Age of Empires: Definitive Edition improves on the original in 2 significant ways, beyond sounds and visuals.
1. The ability to zoom out. In AoE:DE you can zoom out to the point where it becomes hard to select individual units, which is actually refreshing to see.
2. The population limit has been increased to 250. Some may not like the higher pop cap, because it changes the gameplay, but it's better to have the option than not. When you make a custom scenario, you can even set the limit to an absurd 9000. If only the AI could handle it, it would make for some epic battles.

Other than that, the game plays exactly like the original including its notorious terrible path-finding. It also still has a limit of 36 units that you can select at any time, which is even more nonsensical now with the increased pop cap.

Two years before it I was enjoying the futurist spin of Command & Conquer and the fantasy vibes of Warcraft II, but Age of Empires offered up something else entirely ‚Äî a middle-ground.

It was a monumental moment in the history of the genre, as the awe-inspiring sprite-work and the sheer scope of the game really spoke to me and spurred my interest in ancient civilizations. Age of Empires: Definitive Edition is still very much a game from the ‚Äô90s, lacking the panache of its sucessors, but those of you with an open mind and a strategic knack will enjoy it just as I did all those years ago.Even though I haven‚Äôt played in ages, all of my prior knowledge came flowing back through me as soon as I moused my cursor over my first worker. The Definitive Edition has a way about it that just feels right, to the point where I had to do a double-take and watch a video of the original just to see if I was going crazy. No, the 1997 edition never looked this good, and the remaster doesn‚Äôt douse its legacy in any way.

A tried and true skirmish-based RTS, the concept of a warring over a finite amount of resources that forces eventual confrontation isn‚Äôt unique to Age of Empires, but it‚Äôs handled a bit more organically in this series. With several forms of resource gathering (such as hunting and farming berries for food) you always feel like you have a strategic choice, rather than just setting and forgetting a bunch of drones to grab gold from a mine. Rising through the ages for upgrades at new tiers (an RTS staple) is gamey, sure, but it‚Äôs engaging and framed as moving through major moments in history. Multiple win conditions like building and defending a Wonder to win are still magical and unique.

Subtle enhancements that bring the original iteration into the modern era are welcome. Attack move (where units quite literally can attack while navigating if you press a qualifying button) is a no-brainer. So are all the included staples of old school RTS that are still relevant today ‚Äî multiple building orders, control groups, viewing idle villagers at a glance. Pathfinding (the process in which units locate areas you command them to go) is the only ‚Äúimproved‚Äù mechanic that still needs work. It‚Äôll all come naturally to folks who have moved on from Age of Empires and into more uncharted territory. The population limit increase is really the big draw here. While a lot of remasters fundamentally don‚Äôt touch the base, Microsoft took a chance here and shook up the game while keeping in some tongue in cheek references.Ratcheting up a unit cap that served as a technical limitation doesn‚Äôt sacrifice its strategic core, and it works particularly well with the expanded zoom feature ‚Äî whoever put in for that one deserves a raise. I was taking all this in with the tasteful animation alterations (mainly more stylish building destruction) and the orchestral soundtrack. The only aspect of the presentation that feels off is the UI ‚Äî which is so dated that it‚Äôs like the team ran out of money to fix it up.

What‚Äôs going to be the big holdup, not only for power users but for posterity, is online play. It‚Äôs very finicky even after its beta state, to the point where you really need to sort of go into this remaster knowing it‚Äôs a single-player game. Despite the boisterous claim of dedicated servers for all on Xbox One, some PC releases are left in the dust, this one included.

Remember all of those fun ‚Äô90s ping issues you had? Well they‚Äôre back, baby! Having tested out the multiplayer in the live version I ran into some of the same issues as the beta, where entire games would drop as a result of a connection error. Having to go through the Microsoft Store app, which significantly hinders my ability to play the game at times (I had to go through multiple processes to rid the app of boot errors), is also no fun.  It‚Äôs a good thing the campaign has basically been doubled in the Definitive Edition, and bots are still in.The Windows 10 restrictions simply do the development team a disservice. A lot of work went into Age of Empires: Definitive Edition and just enough tweaks were made to ensure that it‚Äôs still relevant in 2018. I have an incredible amount of respect for the folks who brought this classic back to life, and for their restraint to ensure that this remaster doesn‚Äôt abandon its roots. 8\10",1705457436,1705457436,True,7,0,0.629629611968994141,0,True,False,False

Para preparar el terreno para la llegada del tan anticipado Age of Empires IV el equipo de Microsoft encarg√≥ el desarrollo de 3 remasterizaciones de los cl√°sicos originales, partiendo por √©ste, el primero de todos.

Como juego es excelente, es el padre de los RTS, desafiante ya sea en Escaramuza (Solitario o con amigos) o en sus campa√±as, que esta vez incluye tanto a las originales como al contenido de The Rise of Rome. 

Como remasterizaci√≥n hace un trabajo brillante. Es visualmente bello, dota a los nuevos sprites de alta resoluci√≥n y animaciones fluidas, el escenario ahora est√° repleto de detallitos que aportan a la comodidad visual, los nuevos men√∫s contin√∫an siendo arcaicos pero relativamente c√≥modos, ahora es posible hacer zoom e incluso si no te gusta, pod√©s activar el modo Classic para jugar con el aspecto original.

Sin embargo hay algo que me molesta en lo que a visuales respecta, y es que esta remasterizaci√≥n pareciera haberse planteado para Age of Empires II. Luce muy similar a su secuela (Tanto a su versi√≥n cl√°sica como su remasterizaci√≥n), hace un excelente trabajo en adaptarse visualmente pero la mayor√≠a de sus decisiones est√©ticas no son muy fieles al aspecto original del primer Age of Empires.

Adem√°s hay algunos aspectos t√©cnicos y jugables que quedaron sin retocar, como la formaci√≥n de tropas (Seleccionar a un conjunto de tropas no las reune, cada unidad se mueve desde su respectivo lugar inicial, esto no ser√≠a para tanto si tan s√≥lo hubiera un modo de organizarlas en distintas formaciones como ocurre en Age of Empires II), campa√±as con un m√°ximo de poblaci√≥n en 50 sin importar la dificultad seleccionada, imposibilidad de seleccionar m√°s de un l√≠mite muy estricto de unidades al mismo tiempo y un p√©simo pathfinding para las unidades m√≥viles (No hay partida en que las unidades no tomen el camino incorrecto o no se queden atrapadas entre ellas).

En el Age of Empies original se pod√≠a perdonar, pero esta remasterizaci√≥n apenas mejora sus mayores carencias mec√°nicas.

[b]¬øEn conclusi√≥n?[/b] Vale la pena por la excelencia del material original, y en varios aspectos hace un decente trabajo como remasterizaci√≥n; sin embargo le queda mucho por retocar.",1704048318,1704061353,True,4,0,0.534883737564086914,0,True,False,False

It's not AOE2, it's an embryo that has many of the elements that would make it great, but I'll write below my biggest misgivings about it - you decide if you still want to get it based on that.

The unit path-finding is not the worst I've seen, but it's bad compared to AOE2. It can be very frustrating when you want to get units through a tight passage and half of them decide they'd rather take a journey around the map instead.

EDIT: The units also sometimes move on their own, returning to their previous position. This didn't happen often, but when it did it was very annoying.

Civilization tech trees seem to have a great amount of grey, that is: unavailable upgrades & units. To the point where it seems a poor civ choice could make your loss almost inevitable.

Speaking of the tech trees, it doesn't make it clear what units actually counter what. 

There's only one narrator for campaigns and I think no in-game voice acting (apart from unit voices). Not irredeemable, but it makes some campaign scenarios fall kinda flat for me, especially those where you start with a few military units and are supposed to make your way to some goal.

Campaign scenarios give you a pop limit of 50 (- this might be different in campaigns I haven't played yet), while the enemy often greatly outnumbers you. They also like their monks a bit too much and there is no Heresy tech. You are effectively forced into attrition fights where you slowly build your fortifications deeper and deeper into the enemy base until you win. The towers & walls are solid tho, unlike the Papier-m√¢ch√© shit that Empire Earth II has for example, so it's not too horrible but still it often seems unlikely to win some other way.",1703279115,1703871795,False,4,0,0.532220065593719482,0,True,False,False

Although this game is aged, and the controls are a bit clunky it feels like I'm reading a short war novel upon completion of each campaign mission and the game itself is entertaining in its method of exploration. You are forced to scout and explore the map as opposed to many other RTS genre type of games of build base, army, and kill the opponent.  

The tutorial campaign was also very well made to allow any new player to learn how to play the game (arguably one of the best tutorials I've seen compared to most RTS games).

Unit pathfinding is terrible, yet it‚Äôs somewhat manageable some of the time, although it almost completely breaks in several places during campaigns. Trying to figure out where to upgrade units is just ridiculous and completely unintuitive until you basically memorize it. I didn't really enjoy the campaigns that much. Most of the campaigns are tedious at best and miserable at worst. Finally, the reason I hate this game just as much as I love it, the AI. The AI is freaking mental.

The game play is fun and easy to pick up. However you can learn the hotkeys or master the best unit types for your civilization to really raise the level of strategy in the game.  

The game also allows you to make your own scenarios and you can even string them together into your own custom campaign. A good bit of creativity in this game.

Maxed out AI no matter the setting (especially in case of reds). Attention changed to weaker Babylons in the east - villagers nerfed on Easy/Standard so when Priest starts to convert they all charge on you. Changed to Hard as per Reddit tips, better with less aggro from villagers on first conversions, except by the time you've got 15+ villagers gathering enough food to advance to II the red AI is back and already on III. On your arse with chariots before you even have the stable available, plus they know exactly where you are on the map even when should be shaded for them.

I thought I maybe judged it too harshly compared to AoE2, but trying it out again I felt as if I could see the flaws more clearly. There's simply a lot lacking in terms of strategy, civilizations and technology that makes the game a bit more of a slog. However, I think those are the same reasons why  a lot of people would like it, so it's a more subjective thing where for me it just lacks a certain polish and appeal.

5. Civilization buffs are less elaborate

That being said, play the game with the time period in mind. The ages in the game go from the Stone Age, to the Tool Age, the Bronze Age, and finally the Iron Age.

Balance is awful, with unique civilisation units being massively overpowered and spammed by the AI, often meaning entire armies are brought down by 2-3 War Elephants. Units aren't able to path around well, leading to frequent bottle necks and units going the long way around, usually into danger. The lack of stances means your units often just keep chasing and pushing until they are killed, so it's a lot of constant micro managing. 

The AI cheat, quite badly. They advance Age much faster than is humanly possible, and seem to build armies much faster than you can. They do very silly things like repeatedly try and build inside your space, next to your docks etc relentlessly, never stopping regardless of how many of their villagers you kill and builds you raze. They also just give up at a certain point, even if you're nowhere near beating them.

Yes, that version. I still love it, please don't get me wrong, it is the first game I ever played as a child and is responsible for my pursuit of a master's degree in history. However, some major criticisms HAVE to be lent to the DE version of this game, which I feel has not done well to clarify the concerns shared here also by other players elsewhere for the last 28 YEARS. 

So. The pathfinding in the DE of this game is absolutely pants on head. Many villagers will get caught up on each other and immediately stop their tracks so you have to move them manually. The auto-gather of villagers is particularly a pain in this game as well, since they'll sometimes traverse to the other side of the island (during Island map games) just to cut a tree down. The organization of AOE1 whether it's Classic or DE, was never much my style. Obviously after playing massive hours in AOE2 it can be hard to remember the less convenient methods to which research is conducted through which buildings. Why towers and walls are researchable at a Granary is beyond me, and the villager-centric aspects of the Town Center from AOE2 are sorely missed since you have to construct a market just to research how to gather resources faster, and can only build a Government Center in the Bronze Age. It's a clunkier, less enthusiastic Age of Empires than the one I remember playing as a child. AOE2 soars above this game in every single aspect. The AI is beyond a chore to trifle with-- even on easiest difficulty they will manage to build twice as fast as you and outmanouvre your navy to a point where it's useless to build Fishing Ships because they'll already have Triremes countering to destroy them, and will easily send transport ships to your island when you least expect it. Infantry seems very slow to react to cavalry. I think that overall the micro of this game versus what AOE2 created for the community is a joke by comparison. It's impossible not to put the two together for the review as they are both legendary games everyone with a computer knows about.  I think AOE2 serves as a reminder that AOE1 was just the start of something bigger. I'm sure many stans will disagree with me, but I'm just not a fan of this version of the game, and often resort to playing Classic 1997 in all matches, at best. It's hard to make this game work well on this engine, so I can't personally recommend it, even though it was the first video game I had ever played in my life, and holds a special place in my heart.

been playing this game for years, also, i am glad to relive this game one more time, 
the campaigns in remastered version, remastered music, also with slightly better, but sometimes glitchy
mechanics...

I felt nostalgic going through all the the missions, and skirmish as well... sadly i didn't find almost anyone
to play this game in MP, but the solo experience was just fine to me...

Pros:[list]
[*] Game is basically same as the original, with better graphics, and remastered music to be 
as close to original as it can be.
[*] You can switch between remastered graphics and original graphics which is a big LIKE!
[*] AI is slightly improved,
[*] They've put a voice over the description before and after each mission,
[*] Skirmish![/list]

Cons:[list]
[*] Sometimes AI gets glitchy, it's rarely nowadays, but still happens,
[*] Too bad they didn't remade or remaster the intro video from original release
[*] The population in campaigns could've been raised above 50 units, but i guess it would
lose the original feeling of the game, might not be challenging as it was in original
[*] MP is basically dead if you're trying to play online with someone because i don't see that much people playing it online

I consider it's wrong to criticize a game that's 25 years old, even if it's a remaster. I'll just recommend it to hardcore strategy fans and ardent fans of the Age of Empires series, especially those for whom the first part was a part of their childhood, not the second one.

Pros:
- An interesting setting of ancient world civilizations. I think many people enjoyed the history of those times in school. Each mission in the campaigns has a detailed historical description. And then you actually participate in these events. Nice :)
- It's just interesting to see where the series began and what the second part adopted (or didn't).
- And, looking at screenshots from the 1997 game, you understand how well they have redrawn everything with respect to the original.
- The soundtrack. Orchestral music is always good.
- Well, the Priests seemed more effective to me than in the second part :D

Cons:
- Pathfinding and getting units stuck in each other. Of course, you get used to it.
- Many civilizations don't have their own campaigns. So, you can only play with them against AI or online, which might not be interesting. Perhaps consider buying the DLC The RoR for the second part and maybe, someday you'll get them.
- A unique economic system. After it, you better understand the economy of the second part :)

Overall, the game isn't bad. It's a good remaster. But it's best to start playing it strictly after you've played the second part of the series.",1698408663,1698408663,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cons:
‚Ä¢ No ingame dialogue.
‚Ä¢ Awful pathing making units wandering off, not grouping up or go on a different direction you commanded.
‚Ä¢ No grouping/formation options.
‚Ä¢ When commanded to attack, units more often than not, will walk past the enemies.
‚Ä¢ Unbalanced AI (HOLY MAN Mission); where enemies will actually get weaker the harder the difficulty.

Pros:
‚Ä¢ Good History details, the narration of missions, win and lose post screens are a nice feature.
‚Ä¢ Cool unit and building models (Legion)
‚Ä¢ Cool art style and destruction effects.
‚Ä¢ Multiplayer, like any other AoE is fun.
‚Ä¢ Custom Campaigns and Mods give it plenty of replayability. 

If you own the original don't bother getting this as its only a visual improvement for a quick buck.

The remaster is very well done, and makes this classic playable on modern hardware.

I ended up having to wait to try out the remaster due to not having a Windows 10 pc and the pc I had before which ran on Vista at the time couldn‚Äôt upgrade to Windows 10. The wait was well worth it and I got the game when it was released on Steam. While I wasn‚Äôt too familiar with what a remaster was. I looked at it and it blew me away. From playing the original Age of Empires for almost a decade. The graphical upgrades were quite insane. While I never cared much for graphical fidelity. It was cool how they upped the fidelity to 11 but kept it very faithful. Even more faithful to the point that the remaster uses the same Genie engine used for the original game. Another thing they did that made the game sound pretty interesting was that they changed the music from MIDI Sounds too real orchestral music using actual instruments. One thing that was added was a narrator for the campaigns.

          There were some things that were included in the remaster that are optional like turning on blood. Even though the original game doesn‚Äôt have blood. I did enable it and tried it for an hour. I Didn‚Äôt notice it and decided to disable it.

I never had the experience to play online multiplayer, let alone I never knew how to use MSN Gaming Zone around the time when it was still around when playing the original. I noticed the game would use the Xbox Live service for the multiplayer but good thing I realized I didn‚Äôt have to pay for it since I was on PC.

When I first entered a multiplayer Duel. I decided to message the enemy player by saying I was new to RTS Multiplayer. From years of experience playing by myself in the campaigns or random maps. I noticed the enemy player would use houses in place of walls. He did end up building a wonder, but I went on the other side of the map to send a bunch of Centurions to easily destroy the wonder. Only one was left remaining and I took out the wonder before the other player could cry out for victory. I decided to defend myself, I walled myself in but only left the other 2 sides open. Near the walls would have Babylonian towers and monks. While gaining more resources in the process. I was able to build a wonder. I successfully defended myself from incoming attacks and turned enemy catapults into my own using the monks. I angered the other player, and he sent out a message saying I lied and surrendered. I gained a victory, but it was a lucky one that lasted for two hours. I did end up replaying the campaigns I had finished all those years ago. Most of them were the same with some of the campaign titles different. I did like how they added the Age of Empires Demo campaign which wasn‚Äôt in the original release. While knowing everything and how to beat the game. I ended up having an Achievement completion in under four months of playing the game.""

2. SUPER STUPID military unit stay stand idle even tho I set aggresive stance and there are enemy units or buildings near them

That 2 downside are more than enough to make players give bad reviews on a RTS game since its very2 important and game changing. I thought on AOE DE the devs are already fixing this problem, and sadly this game are released on 2019 but until now of 2023 then never give patches about this

AI is busted because all of their archers will kite you, meaning if your unit doesn't have the movement or reach to touch an archer, they'll kill you without a scratch to them

You walk across the screen with the same characters, look for the same raw materials and have the same missions in mind.
However, it all looks much better. The game has had a complete remake. This is not a polished version with a higher resolution, but the game has been completely redesigned and is playable in 4K.
With new graphics, textures, light effects, water effects and details, the game looks like a modern game.

The soundtrack also received a massive overhaul in the Definitive Edition.
Instead of the original MIDI, an orchestra is now responsible for the music in the game.
Many of the songs contain the same characteristics as in the original game, while I also got the impression that there are new melodies.

in its entirety, this is certainly a remaster of an outdated game. The original game is getting close to being 30 years old and yet it's still worth watching.
The game looks more beautiful than ever before and the new music gives the games its own identity while keeping its distinctive character.
If you loved the original Age of Empires, the Definitive Edition is definitely worth checking out. But in the end it remains the same good old Age of Empires, as we have known it for years.",1693234734,1693234734,True,37,0,0.808281183242797852,0,True,False,False

Cons: Abandoned by Microsoft apparently with no dlc, complaints about issues with multiplayer not working properly, villagers (AI villagers I think should not be attacking priests when trying to convert them regardless of difficulty settings), and probably has less people on multiplayer than the other three games from this series, except for RoR (Return to Rome) dlc.

Neutral: Pathfinding, but this a problem for the entire Age of Empires series in general especially for I and II being the most noticeable. It could be argued that RoR dlc from AoE II: DE is better, but debatable and while it might be underrated it also has much lower Steam ratings currently than this game. Some people however might enjoy playing with both games.

Conclusion: Might be more practical for single player than multiplayer and maybe not as good as the other three games from this series especially with AoE IV now confirmed to have its first dlc come out, but I would recommend this game for at least casual gameplay. I would overall rate this game with a 6 out of 10.

‚ùå There has been little to no gameplay updates as compared to the original. While I understand why they wouldn't want to do a complete remaster and instead clung close to the original, the gameplay was already getting old when Age of Empires 2 released in 1999. I mean, there have been so many RTS games released since then that you are bound to feel how unwieldy this whole thing is.

I think that for any people who don't have a lot of nostalgia for the original game, trying to get into this one is a bit of a waste of time. The gameplay is clunky, the narration of the campaigns is conveyed in a bit of a boring way, and overall if you want a real time strategy game Age of Empires 2 just does everything better - even though it's not taking place in the same time period, sure.",1692956723,1692956723,False,3,0,0.506767153739929199,0,True,False,False

The sheer depth and complexity of the game's mechanics keep me engaged for hours on end, constantly strategizing and adapting to the changing tides of history.

It's what got me interested in history and I have it to thank for a lot of fond memories. As while other kids my age were playing your typical kiddie games, I was dominating the ancient world.

HOWEVER...

Those times were also filled with a bit of frustration that my poor 6 year old mind probably couldn't comprehend or really even retain in my wee memory... and now over 20 years later, I'm being reminded of these issues.

So lets get the good out of the way first. 
This is a trip down nostalgia lane through and through. The updated graphics and soundtrack is amazing, the new campaign presentation is in line with what you'd expect from Age of Empires 2. In terms of overall presentation, I couldn't have asked for better. 
In regards to ease of use, there are plenty of improvements. Units can have stances now (I forget if that was in the original or not, but I feel like it wasn't), there's hotkey support and the UI has been updated to convey much more information, once more, in line with Age of Empires 2, a few of these features probably being the beta forms of some of the features added in Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition. 

However, this is where the positives stop, and I'd even say some of those positives are even countered by a few points I'm going to make here.

From what I've experienced, stances don't work over half the time. Heaven forbid that if I put my swordsmen on defensive formation so they don't go chasing some archer half way across the map that they begin to ignore my commands. (Btw, there's no formations in this version either). For some reason units will just outright forget their commands and return to their starting position, ignoring all other enemies in their paths. Which brings me to pathing...

It's improved a little bit but for the most part you will still experience villager congestion, most often when several are trying to drop off resources - though this doesn't happen with farms due to the way you've gotta place them. If they get congested to long they will just forget what they were doing and stand around. Or sometimes they'll just pull a Swordsman and stop working all together for no apparent reason.

The worst part of it all, I'm pretty sure this game's support was dead on arrival. These are bugs that have existed since launch, if not decades back when the original came out. And if wee 6 year old me didn't actually experience them back then, then these are -new- bugs. Which shouldn't happen to a remaster of a game more than two decades old...

UnlessyoureWarcraftIIIReforged *cough*

So all in all, if you are really a sucker for nostalgia, wait for a sale, otherwise, it's not exactly worth it. Just stick to Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition which is by far the superior remaster from the original Age of Empires trilogy.

 Age of Empires: Defenition Edition is the remastered version of the classic 1997 strategy. With improved visuals, new campaigns, and more civilizations (civs). Age of Empires is different from what many players remember Wololo!

[h3]‚úîPros:[/h3]
+ Campaigns:
 -> The game has a good amount of campaigns. The classics are all there and the game had some addictions. All of the stories are good and well adapted to the game.

 + Strangely Good Gameplay:
 -> It's possible to divide the Age Of Empires gameplay into two types. The complex, using a good amount of key binds to be faster building and play with the meta. Or the simple, that is more calm don't follow the meta that much.

 + Visuals Improvement:
 -> From the 1997 edition, it's possible to see great improvements in the visuals. As an old player, I couldn't ask much more

 [h3]‚ùåCons:[/h3]
- Military Control:
-> I could report a bunch of different problems into the military control. While controlling big armies, some units end up rushing into others, not letting any pass by them. Other times I could report that units from the army weren't going to the place designed.

- Constant FPS drops:
 -> I could find a very fun issue in the game. Every single time that I zoomed I would have an fps drop. Or if I moved my camera fast it would also happen a drop

[h1][i]-Going Deeper-[/i][/h1]
[h3]Rating: 73/100[/h3]

[h3]üìúStory[/h3]
  Age Of Empires is not a story-centric game. However, it still contains a series of campaigns that tell the great deeds of some civilizations of the past, such as Romans, Egyptians, and Greeks. There are no cinematic cutscenes or anything like that and is more as if we had to hear a chronicle of the events in which we play. 

 The stories are well told and adapted to the game. I don't see the campaigns as a thing that will make the players buy the game. They are good but don't something important to the gameplay. I was a bit sad for don't see the remastered version from the original Age of Empires: Defenition Edition cutscenes, or any new. I think that they were a master key to make the game more catchy. However, I don't dislike the chronicle idea.

[h3]üïπGameplay[/h3]
 At first glance, all civilizations will look a little the same, since the only things that seem to change from civ to civ are the special troops, the design of their buildings, and their buffs. However, the game has a whole meta of what to do. For example, on a map with lots of hills, a civ with archer buffs is the best choice. It's all about choosing the best strategy and adapting to your opponent's game. 

 I've played a lot of Age Of Empires II: Defenition Edition, and what I'm going to write here is more centralized for AoE II players, that want to go back to the beginning of the franchise. Age of Empires and Age of Empires II is not the same thing. The first game is more complex than AoE 2 at all levels. I'm not going to say it's a 7-headed monster impossible to play, but players who have already gotten used to the gameplay from AoE 2, can shake a little with the difference.

 At the level of control in combat, I must say that sometimes it becomes a bit complicated.  While controlling big armies, some units end up rushing into others, not letting any pass by them. Other times I could see that units from the army weren't going to the place designed.

[h3]üìΩAudio & Visuals[/h3]
 Visually is impossible to don't see great improvements from the 1997 version. The game still gives the possibility to the player to use the 1997 graphics version. I enjoyed a lot have the opportunity to see and compare the two games.

 In terms of audio, the sound of the game is good. The song is more of the same, however, gets less annoying than that of the 1997 version without a doubt.

Age of Empires holds a special place in the hearts of many gamers, and for those who have a deep nostalgic connection to the franchise, the game can still provide a certain level of enjoyment despite its flaws.

For players who fondly remember the classic Age of Empires games, this installment offers a familiar experience that harkens back to the series' roots. The historical setting, strategic depth, and the satisfaction of building and commanding civilizations remain intact. Engaging in large-scale battles, constructing intricate cities, and witnessing the rise and fall of empires can evoke a sense of nostalgia and recapture some of the magic that made the series so beloved.

However, it is important to acknowledge that Age of Empires may not meet the expectations of players accustomed to the advancements seen in modern strategy games. The graphics and overall visual presentation may feel dated, lacking the level of detail and realism found in newer titles. Additionally, certain gameplay mechanics and features may show signs of aging, potentially feeling less refined or innovative when compared to contemporary strategy games.

Despite these shortcomings, the undeniable charm of Age of Empires can still draw players in. Its historical authenticity, engaging campaigns, and the joy of watching your civilization flourish can provide a satisfying and nostalgic experience. If you approach the game with an appreciation for its legacy and the knowledge that it may not match the technical prowess of newer titles, you can still find enjoyment in reliving the classic Age of Empires experience.

In summary, while Age of Empires may not be able to fully meet the expectations set by modern strategy games, it has its own unique appeal for those with a strong nostalgia for the franchise. If you can embrace the game's limitations and appreciate it for what it represents‚Äîa testament to the series' legacy‚Äîyou can still find enjoyment in revisiting the world of Age of Empires.",1687280503,1687280722,False,14,3,0.589675545692443848,0,True,False,False

The Definitive Edition delivers the experience of playing a 90s RTS right to your doorstep, and it's everything you'd expect. Because, apart from upscaling and redrawing and adding sweet voiceover to the game's campaigns, they did nothing to actualize the game's shortcomings and bring it into the XXI century.

Now, I am not advocating for a complete rework of the game's mechanics. I understand this is entirely a different game from AOE2. But whereas some of these quirks had a place in the game and differentiated it from subsequent staples of the genre, some others were just hardware and software limitations in their own time, which even then made the game feel clumsy and slow. But instead of rounding out those sharp edges this time around, Microsoft chose to leave them the way they were.

The result is an upscaled game that plays extremely slow, requires a lot of patience, and might not work well most of the time. Pathing is still appalling, triggers will not, erm, trigger, and there are still tremendous balance issues. 

I would be more forgiving of Microsoft's treatment of this edition if it had been done for the sake of preserving the gaming experience of the original game for future players. But the fact that they've been quite willing to completely overhaul, modify and update everything in AOE2 (for which I am thankful) tells me that their decision to keep AOE's many quirks and shortcomings is less motivated by the preservation of gaming culture, and more by the need to make a quick and easy buck.

It's a shame, because the excitement and wonder of the original game are still there. I was very much looking forward to experiencing this in an updated setting and with improved mechanics and programming.

I'm going to tally up my AoE purchases here. AOE DE on from the MIcrosoft store (which didn't work at all), AOE DE on Steam (which kind of works), AOE II on steam, and AOE II DE. I purchased AOE III (non DE) but refunded it because it was too buggy to play.

If you purchased this game then you were misled and played by Microsoft, and you should be upset. This game is a buggy mess. Campaign maps that stall and prevent the player from finishing the campaign indefinitely. Miserably poor pathing that gets units stuck all over the place. Units will bug out and cease attacking until they die or the match ends. It's a pile of poo. 

With all of these frequent issues that can easily be replicated, this game has been abandoned. Alright, pretty frustrating, but not the end of the world, right? Well, this game is now being resold as a DLC for Age of Empires II DE with full support and planned content updates. 

In other words, this game should be completely removed from existence, but here it sits in a buggy mess for suckers to get conned into buying because Microshaft is objectively greedy. This was a deliberate maneuver to confuse consumers, or a massive blunder that should leave even die hard fans cursing this studio.

We should have seen AOE DE - pulled from the store. AOE II DE replaced by a title like ""AOE collection"", because in it's current state AOE II DE is two different games. AOE DE, as it exists independently of AOE II DE, should then be compensated to anyone who owns the currently abandoned AOE DE. Problem solved. If you ask me, they shot themselves in the foot with this one. There is no way I spend another dime on AOE. I know there are die hard fans that will continue to buy DLC for these games anyways, but this studio is milking their consumers by selling content they plan to abandon.

[h1] I do recommend it on Sale[/h1]

If you are looking for Age of Empires I remastered, then by all means, by it fullprice. You won't be disappointed.

If you played Age of Empires II or Definitive and you are searching for ""more"" or ""the roots"" then by all means, try it on Sale for 5‚Ç¨ because everything besides the nations themselves is either a downgrade of Age 2, or a clearly tested IDEA for something that has not been refined properly.

In Essence this is game is considarebly slower whilst also being faster than Age II, with fighting and teching happening faster and more consistent whilst everything moves and acts on a snails pace. 
If you think that it can't be [b] [i] that [/i] [/b]slow, then look at a villager building a building with only 5 hammer strikes, because it takes him so long to lift his arm with that puny hammer in hand that you can feel yourself physically age.

It is a nice intermission to playing the second title and definitely has its place but Age 2 is the best sequel one can hope for and whilst pikemen, Hoplites and Chariots sound cool, they feel really weird and uncanny to use and while there are Rome, Carthage and Egypt, they are so similar in feel and tech tree, that they might as well be one faction.",1618248746,1685429014,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Comment:[/b]
An integral part of my gaming childhood and one of the three games that got me into PC gaming (the other two are Deus Ex and LoK: Soul Reaver btw). I still have fond memories of trying to crack the missions and find the best strategy with my best buddy. Some of these have been changed in the Definitive Edition but I didn't mind the new versions. There are four base game campaigns (Ascent of Egypt, Glory of Greece, Voices of Babylon, Yamato Empire of the Rising Sun) + the originally unused demo Reign of the Hittites. Then the four expansion campaigns (Rise of Rome, Ave Caesar, Imperium Romana, Enemies of Rome) + the originally unused demo First Punic War. They are enjoyable for what they are to new players and a nostalgia trip for the old ones like me. And now the bad. Campaign saves wipe sometimes due to Steam cloud issue. I had to run the ""home run"" cheat to get back to the progress I was at FIVE TIMES! And it sucks to have to do that. AI was changed a bit and this is the most noticeable in the first mission of the Babylon campaign (Holy Man) where your priest gets swarmed by villagers or soldiers. While it makes sense the AI would do that the mission hasn't been designed for this so it seems unbalanced now. Also, sudden resigning is a thing now, it was okay for me but some will hate it. What an absolute mess the network part of the game is. GameSpy Arcade is of course gone so hello Xbox Live integration. There are official servers although they are somewhat region oriented and sometimes you have lag or just don't see any matches. Even LAN had problems when I tried to play with my wife. Setup crashed all the time. Matches desynced. And on one PC it even crashed my GPU driver. The 1997 version had a better multiplayer experience than this. With a VERY heavy heart I have to go and not recommend this one. Apart from the better visuals and a couple of QoL stuff it just doesn't feel like a proper remaster. There are too many problems just left unfixed. [strike]Plus once AoE2:DE gets the Return of Rome DLC, which has all of these campaigns, there really is no point of buying this game.[/strike] /EDIT: Devs have backtracked on this and the 10 original AoE1 campaigns will NOT be in that AoE2 DLC./ Get the game on a good sale for those campaigns, if nostalgia grips you, but otherwise it's not recommended. It hurts the soul to write that but it is what it is...

My setup is not optimal, but with correct settings, AoE II & III (both DE) run smoothly and without a single hiccup, as did IV. Such is not the case with this game; even on minimal settings -not a big array of options to choose from anyway-, get more than 4 or 5 units on screen and the fps begin to take a huge dip. Crazy to believe the remastered version of the most basic game in the franchise is the one that runs the worst.

Sad!

While my introduction to the franchise was the all-time classic that is Age of Empires II, I did play a bit of this one during my childhood, if only as a demo for the Rise of Rome expansion. During my teenage years, I finally got a copy of the base game, and even though I played a bit, it never quite grabbed me like AoE II. Still, I'd say it's an obviously important part of history.

For those familiar with Age of Empires II, many of the gameplay elements found in that game are already present here; gathering resources, building armies, developing technologies, and advancing through eras, but this game focuses on empires from ancient history, going from the Stone Age, all the way up to the Iron Age. Given its age, though, it had certain limitations that are obviously present in the historical campaigns; you don't get complex scenarios with different triggers and dialogue, instead getting a narration before starting the scenario and after finishing it. Population is also capped at 50. Luckily, for custom games, this limit has been increased to at least 250 (though I've seen some custom scenarios with up to a 500 population cap).

Graphically speaking, the Definitive Edition looks nice. Nothing too advanced, merely a modernization of the classic graphics (which you can still use if you want), so that it looks better on modern system. The sound seems to have been improved as well, and I think there might've been a few gameplay improvements. It also includes a scenario editor, a staple of the Age of Empires franchise, so you can create your custom maps and campaigns. And the cheat codes from the classic version of the game work here as well!

All in all, I can say I recommend this game for people who want to experience a bit of history (pun intended), but it hasn't aged very well. Going back to talking about the campaigns, some scenarios require some rather precise strategies to beat them; they don't feel very noob friendly, so play it with caution.",1574796708,1680910872,True,4,1,0.564245820045471191,1,True,False,False

They also added some new campaigns and factions, like the Romans. Will hit you right in the nostalgias. They added an attack move command, only whether your units actually attack enemies along the way is very hit-or-miss.

Everything else is the same (for worse) or just worse. The soundtrack is a watered-down version of the original, albeit with realistic-sounding instruments. The path-finding is still atrocious, and there's really no excuse for that in the current year. Sometimes, if you order a spread-out of group units to a location, the centroid of the group will move to that location while the units maintain their position relative to each other, rather than all units converging on that location like you wanted. Often, this leads to units going the opposite direction of where you just clicked and wandering off into enemy fire. Moving units across the map takes an unnecessary amount of micro. Trying to get units onto a transport ship is like herding cats. Priests still have infinite lock-on. They added a new unit to the barracks, which makes it more annoying that they couldn't have incorporated gates like in AoE2. The game offers the option to play on ""classic mode,"" with the original graphics and music. Only, I'm old enough to remember that the graphics on my Windows 98 machine weren't THAT terrible. It would be nice if you could play the original soundtrack with the upgraded graphics, like StarCraft 2.

What's more obvious is how little Microsoft, Forgotten Empires, and Xbox Game Studios cared about this Definitive Edition.

The old voice over sounds for units in the original release of Age of Empires are much better, in my opinion. Also, the old voice overs would bring nostalgia and familiarity for players. 

If developers could add old voice over sounds and old fighting sounds that would be great. Maybe a toggle within the menus to switch between ""Classic sounds"" and ""Definitive Edition sounds."" Also a toggle to disable the new voice over reading of the text before each campaign scenario. It's bad.

The original Age of Empires was one of the best RTS games of this era, though not perfect.

It's a disgrace to the CD era that it tries to pay homage to. Disc games had to be shipped without bugs, because they couldn't be patched back then. The units in AOEDE get stuck against eachother (or objects) constantly, and go the long way to destinations (if they don't get stuck in a loop).

Villagers can go idle without showing as idle, sometimes just standing on the building outline you ordered them to build. Sometimes military units don't fight back when attacked, and priests won't heal nearby units, but your catapults will take the initiative and kill your own units. Sometimes units run off and do their own thing across the map.

You can't select a unit behind another unit. Your units don't even obey orders, like if you order a unit to attack a catapult, it'll just attack the storage pit next to it (and then get hit by the catapult). The enemy AI can micromanage each unit though - sending them to pick off all your villagers and dodging any missile launched at them.

Enemy towers that have less range stats than your units somehow fire back at your unit's maximum range. The campaign could have had some work, as it has the potential to be a fun way to walk through history, but their gameplay design is frustrating (made worse if the objectives don't work).

Match outcome feels far too impacted by the wonky generated maps. AI micromanages each unit to dodge shots and target your villagers whilst growing an economy, until they stop doing anything at all or just resign when you get near their base. If the AI doesn't resign then you have to tediously kill each last unit that tries to avoid you.

The game doesn't like to minimize. Units can become invisible. Resources can be invisible on the minimap, or appear on the minimap when they're no longer on the map itself. The achievements are poor - like train 1,000 of a specific upgrade of unit. Some units can fire over hills, while others can't but will keep trying without moving.

I think they even messed up the nostalgia factor - the menu and graphics look too little like the original, and the music doesn't sound as I remember it. The RTS genre is so under-served that despite all these issues there's still a playable game underneath it all, as too many later RTS games added pointless mechanics that weighed them down.

One of the great things about the original Age of Empires games was that they were well polished, but this digital release is a sore disappointment in terms of quality. I might play it sometimes, but digital downloads should have been better; more convenient, not worse. Much like AOE2HD (which gets really choppy) they'll leave the issues in, and by 2023 it's still terrible.",1567730010,1674614265,False,29,8,0.554059386253356934,0,True,False,False

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Two of the campaigns are effectively unplayable for casual play, on account of the initial scenario in each being practically impossible for anyone except those used to the highest difficulty. Unfortunately I've played way more hours than indicated, and it's made little difference. 

Seems to me that the game has no tolerance for players who'd prefer a fair fight, or to develop their civilisation without having to worry about being spammed by every opponent on the map. As others have noted, AI opponents appear to be better resourced from the beginning; and it seems they are set to attack the player rather than each other. Sorry, but if I'd wanted to be flayed alive every game, I'd play PvP. 

I'd like to see an update that fixes this issue, but it's been four years already, so that's doubtful. Unless you're an extreme RTS player, avoid this one. Shame, because otherwise it has a lot going for it. 2/5",1671328745,1671328745,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well, I think it does, since is an updated version of the classic game with better graphics and better quality soundtrack. The original version of this game was my childhood, and seeing it with better quality makes me feel happy. 

Most of the campaigns are really good, and playing with different civilizations being unique in some ways makes it much better. If you are someone who loves classic history, this will leave you a good taste.

Gameplay is really well done and easy to learn. You can play with only mouse or with the hotkeys. You have some units that are unique for some civilization, but the system is similar: barracks, town center, houses, etc...

Graphically has the same ambience to the classic Age of Empires, yet it looks cleaner and more fluid than the original game. 

Soundtrack is trully a blessing to hear. You have the original OST but remastered, so it sounds fresh and new.

Archievements are not impossible to get. Some of them are just about finishing campaigns, or doing a specific activity or just creating units. 

And price? Worths it. Yeah, sales are good, but for full price the purchase is not a sin. You have tons of game hours with the campaigns and (if you want) many hours of multiplayer matches.

Age of Empires is really a nice strategy game and one of the most important titles in its genre, and if you are not fan from this kind of games, I recommend you to at least try it. Just think that this game was the first of many strategy games",1636547260,1671061584,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

Definitive Edition breathes some new life into the classic game. Game looks now more beautiful than ever before, and the newly composed music gives it its own identity, while still retaining its distinctive character.

- PHOTON MAN and BIGDADDY, remember these cheats? Everyone loved these. They were lazy with this remake, they didn't bother to remake the graphics of these characters. Instead their graphics looks worse than in the original, because of the higher resolution.
- In custom game mode, you can activate the classic graphics, but they look worse than in the original game, because there is no appropriate resolution.
- The AI is broken. Your computer opponent cheats like hell. You can see that if you reveal the map in custom game mode. Therefore the game is too difficult and sometimes very unfair.

- GRAPHICS -
The graphics in this game are smooth and crisp, but if you zoom in they get a bit muddy and blurry. Other than that, I think this game's graphics are magnificent. 10/10

- GAMEPLAY -
The pathfinding AI in this game is awful. Every time I order a unit to move somewhere it takes the LONG WAY, or tries to find a nonexistent shortcut to the destination and waste time, or just bugs out and stands there midway through its walking animation. Also I think the difficulty in this game is hard, even on easy (or that could just be me being extremely bad at aoe1), but it feels so rewarding when I complete a mission (that usually takes up more than 30 minutes of my time). Other than that complaint about the AI, the gameplay is rewarding and compels me to play the game more. 8/10

- SOUND EFFECTS AND MUSIC -
I think the sound effects are a bit annoying and grating (except WOLOLO), but they're growing on me. I also don't like the music that much, it only plays a select few tracks that it feels like I've heard over a billion times now (I'm looking at you, 'I Shall Return'), and even when I haven't heard them a lot they still sound mediocre. But the other tracks that I almost never hear actually sound good, it's just a shame that they never play for me. 6/10

The formation is a bit weird. When troops move in a group they seem to stay in the current formation rather than gather to a spot. I don't see a formation button like in AOE 2. I don't remember if this was like this in the original game but it definitely should have been changed.

Two details that I personally found especially off-putting are that the artstyle assigned to half the civilisations don't match said civilizations at all, and then that most of the scenarios don't have much scenario in them, their historical setting feeling arbitrarily assigned afterwards.

It helped fuel my fascination with ancient history and civilisations, which I am still passionate about all these years later. Don't be fooled by the time I've spent on this modern remake (which is excellent despite some minor problems here and there). I've poured countless hours into the original. 

So, is this version actually the Definitive Edition? Not really, but it does an admirable job. if anything it does a far too faithful recreation of the original from 1997 at times, as it imports some of the bugs, poor pathfinding and weak creative design decisions of the original into this newer edition. Hopefully Microsoft will foray back into this period in the future with a new edition, like they did with AOE IV regarding the Middle Ages. Fans of the original will enjoy jumping back into this game for nostalgic reasons, but newer players, or those that started with AOE II will find this game rather lacklustre and unpolished in comparison to Age of Kings or Age of Mythology. 

The new HD graphics are a faithful rendition of the original, and the new reworked soundtrack is a joy to listen to as well. Luckily the old soundtrack and graphics are included too. The missions have been given something of reworking as some scenarios play out a little bit different from the originals, which can cause some problems as the a.i struggles at points (The Holy Man mission from the voices of Babylon campaign comes to mind). They're still enormous fun to play, and I raced through the Egyptian and Greek campaigns. The only new content is the Hittites campaign, which is basically a re-imagining of scenarios included on the demo version of the game from 1997. 

I can't express how much I enjoy this game, and all the fun it has brought me over the years. It's one of my absolute favourite games of all time, and certainly the most influential. Even though I don't play it as often as I did when I was younger, it still lives on in my thoughts. Even the sound effects are utterly iconic (Wolololo, Rogan? Zookontah!) and the music is evocative. A very big thumbs up from me.

What is unique here? You can Play MP with your friend to make the game even more enjoyable. Thank you for restoring the classic.
The scenarios were breatheless and amazing
The graphics look amazing and beautiful. You can even restore the old graphics if you want.
Tons of Civilizations and empires from all walks of life (Not just Greece and Rome)
Some of the Historical information does not always make sense? When did Persians use Elephant warriors (not that common actually)
Fun for the whole family: Why? Bigdaddy, Bigmomma, Pow, ICBM. LOL remember these? They were codes that could use to summon special units. They do work. However, Don't you dare use them because that disables achievements! Also cheating is not right but still I am happy they put them there.

And I wish it was the only problem, but boi, let me start from the very beginning. While I absolutely love AoE II and admit that it is far superior game, the first AoE is my favourite nevertheless. It was my first RTS and the 3rd game at all (2 others and NFS2 and Captain Claw). I can't even imagine how much time I spent playing it in my childhood. As you can see, Age of Empires is special for me. But when it comes to Definitive Edition...

At first, when I launched it, I was excited as a kid. Finally: my favourite game, on modern hardware, huge screen, with modern graphics. Unfortunately this excitement ended abruptly and very soon. Right in the 2nd mission of Egyptian campaign. This is where I've seen [b]that[/b]. Pathfinding. Look, I will not pretend that everything was great with pathfinding in the original. Absolutely not. It indeed had problems. Units could do some stupid things. But here is the thing - 25 years passed! 

From DE that comes 25 years later, you expect not just better visuals, but at least some techical and gameplay improvements. But in fact, pathfinding here is even worse! Your stepunits literally stuck [b]inside[/b] each other. You can unstuck them only via 'delete' button. Or, they can start infinitely walking into the edge of the map. Forever. Have you seen that gif in the community, where peasant is infinitely walking around unfinished buiding? - that's not a rare AI bug, that's rather usual situation.

But enough about pathfinding. Let's talk about mapdesign. And... it's hits and misses. Most of the maps remained more or less the same, and that's kinda good. They also improved some, let's say, inexpressive maps. And they removed some clearly stupid things, like Perseus hero in Yamato campaign. That's also a good thing. The problem is, they also totally butchered some iconic maps. Remember that mission with the temple on the hill, in Yamato campaign? Map was huge, mountain was very tall. Reaching the top was a hard task. True pilgrimage! And now what? - you reach the mountain, left, right and here is your temple.

Or, remember ""I'll be back mission"" from Greece campaign? That was... something. Running away like beaten up dog, tresspassing hostile lands, ambushes at every corner and in the end - you finally reach your allies. You regroup, heal your wounds and start retaking lost territory. And what a satisfying moment it was, when you finally reach initial location and raze that cursed temple... It's all gone in DE. You just run little down, to the left and hop - here is your huge base with tons of resources... Meh. 

One more thing that leaves sour taste after you play the campaigns - AI. And man, it's really bad. In original, even moderate AI could mentally crush you, while here the hardest AI is dumb as a cork. Only few missions here can give you some challenge. I supppose it's bugged, because sometimes if you save/load or restart mission, it becomes more agressive. Probably something triggers him to be more active. But in versus AI is clearly better.

Next issues I'll put in ""lazyness, negligence and indifference"" cathegory. Where do I even start... remember warships? All of them had oars. Here, they animated oars for triremes. Sounds cool, right? I also think so. The problem is - that's the only type of vessels they animated. [deep breath] How can you explain this? They animated one type of ships and probably decided: ""ah, that's enough, or the game will be too good"". Or Microsoft gave them so few money, that they could animate only one ship?

Also, when ballistas and triremes shoot their projectiles, upon hitting target they transform into... stones. As if they were launched from the catapults. How can this be explained? Everything is ok, right? Definitely not a bug, yeah? No need to fix?
And what's wrong with elefant's attacking animation? He is shaking as if he was electrocuted. BTW, a word about attacking animations. In original, almost all units had 8(!!!) different attacking animations for each direction of attack. Here, each of them has only 1.

The last drop for me was MP. And I mean network issues. You enter lobby, bam! - disconnected. (XBox something something - I don't even have XBox account, why I get such messages?) You successfully ended the game - get a desync. You start 3vs3 or 4vs4 game - somebody already lost connection. Playing intense match for 20-30 mins - desktop. FYI, I don't have such issues with AoE II DE and even with AoE II (2013). 

Also... ah, guess what? I said enough. Let's make some conclusions. What did we get? Modern visuals? - yeah. Music? - well, they changed few iconic melodies, but overall quality is good. Destruction? - nice. The rest - clearly worse. 25 years. The first game in the legendary franchise... It had to become something big. Instead, DE of my favourite RTS is rotting on the outskirts of Steam with 10-20 people in MP. If you think that I'm too harsh or unfair - just compare it to AoE II DE.

And I don't even blame Microsoft. M$ is just a bottomless money bag and totally incompetent as a publisher. Always was. Even now, they bought lots of studios and franchises and have no idea what to do with them. I blame Forgotten Empires team. I realise that probably they have not as much experience as Ensemble Studios. But I could not imagine that they will handle AoE so negligently. For me, to pretend that these issues do not exist, is to betray good memories of the original game.

***   ***   ***

Updated. You know, that fact that I had to leave this negative review last time left a taste of regret. But after investing more time into the game (mostly in multiplayer) I regret only one thing - that I can't make 100 more negative reviews and downvote this joke of remaster into oblivion.

Why? Because overall multiplayer experience is just pathetic. I won't even adress that fact that it lacks tons of obligatory features and it is half-dead in general, no. I'm going to talk only about technical aspects - constant crashes are making the game unplayable. It seems like it has something to do with their server maintenance. Sometimes they kinda improve the situation, sometimes - make it even worse. 

In mid September - early October game worked almost perfectly - almost 0 crashes. But since previous maintenance it became totally unplayable. 6 crashes yesterday and 4 more today. In the last 4x4 sesion I played, [b] two [/b] players from the same team got disconnected right in the beginning. This is unbearable. I give up.
 
On top of that, the game is not protected from griefers who spam pause button. These little pests keep spamming pause or constantly switching game speed back and forth, what crashes the game for other players. Thus, if you failed to deliver worthy remaster of once legendary game, at least fix what'd already done.

multiplayer is off so game became totally unplayable; AI is broken - easy difficulty doesn't allow you to enjoy the game, you neeed to grind and farm hard to be able to take struggle in any scenario (which is unseen in any other age of empires games - in those ai is rather too easy than too hardcore).
AI on hardest is less aggresive but still it is pain in the ass later on so I feel like it is messed up inside code or smt

- Formations: no formation button and units do not go into formation by default, instead choosing to move as they were when selected.
- Trading resources: the market only has technologies. On water maps you get the merchant ship but land maps will run out of gold eventually, along with stone and wood, and without wood, food.
- Waypoints: impossible to make an order queue (e.g.: shift+click to order a villager to build two buildings then go back to work).
- Unique units/heroes: civilizations are differentiated by a handful of bonuses and a lack of technologies and units (e.g.: Greeks do not have the composite bowmen upgrade, but Babylonians do).

Other than the lack of unique units, I feel like the above features should have been added to even qualify as  a ""Definitive Edition""; but I'd consider them minor issues were it not for the true abysmal issue: AI pathing. It's so bad it's almost unbelievable. AoE2 and 3 have it nowhere near this bad. A usual case is if an enemy unit is moving in a straight line and you order your unit to attack it by right clicking on the enemy unit, unless it's on a direct collision course with the enemy, it will walk to where the enemy unit was standing the moment the order was issued and then some times start chasing the already gone unit or just keep walking.

Music, visuals, pathfinding, campaign missions... all somehow feels better in the patched original.

Especially pathfinding.... I'm not sure what the problem here is? It is freakin' Dijkstra and I have the CPU equivalent of a full NASA server farm in my midi tower, compared to back in the day. Please utilize that, ffs.
We can see the same villager-problems as in AOE2 DE, with vils getting stuck in each other, unable to resolve the problem for seconds at times (just to be repeated for the next resource drop-off).
You can spot things that should never happen, like units giving up searching for a path after being blocked 2-3 times. user-patch already upped the retries, lowered the time between pathing attempts and overall created a smoother feeling pathfinding system than we got in DE. WITHOUT ACCESS TO THE SOURCE CODE !

I played the campaigns side by side at some point to see how it feels, and both are horribly trial-and-error for modern standards (especially when compared to AOE2). But DE adds a weird layer of buggy AI that seems to either do nothing, or go completely crazy, rushing max age and hitting you with everything they got, no matter where you are on the map. It's the worst in those ""limited-army"" or ""one-monk"" starting scenarios.
Even with improved missions when it comes to eye candy and overall map design, those issues again make me recommend the original instead.

The new visuals are great, especially with what underlying systems they had to work with. Still, the originals fit the clunky gameplay better. I feel a 1997 game, and I see a 1997 game. No fluff.
The problem: You can ONLY switch to the original graphics set when playing skirmish... WHAT THE ACTUAL F*** ???
On top of that, there are bugs (trees without shadows, wrong sprites for the shore line), and you are not allowed to zoom. You can only choose a resolution and stretch the sprites to fill it (== zoom in/out). Why? How is that a ""Definitive"" edition? The user-patched version achieves the same with less bugs.

Music is fine. But why is there not a button to switch between the original and modern tracks. Or mix them? Again: ""DEFINITIVE"" should mean grab and preserve what is there, improve what you want to improve as optional changes, then put a sensible price tag on it.

The only REAL positive feature I can list is the updated farming system. It's basically AOE2's system, allowing to walk over farms and have them auto-reseed.

TLDR: Half-arsed modernization attempt. Stick to the [url=https://upatch-hd.weebly.com/]user-patched[/url] original or get it cheap in addition to the original. No substantial patches since release.",1567430032,1661014299,False,1,0,0.530201315879821777,0,True,False,False

I was playing Microsoft Combat Flight simulator on my Windows 98 computer and in the introduction menu had an option for demos. In it included Monster Truck Madness 2, Motorock Madness, and this game. At first I thought this was a biblical game considering the civilizations of the Egyptians and Babylonians. Not to mention the fishing boats resembling Noah's ark and the priests resembling ones depicted. I opened the demo campaign where you played as the Egyptians fighting the Greeks and destroying their town center. I had no idea how to play and I kept sending Soldiers one by one to destroy the buildings and they kept dying. It wasn't until I accidentally dragged a whole bunch of them by mistake and sending all at the same time to the enemy base, destroying everything. I thought it was one of the coolest things I ever saw. It was than I also played the Hittite campaign though I never beat all of them since I wasn't good at creating a base and fighting off the enemies.

I ended up getting Age of Empires II: Age of kings as a surprise gift for good grades and the I stuck with that game. a few years later I ended up getting the dual pack CD that included the first game with the rise of Rome Edition and discovered more fun with that.

REALLY WISH they created new Civilizations in the definitive edition as well as new units, new research techs, and maps as well as porting more quality of life improvements from the 2nd game to here. Other Civilizations certainly exited in this time period such as the Olmecs, Huns, Celts, Harappan, Akkadians, and more that exist as enemies in the campaign already. 

Only a few things were brought like passable farms, idle villagers, and military stances (ones I can think of at the top of my head). Of course the one issue that has existed since the beginning is the Path finding, which I think is the hardest to fix since the game is older than the 2nd game.

How can the AI afford to get to Bronze age AND build an army of 10-15 units to attack you?

Update:
I revealed the map with cheats to see what they are actually doing during the first few minutes and i could not believe my eyes ...  They build 4 Huts, a Storage and Grain Silo, send some villagers off to reveal the map and send their other villager off to get food, while simultaneously creating new villagers until they are at 24 ... Every new villager is instantly sent to hunt for food ... WTF? Thats so much micromanagement in the first few minutes, that a human can never achieve ... or at least not in a way that is actually fun to play ... 
If you don't do it like this you can play for 10 more minutes then they will be already in the bronze age, have an army of 10-15 units and come attack you, while you are still in the Tool age with no army ...

First off, I strongly disagree with the negative reviews mostly citing the bad pathfinding to justify their rating. I don't see how, on a scale of 1-100, that ""issue"" alone warrants a deduction of 50+ points. Especially if you're a fan of the original AoE and should be used to that behavior. But maybe that's just how I do my ratings. I guess it comes down to a difference in expectations.

It didn't take away from my experience at least: It's a lot of fun and just how I remember it. Even if you're not into online play, you'll get your money's worth out of dozens of campaign hours. WOLOLO.

At the time of this games release I would say it was one of the worst remakes or ""Definitive Editions"" I had ever bought. I loved the original Age of Empires, the style, the love and effort put into the little details, everything. And this remake didn't live up to the nostalgia. If you want to read my original review, I've left it at the bottom so you can see how I experienced the game when it was first released on Steam. 

Since then I have actually got it to work and still found issues with it: Pathfinding is still appalling, the hitboxes for mouse clicks are oddly finicky: try and send a lumberjack to cut down and tree and he will occasionally develop a love for staying at bark..., the frame rate at times was down right atrocious, dipping into single digits, and the AI was either mentally brain dead or an omniscient god, sending troops across the entire map despite the fact that they had never scouted you out yet. Yes I despised playing this game a lot of the time. 

But then I thought to myself: did I really enjoy the gameplay when I first experienced Age of Empires all those years ago? Yes of course I did, because I didn't have anything to compare it to. Don't get me wrong the original Age of Empires was a monumental game, a monolith of the RTS genre, but it hasn't aged well. Most of the issues I find with this Definitive Edition are there purely BECAUSE it is Definitive. It is a remake of the game as it was balanced all those years ago. Could it have done with a lick of paint? Sure. Maybe make Axemen useful after the Tool Age, some added bonuses that make Camel Riders a unit worth investing in more than 5% of the time, some changes to Chariot Archers that make them less infuriating to defend against a rush of. But it wouldn't have been DEFINITIVE.

Yes there are other things I find problems with: as an avid Scenario Creator, the tools you are given (or rather lack there of) especially in regards to the Scenario Instructions section is just mind boggling. The art style seems ""muddied"" for lack of a better phrase, especially when you zoom in. 

But I cannot truly hate this game. When it was released I certainly did. I will stand by my belief that releasing it on Steam was a last ditched attempt to boost up sales (we had been asking for it to be released for Steam for a year and a half to almost no avail) and when it was finally unveiled it was atrocious. But a small team HAS been steadily fixing and adjusting it. But you can only polish a broken vase so much to make it shine. 

OLD REVIEW YET STILL SORT OF APPLICABLE - Yet another highly anticipated release marred by a publisher greedy for cash. I, like many other Age of Empires fans was incredibly excited to see this game was in progress, and as a fan who found many problems with the original games despite my adoration for them, was looking forward to seeing those issues addressed.

First red flag was the pushed back date of release. Now this isn't always an issue, see A Hat in Time and Cuphead for examples why it can be a good thing at times. However, it usually indicates a company is trying to push a game out for a certain date but realises that the product is not up to Steam (amazing pun I know). Second red flag was that when it was finally released it was a Games for Windows Live exclusive, suggesting that Microsoft wanted to force people to use their frankly useless service for more money.

And so we waited, and waited, and commented on every post that we could ""AoE IV is good and all but can you spend like 5 mins to release AoE DE on Steam?"". And then at last NEARLY ONE AND A HALF YEARS LATER, we get AoE DE on Steam. And it's a sh*t show.

I have only 7 minutes clocked in on this game and that will give you one of two reactions to this review: A) He doesn't know what he's talking about, or B) God this game must be really awful. And both are valid points. On the one hand I didn't get enough time to experience things like path-finding or gameplay bugs or tweaks. But on the other, the fact that I got a refund 7 MINUTES IN tells you that something is seriously off to dissuade a fan such as myself.

The biggest issue for me, as well as many others, is the fact that the game clashes with many other programs most notably antivirus software. The solution should be simple but as I am using a free trial version of Avast means I can't actually whitelist this game so I cannot play it. So you may think ""That's a you problem"" but the fact that the game was released in a state in which vast portions of its playerbase cannot even run the thing for more than 5 minutes astounds me.",1566266760,1656409743,False,32,2,0.56043398380279541,2,True,False,False

It feels like a different game entirely, but at the same time it managed to keep the soul that made the original 1997 title so great.

This isn‚Äôt to say there aren‚Äôt issues, though. I‚Äôve found some shortcuts really difficult to use and I had to tweak most of them to be able to take advantage. Some unit commands don‚Äôt seem to work at all, such as ‚Äústand ground‚Äù, which some units insist on ignoring. Pathfinding is another problem, but even that was absent in the original game and, in some way or another, it forces the player to micromanage a little so it isn‚Äôt all that bad.

I absolutely love the fact that Age of Empires is based on the world‚Äôs history, even if there‚Äôre inaccuracies. I didn‚Äôt play all the campaigns, but the Tutorial (based on the Egyptians) and the first one (based on the Greeks) were a joy to go through. The narrator does a pretty decent job to give some background info before each mission. There‚Äôre real world maps, hints and further history insights for every campaign scenario, which is something that one mustn‚Äôt ignore to fully enjoy this game.

Some companies should do their homework and learn how to do remasters like Forgotten Empires. It is safe to say that Age of Empires: DE isn‚Äôt only a timeless classic, but also a masterpiece of how to properly reimagine a game in the modern era. Everything is done correctly here: skirmish against AI, online multiplayer, LAN (!), ranked matches, custom campaigns and so on.

There are lots of single player campaigns, so plenty of content. But in some scenarios, the difficulty is unbalanced. Like, first you are strolling through the scenarios, and then suddenly the AI goes bonkers, and you'll find yourself save-scumming a lot.

Multiplayer is practically dead. Unfortunately, one achievement requires winning a ranked multiplayer match. So that sucks for 100% achievement hunters.

The lobbies are barren and empty and the game hasn't had a patch for ages. Again, it was to test the waters and die since barely anybody cared about 1. The game fixed a lot of issues like villagers not auto-tasking, but the game still lacks a method of generating infinite resources so it's incredibly easy for the game, especially island games, to run out of resources.

I played the original AoE1 and it's Trail version (Hittie Campaign) and I appreciate the remake of the game to modern standards. However I feel more affected by the cons than the pros. :/

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- Unit PATHFINDING is VERY BUGGY, sometimes resulting in units blocking themselves while moving or standing; villagers sometimes cannot find way to a resource they previously accessed;  This sometimes requires spending time on manual controlling units every second step (and grants even more frustration)
  (I also have a feeling like it's not just the pathfinding but also unit-to-map size ratio that's an issue here)
- Player Unit AI stances don't seem to perform well - aggressive unit can start attacking after being hit first
- The change of campaign mission intro screen seems to have little place for text and I find the audio intro (and outro) somewhat irritating
- For people looking for the original feel of AoE it might come a bit of a dissapointment at first since unit sounds and interface have been significantly changed (building icons for example)

The campaigns are long, some of them do not have base building, and missons can be a pain in the ass because you have to manually form them in some kind of order, only to see itl brake on the first tree or enemy your units will find.

AI is intresting, once you steamroll everything on your path, you will find the enemy AI vills are just standing still. All the time you will see that units like to first pass eachother than do 180 and after that ritual is done they fight, not really the deginitive edition in my opinion.

1. Graphics
2. Sound
3. Gameplay improvements 
    a.) The ability for each building to produce soldiers separately
    b.) The rally point for buildings
    c.) Villagers are a bit smarter and try to not remain idle
    d.) The information the game gives (idle villagers and how many villagers are gathering each resource)
I'm sure there are other improvements that I don't know about since I barely played this version of the game.
4. Voiceover in the campaigns

Cons
1. Pathfinding, although it's a bit improved
2. There are very little differences between civilizations in terms of unique units and there are some units that feel out of place. For example everyone has hoplites, which was the main greek soldier and greeks do not have a better archer than the bowman which is considered a ""trash"" unit.
3. The campaigns don't offer much variety


Summary
If you played the initial version of the game and liked it and want to feel the nostalgia, then you will definitely like this one because it's the same game with better graphics, better sound and better gameplay. You might also like to play the game if you are new to the series, it's not a bad start, but play it first because the other games are better and you might dislike it otherwise.

Personally, although I finished the original version of the game, I found it to be more of a chore rather than a fun experience. I played it for the sake of playing all the series. I can't say this version of the game is bad by any means, but I found the overall experience just ok. I find the pathfinding problems frustrating. I also felt that all the civilizations were mostly the same with minor differences and I found the unit inaccuracies annoying.  The overall gameplay is just a little outdated in comparison with today's standards and the campaigns don't offer a lot of variety to keep me interested. Age of mythology is a much better game in my opinion and each civilization feels and plays differently. When you play with the greeks, you instantly know you play with the greeks, when you play with the vikings or the egyptians, you instantly know it. I just can't find the will to replay the same boring campaigns just because the graphics, the sound and a few aspects of the gameplay are better.",1650766195,1650766602,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On the one hand, it absolutely looks like you might have wanted it to in your mind's eye 25 years ago when Age of Empires came out, with a (small) number of tweaks to QOL (I think the reseed farms button is new) while still being mostly faithful to the old game. It includes all of the original game, Rise of Rome, and two reworked campaigns from the demo, and all the associated civs for online and comp-stomp play, giving it a fair bit of meat for your money. I got to see a lot of stuff I'd never seen before, experience a lot of stuff I'd never experienced before. Some of the missions here are a ton of fun. (Turning Archimedes' fabled sunlight reflectors defending Syracuse into laser towers for the sake of a video game was inspired.) On the other...it is indeed faithful to the old game, kind of to a fault.

The missions here have been tweaked, remixed, and occasionally rearranged or replaced, but you still have to contend with the limitations of 1997: a low population cap, wonky AI (despite admirable efforts), and a general lack of strategic options compared to AOE 2. This results in the difficulty curve being all over the shop irrespective of which order you play campaigns or missions: one of the hardest missions in the entire game is the first Hittite scenario, which the tutorial campaign subtly points you toward at its conclusion, while the very last Rise of Rome mission chronologically (The Coming of the Huns, here remade to resemble the Catalaunian Fields scenario from AOE 2) becomes piss-easy after dealing with the early Wonder rush.

It's a fun piece of gaming history, and clearly since I saw it through to completion so I didn't *dislike* it. It's just frustrating sometimes when the old mechanics wind up not quite holding up the way your nostalgic brain wants them to.",1649784884,1649784884,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I didn't play the original 1997 version so it's hard for me to compare the 2 of them but I can say from what little I do know this version fixes problems the original had such as the famous problem with farms counting as an actual building which would prevent units from walking through them (which you can turn back on funny enough) but you still have to deal with the bare bone unit commands like they have AOE2 (attack stance, guard, different unit group layouts, etc etc) and honestly quite terrible path finding and just dumb units period. This game does have both singleplayer stuff and online stuff though I dont believe the community is much there but I could be wrong, speaking of that we got the CIVs you got all the ones from the original base game and ""Rise of Rome"" expansion no new CIVs sadly but the ones you get do the job and keep the game to it's semi original balance. So overall I'm sure you noticed I've used the word ""original"" A LOT that's really cause all and all it IS THE SAME GAME just with fixes to old problems and with newer clean graphics that look okay so I mean if you love the AOE games or just feeling super nostalgic this is really the best to play and the only to get the game do I recommend this over AOE2 not really I'm with most people and feel that 2 is 100 times better than 1 but it's not the worst game so I still keep what I said previously.",1649222010,1649222010,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Just kidding, it's not, but I do have a pretty funny memory related to this game that I want to share. When I was a kid, one of my older cousins brought me to one of those internet cafe places and told me to play Age of Empires with him. I can't really remember why he wanted me to, since I barely knew how to even play the game at that time, so I guess he just wanted me to become his punching bag or something. We played our first game and to no surprises, I was trailing behind pretty far at first. But then out of nowhere, there was this random dude who stood behind me and told me that he wanted to offer his help with the game for some reasons. I agreed, and after about 10 minutes or so, he overran my cousin's army and completely destroyed him. He was pretty mad about it and walked toward my desk and told that dude to let me play by myself. I wasn't reacting to any of this, but from the inside I was having a blast about it lol. That was my fondest memory I ever had with Age of Empires, and even though it was never my thing back then, I'll always remember the moment when my cousin got destroyed by a total stranger every time I think about this franchise.

Fast forward to the present. When I heard the news that they were going to make a Definitive Edition for the game, I was pretty stoked and couldn't wait to try the game out. I wanted to see how much they have improved over the original one, relive some of my childhood memories, and lay this theory that I would never get good with it to rest once and for all. Turns out, I couldn't, because I still sucks at this game lol. Age of Empires: Definitive Edition reminds me of the main reason why I can never get into RTS games: Too many things to worry about at one time. Yeah.. Multitasking has never been my strong suit, but I will say that out of the 19 hours of playing (Finishing the tutorial and the first campaign), I did manage to have some fun with the game. Ain't nothing like eviscerating every single AI's units, then building Wonder and feeling like a complete douchebag am I right? The game overall looks good and works well, though sometimes when I was moving a large number of units, some of them were starting to behave weirdly. I heard this is an issue with the AI pathfinding that was presented even in the original game, but since I never was a serious player, it didn't bother me too much.

Normally in my review I would point out some pros and cons of a game, then give the final rating, but I don't feel like doing that with Age of Empires: Definitive Edition since I barely scratched the surface of it. However I did enjoy my time with the game and would recommend to anyone who's new to the franchise, as long as you have some interest with the RTS genre, unlike me lol. But if you are a hardcore RTS/AoE fan then consider getting the second game instead, I heard it's a much better product than this one.

The sound effects are perfect, makes the game feel the right amount of chaotic when battle starts up. But it's also fun to just watch your villagers shuffle around and gather resources. I love the new graphics, it's such a nice step up from the original.
I'm glad the Definitive Edition has the tech tree in game. I spent so many years not knowing what civ did what because the original had it separate from the game.

What I wish though, was that this 'Definitive"" edition did more. It's almost too faithful to the original? There are some lovely QoL they did add, like reseeding farms and the ability to production chain techs and units. I would love more maps, especially the MegaRandom map option from AoE2DE. What we got feels so bare compared to the love and attention the sequel got. Also strange that the game doesn't ""remember"" the last civ you played in skirmish, or that you have to keep clicking the reseed farms button every match. 

I am thankful this Definitive Edition is much more lax when it comes to using cheats in campaign, the other DE releases clamp down on it. Just let the player decide if they want to cheat or not in single player.

Overall though, I love AoE1. It may not ""historically accurate"" in areas, but it was made in a time when computer space was at a premium.",1647096837,1647096837,True,0,0,0.474664777517318726,0,True,False,False

The updated visuals, controls, and UI have been a welcome addition to the game that had me waking up early before school to play.

However, I am hesitant to recommend the title for those who are not interested in the nostalgia trip.  The gameplay feels a bit clunky compared to many modern titles.  With slower units and frustrating path finding, a match can get a little frustrating.  Especially compared to the polish seen in AoE II and beyond.  If you can get past that there is a fun historical campaign with a nice narration to enjoy.  It is also always fun to play in an ancient worlds sandbox which is so rarely explored (Age of Empires Online does a great job however ‚Äì and it is free to play).

This game is great. This is the first one I played in the series and recently I got a copy of the very first version of this game. The graphics are definetly a step up from the original with a lot of elements from AoE 2 mixed with the gameplay mechanics introduced in The Rise of Rome expansion. The Campaigns are very good and the tutorial campaign taught me how to play this game very well and what I learnt from it has helped me play the other games in the series. The pathfinding and AI can be a bit annoying though with the AI sometimes being pretty challenging even at easier difficulties but challenge seems to be what makes up this franchise as a whole. In all that I've said I would 100% reccommend getting this game. 

My rating 8/10 (loses 2 points for AI and Pathfinding)

+ Tons of history lore. You can learn so much about ancient empires and civilizations.
+ 10 campaigns, that is a huge amount of content. Took me 77 hours to beat them all.
+ In each campaign you play as different civilization and each of them have different technology trees.
+ Gameplay is RTS and has pretty much what you'd expect from it, resource scavenging, building buildings, improving technology, demolishing enemy empire or empires. Because of different map variations you have to adapt to situations based on geography, recourses and civilization you're playing for and that's why the game never gets boring as in each level you have to use different tactics to defeat your enemies.
+ Improves over original game with many quality of life improvements to make it smoother to play.

- Troop pathfinding is terrible.
- I preffered graphics of original game, it was more colourful. Of course, it's nice that the textures are higher resolution now, but I wish it was less realistic looking and more colourful or at least let us choose the colour palette.

Age of Empires has a special place in my heart as it was the first RTS I ever played, courtesy of my grandmother receiving a free vanilla copy with her new laptop (circa 1999).  As a child, I didn't exactly understand what I was doing and this continued for the next 20 years as I would play the game on and off. Only since last year have I come to truly understand what I am doing through research and trial and error and it has made the game that much more enjoyable.

With that overview stated, let's talk about what makes this game what it is:
1. The improvement of the graphics is pleasing to the eye though if you want to take a trip down memory lane you can refer to the available classic mode which gives you the original experience for the most part. 
2. Farms now have the option of being solid (like buildings) or not (like AOE2 farms), the latter allowing you to maximize your economy and increasing your game-play experience.
3. Definitive Edition includes all DLC from the original game (which was a surprise to me; prior to my purchase of DE, I was unaware of any expansions.)
4. Many attack animations for the units have seemingly been removed with the introduction of DE which may leave you feeling at a loss concerning visual aesthetics. 
5. Possibly the biggest flaw, the AI seems to have taken a turn for the worse: ""handholding""  has almost become a necessity to increase lethality.  Pathfinding quite often causes your units to clump together and become stuck or even send them in the wrong direction altogether before correcting themselves. Even after this, sometimes intervention is necessary.
6. As AOE2 remains the proverbial Golden Goose (and with AOE4 now on the market), major updates for this game have ceased.
7. All buildings now allow unit construction/improvement research stacking which may also improve your experience as you no longer have to check in constantly to keep the ball rolling.

For those that are die-hard AOE2 fans, this installment will feel quite foreign to you. Some examples of this: 
1. The market system and build orders are drastically different. 
2. There are no unit formations.
3. The constructable units and buildings are fewer. 
This allows the game to be simpler and yet more challenging at the same time.

With all of this said, I would still recommend this game. It is highly enjoyable if taken with a grain of salt and knowing full well it has its kinks which, in all likelihood, will not be addressed by its producers.",1592160127,1642274898,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Half of the time I try to play online, we get sync errors and the game drops all players after about an hour. Losing all progress after an hour invested into the game is incredibly frustrating and makes the multiplayer unplayable.

I played Age of Empires when it was released in 1998 so purchase of the Definitive Edition was meant to be a trip of nostalgia. Playing Age of Empires now reminded me how far the series has come. There are so many quality of life improvements which aren't included, pathfinding is terrible, the AI poor, the UI feels clunky and the game itself hasn't aged well. 

If you want to play it for the nostalgia, sure, get it on special but be prepared for disappointment. If you are a new player, skip this one and rather play one of the other Age of Empires games. The series may have begun here and while AOE2 and AOE3 continually improved, it seems that AOE got left behind.",1639827909,1640167454,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game is fairly hard even on Moderate, some levels require tactics which take several attempts to find out. The game was rebalanced, some units, stats and upgrade paths were changed. The expansion is included, as well as some demo campaigns. There are achievements to unlock, some require a bit of grinding, but all of them can be collected.
The game has around 80-100 hours of content (largely depending on how meticulous your approach is to campaign levels).
The AI is not cheating (as some critics say) in terms of resources or unit production, but it does exploit its ability to do lots of tasks at once (like archers alternating between backing and shooting), which you have to find your own methods to counter.

You have only 50 of population limit, you get constantly raided from two AI players, both on land and on water (even with transport ships). You have to spare resources for your Wonder and then you have to destroy enemy wonder. No problem you will think? Well, if the AI has ton of heavy catapults with range 12+2, ton of monks with range 10+3 and you are not able to make more army than 25 it really sucks. You do not have heavy catapults, only stone throwers, if you will make cavalry, elephants, centurions, all gets smashed by heavy catapults WITH BALISTICS - so they will hit every target. And the cherry of the cake - your units are not able hold formations, and they are randomly stucking at each other and at terrain, sometimes the units got stuck for no reason.
So, this game cannot be compared to AoE 2, Stronghold, Command and Conquer etc. Even units in Total Annihilation are much more inteligent than in AoE 1 original and Definitive edition.

Graphics is great but AoE was always less about graphics and more about the gameplay. Key issues that are affecting the game are as follows.
1.  Pathfinding is terrible. Troops navigate so badly that it is often impossible to control them properly. 
2. Units can get stuck behind other units as every unit's occupied cell is quite big and often only a few troops can move simultaneously.
3. Troops don't always follow commands. I have troops in stand ground formation that keep moving around.
4. I have difficulty using transport ships. Safest way to load is one by one.
5. Priests have high variability is converting enemy units.
6. Sometimes when a resource is depleted, instead of going idle, villagers move into enemy areas and get killed.
7.  AI is weird, the enemies are sometimes tough even at easy level.

Even now the old AoE has a better gaming experience despite the screen resolution issues. I hope the other definitive editions ( AoE II and AoE III) are not this bad because I had bought them too.",1639482385,1639482385,False,4,0,0.532989561557769775,0,True,False,False

The new graphics and gameplay functionality are wonderful, and manages to bring back some of the childlike nostalgia of 20+ years ago. It is a great upgrade to the original game series... except for what I feel is one glaring flaw: the unfair AI scripts.

After 75+ hours playing the game, I can say with certainty that the AI are not designed to play according to the rules of the game. For one thing, they always know where all your units are at all times, despite never building or using a scout to explore the map. They'll know as soon as they ready their forces, where your defenses are weakest, and proceed to somehow walk right through a defensive perimeter full of opposing units to strike at the villagers hidden somewhere inside your territory. I've tested this by having a villager run across the map, and far out of line-of-sight of some much slower military units, only to have the AI perfectly follow my villager across the map and back. When a human player's unit loses LOS to a unit, they give up; meaning the AI get to play with no LOS... which leads to some very ridiculous situations in which they attack villagers in far away places they shouldn't even know are there.

On top of that, player-controlled units seem to behave differently to AI-controlled units. Whereas the AI units spread out and attack as normal, my own units often get stuck on themselves, or randomly wander off. My units often get stuck on each other, and are unable to move when 2 or more units end up partially inside each other. The AI don't seem to have that problem, despite having their base units and buildings in very close proximity to each other. Another issue I have sometimes, is where units I've put on Defensive stance randomly wander off from the location I've tasked them to, despite an absence of enemy units. They pick up and move to another location beyond their defend area.

In the last match I played before writing this, I also had issues with my units retreating from an opposing unit they're in melee with. I had a squad of 20 hoplites retreat from one nearby (range 3-5) elephant archer because one of their number was being shot with an arrow. Now, I know that is normal for melee units being attacked at range (on defensive stance), but why does the entire group move with him? That is unusual, especially in a remake of such an old game. They were well within their defensive area, and should attack any enemy that comes into it.

Lastly, I wouldn't be surprised to find that the AI receive free resources throughout the match. This seems to be the new standard in numerous Real-Time Strategy games (like Dawn of War series, Age of Empires series, Halo Wars series, Company of Heroes series, etc) for the past few years; and even old games are being updated this way. I'm guessing it's an easier way to program AI; for the developers. This wouldn't be a bad thing, especially for those who like a seemingly-impossible challenge, but there's no way to turn off this benefit, even on the lowest difficulties. For someone trying to learn how to play RTS's, this is a very steep learning curve, and I can't be the only one who feels this way.

I hope that this game, and other RTS's, will include better fairness and difficulty controls in the future. Video games like this one need to be more accessible for those who can't keep up with the modern gamer (People with disabilities, illness, etc), but still want to enjoy this beautiful piece of history.

Update 21-11-25: More than a year later, and they still haven't fixed anything that's wrong with this game.

In short, for those who know it, it's wonderful, for those who already play the genre and don't know it, get to know the advances that happened in RTS 20 years ago.

The battle on the battlefield, which the units perform, is to kill. You can easily clog an army in the strait and it will be hard to find a plug. The AI ‚Äã‚Äãof your units is as dull as a stump and you will control the units one by one during the campaign in tense moments for safety.
Sending an army across the map amounts to sheer madness. The legionnaire begins to admire the tree standing in the way, for the horserider becomes an insurmountable obstacle to a puddle of water, and so perhaps a third of the procession reaches the destination.
The pathfinding of the units does a mess on land and on water and does not make it as easy as getting on and off the transport ship. The units move chaotically around the vessel with their own enthusiasm before finally boarding. Appearance can also give you wrinkles on your forehead, if the shores are too close, it is possible that half the army will land on the original one.

I mean, I love the AOE franchise. This franchise is undoubtedly my past, present and future gaming-wise. AOE 1, however, is easily the weakest link. I mean, it's understandable that it is the weakest link given that, even with this remaster, this game is ANCIENT.

The pathing is an obvious one. It sucks, characters can't move through other characters, and their hitboxes are extremely blocky, so your units can easily get stuck or maybe they'll just pick an incorrect route altogether. This isn't really frustrating to me though, I can deal with that with some shift-clicks.

I will say though, the ancient setting is really well done. The visuals of this game feel really cool and really hits home a feeling like it nailed being in ancient Roman times.

The game suggests that you can do a free for all with the AI...... DON'T TRUST IT, FREE FOR ALL's DON'T EXIST!!! In short 1v1v1v1 = 1v3. AI behavior is highly debated in these kinds of games, though, so take that with a grain of salt.

I went into the game for the first time since a child, thinking that it would be a lot easier now that it's been many years and hundreds of hours of gameplay later. I had forgotten. This AI must have blackmailed a genie or something, because as soon as those creatures find you (even though it already knows where you are), they will proceed to sent a never ending avalanche of whatever crap they feel like training. Sometimes it's a tsunami of Hoplites, sometimes it's a downpour of archers, and god forbid it chooses monks as well. Do you remember that scene in World War Z, where the zombies pile up against the wall? It's like that.

If there's a hole in your wall, they will find it. When they find it, the cavalry pours through. When the cavalry pours through... I don't want to talk about it...",1635818826,1635818826,False,5,2,0.488641023635864258,0,True,False,False

 - Awesome units and army compositions. Everything feels useful and purposeful (though some more than others)
- Very aesthetically pleasing design, though lacking a little in diversity, not lacking at all in quality (not zoomed in of course)
 - More accurate to history campaigns than the original
 - Feels good most of the time

Cons
 - AI is simultaneously stupid and stupidly hard. Will micro every unit individually, yet won't fill transport ships with more than 5 units. Spams towers in random places for no reason, bum rushes your army with villagers, (some missions are broken because of that), occasionally just stops doing anything for extended periods of time. Will try to build a house right in the middle of your army, and yet ruthlessly stomp you if it can, when it can.
 - Some campaign missions suffer because methods aren't implemented to counteract their massively aggressive AI (The Holy Man and other similar ones specifically).
 - Occasional performance issues and graphical hiccups (Like all the map animations cycling back, visibly resetting)
 - Pathfinding suffers massively, constantly and painfully. I can't do it justice. While it's better than it was, it's still far, far from ideal and makes the quality suffer a great deal too.
 - Many of the achievements are horrible grindfests far beyond reasonable play. 500 heavy catapults? Seriously?
 
I love a lot of AOE: DE, but it has some serious teething issues with its AI and sometimes performance. Pathfinding is also a huge issue. That being said, I love the game's design, i love a lot of the history, themes and memories associated with it. It's rough, but it's a good hundred hours or so of fun if you don't mind dealing with some of it's issues. 

Overall, Don't expect this to be the best game. It's arguably the weakest in the series right now, and I don't see it getting any better (Yes, that includes AoM and the original AoE games), but for what it is, it can be fun. Once you're done with the campaigns, you'll likely struggle to find fun in the random map games due to the very limited map pool, along with the AI and pathfinding issues.

Word of warning though. The RTS genre advanced a long long way since AOE 1 came out. This might be a case of be careful what you wish for. AOE1's pathfinding was and is shocking. The addition of reseedable farms and idle villager buttons is a helpful concession to modern sensibilities but even prettied up AOE 1 is a bit samey and no longer a shining example of the genre.

I would recommend you play the original game, this gives you headache. (IMHO All AOE games are best played in original).

Negative:
Units gets stuck in each other!
Units do not enter boats properly!
Units walk opposite directions / press down 1 ""yard"" and your unit ends up on the other side of the map!
Units not stacking properly!

Positive:
Nostalgia *shrug*

I played for few mins and I saw what I wanted. The FPS is all over the place, elephant perpetually stays in some 12 or 10 FPS. Path finding is hideous, I placed a storage adjacent to the TC and one villager took the gap between the TC and storage so another villager who was supposed to take the other vacant space rotated all around the storage and took that position, its ridiculous. Villagers who are getting back to work after resource drop off, get stuck at TC when another villager is coming in with a resource drop off.

I expect premium products from Companies like MS with great quality and proper testing done. Sadly this is what I got.

At present I won't recommend this game but will update my review if this game updates near future along the time of AOE 2 HD release.

I got a refund on this game.

- Make the game run on modern systems (okay)

- Upgrade clunky gameplay and steering issues to enjoyable in modern comparison (WTF? FAIL!)

In defensive mode you still have to search your units at the other side of the map when leaving them to defend your base and so on. It is so highly annoying, I had to stop playing.

- The only negative thing was that I had some troubles when I first installed the game- after starting it, it just froze on the main menu screen and then crashed. That was fixed after I re-installed the game.
+/- Also, the codes for the game do work and if you used them the achievements will still be earned on Steam, if you figure out how to use them in the scenarios (unlike the AoE II: DE where if you use coder the achievements are disabled, hence you don't unlock them). This may count as a plus to people that want to go through the story of the campaigns quickly, but it kind of lowers the gratification from getting the achievements...

I thought ""well the original was great so there's no rush to play it as I'm not that into RTS games"". Biggest mistake. They absolutely butchered everything about the AI, everything from difficulty to the pathing.

The AI pathing makes you wonder if the devs even know how to actually make games. It looks pretty but its not really optimized well and the AI is total ass. So ass that it just makes them all look retarded.

Easiest way to scout the whole map = build an army and send them across the map. They'll split up that much that you'll likely have the whole map scouted by the time they actually reach where you told them to go due to them randomly splitting up for no reason, getting stuck on themselves and other objects which in turn makes them turn around and go in random directions..

The game is also more difficult than it should be. Harder than the original game that's for sure. Due to this, getting through the campaigns is just an annoyance and you're required to do cheese tactics as much as possible otherwise you get swarmed and lose. In missions that require you to eliminate multiple enemies, you'll get constantly attacked by them all 1 after the other, leaving you with no time to breathe and rebuild until you eventually just can't protect yourself anymore and have to restart.
Very obvious that the AI is a huge problem when only 5% of people that own this game have even completed a campaign.",1629854697,1629976295,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On the off-chance you didn't take my advice, well, good luck, you're gonna need it. Set the difficulty to whatever you want, it will not make a difference, the difficulty on this game is completely broken. Oh and let's suppose you mistakenly saved at the wrong moment, you can't even restart the scenario, it will always load that save for you. The only way for you to restart the scenario is by dropping to the main menu and selecting Campaigns. How retarded is that? I mean Wacraft II got this right back in '95.

Graphics are kinda nice, though. But all in all, it feels like a retarded mid-school coding project gone wrong.

Stay away if you know what's good for you and your mental health. This application will break you. You have been warned.

The game tries. It really tries. But it fails miserably. It's a frustration fest. I can remember Warcraft 1: Orcs and Humans being more forgiving and actually enjoyable than this silly prototype of a game.
It has light years to go to even reach a decent level of playability.

The AI in the game (not the opponents, your units' AI) is horribly stupid. Collisions and units blocking one another resulting in both being blocked happen all the time. And this is a feature that needs to work 100% in order for you to actually have a shot at winning some mission. Except it doesn't.

Also, the difficulty levels are all wrong, playing on Standard, some missions are boringly easy, while others are mayhem, almost impossible to complete.

If horrible, utter pieces of trash games are your thing, though, maybe you could get some enjoyment out of it. But, again, keep in mind: this game really tries.

If you played the original, and don't mind some of the clunkier aspects (AI, path-finding, etc.), it might be worth a buy for some nostalgia. A remaster of Age of Empires(1997), really well done. It's such a good remaster that it made people believe it was a complete remake, and not a lot of people give it credit for that.

The game functions more or less the same as the original, but with some updated stuff, such as:
Gather points
Traversable farms
Slightly more aggressive AI
Slightly better pathfinding
More intuitive UI
Rebalances to techs, civs and units.
A few more quality of life things.

I would suggest if you expect the game to be more or less the same as the 1997 release, then give the game a go. This game is by no means better than AoE 2, and won't be, even if they completely overhauled everything. 2 is more advanced, and is overall just a more complete RTS experience.

If you have any expectations that this game will be any better than the 1997 release, then this most likely won't be a game for you, since it can be pretty hard on unskilled RTS players, it's still the same game from 1997 with a lot of updated things. It still has some of the same bugs the original had and a few new ones even.

Overall, I like the game, despite that I grew up with AoE 2 when I was younger, I can still appreciate what the original did, and still enjoy it from time to time.

I'd say get this, if you:
Loved the original, despite its flaws.
Don't have any high expectations for the game to be anything more than an average RTS game.

However, do not get the game if you:
Expect this to hold a candle to modern RTS or even AoE 2.
Have bad patience.
Can't handle moderately hard games.
Have any high expectations for the game.
Expect this to have updates to mimic AoE 2.
Can't handle lowered frames when zooming.
Have only multiplayer in mind.

I know it sounds like the game is bad when I say all this, but I do like the game, and the original 1997 release with the Patch, I just think the reviews speak for themselves. It's not a game for people expecting it to be anything that is highly superior to the original, because it's really only a minor step up, outside of visuals.

Age of Empires: DE is finally on Steam out of tosh Microsoft Store, making me squeeee my legs in nostalgia happyness remade with awesome graphics. Well, of non-AAA level. AoE1 was an old RTS, released somewhere between Red Alert and Starcraft 1. And it was real unique due to historical setting where you could go through ages. Well, ancient history only, from Stone Age where you find recources, to Tool Age where you build up farms, defences and may rush with units that you can't upgrade in Bronze Age which is where it gets hot and then Iron Age with it's many upgrades. It was great RTS for it's time because it hit that nice balance between economy and military. With economics you had four recources which had their uses and place in match progress. For example, you may not care about stone if you aren't going to build defences such as walls and towers. And of course you had to set up drop points for them. And food was quite detailed, as each food type has it's own gathering rate. Well, actually hunting and gathering had same rate before Definitive Edition. Using villagers to fish at shore is still Sonic fast while boat fishing and farming are the slowest kind.

So while it doesn't cover whole human history, the ages progress doesn't feel like just a reskin of units with better stats in this game. Compared to Rise of Nations and Empire Earth from what I know, that is. And it's historical. YEE, sending centurions on those axeman.
Yea, it's not historical accurate, it was designed to be Hollywood history of 90s kind, just read old interviews. Gamefied on top of that. Cue the unit called ""Phalanx"" that is upgrade from Hoplite. Those who don't know, Phalanx is troop formation of Hoplites in RL. AND they get some strange reskin on upgrade.

If you have played some other AoE games, here are some unique features of this game compared to other ones: Absolutely no defence at the first age for you can only build stone walls. No gates either, you have to close yourself and then Delete when you feel like leaving. Town centers have no defence by themselves, can't garrison either. But at least town centers are real cheap when you get to building more. Nations use one of the five architectural styles, real nice. They are defined by passive bonuses, like Greek getting discount on Academy (a place from which thousands aggitiated Aristotles in hoplite attire go to war) unit who are also faster along with ships, as well as what techs/units they don't get. There are no exclusive super units, but there are Iron Age super upgrades to certain units, very expensive, each nation get few. Oh, and size ratio of units to buildings is silly.

Definite Edition brought in balance changes. Mostly lessened passive bonuses while giving more techs to nations that didn't have them, homogenizing. There are now many QoL additions, such as farm reseeding, just press on icon in Granary. Siege projectiles fly faster, for they felt like on moon physics before. They also don't explode in gray dust, instead leaving a hole in a ground. 

Talking of graphics, it's freaking awesome. It's 2D prerendered of 3D models. And they managed to blow my 8-sided tiny Doom brain by including 32 freaking sides for units. And building destructions are now unique animations. Albeit they look weird, as if friction between each brick stopped existing and it all flopped, not like real building destruction. No skeletons for decaying units either, they cheapened out on this part. But overall, it looks awesome, especially shore environment, so much pleasant to my eyes, albeit I still miss colorful simple stuff of original, but!

Oh, and the biggest change is that farms are now walkable. They removed the houses from farm graphics too, they are just fields now. I kinda miss them acting like building, another thing that made AoE1 unique. But then again, you had to micro villagers around them so they don't block each other in their 1-space-wide inbetween tunnels. Yea, I was putting farms close. So I guess it's for the better.
But they left the trade mechanics as is. Not the tribute where you send recources to ally for real but mechanic to generate gold. You use trading boats and send them to anyone's port where 20 recources of your choice disappears into void, for no one gets it, and it generates gold for it once it gets back. Here is a funny thing: the amount of gold it will generate depends on the lenght of a route, the longer you get... OK, I lied. It's actually calculated by drawing a straight line between the chosen port and the closest port of yours to chosen nation. You can ruin it by building port closer, yes. Frankly, I don't think that many peeps used it.

And pathfinding, so much awful pathfinding without troop formations. It's actually better than original 80% of times, worse 20% when individual units calculate that choke point will be busy and go around half of a map, but overall less than acceptable.

Presentation meh. Well, it's as basic as original, but now they replaced the intro movie with battle to low-budget logo showoff. And there are no intros or outros for campaign. Even if they were like 10-seconds low-budget CGI renderings that sucked and had no plot in them. But QoL in interface tho, with it showing global queue and how many workers work on each recource. Music arrangement is lovely but I am disappointed that match-starting song is the first song from Rise of Rome CD instead of original CD which was ten times better. Could use original battle song for main menu too like original instead of what later became an AoE main theme.

You can also play original mode but only for custom matches versus AI.

And I am disappointed that there was not a single history or unit stats section in the game or nearby. Originals had manuals with info that they had back then on ancient history of nations. And there was help file as well in game files that you could access with F1 or so that included info and history bits on each unit and tech. Nothing here, save for campaigns where each mission has a map and historical info, updated over original. Much better too. Most missions were streamlined to waste less of start time. Some not as awesome, some are better. More consistent. But overall, it still feels like build and destroy for many missions without any story in-missions or much so it gets tiring. For example, in Rise of Rome campaign your objective is to build defences of towers at set spots and you think that it will help you too but enemies just run past it all and you have to defend yourself first until they run out of motivation and then you put towers which would be no different from destroying enemy at that point. So I only played a bit of campaign. 1/4 of it. Samey.

And they are all 50 pop caps. Which is the way that game was designed anyway. Being small enough to micro. Can increase in skirmish to 200 at least or 300, didn't check, I don't like it, without good pathfinding or troop formations. There is even upgrade that makes units of Barracks take half as much space, so.

While pathfinding sucks, AI enemies are better this time around. Until they get depressed after a hour of play. Tho sometimes they screw up and get stuck in stone age. Not as good as AoE2 tho either. Just play with them on Moderate or Hard. Hardest cheats, they will be in Bronze Age by the time you are in Tool Age.

Protip: Ranged units on higher elevations get bonuses!

Overall, nostalgia with great QoL changes. Loved it for what it is, as something they build up over original engine while trying to keep spirit same instead of becoming homoginized with AoE2, farms aside. Gonna force my friend to play it. 1v1 me Stone Age only, biatch.

And yes, this is where the original priests with their Wololo came from. Respect it. So precious.",1568774528,1627171329,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,2,True,False,False

I was enjoying playing with the civilizations in antiquity, especially with the Romans. It was a little different and exciting since it was my first strategy game experience. Now, while playing Definitive Edition, I realized that I wish we were still playing the old versions, even if these games were out of date. The development effort called Remaster results in disaster in many games. They think they can sort out the job just by doing graphic polishing. However, since there are target groups that buy those Remaster games, I think the developer team doesn't care about the balance of the game because of it.

I enjoy playing Age of Empires Definitive Edition, but I also think some obvious bugs need to be fixed. Like, enemies directly rushing through your villagers, not the army they are facing with. That is obvious; there is an army full of swordsmen, archers and cavalries, but the enemy army is still searching my villagers, which these villagers staying behind the army and lots of walls. This is not how to make a game, this is a disaster! In other words, I do not think of how these errors escape from the eyes of the developer companies. There is a huge game developer company and a huge distributor company behind it, but they do not fix even the slightest obvious mistake. Look, I'm not saying that they can't fix it. They do not fix it.

The campaigns are fun but I must admit that the game mechanics are clunkier than AOE2. To me it doesn't matter as the fun I experience is timeless and priceless. Definitely worth to play (especially if you played it back in the day).

The game includes the content from the original game the Rise of Rome expansion. 

The only real shame is that the original opening cinematic isn't present, man that was just epic. I have found it on youtube and admittedly the years haven't been kind to it but it still gives me the chills.

I am very experienced in RTS games but I struggled hard in some campaigns, which are supposed to be a casual experience. Before you smirk at me, I challenge you to play ""Glory of Greece"" ->  ""Colonization of Ionia"" on ""Easy"" and tell me it was a fun experience and since its on Easy, winable by any casual player.

- Upgrades seem to have almost no effect compared to an early rush in a normal game.
- Counter units dont seem to be of any real importance, since the lategame enemy AI often just mass produces every unit it can build and the mix is often what makes it the strongest army -> braindead gameplay.
- Dreadful pathfinding, feels even worse than original. What makes it even more worse is that units have a humongous hitbox which makes ordering units feel like its the most frustrating experience of your life.
- The AI doesnt seem to care if you go on Easy or Hardest in campaigns, it always plays the same. It micro manages every single unit, making it impossible to hit a ship with a catapult even tho that unit is the one of the only true counter.

On the whole, they did nothing to improve actual gameplay, maybe its even worse now.

TLDR points:
* This could have been a great remaster. They took some great things from AoE2 and left look and feel of AoE. If only they made a good AI
* Enemy AI is buggy. Stops working at some point. You can see, that enemy units are not moving. Also, I have a very bad experience with AI on water maps. Played on a difficult level.
* Pathfinding AI is horrible. When you order some unit to attack it goes directly to the point, where the enemy used to be at the moment of attack order, not taking into account that the enemy unit is moving. Also, units can stuck in each other or even forget about your order altogether.

Not worth attention. You better play AoE2",1625432248,1625432248,False,2,0,0.498210310935974121,0,True,False,False

The game is prettier and some functions from Age 2 were implemented (like able to walk over farms and set destination for newly created units), but that's it.
The AI is as stupid as it used to be (leave a group of units unattended for 2 seconds and they all kill themselves), enemies blend in with the scenery (finding the enemy monk converting your units is harder), same pathway glitches (villagers stop working, units get stuck)...
I suppose the biggest problem was that the play style changed to something more aggressive, and while using the same 50 population limit, the game got caught between ''not Age2'' and but ''not Age1 anymore''.",1624990138,1624990138,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am playing on the second easiest difficulty and was hoping to have a chill game slowly building my empire and not worry too much about optimising. Out of nowhere I got mobbed by units I had no chance of beating, costing me the game instantly. Then I decided I'll actually give it a good go and see how well I can do. I was doing really well, keeping ahead of the AI and had an okay military to boot. Well that doesn't help when you're constantly swarmed by AI armies. By the time I finished one wave, another had arrived. It was relentless, and I ended up losing because of it. On the second lowest difficulty. This kind of behaviour is totally fine on higher difficulties, but the lower ones should be winnable by kids like in the original. Instead the AI is ruthless no matter what difficulty you select, and the idea of a casual relaxed game has been entirely removed. 

If you're good at RTS games and enjoy constant challenge then this game is probably fine. However, if you're like me and want to casually enjoy a game from your youth without worrying too much about optimisation or making the right moves? Stay far away.

My opinion did not change. 2X zoom and the frames drop below 50 ( I don't think that a GTX 1060 6GB can't handle a 2D game). They are trying to make improvements, but don't seem to do a good job. I didn't even bother to try the ""new"" pathfinding, sure it's bad. 

Oh, and the multiplayer and LAN buttons were disabled. It seems I don't have the right to play vs other people. Worth maybe when on a 75% sale.

I thought this would be an improvement, they certainly charged enough for an old game.  Unfortunately it's really not.

The AI is bugged.  It was never really good in the old game but it was bearable.  This AI is really frustrating.  It's a real toss up whether they just ignore your instructions; career off in the opposite direction to what you tell them; or actually do what they're told.  

Sometimes they fool you and look like they're about to follow instructions, so you go to manage another part of the map that's in trouble, only to find they got bored and killed themselves trying to take down some random tower miles away from where you told them to go.

And just try and get them to get on that boat.  It was bad enough on the old version, this one is 10 times worse.  Apparently the little darlings can't possibly get on the boat unless the ground is just right and you click in the right place.  They would rather die.

Which brings me to the hit boxes.  There is no rhyme or reason as to where you need to click an item to get the desired result.  For example, if you try to get a stone thrower to attack a tower, you have to click on exactly the right spot (which varies from tower to tower) otherwise it just trundles up to the tower and sits there while it gets demolished.

Imagine.  You're in a battle.  You tell your Cavalry to attack some stone throwers and you tell your stone throwers to attack a tower.  The cavalry all shoot off in the opposite direction and the stone throwers just move towards the tower, peacefully waiting to get disintegrated.

Not only that but the difficulty settings are bugged.  One of my favourite scenarios (Holy Man) is impossible on Easy because the AI is completely bugged.  The only way you have a chance of completion is on hard mode - only then does the game act correctly at the beginning.  How can you sell a game where the easy setting is harder than the hard?

They appear to have rebalanced all the campaign scenarios - some of them work, while others definitely do not.

Basically, if you remember and played the old classic AOE, don't buy this.  It makes my nostalgia buds want to cry.  I'm buying a disc drive and firing my old classic up again.",1623776274,1623776274,False,6,0,0.531153678894042969,0,True,False,False

I really wanted to enjoy this game, and write a positive review but it would be just like smiling through your teeth. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

First let me point out what the remaster did right. The graphics, the music, and little QoL changes (such as farm reseed button, farms having no collision option, UI changes and so on) are spot on. These alone make the Definitive Edition look like a true remake. But frankly, that's about it. 

The reason why I decided to make it a negative review is because it doesn't ""play"" like a remake or even just a remaster. The units still have issues with colliding with each other and the pathfinding is still nearly linear (as in - a unit will try to go to their destination in a straight line, which was painfully apparent in the Hannibal scenario). Too many times I've had a situation where I had two Legion units stuck in themselves, unable to move. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. The attack-move command does nearly nothing - the units will bump into each other politely moving out of the way because they targeted some other unit at the back while attack-moving. Unless we're supposed to micro manage the whole fight unit-by-unit, I wouldn't say it's a well done feature. More than that I had many situations where I ordered a melee unit to attack another unit that was moving. My unit then just moved to the location the enemy unit was in, while the order is given and just THEN started chasing said unit. Things like these made me so incredibly sad about the state of this game. 

The AI is also another issue. Throughout the campaings it put up a reasonably good fight but only untill like 40 mins of the game. After that it just stopped attacking entirerly. When it came to me attacking however, I saw tons of units just stationed around their respective barracks not moving at all. I wonder if it's because of the difficulty setting (I was playing at ""Standard"" difficulty). Another fun little glitch I found is that you can bait the AI priests into converting a unit that has ""No attack"" stance - the unit will also not move and will not fight back when you attack it, allowing you to deal with the priests and then safely recapture the unit. I found out that it's most easily done with War elephants. Finally I'd like to mention the AI behaviour in random maps. I've played 4 player FFA where after scouting the map I had 3 other AIs at my base, even though I wasn't even first on the scoreboard (I'd assumed that they may join forces only if another player was a threat, but they consistently attacked only me for like 3 games).

Unless the whole ""clunkiness"" of the game was an intention of the devs - to trurly port a game from 1997 with all of it's flaws, then I would say that they made a job well done. But if not, then I'd just reccomend you getting a dosbox or some other way to just play the original 1997 release - you will get the same experience, with worse graphics but at least it may save you the price of the remaster.",1622803843,1622893865,False,88,4,0.723097085952758789,0,True,False,False

Got my hopes up with the April 2021 patch.
Unfortunately, the game is still broken by horrendous pathing.  
(Worse than the original game.)

Units still:
-Get stuck on each other.
-Block each other.
-Bunch up in immovable clusters.
-Turn to face left/right/left/right...instead of moving (inside the cluster.)
-March the way you don't want them to, if units block their way.
(IE units take off heading East, if you told them to walk West, however, units were blocking a pass / river crossing to the west.)
-The game is more of ""fight the interface"" and ""constantly monitor for stuck units"" rather than ""fight the enemy.""

Try to guide Hannibal over the alps through mountain passes.
You can't.
(Unless you click on every-single-unit-you-own, individually, and select a series of waypoints.
Try doing that for all 20+ units you get.

It's funny when you realize - the actual Hannibal had an easier time moving his army than we do in this game.

Really sad.  They went through all the trouble to make gorgeous graphics, music...good balance...
Just to ruin it with where it matters most:

The Definitive Edition has some really good and welcome improvements on the original - The graphical overhaul is beautiful, the quality of life changes are great. 

But there is one very large, glaring problem stopping me from recommending it to people: Pretty consistently, when you're well into a random map game the ai will just......stop. All its units will cluster near its town center, if it has any boats on the water they'll hang out in one place, its villagers will continue to gather but just keep finding more and more distant sources of resources, and the ai will make no attempt to win the game. It ruins any game that isn't finished within 40 minutes to an hour. 

I really hope this gets fixed, because aside from this game breaking issue, I love everything about the extended edition. I like how aggressive the ai is, I like the QoL improvements like the UI that shows idle villager locations and how many villagers are on what resource. I love being able to set higher population limits in random map games, and building farms that are similar to those in AoE 2. I think the work they've done on the art is fantastic, and looks excellent. The redone music is really good. But this one bug is holding it back. I know that this isn't exactly the priority over at microsoft, so I'm not really holding my breath, but if they do fix it, I'd heartily recommend AoE 1 DE.",1621363123,1621363123,False,1,0,0.469798654317855835,0,True,False,False

1. Nostalgia: AOE was pretty much the first game I ever played, although at that age I didn't really know what I was doing. This edition really gives you an opportunity to go back 20 years

3. No technical issues for me 
CONS:
1. Pathfinding is awful, units get stuck all the time. Boarding groups of units into a transport is a nightmare 
2. Campaign AI / scripting: it's really hard to enjoy campaign missions because of AI. Sometimes AI will attack you in early game, but then just stops all of a sudden. Sometimes it just sits on a base does nothing, waiting to die. And a few times it does it's best, giving player a very small room to breathe.

Age of Empires Definitive Edition is a great upgrade for a classic strategy game of the '90s. We have played the original game (Age of Empires 1997) may be up to 1,000's of hours as a kid, and after 15 years, this game will give you nostalgic vibes of the original game. This remaster of Age Of Empires is done very well. We liked the graphics upgrades. Warships, cavalry, chariots, legions look better. The game is much more enjoyable.

The definitive edition has forgotten all that. It could have ended the trend. The devs call to make the game a lot harder was not, and still isn't, appreciated. Age of empires 2 DE seems a lot easier. But taking the comments and feedback and making ANOTHER game doesn't fix this one.

So in all technicality, It's not recommended to buy this game. They cared more about making this a prototype. We gave the feedback and they made ANOTHER game. It's not worth buying.

PS:Has anybody tried playing a campaign? Well... I played the first level called ""Holy man"". It's just, the original leaves the only man you have with something like half health. Here? It's 1 HP! You could have died otherwise!

In short, The original was sweet. This one's bitter.",1620645424,1620645424,False,3,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

I have some mixed feelings regarding this release, while this is a great game and I did enjoy playing through it there was some elements which I found very annoying.

Pro's:

Good old Age of Empires.
Aesthetically pleasing graphics overhaul.
Good Music and Sound.
Some QOL improvements but nothing ground breaking.

Con's:

HORRENDOUS Unit pathing. Some of the worst I have ever seen.
Campaign missions are insanely difficult. Even on the easiest difficulty.

While I can understand the unit pathing is not something they can change since its a product of its time, my biggest problem is that the AI just spams units into your base with no cohesion or tactics. Had to resort to cheesing my way through almost all of the campaigns missions because of this even on the easiest difficulty. It also seems the campaign difficulty options make no difference. I never had this issue with Age of Empires 2 HD Edition with the campaigns on standard difficulty.

So while I did enjoy this game it still has some issues that need to be cleared up. I would highly recommend rather playing Age of Empires 2 HD Edition (2013) which is the vastly superior sequel and has waaaay more content.

TLDR: Enjoyable old school RTS with some issues.",1620631357,1620631357,True,5,1,0.568994879722595215,0,True,False,False

If it is the first game for you in the franchise it is a good game though... the DE version with all the gfx upgrades brings it a bit back to the scene. So in overall I give a thumbs up.

And here is a hint: I have just read in other comment that logging back (after you accidentally logged out like me :D ) to the xbox live is not possible on windows 10, Here is the way: you will need to enable (I advise to temporary only!) the scripting host in the registry:

I appreciate its a remake of the original but the pathfinding is infuriating, especially in crowded cities. I am glad since I first started playing they have added a few non original features like being able to set units to defensive mode and catapults to no attack stance. 

The campaigns are quite fun and whilst scenarios should be challenging sometimes they are nigh on ridiculous, maybe I'm a bad player but sometimes its taken me 3hrs to clear one scenario in a campaign. The AI even on easy is very aggressive and usually rush you within minutes of starting.

First, a positive note: game looks and runs great. Atmosphere is awesome and I do think devs did a fantastic job there. Truly, spirit of the original is captured here...

That being said, AI is where this game falls flat. It straight up cheats, and not in a subtle way. I could live with game giving slight edge to AI on higher difficulty settings, but AI cheats massively even on easiest setting. You can literally wall off player, cut him off resources and he will just keep spamming the most expensive units in ridiculous numbers. This varies slightly between missions, but because of it, some take more than an hour to pass... on EASIEST setting!

This game is good. It runs smoothly. It plays well. The art and animations are all well done. Different civilizations are all clear. Everything in that regard is great. Most of the negative reviews here on steam seem to just not be aware of some of the quirks in the Age of Empires games, particularly regarding movement. It's always been like this.

That said, I think in general AoE2 is a better game than AoE1, and the only case I would really recommend this game as opposed to the Definitive Edition of AoE2 would be if you want the older civilizations here and know that you're getting a game that isn't quite as refined, but nature of being based on the older game. I don't mean there's any problems technically, just that the later time period comes with some advancements in in-game tech and units and whatnot that make AoE2 better.

But if you're okay with that, this is a fine game. I would wait for a sale. I paid 5 bucks and am very happy with my purchase! Full price, I might feel a little unsure.

I did the dungeon crawl mission with the elephants, in which I had lots of issues with units getting stuck, and it went much much smoother this time. Didn't have a single unit get stuck, they still body block each other but I can live with that, and units no longer move in the opposite direction of where they're told to go. Definitely feels much better and actually playable. It is worth the try now. (going to leave the old review below for reference)


I'm quite lenient with games and I give them a chance til the end and I've played a fair amount of lower quality indie games but never have I ever played a game this off-putting that is not even worth giving a shot. The game starts promising and the Yamato campaign was really good but the rest was just ruined by bugs. The most game breaking one is mainly horse and elephant units getting stuck in other units constantly - there was nothing more infuriating than when you're being attacked with full force and your units keep getting stuck. Adding to the flames the pathing is bad and there is a bug to it as well. Units will block each other and get stuck on the smallest of pebbles. The bug is when horses attack workers they will run up to them do 0 to 1 hits if the worker is moving and then give up on attacking them. Units also have issues when moving as a group - if they are spread out some of them might go in the opposite direction in which they were told to go and they don't adjust their speed to the slowest unit in the group. All of this combined makes the game next to unplayable at times. A side note is that I personally don't like the priests' conversion ability because of the RNG which can be easily countered by just saving while your units are walking up to them and keep loading back til RNG works in your favor. The game genuinely feels like it's in an early beta state and if they fixed all of the issues the game does have potential to be good and the Yamato campaign is proof of it because that campaign was great mainly because most of the time you weren't affected too much by the bugs.",1617556905,1617875622,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would play nonstop and it's probably my favourite game off all time. It wasn't perfect but back in 1997/1998 this game was the shit!

I'm happy to inform you that this game is still so much fun to play. Yeah sure AGE OF EMPIRES 2 has features that this game would have loved too have and AGE OF EMPIRES 2 is the better game overall. This game is set in a different time, much earlier than AGE OF EMPIRES 2. I actually find the older CIVS, TECH and UNITS more interesting. You can battle through 10 campaigns on this version and also add custom campaigns if you wish. 

Offcourse the game is looking gorgeous now with the updated graphics and you have added feature such as a zoom further out and in option.The multiplayer dosent seem very populated but there are always some games going on. This game is worth it for the single player anyway. The game seems to get small updates every once in a while too. 

I saw the release off this game on the microsoft store with a few problems and bugs, AI issues but the updates have done a decent job in improving it since then.It's already had a patch but it will need more to iron out a couple BUGS i've seen but it's not a game breaker. The ones i seen anyway. 

One last note - This game will work on WINDOWS 8.1.It runs perfectly fine and i've only had one issue which was the sound. There is a thread that is pinned on the forum for WINDOWS 8.1 users that is an easy fix for the sound. You can play this on WINDOWS 10 and WINDOWS 8.1!

With a splash of high definition to all of it's aspects, it's an almost perfect example of a remaster. 

But as mentioned before, it has mechanical faults, the character path-ing is horrendous - as units just follow whatever direction they choose on their own even if it means they'll have to move halfway across the map to cover a tiny distance, and often times 2 different units can clip through each other and get stuck, they may get unstuck if you're lucky but you'll eventually have to kill one to free the other, I may be wrong but I believe these bugs existed in the original release as well.

But the worst sin of AOE:DE is it's campaign difficulty, it is extremely difficult on ""Normal"" difficulty for some reason, and leaves no room for error in the starting minutes of some missions, and now there's lots of these new missions with terrible designs, for example : requiring you to convert enemy villagers and start a new civilization with just one priest all the while other cities are hunting said priest, or move from point A to point B with a given number of units, in a path littered with hordes of enemies and towers.

But it's still a fun game if you're willing to overlook it's drawbacks. Plenty of hours (atleast 70 hours) to kill in the campaign missions, deathmatch or multiplayer - which still has a lot of players in it. There's also the map editor, which is always fun to experiment with.

Now, Definitive Edition (or AOE:DE) by itself, like the original (and the Rise of Rome expansion) is a great game, however, it seems like the developers don't even care about this game at all. 

This is the game that started it all (that's what they said), but it has received no respects from its devs. 
No events being hosted, no regular updates, and bugs have existed for months, heck, even years, but has not been resolved. 
(There are ""maintenance"", but that's happening on all the sequels at the same time, so that doesn't count.)

The people who read the bug reports for DE has always been the other people in the community, I have yet to see any post that actually got a response from an actual developer for this game. 
(I know this cause I read all the ones in a list gathered by a community member)

Overall, the only reason why I gave it a thumbs down, is because of the developer's attitude towards the game, and its players in general.

If you're getting this game, you should only get it on a sale of at least 75% or higher if you don't want to waste your money on those who are never going to fix, or even care about the game you paid for to play on.

-
I really like the time period this game takes place in which is something none of the other AoE titles have. Growing your civilization from the Stone Age to Tool Age, Bronze Age, and all the way up to the Iron Age to duke it out with the enemy civilization is so satisfying.  And the soundtrack is godly beautiful. Even the opening cinematic alone gave me goosebumps and sometimes gets me choked up. When I first started the game and saw that, I knew I had to give this game a fair chance after I bought it. And I'm so glad I chose to get into this and Age of Empires II DE. (My thoughts on AoE II will be separate from this one)
.
As far as gameplay, RTS hasn't been a common genre of mine, but I ended up liking this quite a bit. The civilizations all have their unique strengths and weaknesses which keeps the game exciting in it's own unique way. The fact that there's no perfect civ keeps anything potentially game breaking out of at least the campaign and online multiplayer. (If it's a local game against Ai then that's the only exception if you want to use cheats.)
.
Following the history of Ancient humanity through the many perspectives of civilizations like Babylon, Rome, Egypt, Carthage, Greece, and many others is really refreshing and intriguing. 
While the History taught in this game is already in history books throughout schools, libraries and searchable online, apart from slight deviations in how our educational system wants to tell these stories. 
.
There's something about playing through historic battles as a given empire. Building up your Economy and Military force along the way, and finally crushing your enemy in battle. Just interacting with the world in that way which you just cannot get from reading a book or watching a documentary about these same subjects. But that's the beauty of video games for you.
.

The most annoying thing, is the movement of formations.
Units always go to different areas instead of where you're actually clicking it for moving them, making it so frustrating to execute an attack or anything similar.

Second, units get stuck sometime, making them impossible to move. This can often lead to lose those units if the enemy is attacking them.

All the rest is quite acceptable... and if it wasn't for the two problems I previously described, I probably would be very happy to recommend this game positively.

But at this stage, I suggest you to avoid it and go for the second or third chapter.

There are some significant downsides to the gameplay though. 

- The pathfinding AI is sometimes just dumb. Units are not able to circumnavigate certain cliffs. They struggle to take narrow ""entrances"". Instead they might get stuck on cliffs. It also can happen that units jam other units close to them causing them to get stuck and unable to move in any direction. Selecting individual units trying to ""untangle"" them does't help any. It takes some time for them to idle and be able to move again.

- Priests tend to be disobedient. You can order them to heal a unit but instead of healing, and when necessary following them, they stop healing the unit they were ordered to heal and try to heal another unit which often results in the death of the unit they are supposed to heal. 

- Conclusion, babysitting your units is in order to avoid ""unfortunate"" outcomes of battles in too many situations.",1614294706,1614294706,True,1,0,0.5071868896484375,0,True,False,False

I used to love this game with all it flaws (back in the 1990s)
They overworked the graphics and lost the entire atmosphere from back in the days.

Con:
- But what is really annoying is a terrible wayfinding of units as they frequently get simply stuck and do not move anywhere.
- Poor AI
- Extremly inbalanced: Why is a tower so much weaker than an infatry man? Why are archers almost not causing any damage and why is one hoplite strnoger than an elephant?
- icons in the menu incl. text is way too small

This DE remaster is imho my favorite out of the DE series as it does the best job addressing the most common issues with the original game while retaining its quirky gameplay mechanics to a T. It turned a game which, in 2021 is not really all that enjoyable, into something I could totally see wasting a few hours in here and there.

The main changes are graphical. The art has been completely re-modeled or re-rendered up to very high resolutions, though they have also retained the original game art it seems which is very cool.

If any of the three AoE games deserved and would benefit most from a remaster, it's this one, and I think they struck a very good balance here.

My only complains with the game are with the sound and music. While they did a really remarkably good job trying to echo or stick to the sounds of the original game (except obviously at better than 8-bit depth!), there are a few sounds which are irritating like stone mining which is rather unpleasant sounding. Ironically the bird sound from selecting/building towers which was horrendously irritating in the original is now much improved with the replacement, so, hit or miss.

The remastered music I think was really quite well done... aside from the fact that it's absolutely swimming in way too much reverb. The original game was DRY MIDI sounds (depending on your soundcard of course), or at best, moderately reverby CD audio. That gave the original soundtrack this really nice clarity and driving rhythm which kept the songs moving, and in which EVERY sound was equally and clearly audible. With all this reverb and admittedly nicer samples, it just sorta gets mushy at times and less enjoyable because you just can't hear the intricate details of the rhythms and counterpoint which made the original score enjoyable in the first place.

Now, the one thing to keep in mind is AoE is pretty cartoony. Dudes with big spiky sticks walking around and slapping each other upside the head. The game is by far its most fun and adventuresome in the early game through the stone and bronze ages, and sort of becomes a nasty slog by the late game, at least to me. It's sort of like if you turned the attitudes and perceptions people had about the ancient world from the time of classic movies like Jason and the Argonauts and Ben Hur into a video game. The idea of little early settlements waging skirmishes and protecting hunting grounds is really a lot of fun, but to me it falls way short when you get to the Iron Age with the lack of formations and primitive AI. For that, you're better off with Ensemble's other take on the ancient world, Age of Mythology, or for a historical purist approach, 0 A.D.

So with that minor nitpick aside, I do recommend this game to anyone who wants to dip their toes in early AoE! Just keep in mind that despite the pretty looks it still mostly plays like a 90's game, and that's imho a good thing. :)",1614230267,1614230267,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But do I recommend you play it? No.

You may be tempted to return to the original Age of Empires if you're nostalgic for the days when you'd log onto your dial-up and peruse various shoddy websites for new game demos. It was a really cool game back then. No sci-fi or fantasy trappings, just historical campaigns based on real empires and eras on our planet.

But man it has no aged well. You just can't go back to the grandfather of this franchise. Age of Empires II expanded and improved SO MUCH on the original that it's barely the same game and I can't recommend spending time with AOE1 now that both have received a very generous helping of remastering.

At the core of it, AOE1 is just clunky. The population caps are lower, the units have no concept of how to group up properly, building placement and tiling feel much finickier, the gameplay is sluggish on slower speeds and then cartoony on higher speeds, and the AI is a cheating poohead. You feel like you're micromanaging a couple of sluggish, braindead soldiers every second you're playing, trying to stay ahead of an AI who is perfectly managing dozens of units at a time, simultaneously, always.

The campaigns feature some really cool settings, some undercovered in games (Hittites?) and others very well represented (Rome, baby). But the actual missions are just obnoxious. Sometimes you're pitted against way too many AI opponents, all perfectly managing their armies, while you're stuck with 50 POP to fight them all off. Others require managing a tiny force to near perfection. It might be less annoying if the game's unit pathing and lack of unit formations didn't leave me feeling like I was fighting the game more than anything.

I don't want to rain on anyone's parade. Again, this doesn't feel like a cash grab at all. it feels like a labour of love. I just don't know how much I love the original anymore and no amount of fancy building destruction animations can change that.",1614134460,1614134460,False,28,1,0.625100970268249512,0,True,False,False

 Looking for a unique experience? Watch as the game you know and loved from the Kellogg's cereal box gets turned into a circus, where you feel like bombad Jar Jar Binks directing an army of defiant cats. 

No matter what you tell them, your units will do their own thing, often the direct opposite, and they love getting stuck on top of one another in clumps, like clusters of sleeping felines. It doesn't help that priests need a lot of convincing to heal nearby units, often they walk away all together, not wanting a bar of it. Even when the unit is just behind another unit in front of the priest, he just won't do it, and the others won't budge to let him through. I know we are losing faith these days, but this game is not meant to be a reflection of modern life!

The enemy doesn't help things by being comically on the ball. This, combined with your incompetent cat army just makes you feel like a failed commander. Just like in school when you were chosen to be the leader and nobody wanted to follow your directions.  

If you are prone to gamer rage, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME - you might find yourself sectioned in a mental asylum, and when you return home there will be a smoking crater where your PC once was.

The 'HD Edition' of AoE2 greatly improved its namesake and they later remastered it even further with the definitive edition, overhauling the AI yet again including the visuals not to mention some quality of life improvements.

This is just the same old AoE1 made to work better on modern hardware. Minimal quality of life improvements, minimal changes.

What this game IS: A supplier of memories. This was the first strategy game I played on a computer back in the mid 90s and I loved it. It got me into history as more than just a school assignment and it set me on a path I would never wish to change.

It may not have aged like a fine wine but it sure does feel good to reminisce every now and then. If you have never played the Age of Empires series then I suggest you instill yourself with the power of an open mind and play this first. Travel back in time to the 90s when there was nothing really like this (yes I am aware there were other strategy games, but nothing involving history) and enjoy what it was like for me when I was a kid.

You CAN'T enjoy the good graphics. Graphics options are '4x' stuck in a super close up view with good graphics or '1x' with full zoom out but while graphics are horrendous. (Or 2x, somewhere in between) So frustrating, not sure what's going on there. Need better graphics options.

The fact that they remastered the entire series in the past few years just lends itself to how excellent a title this is, and I'm really happy to be playing through it again.

One of the things that makes this game so magical is building your settlement into a city, and even a fortress if you want it to be.  The way you utilize your villagers is what allows you to be victorious, and that's never been more clear than playing against stiff competition.  It's just the computers for now, but they are giving me a run for my money.

Age of Empires is where my love of RTS titles began, and it is wonderful to see it remastered not only for myself, for any other person who wants to spend some hours civilization building.  I used to have a go to culture back then, but these days, I just go with the flow.  And if you're a fan of great games that don't stifle your cash flow, you gotta be on Steam.

This game got fastly superseeded by its ultra-famous sequel, Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, which translated all of this into the Medieval Era and added new features, content, and made the overall experience more welcoming for RTS newbies. So don't forget this: Age of Empires Definitive Edition is a remaster of the PREQUEL of Age of Empires II, and that means that still holds up with almost all of the original game features (plus some quality of life improvements), and thus you will not find the same features as in AoE II. That means no formations or no wall gates, for example.

Does that mean that this remaster is basically for veteran players that want a technical remaster of the same old game? As one of them, sure, I'm really enjoying it a lot. But this game has the charm of classic RTS that has been mostly lost this day with modern titles, and still has a lot of fun to deliver with the classic formula revamped and wraped in a glorious visual upgrade and amazing remade soundtrack, making it a very recommendable experience for anyone who feels attracted for the idea of a RTS set in the Ancient Era. Babylonians, assyrians, hittites, persians, egyptians, minoans, yamato, shang... there are not many RTS games out there that give you the chance of playing with such civilizations. And yes, you still have classic romans, greeks, carthaginians and so.

So don't be afraid, get this jewel of a RTS and jump into the real old times hunting elephants, developing the wheel, finding ruins and artifacts from even older times, preparing a huge phalanx horde, or even going full wololo and converting every enemy to your side. This is a wonderful remaster for one of the best classic RTS out there, and truly deserves more love.",1612037634,1612037634,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In an era where RTS gaming is already dead, Microsoft has resparked interest in the genre by remaking its THREE signature games. Age of Empires Definitive Edition is a built-upon remake of a classic, with much MUCH better visuals. The graphics are totally stunning, shadows make the game look quite fantastic. Whether you want to play with friends or play single player, this game has got you covered. There are 9 campaigns in total to sink a dozen of hours in. With over 16 civilizations, there's plenty of replayability in this game (and plenty of strats to try out). As compared to other remade games, Age of Empires Definitive Edition still lacks a proper pathfinding system and a proper Art of War campaign to get newbies to really learn how to manage their online games since I've personally found that playing against the computer is NOTHING like playing versus real humans (hence why an Art of War campaign should be present to get you to grasp things like: When you should age up, when you should swap vils into gold production etc...). Furthermore, there is a new ""Rank System"" involved with Multiplayer that, after a couple of games of calibration, puts you in an ELO that you have to grind. It's fine if you play Ranked Games 1v1 since then you'll only have yourself to blame for getting utterly destroyed.

However, this seemingly perfect game is still, to this day, in dire need of balance patches. In ranked, people still spam OP civilizations like Macedonians with +5 Hoplite armor (literally invincible against any other civ) and Greeks with increased movement speed for Centurions that will leave you flat in 10 mins if they rush your busy-farming peasants. With the right balance fixes and improving on the pathfinding, this could be as good as Age of Empires II or III; but it seems like Microsoft has already abandoned ship with this project and is more focused on making AOE II and III better. It's still a great game if you force those who join your lobby to go for Random Civs on Random Maps. For me, this is a solid 9.1/10. A great RTS game with a great online community that will teach you how to play and will mostly not rage if you fail in 2v2s or 3v3s.",1611923630,1611923630,True,6,0,0.558138012886047363,0,True,False,False

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†[b]A[/b]ge [b]o[/b]f [b]E[/b]mpires is one of the most important strategy games in history, a true titan in its genre and a classic position. I had a lot of concerns about the remaster of this game. On the one hand, it fully deserves second youth, on the other - by today's standards are a pretty bare-bones RTS mechanics-wise, in many respects it is an archaic position and there is not much room for developers of the remaster who want to remain faithful to the original from 1997.
Fortunately, after a dozen or so minutes with the game, I breathed a sigh of relief - apart from the beautiful audiovisual setting, AoE: DE is a game extremely faithful to the original, avoiding making changes to the gameplay (for better or worse), apart from what is absolutely necessary for its proper functioning (mainly multiplayer).
Although I would love to see the first part recreated in the convention of the current AoE II: DE, an honest remaster required restraint and the creators definitely showed it, focusing on the complete reconstruction of the entire visual setting, which significantly improves the experience of the game. Compared to the original - it's a real eye candy.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†At the moment, both in terms of the content and quality of the product as a whole - there is nothing much to criticize.
For some time after its premiere, the game has had some problems with proper functioning, especially AI, fortunately everything has been patched up and Age of Empires: Definitive Edition is now working very nicely.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†[b]A fantastic way to relive your first time with AoE - lots of fun for single and multiplayer enthusiasts.
If you know what you're getting into - I recommend it with all my heart! Especially during promotional campaigns on Steam - you can complete the entire series for a fraction of the normal price.[/b]

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†By the way - I also highly recommend going back and checking the original release with 'The Rise of Rome' expansion. It's as playable as it ever was and still has a lot of magic after all these years. It should run fine on modern systems, and in case of any issues- there's a decent number of solutions to overcome them.

I bought this remastered version because the original Age of Empires does not scale well on 1080p monitors and each new update of Windows 10 causes compatibility issues that I'm sick of trying to fix.

Now to the remastered version. It looks very good and runs beautifully on modern machines. The music has been upgraded but still has the original melody and the sound effects have also had the same treatment. It's a blast hearing the same units and music from over 20 years ago, now in crisp HD quality!

The only thing I have noticed is that there are now gather points and the ability to queue troops & research together. As much as the original version didn't have those features, I don't mind that they've been added - it does make the game play a bit better.

Any 1990's folks will know this is one of the strategy games to arrive at the time of Command and Conquer, Total Annihilation, Red Alert, Warcraft and helped shape the ""RTS"" genre as we know it today. A brilliant era for the genre and thankfully one which is being given the remastered treatment for Windows 10, alongside Command and Conquer. 

Pros:
- A beautiful graphical overhaul, giving the appearance of a contemporary game in its own right. Each unit is remastered, alongside buildings, ambient world effects and water. While not groundbreaking it looks modern without breaking the graphical bank and ensuring compatibility across generations of PC's, the more higher end systems enjoying the increased zoom and 4k compatible visuals. 
- Soundtrack which is remastered and is one of the biggest improvements as the music is very calm, melancholy and fitting and easily a pro against the more hectic, medieval soundtrack of it's successor. The music fits the speed and pace of this game (even the most frantic of which seems rather calm compared to Age of Empires II). 
- Quality of life improvements. Automatic reseeding of farms, traversal across farmland, a proper tech tree for each civilisation and unit resource allocation amongst those which warrant this game another look. 
- Another visit to one of the most storied eras of human civilisation. Campaigns are easy to follow, and provide a keen insight to the era culminating in the rise of the Roman Empire. 
- Great for new RTS players. This game is easy to learn and provides accessibility for players across many skillsets and while the finer nuances of each civilisation take time to learn, the basic mechanics are easy for younger or new players to pick up. A great introduction RTS to master and then hone their skills in other games. 

Cons:
- Pathfinding leaves a lot to be desired. Units become grouped at choke points and can often be near useless unless they either engage in combat or through the passage of time become free once more. This is not game breaking but something to be aware of when generating several large groups of infantry in particular. 
- At times unbalanced. AOEII is constantly receiving updates to the unit roster, tech tree and civilisation specific bonuses, making a very balanced game. AOEDE suffers from a lack of care in this respect. Glaring deficiencies such as wall gates missing also harm this aspect. 
- Wanting more. While accessible it does have disadvantages, especially against its successor which has more units and strategies to win, which may harm replayability. 

Overall this is a welcome addition to any RTS fan's library. This was the first foray into this series for many in 1997 and remains my spiritual favourite, despite the arguably superior gameplay of AOEII. The music, time period and calm demeanour of this game invite seasoned and junior RTS players to jump into this fascinating era once more and experience one of the torchbearers to this genre. I highly recommend this to all RTS players and those who wish to step back to a simpler time, with window dressing.

AOE is an RTS game based in antiquity (Stone Age to Iron Age, goes up to Roman times). It's one of the progenitors of the RTS genre, so if you've played an RTS game at some point in your life, chances are it followed a similar formula: Make workers, gather 4 resources, make buildings, make soldiers and beat up your opponent.

The remaster comes with brand new beautiful graphics and a reworked soundtrack, as well as many quality of life improvements such as balance patches, new functions (for example, unit stances, which were absent in the old version) and changes such as farms being walkable over like in AOE 2 instead of being regular buildings.


While nowadays it largely lingers in the shadow of its child AOE 2, the game holds up surprisingly well in 2021. Larger and blockier units, as well as the general lack of preset formations, allow for body blocking, while arrows being slow and seeable allows you to dodge them if you manually move your units to the side - things like that make AOE potentially more micro-intensive and focusing on controlling a small amount of units, tho late game deathballs are still very much there. Resources on the map can run out quickly (even wood), and the lack of gates, as well as the presence powerful options in Age 2 and 3, make AOE generally a more aggressive version of AOE 2 - Age 4 games are less common, games ending in Age 2 or 3 are. The fundamentals of AOE 2 still apply in AOE 1, and the choice of civs and map types on offer allows for a good amount of variety in play, and should be enjoyable to people who have played a latter installment or like RTS games in general (however, the balance of this game is all over the place, with some civs being particularly dominant, like the Romans, while some languishing in bottom tiers, like Carthage or Greeks).

There's plenty of campaigns to chew through, which can take a long time, so even if one does not intend to dive into multiplayer (which is still active, in case the reader is wondering), the singleplayer offerings should keep one engaged for a long while, if money spent->content ratio is important. While the campaigns are rather challenging (if one plays on high difficulties), the scenarios are significantly more simplistic due to lack of triggers or in-mission voice over, so they might come off as stale after some time, since most scenarios rely on you starting off with little, building up a base and beating your opponent.

Overall, it's a gorgeous and well put together remaster of a classic, which should appeal to a lot of genre fans and those after the nostalgia.",1610055278,1610055399,True,5,0,0.591778457164764404,0,True,False,False

Took several days' playtime just to get through the campaign, so you do get your money's worth.
The game teaches you some history, and refers to famous events and people you're already familiar with. Losing (or saving and quitting) often has a humorous story to go with it. The win, loss and instruction messages are all voiced.

The gameplay itself is fun and quite impressive given the game's age. It aged very well. You usually don't need a lot of war tactics or strategies, but there are a few near impossible levels where you need to know what to do to even stand a chance (but there's a bunch of cheats that'll help you overcome almost any level. You can cheat just enough to make a level 'fair', or go overboard and enjoy being the all-mighty ruler of the map. Cheats don't disable achievements).

One problem with the campaign is that the enemies tend to resign when they are losing, cutting the fun short. Luckily there's a 'bug' you can abuse to fix that. On maps with multiple enemy groups, beat one of them (you may need to leave a wall standing), then ally with them and tick the allied victory box. Then even if all the other groups resign, the game will continue till you untick allied victory, in which case you immediately win the level.

There is one annoying bug where units get stuck together on the same spot. Unsticking them requires either waiting a minute or so for them to unstick themselves, or killing one off. This requires a slight delay as you need to arrange your units in a way that minimises the odds of them hitting the same spot.

Many achievements are obtained during normal play, but there are some brutal ones that require way too much grinding. So I wouldn't recommend this game for completionists.",1610013024,1610013024,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
-High resolution graphics
-Nice update from the original game (animations and visuals in general)
-Combines everything from AoE and AoE RoR into a single game
-For those looking for that old feeling of playing the original game, you will feel it

Cons:
-So many things could have been improved to make this a much much less irritating experience

1) No troop formation: Troops just wander and bump into each other continuously making it almost impossible to control and perform an effective attack or defence. It's hard to control more than 10 units, imagine a whole army. You have to select one by one in order to move them where you wish them to be.

2) Pathfinding sux: Troops and villagers get stuck all the time. If you don't pay attention, you might find out 15 minutes later that that villager you sent to build a watch tower was stuck in the forest all along. Combine this with the absence of troop formation, it becomes impossible and very painful to use strategy in a game that relies mostly on using strategy.

3) Priests range is 10+ yet for some reason they won't start healing unless the unit is almost completely next to it. Sometimes I have 5 or more units all wounded very close to the priest yet he doesn't do anything. Same thing for some units like War galley that won't start shooting enemy units on sight. No matter what position you choose for them, they see enemy troops next to them such as a villager constructing a building and they just stand there without any reaction.

Another issue with range is that your war galleys have 8 range and the enemy tower has 6 or 7 (less than you), yet for some reason, go figure, your boats need to get into the tower's range in order to shoot it and at the same time be shot by it? What's the purpose of having increased range if they put themselves withing enemy's towers range?

4) Population caps at 50 in campaign: How are you supposed to beat a very difficult AI that constantly spams attacks at you and rebuilds everything that you destroy, when you have 20 villagers on resources, 10 boats and 20 army units = 50 population.

5) AI cheats or difficulty setting is bugged: I circled an enemy on an island, no resources left to gather, for 30 minutes continuously killing his villagers and troops with my boats without suffering any damage on my side, yet the AI never stops sending troops my way and never stops rebuilding every building I destroy (Easiest mode).

5)General bugs like a Gazelle running and stopping at mid-air jump position.


I know the original game lacked everything I mentioned here, but how hard would it be to make a better pathfinding and options for troop formations like in AoE2? I doubt anyone would complain about this for not being like the original game.

However, nostalgia isn‚Äôt enough to make me want to continue playing the game.

Sure we can now replenish farms now but the two things that continued to infuriate me, STILL no gates and the pathing is still shocking, units barging into each other non-stop. Feels like I‚Äôm still playing that same 90‚Äôs gameplay instead of the ease of play we have in subsequent releases.

I bought this because AoE 1 was a game I grew up with, so there's a ton of nostalgia involved for me. Also this is a single player only rating, because that's what I bought it for and honestly I don't see why you wouldn't play AoE2 if you wanted to play AoE multiplayer.

AoE1 is noticeably a game from the early days of RTS. Pathfinding was still in it's infancy, archers can't hit a target that doesn't move in a straight line towards them, bonus damage for triangular balance wasn't a thing. They added waypoints and a-move, but the pathfinding and core mechanics weren't noticeably touched, so these issues remain and they have quite a bit of influence on how much fun this game is because units get stuck quite a bit.
Otherwise AoE1 is a solid game. Factions have very different strengths and weaknesses (and looks), there isn't a super-dominant unit that doesn't have a counter and the low supply limit forces you to often micro small balanced armies and think a bit outside of the box. AoE 1 has a surprisingly solid campaign mission design that often rewards exploration and generally the missions are fun.

In terms of remake this gets a 8.5/10 from me. I loved the way the original AoE1 felt, the sounds when you went through the menu, the soundtrack and in general the representation. These are mostly gone, the menu looks and feels very generic and minimalistic, the soundtrack is mostly replaced and only occasionally hints at original tracks. An option to switch these things off and on would have been appreciated. The campaigns in- and outros are now voiced, but unlike in AoE2 where you have multiple voice actors with fitting accents and voiced dialogues during missions here you have a single one who gets a bit tiring to listen to after a while.
That being said the new tracks are nice and fit the atmosphere, the new effects are neat and the DE makes the game look every bit as pretty as it was in my idolized memory. It's freaking gorgeous and pictures really don't do it justice. The higher resolution naturally is icing on the cake.

Overall It's easy to see why it became a classic, but also why it got completely replaced by AoE2. Realistically the pathing is holding it back quite a bit. As such I think it's easily worth trying out for the 5 bucks it's currently offered for if you have an interest in RTS and antiquity or played and liked the original, but it certainly can't compete with titles in it's full price range like AoE2DE or Sc2.",1609636413,1609636413,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]‚úî Opening Comments[/h1]
[i]Age of Empires: Definitive Edition[/i] is a complete graphical overhaul of the original game, released over 20 years ago. The Definitive Edition has fully replaced the graphics of the original, making it much more visually appealing compared to other games these days. Some other quality of life features such as auto re-farming have been added, making it less frustrating to play.

[h1]üéÆ Singleplayer[/h1]
Probably the main part of the game, [i]Age of Empires: Definitive Edition[/i] gives you the option to play historical campaigns, from Egypt to the Huns, or to play matches against as many AI as you wish. Another feature is the ability to play the game in the original 1997 graphics for some added nostalgia.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2346258638

Campaigns are quite good, but I found that because of the 50 pop cap, games could drag out needlessly for hours until finishing. Another annoyance was the difficulty of the AI on some levels. Some levels are horribly easy and then some are stupendously hard, even impossible.

The number of civilizations included is suitable for the time period and geographical location, but some nations such are clearly missing that were quite important in this time. It is unlikely there will ever be a DLC for [i]Age of Empires: Definitive Edition[/i] because of low popularity.

[h1]ü§º Multiplayer[/h1]
Multiplayer is nice when you can play a game with it dropping out, but due to [i]Age of Empires: Definitive Edition[/i]'s lack of popularity, there are not many lobbies available to choose from.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2346284763

[h1]üíª Graphics[/h1]
One of the main selling points for [i]Age of Empires: Definitive Edition[/i] were the new and improved 4K graphics. The developers did a fabulous job in updating everything into beautiful visual quality. There are three zoom detail options able to be selected, depending on how much RAM is currently installed in your system.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2346254605

Another updated visual is that of building collapse animations. When you destroy a building, it will collapse into a colorful mess of many bricks, adding an extra appeal to watching things being destroyed.

Overall in terms of graphics, the developers absolutely aced it. Pity that it can not really make up for lag issues.

[h1]üé∂ Soundtrack[/h1]
The in-game soundtrack is relaxing, and helps you focus on the screen. It is fully instrumental - another change that the Definitive Edition introduced - and sounds great. The music perfectly fits the age and theme the game is set in.


[h1]üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Audience[/h1]
[i]Age of Empires: Definitive Edition[/i] contains mild violence and death noises, and is not too complex to grasp the basics to be able to play, so I recommend it for anyone twelve or older, and especially those with a knack for history.

[h1]üî• Performance[/h1]
The game performed below average due to the single-core bottleneck. This caused frequent FPS drops throughout game-play, and was a real 'put-off' for me, making the game thoroughly less enjoyable. Although you could experience a smooth 30FPS (in-game lock in settings), this made everything clunky.

[b]My system specifications:[/b]
CPU: AMD Ryzen 3 3300X @3.8/4.3 Ghz
RAM: 16GB DDR4 @2666MHz
GPU: MSI AERO GeForce¬Æ GTX 1660 Super OC 6GB
Storage: 480GB internal SSD, 1TB ASUS FX external HDD

You computer will need to be stronger than the specs advertised on the store page, and if you want a high refresh rate, you will need a CPU with very strong single-core and thread performance.

[h1]‚ùì Conclusion[/h1]
To wrap up, [i]Age of Empires: Definitive Edition[/i] was a splendid job in terms of graphics and quality of life improvements; however, the huge flaws such as bad path-finding AI and CPU bottle-necking which causes huge and unsuspected lag make the game very hard to play much of and let-alone even enjoy. And since the latter is by engine design, it is highly unlikely performance in this category will ever be improved. 

I recommend to buying this game while on sale and only if you happen to have nothing better worth playing.

Rating: 5/10

i feel this game was just overhauled graphically but no care taken to optimise it correctly for low-end machines, more like a dressed up cash grab and unless you have a gaming rig that set you back several hundred ¬£'s then there really is no sense in playing this until it gets some extra attention to run smoother on anything that isnt a dedicated gaming rig

i can run games like deus ex human revolution fairly well, its no graphical masterpiece but certainly stretches the limits of what my laptop can run but still very playable nonetheless. AoE1 definitive edition on the other hand.. definitely unplayable.

They fixed the most annoying aspects of the original game such as production queuing, although there is a new bug where sometimes two or three units get stuck together and can't move for several minutes.

If you've never played it before, the game has an easy learning curve. However, the campaigns have no depth, and all but a few campaign maps were boring. I completed them all to check it off my list. The Egyptian campaign is a useful tutorial. After that, do random maps. They are fun for awhile.

I like the time period of starting in the Stone Age and progressing to the Iron Age. The world is saturated with games set in the Middle Ages, but almost all of human history was spent in the stone age and there is a lot of fascinating history prior to the Middle Ages. I wish someone would create a game of AoE2 quality or better set in the AoE1 timespan.

It's practically impossible to be objective about a game that I literally played while sitting on my Mom's knee, but this blast from the past holds the fuck up to the test of time.

The visual updates to classic aren't the only changes either. The Campaigns have updated as well, with some scenarios featuring minor cosmetic changes, such as the position of starting bases or resources been adjusted to improve the game balance and provide a better challenge, while others have been radically altered.

My main complaint is a big one.  There are times when the path-finding is ATROCIOUS.  I will echo another review in that it actually feels worse than I remember (although maybe we just don't remember how bad the 1996 version was).  Sometimes you have to babysit your army though tight passageways or corridors.   Occasionally your units will decide that the best way to walk around another unit is to WALK ACROSS THE MAP in the other direction.  Other times, two units in a crowd will accidentally overlap and get stuck, and you have to tell them to stop moving for about 5 seconds and then move them one at a time.  As long as units' pathways are about 3 tiles wide or more, the pathfinding is OK.

Your units gets stuck on each other a lot making a simple ""attack this enemy"" command be way more difficult than it actually should, they also do not update their target location very often, so if the enemy start to move away your unit will go to were you clicked to attack, not where they are now.
Enemy AI is also a problem, they keep attacking your city no matter what you do, even if you didn't attack them, your only viable option is to build towers around your city and gather a big enough army to destroy them in a single attack, because they will rebuild everything you destroyed before you can prepare a second attack. If you don't defeat them fast enough you will literally run out of resources and lose all the progress you made because you never have more resources than the enemy (unless you use cheats).
Also, WTF is with the kamikaze enemy units? You cannot bring any weak but useful unit with you because the enemy will pass your stronger units and kill them no matter what, even if your stronger unit attacked first, you also cannot keep the villagers anywhere near your towers because the enemy will ignore them and attack the villagers, you need to keep a literal wall of soldiers at the entrance of your city or else you will be expending all your food replacing the villagers.
Mind you I had all of these problems with the enemy AI in the Normal difficulty, going for easy doesn't help much and I'm not even going to try the harder ones, only buy this game for the nostalgia and use cheats as much as you would like, you don't lose the achievements.

Cons- It's EXACTLY the good old AOE1 you know and love. BUt let me explain further.

While the DE is what the name says, it keeps out many of the things that made AOE 2 better. No resource trading system unless it's gold, and if it's gold it's only by trading ships.
Path finding is exactly as bad as the original. tech costs while rebalanced are still the same ( you need gold to upgrade gold farming and stone to improve stone), population limit for campaign is still 50 , and houses still give you 4 pop. points

That being said. AOE1 is a pretty good game for it's time. and this is an improved version of that game. Not only in graphics but also the rebalancing changes and the music, wich we are going to talk about now.

Changes in graphics. Not only the game is now 4k compatible, units have a turning animation. wich i wish could be disabled. there is a problem with that animation. sometimes units get stuck inside other units. They usually de stuck after a while. but it's still annoying. However it doesn't happen often.

Rebalancing.

Farms , like in AOE2 DE can be auto restocked if you set it from the granary. Wheel is far cheaper now. And some civs passives were toned down because they were absolutely broken in the original AOE. some others where changed due to their passives being way too focused on water or teamwork only.

You have a tech tree available to see, no more checking the manual or a wiki, Zoom function, Defensive stance, attack on movement, attacking doesn't override stances,  You can combine different unit creation, and even queue a tech and unit together. All important info is right in the hud, you know how many villagers are being used for each resource... Even if they are not actually working on it, wich can be confusing if i wasn't a idle villager maniac and was always using the idle villager button (not a new feature tho, it's from rise of rome)

Now. Let's talk about the biggest contention point 

The campaign.

As i said pop limit is still 50. But not only that, adding the brain dead AI on most difficulties, you also have reworked maps. And most of them are EASIER. and not in a good way. The first Babylon map, holy man, is still a nightmare, even if you got more resources now, But THE HUNT, 4 4th in this campaign, and possibly the HARDEST in the original game, is now a cakewalk. And the reason is... Forgotten empires NERFED The skirmish levels. 

Skirmish levels are levels where you start with a limited set of units and find more trough the level, you can't build or replenish your troops.  And The hunt was the MOTHER of the skirmish levels. It's unforgiving, and requires good use of your troops, specially priests.

what did they do? Give you villagers, lots of resources to gather. and since the AI is set on defensive, waiting for your next move like in the original level, You don't have to worry about being attacked. You don't even have to worry about accidentally killing the villagers, because you later find more! And this kind of situation repeats on EVERY map where you used to have limited resources. Some of the maps where they actually made a new map instead are actually harder, but the ones that used to be skirmishes are a cakewalk.

The Yamato campaign was the worst in the original, it was rushed, difficulty was all over the place, so FE did a good job getting rid of most Yamato maps. Didn't play ROR yet, but i hope not a lot changed, ROR maps were very refined. And didn't really need a rework.

Overall if you play this game do it for the campaign, because even if the difficulty curve is all over the place, it still plays really good. Don't bother with the multiplayer. Most people are playing the superior AOE 2 Definitive. But AOE1 is a great piece of history, and despite not aging as good, It's still damn fine to play

Improved AI. BUT ONLY ON SKIRMISHES. While the campaign AI seems to be less stupid than vanilla AOE , anything under very hard makes it brain dead. I remember in the original AOE Moderate was pretty challenging. Here it's way too easy and the PC gives up on attacking you too fast. main problem, The campaing population limit, the game spends a lot of population on villagers and barely attacks you due to most of the population being lumberjacks. Don't expect a lot of challenge from the campaign because of this.

Music. It's okay, but i wish the OG OST was available. Mostly because the new one is good but lacks any impact. While i don't mind losing AOE1 music, I CARE about Rise of Rome music, and this OST doesn't do a good service to the original wich was top tier.

Micro is impossible and so beyond frustrating it's caused several ragequits, despite the love I have for this game. This happens ALL THE TIME. It's unbearable. 

Also the campaign cinematics, the most charming aspect of the game, are gone. How could they. JUST UPSCALE THEM AND PUT THEM BACK IN.

... go play the original version.

Edit: Changed to positive. Can't stop playing it, the nostalgia is too much. Alas:
- Pathfinding/micro is still garbage
- Some campaign missions are just bugged (Babylon 1, Imperium Romanum 2 at the very least).",1606575459,1607166960,True,0,1,0.566644787788391113,0,True,False,False

Except, one major flaw: they did not modernize the most important parts: adding more advanced commands like formation movements etc. The worst part is the path finding. It is simply terrible. Units get stuck trying to push the buildings out of the way. I had soldiers get stuck on a damned tree, unable to move anywhere until I manually moved them AROUND the stupid tree. I would send the army on attack/move command to enemy base, only to have them MOVE there and stand perfectly still, completely ignoring enemy units and buildings. They would only fight if someone attacked them directly, and only units that are directly attacking them. Other units will not move at all to come to aid unless I do it manually. Aggressive stance does not help at all.

It is a beautiful remake of the original AoE, but damn is it terrible to play. Do not buy at full price, it will hurt less when you realize how little time was spent on optimizing the most important parts of any strategy game - actually moving units and attacking others. Be ready to micromanage every single damned unit you have, since they will get stuck on trees, buildings, other units, etc, while also at the same time forgetting to fight enemies.",1606650270,1606650270,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Multiplayer works fine .  Steam achievements are doable without strong efforts and game overall is pretty cheap.

Pros: Graphics, good multiplayer online and all expansions campaign single player included into product, cheap price.
Cons: Strong players in multiplayer can ruin your experience, Limited roster of maps (nothing new added ) Same building and civilizations like original game, on long term this game can be boring and repetitive.

Age of Empires: Definitive Edition is a game developed by Forgotten Empires and Tantalus and published by Xbox Game Studios and is a remastered version of the classic Age of Empires

The game offers some nice graphics and environments, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

Age of Empires: Definitive Edition overall, however, is a fun game to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a very good strategy RTS game and to play in short bursts

AoE:DE has a great look and play well but it's still essentially the same game, you get 3 simple guys ( why only men? ) and you have to build a mini-civilization based one of the many civilizations formed in early human history. 

Sadly the DE update is really only updating the graphics, adding in the online play and a few tweaks to the fairly simple AI. There's really only one way to beat AoE:DE, same as you used to beat it in AoE, simply raise the biggest army you can at the highest tech point you can get to for your civ and then go kick seven shades out of your neighbour. That's it, usually takes about an hour to do that.

I bought it on sale and it's a great little time waster and brought back a few memories but AoE simply never had the depth of something like Sid Mieirs epic Cilivization games.

20GB of HD just for mild cosmetic enhancement (ships' oars still do not move as 20 years ago...nor any effort was made with animations: unlike AoE3, there is a single attack animation for both units and building and it is quite comical to look swordsmen or archers in vain fighting with building which at a certain point, and for unknonw reasons, collapse), a resampled soundtrack (which in my opinion has less ""personality"" than the original score: why on Earth the game start with AoE2's intro theme???) and the minor tweaks already added by the Rise of Rome expansion.
If rule out the nicer graphics (an utterly useless feature for strategic games) developers did nothing to truly improve the 1997 game, not even fixing the major flaws which were addressed in AoE2:pathfinding is still awful as it used to be, and the game become less and less fun as the unit cap is increased. Which makes me wonder why unit cap could be raised up to 250 when the AI is not able to move coherently five war chariots or keeps clogging up villagers...speaking of which I must underline that the flag and idle button of AoE2 have been included.
To sum it up, the Definitive Edition is basically a pile of chaff attempting to hide the horrid truth that the game is the very same of 20 years ago, which did not aged well at all.
So may wonder why did not asked the refund but, well, the answer is pretty simple: my AoE cd is damaged beyond repair and this is the only version available for when feel the urge to unleash a thundering nigthmare of horses and chariots upon the blue and yellow player (in truth the new animations and sounds of collapsing buildings and their razed remains make all this much more satisfying).
If are a long-time fan of AoE, then it may be worth the purchase if can not play the original AoE anymore; for all the others, there are many much better options

EDIT
Unlike the HD edition of AoE2, this one comes with the very same original AI, dumb as a brick.
Even at the highest difficulty setting AI can not handle sea maps (can not colonize new islands, waste a large fraction of the limited wood for useless buildings and, if wait to see what it does instead of wiping it away in the Tool Age, trains the most expensive land units and send them in suicide missions against the blockading fleet to the point it is even merciful to destroy the docks), and can put up a bit of challenge only through numbers: if pick an open, huge map with eight players, 2-3 AI-controlled civs should survive the bronze age onslaught and put up a fight.
AI performs better on deathmatches because of the horrid pathfinding which greatly increase the need for micromanagement when sizeable masses of units are assembled.",1605315494,1605450324,False,4,0,0.513572454452514648,0,True,False,False

The game comes indeed with better graphics; unfortunately the animations cannot keep up with that and so look cheaper than ever. Also AoE HD lacks those improvements which you can find in AoE2 HD or AoE2 DE. If you frequently play AoE2 HD/DE, you definitely will miss those features in AoE HD as much as I do. 

So here is my advice: In case the retro fever hits you, think about playing the good old classic version of AoE from CD. I am not kidding.

It had a 800mb hard drive, and 128mb of ram. We typically only had 1 or maybe 2 games installed at a time because of the disc space required. Age of empires was put on and did not come off. It would of course lag, have some occasional colour rendering issues because of how garbage the computer was. But it was quite well playable.

Fast forward to now. My computer is beyond the recommended specs of definitive edition (not that you should need such specs for a game like this, but that's another issue). On opening it I set every setting to maximum, as I typically do with games to see if it's playable, and my god it was horrifying.

Of course I set everything to minimum. What happened? Nothing. Exactly the same behaviour.  What behaviour might you ask? SO. MUCH. LAG. Building finished? Lag. New unit? Lag. Tell a villager to do an action? Lag. Battle horn? Lag. But this could just be an optimisation issue. Maybe I need to configure launch options. Thank goodness the game is so polished otherwise.

Oh, no.

How the fuck is the pathfinding WORSE than the original? How is this even possible? Units get stuck on each other, trees, coastlines, buildings, and it is CONSTANT. When 2 villagers get stuck on each other they can get trapped in this dance, and they don't show up as idle villagers either so unless you happen to notice they just dance forever. There are things you would have noticed just by playing the damn game. When villagers finish chopping down a tree on the edge of the map, they walk forever, facing the edge of the map. There are some sprites which just don't look the same as the others, they jitter slightly, like the lion. Something weird has happened with the edges of it and it just looks like it's floating near to the ground. But once it's in the dying animation and dead it looks normal. Oh and the fucking xbox live bullshit. No matter what I do, it just keeps opening the window again and again. Sometimes it crashes itself out, sometimes it freezes, sometimes I can close it and it leaves me alone for a while. No one in history has ever thought to themselves ""God this game would be so much better if I was forced to log in to a microsoft account"".

Given how long the game has been out for, it's fair to assume they don't intend to fix these issues. I suggest avoiding the game.",1605271043,1605271043,False,90,8,0.840445399284362793,0,True,False,False

The core game is pretty good and the new graphics and music is a nice improvement over the original.

But the AI and path finding is still complete crap, it feels like your own units are actively working against you at every opportunity, it's worse than the original game.

I could have been ok with that and still enjoyed the game if the developers hadn't broken the single player campaign. The difficulty is all over the place, doesn't matter if you play on easy or the hardest. Some missions are just unbeatable and the AI doesn't follow the original mission objectives. It looks like some of the skirmish AI tweaks they did have ruined the single player campaign.

(ii) Ability to walk over farms and automatic reseeding of farms
(iii) Having waypoints for units
(iv) Villagers allocated to each resource (near the resource bar) 
(v) Villagers start resource collection after building Granary/ Storage Pit

But, there are lot of issues, which haven't been solved in the last 22 years
(i) BAD path finding (this is a BIG issue)
(ii) No new civilizations. Seriously Devs? What about the Indians (Harappans and Mauryans?)
(iii) No Trade Carts and inability to trade for Food, Wood and Stone. (AoE 2 does a fantastic job)
(iv) No Formations for units (like AOE2 has). Who can forget the legendary Roman and Greek Formations? This is frustrating when coupled with bad path finding. The cavalry goes fast, the archers and infantry are slower and the Siege weapons and priests are stuck at last, thereby falling easy prey for attacks
(v) No Gates (like in AOE2) ; this prevents units from going astray 
Although micro-management has been improved (from the original game), it is no way near to what AOE2 offers. We need ability to group units, Auto Scouting... just to name a few. The issue is after a point of time, these problems are magnified. 

Make no mistake, I'm a huge fan of the AOE/AOM Franchise and I have finished all the games multiple times over the last 2 decades, but the price isn't justified and this is an insult to the original game. The Devs should realise that we gamers play AOE for the fun and not for the graphics.

The main issue by far (we're talking light years here) is that units are getting stuck with each other to the point you have to delete one to set the other free. The pathfinding is almost non-existent. They just wander of in whichever direction and get stuck somewhere, most commonly in the middle of battle when you task them to attack the enemy unit.

The balance of units is dreadful. I have used maybe half of the units available when playing through all of the campaigns. Just because the rest is utterly useless (we have a saying ""useful like a bobsleigh during summer""), so with pop limit of 50, they'd just be wasting space. And the half I used was only because the 2-3 unit types I wanted to use are not available to every civilization, so I had to use whatever the next best thing was they had available.

And the AI difficulty scale seems to be set higher than AOE2. Playing against medium AI is no walk in the park. And playing deathmatch (high starting resources) was a chore even against the easiest AI. I think the major difference between the difficulties might be resources available to the AI.

Yeah, the graphic looks ok but who cares? If I wanted something nice to look at, I'd buy an aquarium. But it seems to be the only thing worth calling definitive edition about this game.

I feel it would have been better to maybe stray further from the original, and overhaul some stuff. Like maybe add gates to the walls, add strongholds that are stronger than towers, make fewer units with more upgrades, so there's a sense of progression, make the civs more distinct from each other.

As it is, I don't see any reason for this game to exist. Would be better to just port the campaigns to AOE2:DE, so we can enjoy this historical era inside a playable game.

It's tough, because I imagine most people bought this game largely for nostalgia reasons, and any criticism of this game is likely to be construed as criticism of some of the community's most cherished gaming memories; I for one remember bonding over this game with my cousins as a young boy, and the patina of innocence and past-yearning are worth rehashing for its own sake.

But as a game, even in the context of a re-imagined retro game, AOE:DE falls short of the ambitious claim that it is the 'Definitive' experience. As in, no more improvements to be made.

I am okay that the game retains some of the tastefully retro elements, like cheesy 90s menus and buttons, a minimalist UI (much improved from the original), and lo-fi voices. But there is a difference between retro aesthetics, and flaws that make the game less enjoyable. These flaws are as follows:

- Very stupid AI and pathing. I mean, terrible. Units get lost or stuck moving from A to B; fishing boats constantly forget to keep fishing, requiring me to retask them over and over. Units needlessly take round-about paths, can't negotiate simple obstacles like narrow gaps, and react in weird and annoying ways when tasked as a group. I did not find these quirks endearing.

- High learning curve. With no tutorial, and an AI that even on its easiest setting still wrecks new players, I found this game hard to settle into. Enemy AI has to be able to see my units with or without LOS; there have been too many times where they randomly wandered through that one weak point in my defenses, past all my units, and slaughtered my Vils for it to be an accident. Plus, many times I have destroyed their economy and yet they still seem able to spam units...how?? They have to be receiving bonus resources or something. I think it is fair-game to compare AOE:DE with its natural successor, AOE2:DE, which handles new players much better, with both a tutorial and War Academy.

- Bugs. Why are there still frame-rate drops, glitched movement, animal bugs, and the like? This game has been out for 20 years, and the DE spent a year on the Windows store before coming to Steam...my personal opinion is that the Devs knew that AOE2:DE was going to be their money-maker, and so they put their focus there. Well fine, but it sucks as the consumer.

But even though it became a quite good game, one important thing doesn't work and when I found out it was too late. I play AoE with friends and we play with AI, so to scout for us I bought the game and played a test game against the AI and I enjoyed it so I recommended it. My best buddy bought this game, we played a MP match against the AI and we wondered that it was too easy. We played team isles so maybe the AI isn't that great on this map type so we tried it a few more times but even on the highest difficulty we had absolutely no problems to win against enemies with only a few units, several buildings and almost no resistance. It seems the multiplayer AI is different from the AI used outside the multiplayer and is extremely passive. We both wasted 5 Euro so it didn't hurt that much but it was clearly a bad investment for both of us.
If you play it for the campaigns, it more or less works. If you solely play MP with and against humans it will work fine. If you plan to add AI in multiplayer matches, don't buy it.
Edit 31.08.: seems the singleplayer AI became worse. I set a waypoint to a tree and the trained villager did nothing on their arrival. In addition to that, I ordered my two ships to attack another naval unit but one of the ships ignored that and attacked another unit instead.

In Standard games, this AI is - quite incredibly - too easy and too difficult to deal with at the same time, acting nonsensically when it comes to actually building a economy or army, but capable of divine skills allowing it to guess your position and actions at every single point of the game without ever needing to properly scout. There's a few strategies to eventually deal with it, but playing against the AI never feels remotely close as fighting something with actual sentience. By the way, do not even try to fight more than 2 AI at once: as soon as you launch an attack against one player, the other AIs will instantly turn hostile to you and send their whole army to your base - they always magically find its location -, no matter their alignment with the player you attack, no matter the difficulty setting you choose.

The campaign mode is unfortunately where this new AI is most damaging to the game, as it will always act just like it would in skirmish/deathmatch: if the scenario is a mission where the original AI started with a giant army which was supposed to stay in its starting location until you're ready to engage it, the new AI will simply send its army to your base to steamroll you before you even get the chance to do anything. In other missions where the objective isn't tied to destroying the enemy, this ""improved"" AI will often give up before you complete the mission objectives if you deal too much damage to it, ruining the mission's narrative.

All in all, this new AI addition renders the singleplayer experience nonsensical, unenjoyable and void.

I have no idea of how the multiplayer fares, as I never had any desire to play it ; maybe it is good, since you don't have to deal with the AI? Still, if Microsoft and Forgotten Empires only ever desired to remaster the multiplayer component to this game, maybe they should have made this remaster multiplayer-only and advertised it as such, because I feel it's somehow more damaging to include the singleplayer content of this game in such a state than simply getting rid of it.

If you really want to experience Age of Empires how it is meant to be played, find a copy of the original game and its expansion or the Gold version, and download the Upatch HD (https://upatch-hd.weebly.com/) as it offers several improvements from improved resolutions to AI and countless bugs and textures fixes, even adding a few new maps to the game.

And if you want a Definitive Edition that actually does justice to its original game, get Age of Empires II Definitive Edition. I'm saddened to see the state of Age of Empires 1 when Forgotten Empires did so well with the second installment, and I can only hope that Age of Empires III Definitive Edition will be more like the latter, not the former.",1598798218,1598798218,False,55,1,0.757398486137390137,0,True,False,False

Age of Empires: Definitive Edition truly is the best version you can play of AOE1.

I would highly recommend that if you haven't given it a shot already, buy this game at full price or on sale and go crazy. It's worth it either way, and you'll get hours of both relaxing AND keyboard-smashing fun! Just be sure to crank up the Woolooloo.

- Pathfinding is so awful that it makes the campaign pretty much unplayable or at least very frustrating/annoying. Unit collision size and how it affects all that, will make you find some strong rope and attaching point for it. Its that bad.

- Because of the collision size and how the movement is so clumsy (because the game engine behind all that is so old), the units will collide with each other even on a field with no obstacles. When two of them collide (going to same direction), the other unit makes 90deg turn and goes that direction for a sec. Then it will collide with an another unit (running to its path) which makes that same manouver and the show goes on. Its just plain horrible and ruins the whole game. Also, they make choke points even on wide paths because if one stops, then the unit next to it stops and then its all blocked like dozens of times that day you have been playing the game and finally, you uninstall it and start playing games like WC3 or SC2 where all those problems mentioned in this review, are nonexistent.

- A group of units easily get jammed together for no reason and they ""release"" themselves totally random after time X, Y or Z has passed after that: They literally are stuck tightly and cannot move. I dont remember that from the original games so they have made all that previous even worse.

- No formations. Or there is, one fixed that is just pure BS: If the units have distance X from each other and you command them to place Y, they will keep that distance to each other and the location where you clicked is right between those. Just think what happens when there is not much space in the are you ordered them... They will be all over the place and blocking other units etc etc.

I could give a dozen more examples why the game mechanics in this game suck so hard. It seems that they were in rush and just polished this turd without making it more playable. If you played this game when you were 10yrs old kid, buy it if its on sale. Others, dont bother.

Despite all this I unfortunately cannot recommend this game, due to the overbearing new AI even on low difficulty settings that, on the original game, would give the same player little trouble. This is quite tragic, as so much good work has clearly gone into this otherwise fantastic product.

NOTE 1:
This review is regarding single-player modes only.

NOTE 2 (further details regarding new AI):
For the sake of reference, I typically play on ""standard"" difficulty, which is 1 step above ""easy"" but 1 step below ""moderate"", which was my preferred setting on the original game and rarely gave me too much trouble. On all difficulties I find the new AI drags every single map (notably including campaign missions) down into a gruelling war of attrition which only ends when they run out of resources to the point where they physically have nothing left to produce units. An interesting observation I figured out last night is that at this point any allies will tribute resources to them until they too have nothing left (even to the point of self-sacrifice; in this example the AI providing tribute gave away so much that it never produced more than about 20 military units or even advanced to Iron Age, despite the map lasting over 2 hours). The AI will construct many redundant buildings (typically 4+ of each: town centre, barracks, siege workshop, archery range, etc) which will clog up the terrain, confounding micromanagement and continuously churning out units until reaching the population limit or no resources. This makes some campaign missions (including the tutorial campaign!) truly horrendous due to the single player (typically starting with little or no base) but facing multiple enemy players (typically starting with one or more highly developed base(s)) from different directions at the same time. To summarise as succinctly as possible, the AI expansion and multitasking capabilities are similar to the highest difficulty settings on other RTS games, regardless of which setting you have actually chosen.

I'm a massive AoE fan. I still have the original somehow running on my Windows 10 PC. So, it saddens me that a ""Definitive Edition"" must get a down-vote from me.
Here is what I like about it compared to the original:
- Looks updated, better graphics.
- A new campaign based on the Hittites
- The old campaigns are there too, as well as the Rise of Rome campaigns
- Built-in tech trees you can explore (like in AoE2)
- Unit queuing (like in RoR)

Here's what I really don't like about it:
- You can't even use the Return key to go down a line when trying to type in the Scenario Instructions box on the editor. What is up with that? (**EDIT** They have fixed this. However, now if you try to edit the text in the Scenario Instructions, it doesn't just crash the AoE game, if the window doesn't close automatically, you have to shut your whole computer down to close the game. Not even Task Manager is getting rid of that crash.)
- Still a limited zoom function on the editor, making maps is still as clunky as in the original. IMO, pretty much no improvement, and for an updated release of a game over 20 years old, that is unbelievably shocking. (**EDIT** Still not fixed with new update)
- ""Connect to XBOX live account"" is fraught with issues (UI suppressed etc.), and I still can't do it, even after troubleshooting from Microsoft's website. If Microsoft bloody Solitaire can connect and synch seamlessly, why can't AoE DE? (**EDIT** Got this working on my laptop, must have been an issue with my PC. My bad)
- As far as I can tell, there is no way to port old campaigns/scenarios I (or anyone else) made on RoR or AoE original into the DE version. Again, that is absolutely shocking.
- All this game seems to be is a graphically improved (though not perfect) version of the old RoR game, with a new UI, which is somehow more limited. No new civs, no expanded tech tree, no extra depth, music has been updated (and some tracks are actually worse imho). 
- It is absolutely not worth ¬£15 (which is what I got it for). You're better off getting your hands on Age of Empires: Rise of Rome, which for a 20 year old game, should be cheap or even free. If you aren't a graphics snob, and would rather a game that does more than what you expect for a 20 year old game, get RoR and enjoy it.

(**EDIT** It still isn't worth ¬£15. I have played it some more and given it a go, but it still needs basic improvements to make the actual gameplay match the original.)

That's it really. If you are a dev or modder or have any fixes to what I have mentioned, I'd be more than happy to edit my review. The AoE community is an amazing one, and I have learnt so much from them, an had years of enjoyment playing community created campaigns. It's a shame Microsoft didn't consult people who have played and loved the game for 20 years, and they don't seem to care about fixing those issues either. Unless you want multiplayer, stick with RoR. You'll be glad you did.
AoE original: 7/10 (considering the hours of game time and enjoyment it has brought me)
RoR expansion: 9/10 (a great update with more functionality and 4 new campaigns)
AoE Definitive edition: 1/10. (I genuinely regret buying it).
I'm off to play RoR.

Other gumpf:
I bought this game thinking that I'd be getting a polished, sparkly, updated version of the original. I was expecting the same campaigns (which it has, plus another one for the Hittites), I was expecting all the features that the new games had that the original doesn't (remember when you couldn't unit queue? Myself and Pepperidge Farm remember), I was expecting an enhanced scenario editor where I could make historical campaigns the way I wanted to and play them with all the depth and detail I have come to expect from online AoE scenario and campaign sites, and that I try to emulate. I was expecting polished graphics, and easier online connectivity, fit for purpose going into the 2020s.
And by and large, I'm really quite disappointed.
Here's a few disclaimers about the way I play: I don't do multiplayer, and even having played the game for a long time, I'm still not very good. As I said, I try to make historical battles and campaigns. I'm not a pro or a modder, just a standard user who likes RTS games and a really keen interest for history.",1586010674,1594571950,False,18,0,0.548485279083251953,0,True,False,False

Good game, though it's full of issues that have been there since the original. The campaign is also out of whack in difficulty. Some missions take hours to complete , while others you just stand there and your allies win the game for you.  Online multiplayer seems restricted to private groups, though the devs have attempted to update the game to encourage online play.  The new update added some interesting features not present in the original such as more unit commands which is a plus. Now you can tell your catapults to not attack the middle of the town!!! hellz ya.

First of all, what made me buy this title instead of AOE II was being able to play with ancient cultures, something that most games in general lack, and i saw a chance here, like the Romans and Egpyt, but this game offers a lot of limitations compared to the other games.

[h1]First of all, the pros[/h1]
- Much better graphics
- Much better Interface
- Tons of empires
- Tons of troops and upgrades
- Soundtrack
- A lot of campgains

[h1]The cons[/h1]
- your troops getting stuck at each other multiple times (unable to move)
- limit of troops/peasants(50)
- very confusing upgrades, example: (you upgrade your towers at your cellar) wut? you upgrade your troops at the warehouse. That makes me feel lost at times.
- not being able to kill unecessary troops/peasants
- tons of useless buildings
- no cutscenes
- no gates to complete your castle (not sure if the original one had)
- no voice acting (heroes)
- dumb AI (free for all matches, all AI decide to attack you at the same time)

I expect further updates for this game, still a master-piece. 
Stay away from it for now, buy AOE II instead.",1594216309,1594410522,False,10,0,0.49521636962890625,0,True,False,False

Including the 90s style AI dumbness, so your units require a lot of micromanaging, especially with path finding... 
The only thing that might scare off the nostalgist is the ""cartoonish"" graphics.
All units look the same, but more detailed and also bright colours, these bright colours make it look like playing a cartoon (remember Battlefield Heroes?).

The improved graphics look great, the arrows make satisfying snappy sounds when fired, the buildings (and their destruction animations) are a treat to look at, and the water and landscapes look pretty. It's fun to play and looks great (high quality 2D graphics). I logged over 24 hours within the first week after getting it (yay quarantine).

The AI could be improved, however. The pathfinding is still a bit dumb, and sometimes AI opponents will just be too stupid to feed themselves and ""starve"" - get all of their soldiers and villagers killed with no food in reserve, therefore becoming dead in the water. This really sucks when you get to the Iron Age and have an army built up, and you find out that your enemy is still in the Tool Age and is completely idle. Pillaging a desolate village already destroyed by famine just isn't all that fun. The shortcomings of the AI are disappointing to me, since I usually prefer to play against the computer by myself or with my brother (I'm not good enough to face human opponents).

If you don't get a dumb opponent, prepare to be crushed by catapults and war elephants early on - there is a huge jump between the different difficulty settings, going from far too easy, to brutally difficult (IMO) very quickly; brutally difficult as in being annihilated less than ten minutes into the game even when everyone started in the Stone Age with minimal resources, but then again, I'm still not that good at AoE even after all these years.

Then, when I had gotten a good game going against competent AI opponents, I had problems with them resigning when I started to win against them (literally after they lost just a few houses and towers, ""RESIGN!"". This is easily fixed by editing the .per files using a text editor like Notepad to disable resignation (change to 0 to a 1 in the Death Match and Random Map .per files and enjoy crushing your enemies with relative impunity).

Minor complaint is that sending a game invite through Steam seems to do nothing - other player tries to join the game, waits 5+ minutes, and still can't get into the lobby. I have to make a public match and kick anyone else that joins besides my bro (sorry). Also, I realized that you have to select unranked match to play against AI online rather than selecting Death Match or Random Map when creating the game.

If they fix the AI incompetence and pathfinding issues, this game would be perfect. I would have literally zero complaints. It's all problems with the AI. I would still recommend getting this game despite this.",1593738008,1593738008,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Friends on Steam joining your multiplayer lobby via invitation causes the game to hang and ultimately crash for them. Why? After investigation on the Steam forums, unless joining players log into an Xbox Live account (including the host), the game doesn't know what to do and, as said, just hangs and breaks.

Clearly the devs haven't covered situations where Steam players don't use Xbox Live, which in the days of Microsoft Game Store exclusivity wasn't a problem. New store, new platform, new problems.

What's more - how come the newer game, Age of Empires II Definitive Edition, doesn't have this problem?! It's weird. This makes me think that it's an oversight as opposed to a strategic, snide, 'use our online service or get an incomplete game' move. It's been long enough since the Steam release though - must be low priority. Low priority = 4 players (including myself) refunding.

I love everything about this version, the music and animation are just way over top and all the new stuff as well. This really is the Definitive Edition.

In my opinion, worth it for the sale price but not full price, considering the original still runs on Windows 10 and much, much faster on low/middle end computers.

Visuals: everything is gorgeous. Change the zoom level in settings for even more detail and gorgeousness while giving up playability. Cutscenes have been replaced with voiced actors for Instructions.

Sound/Music: sounds have been remade completely. Each original sound has been replaced with re-recorded variants, but keeping the essence of those original sounds, making them less repetitive. Music has been rescored, but to me it has lost some of its magic this way.

Playability: some standard features have been added such as gather points, autorebuild farms. Hotkeys now depend on the position for each button in the UI, not on the unit's name, but I think it was reconfigurable. Units may now walk over farms (this was not possible in the original). All these changes are appreciated. Some civilization bonuses have changed slightly for better MP balance. You can play random maps using the 1997 assets if you want, but some visual features are broken (i.e. look worse than the 1997 AoE/RoR), for example some trees have no shade, water has no waves, etc. Even in this mode it still requires the same specs as the DE, so it will run much worse than the original on older systems.

Campaigns: campaign maps tend to follow the same structure as the originals. I haven't checked if some are identical (sans visual enhancements) but at least are very similar in shape and feel. Some maps have been completely remade, but didn't feel anything was missing, I only noticed because some maps were new and gave some freshness to the game.

Overall, it preserves the essence of the original with more modern graphics and audio, but it's hard to justify paying $10 for this if you already have the original, other than curiosity.",1592761747,1592761747,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Age of Empires: Definitive Edition (AoE1 from hereupon) is of course a well-remastered rendition of the game of the same title from the late 90's. Instead of blathering on about all of the satisfaction this game brings me, I'm going to keep it quite curtailed and just explain the good notes, and the bad.

AoE1 is a real time strategy game built upon a wonderful campaign system that could be completely ignored in lieu of it's robust randomizer engine. Ever wanted to play out a violent war between China and Rome? This game lets you do that, while being completely unforgiving in the process. The AI pathfinding is absolutely horrendous, leading to controlled units aimlessly wandering back and forth while they try to get around the seven trees in their direct path. the AI for the enemy factions are somehow telepathic and often know your strategy way before you do. But that all doesn't really matter, as it's hihgly likely the reason you're looking at this review is to discern whether or not it remains faithful to its original counterpart. It most definitely is. The only major difference of note is that you're no longer limited to just a population of 50, which leads to some very interesting brawls once you break the game with as many cheats as possible.",1592656222,1592656222,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

[i]Priest[/i][/h1]

First thing first, what we have here is a remake, not a remaster. Even though technically, you'll be able to switch to the ‚Äúold school‚Äù visuals from the original [b]Age of Empires[/b], it's a different game and the difference is way bigger than what you can see in [b]StarCraft Remastered[/b], for example. And yet, [b]Age of Empires DE[/b]? It's a remake done right. Even though a lot of stuff from ‚Äúmodern‚Äù real-time strategies was added (for example, you'll be able to use rally points, which were not a part of the original gameplay), pathfinding, which was a pretty big problem back in the days, was improved again (it was already improved in [b]Rise of Rome[/b] expansion before), there's a new zoom feature, etc, etc, etc.

The funniest thing, though, even with all the changes, the game manages to feel the same somehow. I'm not kidding. I've played (and finished) the [b]Definitive Edition[/b] and the original [b]1997[/b] version side-by-side and I must say ‚Äì the original soul is totally here. You loved the original [b]Age of Empires[/b] back in the days? You'll love the updated version. Especially since all the campaigns from both the main game and its official expansion are here. Heck, even the [b]First Punic War[/b] campaign from trial version of [b]The Rise of Rome[/b] (which wasn't in the full game, in case you didn't know that) is included! I totally love the attention to details here.

Now, about the bad stuff. First of all, the atmosphere sucks. I mean, yes, gameplay-wise, this game feels totally right. But stupid new voiceover? It just sucks. Especially that awful narrator who'll narrate all of the briefings. I mean... the original [b]Age of Empires[/b]? Even though it had quite a lot of bright colors in it, there was a certain kind of atmosphere in it. Which was one of the reasons why so many people called it a mix between [b]WarCraft[/b] and [b]Sid Meier's Civilization[/b]. And even though I never liked such comparison much, I mist admit, there's sure something in it. The voices of your units, the music, the menus... there was a certain mood in all that. And the new voiceover and menus? The game started to feel way more bright thanks to them. Almost like a comedy (again, all thanks to the stupid narrator). All the darker mood is gone now and the game began to feel more like... well... more like [b]Age of Empires Online[/b]. If you know what I mean. Atmosphere-wise? It's more [b]Settlers[/b] than [b]AoE[/b]. And I can't say I like it. Doesn't sound like a big thing, sure, and in a way it is not (especially since [b]AoE[/b] always relied on multiplayer quite a lot and it's not like you'll need atmosphere there, simply because you won't have time for that), but still, I can't help but feel that certain something was ruined together with the old atmosphere.

The cutscenes were also completely removed with pretty much nothing to replace them (again, nobody played [b]AoE[/b] for cutscenes, but still) and, well, there's a lot of small cons here. For example, optimization can be better (got a lot of weird [b]FPS[/b] drops here and there), [b]Xbox[/b] integration is a little big bugged (achievements can pop up with some delay and in my case one of them bugged and, while being unlocked in [b]Steam[/b], stayed locked on my [b]Xbox[/b] profile), while [b]AI[/b] is pretty dumb. Can't say I hated dumb [b]AI[/b] much, though. I mean... make the computer way too smart and [b]AoE[/b] just won't feel the same. There was a certain balance between smart [b]AI[/b] and the old school experience and personally? I think they did it all right here. They even kept the [b]AI[/b] being exactly as nasty as it was back in the days. Leave one enemy villager alive and in only a couple of seconds he'll build a freakin' empire right around the corner. That certain feeling of frustration from the original [b]AoE[/b]? It's still here. And I loved it. Because that's exactly how I remember it.

Like I've said, if you liked the original [b]1997[/b] game, you'll love the [b]Definitive Edition[/b]. And that's what you call a success, I guess. All the bad things about this release are minor, while all in all, it's pretty much as good as you'll want it to be. It's also nice to (finally) see a proper [b]Steam[/b] release. With [b]Steam[/b] achievements (which won't be disabled by cheats, but still), online leaderboards and all the original [b]Xbox[/b] features intact (yes, you'll still be able to get your [b]G-points[/b] if you'll buy this game in [b]Steam[/b], just make sure to connect your [b]Xbox[/b] profile in the main menu). There's one thing you should know about [b]Age of Empires[/b], though. See, this game is not for the new players. You never played such games before? Go for [b]Age of Mythology[/b] or [b]Rise of Nations[/b] first (both are presented in [b]Steam[/b]). You'll get a pretty good idea about how such games work and will be able build up some skill without suffering much. [b]Age of Empires[/b]? It was always a bit rough. And the [b]Definitive Edition[/b] kept that intact. Don't expect this game to go easy on you. Even on the lowest difficulty out there, new players have all chances to be brutally defeated. [b]AoE[/b] is just one of those series that may actually worth playing in a wrong order. Just because the first one was allways the most hardcore out there. You either know exactly how to achieve things, or die in agony.

It's a good thing, though. I mean, I just wanted to mention that. Just in case that kind of info will be useful for somebody. When it's about remakes, nobody likes it when the good old games become casual crap. When the original game was challenging? You want it to stay that way. [b]Crash[/b] got it. [b]Age of Empires[/b] got it too. And with easily accessible multiplayer? I'd say, this one is a must have for all [b]Age of Empires[/b] fans out there. It's almost as good as remake can be. You want it to be closer to the original? Dust off your original [b]CD[/b]s. Dixi.",1589898359,1589898366,True,10,1,0.595212876796722412,0,True,False,False

It was on the demo disc (where I also discovered Grand Theft Auto) it wasn't a timed demo, just a restricted one, and it played the hell out of it all the way up to October 1998 when I finally caved and bought the full game. It was naturally usurped by AOE2, which I've sank many days into over the years. In doing so, the original was forgotten. I was hoping that this ""Definitive Edition"" would reignite my love. It didn't.

They've got some nerve calling this a definitive edition as there are numerous problems, not the least of which is the game suddenly cutting off and returning you to the desktop, and there's nothing you can do about it. Sometimes you'll get lucky and manage to finish a game, other times you won't! The interface is more detailed and user-friendly, but the controls feel clunkier and, compared to AOE2, you'll have no order over your armies, who just go off to do what they want instead of lining up in formations.

With less technology than the sequel, there's not much incentive to go back to the original Age of Empires outside of the nice visuals and orchestral soundtrack (assuming that you are not driven mad by the game just cutting you off as soon as you get going).

If you are looking for a modern rendition of AoE 1 this is not it, this is more of a graphical update and the minimal QoL features for it to be considered a remaster. The shift queuing of tasks is broken so it leads to a very frustrating experience. The pathfinding for units is a mess and leads to inefficiencies.

If you are looking for a scrappy economy to play with and try to suss out an army, this is a good game. If you are looking to field hundreds of legionnaires and storm the enemy fort, this is not it, go play Rome Total War.

The naval game play is boring, artifacts are historically cool to look at to see how they evolved into relics, wild animals actually take down huntable animals.

The game feels a bit on the sluggish side, primarily because the GUI is a weird mix of modern and terribly dated elements. The nice graphical display of campaigns is replaced with lists that do not indicate progress. I really wouldn't want anyone to buy this game if you're looking at it for competitive play, there's too much dumb micromanaging for it to be a pleasurable experience.

If you are looking for historical campaigns and building what-if scenarios, this is a pretty good game to do that from.

If nothing else, Definitive Edition is certainly true to the original, to the point of it being a fault.  The updated visuals are impressive, and certain quality-of-life features (like handy tool-tips that remind new and veteran players alike which buildings house which upgrades) are welcome additions.

However, I do feel quite strongly that the window dressing wasn't the only thing requiring an update.  One of the major reasons why AoE2 is hailed in the best in the series is due in large part to the wide variety of strategic unit options available for guiding and fielding armies.  That the same unit tactics were not put in play in this Definitive Edition of AoE1 strikes me as something bizarre as it is frustrating, even for a seasoned player of the original.  I can only imagine how many newer players likely resort to cheat codes to clear campaign missions because the all-too-faithful retention of the game's original AI will cause units to pathfind incorrectly around terrain features, or clump up and pause before attacking a target or retreating.  Losing units (and potentially entire missions) to one's inexperience or incompetence as an RTS player is one thing; doing likewise because of antiquated AI entirely another.

That's why it is so difficult to recommend this title as it stands.  On the one hand, I am very accustomed to the kind of jank this sort of game had back in the early- and mid-90's, but we are nearly thirty years removed from those kinds of software limitations being acceptable.  Had the AI, pathfinding, and versatility of unit tactics been brought up to the same spec as AoE2 I wouldn't have any issue heralding this iteration of AoE1 as a worthy update to the original.  But given that the game plays in so archaic a fashion despite the more modern appearance will surely drive away newer players, or players more accustomed to AoE2 (or even 3), I cannot in good faith recommend this as a purchase for anyone save the most die-hard AoE fans.",1588289917,1588289917,False,2,1,0.535400390625,0,True,False,False

For the negative things, it's controls are changed which is a serious bad thing. I am used to the old controls and I like those, I want those back. As I said, the zoom function is too far zoomed in even if fully zoomed out. This is a real problem if you want to play in a decent way.

The MS Store version is represented by colourless logo, Steam version with coloured logo. Both versions have their very own sets of exactly same Xbox achievements - well DUH!

Gameplay of AoE has not aged well at all, this game is officially postwall now, but with no gates, garrisonable towers, town centers or something like fortresses. Thus almost every AI raid has a big potential to turn into immediate worker drone slaughter. Creators did the very minimum in terms of improvements like idle worker button and farmland the farmer can actually walk over. Outside of that everything stays the same, AI know excactly where you are from the start, pathfinding is still worse than that of an ant on a computer screen. Army formations remain something that ancient people weren't able to fathom with their lizard brains according to this game.

Nations do not feel unique at all, just 4 old tired architecture sets, 4 wonders and widely shared unit types. Every single nation seems like the Greeks were roleplaying as Hittes, Babylonians, Egyptians - just name it.

This version is just awful. If you enjoyed the original and Rise of Rome back in the day, chances are you are going to be massively disappointed. 

- The re-imagined music is forgetable, it does not really sound anything like the classic music in the original. Same with some of the voice lines, most of the iconic voices are gone. 
- The pathfinding is atrocious, somehow they made it even worse than the original, which just blows my mind. 
- The AI is incredibly cheap to play against, even on the eaiser difficulty settings. When attacking an AI base they just run all over the place and spam Town Centers and villagers making it very tedious to hunt them all down. There is also an option to increase the population to 250 (if I remember correct) but all that happens then is that the AI goes crazy and spams an never ending army of Legions. 
- This is really nitpicky but I actually hate how the game itself looks, it just looks bland and unappealing. Some of the newer models look pretty good, like the Hoplites and some of the buildings. But overall it does not actually look or feel like Age of Empires but rather some cheap knock off. 
- The achivements are a joke, too few and really uninspired. 

To call this version of the game the Definitive Edition is just insulting, stay away from this one and stick to the original. Or get the Definitive Edition of AoE2, because that is actually worthy of the name Definitive.",1586961740,1586964214,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Also, the graphics aren't even that nice. It looks like the old backdrop from the original, only the character models look out of place, as if floating GIFs on the battlefield, it looks odd.

Even the largest skirmish maps are tiny, you normally have barely any space to build and your buildings take up tonnes of space - you almost never have enough room to build all the houses that you need.

The announcement of AoE: DE was a shock for me, I volunteered to test the beta, and got my hands on a relatively early build. I was stoked, but also a tad bit disappointed: the visual and musical overhaul was amazing, but didn't have the charm of the original, the mechanics were pretty much in shambles, and made some games really unenjoyable, to the point, where (although I'm not proud of it) I lost my commitment as a tester. Well, time passed, and I read about some interesting changes, positive and negative feedback from other testers, and even players, after the original release - one in particular, that piqued my interest: classic mode, with the original visuals and music was available now. At one point, I collected my spare shekels, waited for a sale, and got the game for 10‚Ç¨. It was worth it. Much better performance than the beta (speaking single player-wise, since I've never been so confident as to step into multiplayer blindly), and the classic mode just hits the right spots. Now on the downside, it's still a mess sometimes. Pathfinding is still terrible, the new graphics tend to make my hardware go ""nope"" in some cases (I run an office laptop, nowhere near a gamer setup, mind you) and since needs of players far progressed since 1997, the game might seem lacking, if played constantly (it has and always had way less replayability than the second implementation). Regarding the last part though, we can't blame the devs for trying to minimize changes to the authentic design - even though personally, I wouldn't mind some new civs added to the original roster, despite a major part of the community hexing people who even mention something ""cashgrabby"" ""money-milky"" as that.

Other issues such as 'model conflict' (duono how you will call this) while units are facing and moving towards each other, they suddenly freeze. I believe this is simply 'succeeded' from the old 20th century version, but this is just annoying while you play.

Steam - Won't even recognize player invites.

The only way you can set up a multiplayer lobby for your friends is by making a public lobby, but get this - there's not even a way to set up a password for a lobby, so while waiting for your friends, you'll just have to kick everyone else that tries to join. And even when your lobby is public, it's not guaranteed your friends will see it. You just have to keep recreating the lobby until they do.

I was very excited about this plus the graphics look amazing, but the first match i player ruined my experience, the did a 1v1 vs the AI on standard, i couldn't believe how overpowered the AI was, i mean there was no way i human could beat it, i mean even during battle AI was taking almost 10 desicions per second in different areas of the map, which a real person could never beat, after getting defeated in the first battle and the map completely running out of wood/gold/stone i somehow managed to raise another army with just food and the leftover of my gold stockpile, and attacked again, now mind you this was a map in which there was a big land mass in the middle surrounded by water, both the teams on the same land mass, the AI had like infinite amount of boats and i my ships were all destroyed in the first battle and now with the map completely out of wood, i was not able to make any more ships, i could have traded but my market was destroyed and i couldn't make it for the same reason.

Now after i raised my second army, i managed to destroy all the buildings and all the units of the AI, all there was left with boats, now i tried luring the boats towards the shore by making my troops go near the shore,

and i was successful i mean i destroyed around 10 ship like that, also i built some towers around the shore to increase my line of sight and that killed another 5 but even after that the game wouldn't finish, 

Now i looked up, and to win by conquest, you have to destroy each unit and building to win, now these ships, i could literally see them running into the fog of war and i tried to think of some other way to lure the ships near the shore to destroy them but i was not able to do anything, 

Now thinking maybe there is just one ship left over somewhere and there is nothing i can do because i don't have any ships, i finally decided to use the the cheat code to reveal the map and to clear the fog of war,

I couldn't believe what i saw, i could see at least 35 ships lined around the the edge of the map and the corner of the map, and they weren't even trying to attack they were just idle here, it's like the AI figured out it was going to loose and decided to hide troops to not loose the game, 

Then i decided to get this over with i used the cheat code to get wood and gold, i made ships and tried attacking these AI ships, now to surprise, these ships were not even attacking back they were just trying to run away

Finally i finished the game, and i was very disappointed, this was my first game of AOE 1 after a very long time and i couldn't believe how the AI was so overpowered and cheated

I seriously hope the the devs fix this, it's very disappointing to buy one of your favourite games as a child, and have this kind of an experience",1586030440,1586030440,True,9,8,0.572672009468078613,0,True,False,False

For an ancient game, so much was improved in the visual department that this can almost be reconsidered a remake. 
While AoE 1 isn't a masterpiece like AoE 2, it's still a great game with very solid mechanics.

Its age shows mainly in the lack of different units and overall cultural diversity of factions compared to its successor. But that's pretty much the worst thing I can say about it, which is saying a lot in itself, considering this game is 20 years old.

But here it is: it WAS one of the greatest game from my early years experience. So how not to be curious and try to get back to those nice memories? Microsoft knew that the bait was strong in the community, so they just wrapped it up quickly with so much flaws.

- the game is almost exactly the same, alright, it was the deal (much more beautiful indeed... no autosave or decent pathfinding though?). I can enjoy that.
- ""oops cannot run on Win8"". Had to wait to buy a new computer to run it -_- (well played microsoft)
- new computer, more than enough to run it: umbeliavable lag at the start, to the point you can get black screens and windows itself prefers to consider it dead. Not sur what kind of coal technology they used to optimize their game experience, but the game DOES have to warm up 15 min of lag/freeze to finally be playable.
- Let's not talk about the glitchy and invasive online game system... 
- AoE DE is out for a while already. What a surprise to see that all the bugs people were reporting ages ago are still a pain in the ass. I tried dozens of fixes, reinstalled all my drivers and even windows 10, for zero improvement. It's 2020 and AoE I can't run smoothly or without the threat of crashing. What an achievement.

Firstly the ai is dogshit, the amount of times ur vills just afk and get stuck between a rock or a tile is astounding, secondly a lack of commands for units results in a heap of frustration, enemy boats or units seeping thru ur defences cos u cant patrol ur army to protect anything is quite annoying. Also i hate the enemy ai, its like it has some sort of tunnel vision maphacks with constant swarms of enemy units that seemingly are homing missles on ur villagers no matter where they are on the map.  really slows down progress when ur vills constantly getting massacred. The game is slow and lack of end game upgrades makes taking enemy bases a bit tedious, i play on max speed but campaign missions still mostly take over an hour to beat as u usually end up having to slowly advance against towers with enough soldiers to protect siege units and having to stop them going suicide against towers and protect them from cav charges that just reset the whole process if successful. I noticed going all in on navy seems best thing to do almost always as it only costs wood for boat armies and having water supremacy saves you from constant transport raids killing ur vills or boats anniliating all ur eco. But yeah icing on cake that forced my hand on negative review was frustrating campaign mission that was taking over an hour to complete (rise of rome lvl 3) where finally assaulting enemy base and then a random 'you have been defeated' shows up when enemy has no army or eco left. no clue what that was about but sure pissed me off enough to finally admit this game is not worth your time, just get aoe2 and let nostalgia memories of aoe1 keep you afloat instead of playing it and soiling your fond memories.

All amazing times in history. I love starting with club wielding cave men and then busting out chariots and elephants! 

The definitive edition is packed with content and although the game is old it looks great. It's definitely missing a few quality of life enhancements the genre is known for. However, it doesn't hamper your enjoyment one bit. 

Knights and castles are great. If you want to travel back to beginning though, then fire up the original and see how it all started. You just may find yourself putting down your knights for chariots for a little while. Don't forget to upgrade those bowmen and learn the secrets of alchemy.

Things began when I couldn't see a thing due to the tiny UI. And when I changed the scale of the UI the game reset it every time I started the game. I seriously had to manually change the file of the settings to read-only to keep the UI scale.

But the bigger issue are the campaigns. In the campaigns you have a population limit of only 50. Most of the time this is simply way too low. You can't build a strong army while keeping a good economy. You WILL have to cull villagers to make room for an army. Or you destroy your whole navy. And even then it is likely that your troops aren't enough and you have to get more troops to the front before the AI can. Hopefully your economy is still strong enough.

There are also missions where you start with an army, a navy and three villagers. In order to make more villagers you'd have to build a town center and ten houses. But you only have wood for the town center. So you destroy your whole navy to reduce the number of houses needed and start chopping wood with your three villagers...

I also want to mention the very first mission of Babylon. You start with a single priest and wander around trying to find someone to convert. When I found a villager I started to convert him at max. range. But then the game randomly decided that this villager would be enough to kill the priest. Mission failed. 

All these things cause the missions to be unnecessarily lenghty and boring. Truly a missed chance.",1582557190,1583008487,False,4,1,0.487728089094161987,0,True,False,False

Pros:
-High resolution graphics
-Nice update from the original game (animations and visuals in general)
-Combines everything from AoE and AoE RoR into a single game
-For those looking for that old feeling of playing the original game, you will feel it

Cons:
-So many things could have been improved to make this a much much less irritating experience

1) No troop formation: Troops just wander and bump into each other continuously making it almost impossible to control and perform an effective attack or defence. It's hard to control more than 10 units, imagine a whole army. You have to select one by one in order to move them where you wish them to be.

2) Pathfinding sux: Troops and villagers get stuck all the time. If you don't pay attention, you might find out 15 minutes later that that villager you sent to build a watch tower was stuck in the forest all along. Combine this with the absence of troop formation, it becomes impossible and very painful to use strategy in a game that relies mostly on using strategy. 

3) Priests range is 10+ yet for some reason they won't start healing unless the unit is almost completely next to it. Sometimes I have 5 or more units all wounded very close to the priest yet he doesn't do anything. Same thing for some units like War galley that won't start shooting enemy units on sight. No matter what position you choose for them, they see enemy troops next to them such as a villager constructing a building and they just stand there without any reaction. 

Another issue with range is that your war galleys have 8 range and the enemy tower has 6 or 7 (less than you), yet for some reason, go figure, your boats need to get into the tower's range in order to shoot it and at the same time be shot by it? What's the purpose of having increased range if they put themselves withing enemy's towers range?

4) Population caps at 50 in campaign: How are you supposed to beat a very difficult AI that constantly spams attacks at you and rebuilds everything that you destroy, when you have 20 villagers on resources, 10 boats and 20 army units = 50 population. 

5) AI cheats or difficulty setting is bugged: I circled an enemy on an island, no resources left to gather, for 30 minutes continuously killing his villagers and troops with my boats without suffering any damage on my side, yet the AI never stops sending troops my way and never stops rebuilding every building I destroy (Easiest mode).

5)General bugs like a Gazelle running and stopping at mid-air jump  position. 


I know the original game lacked everything I mentioned here, but how hard would it be to make a better pathfinding and options for troop formations like in AoE2?

An extremely well polished and modern looking release of Age of Empires and a guaranteed nostalgia blast from the past.

However! Pains me to say, some of the changes they have made in my opinion have taken from the original feel of the game that I remembered and liked and have left me feeling a little disappointed.

Some of these changes, the new death sound effects and the new soundtrack (don't get me wrong, sound great) but do not work as well as the originals did.
They also tossed out the original intro video and replaced it with a puzzling new one that looks like it was nothing more than a place holder.

This game, the [i] Definitive Edition [/i], is a fully updated re-release of the original game and its expansion.

This game is a historical RTS covering a massive span of human history, roughly from the end of the last Ice Age to the fall of the Roman Empire. It contains multiple sprawling campaigns, each of which should take between 6-12 hours to complete, plus the option to play skirmish games against AI opponents. It also contains online multiplayer and a scenario editor, but I have little experience with either, and so will not discuss them in this review. 

On the positive side, the game looks gorgeous, and the remastered soundtrack is pleasant without becoming grating. The campaigns are fun, and are generally challenging without suffering from the unpredictable and infuriating difficulty spikes that plagued those in the original game. The AI can put up a substantial challenge to the player, and actual strategy is often required to win. Although all factions share the same overall set of technologies, units, and buildings, no faction has access to all of them. This, combined with various faction bonuses (ex. gold miners work 15% faster), ensures that no two factions feel exactly the same.

On the negative side, unit animations are somewhat stiff, and unit pathfinding can often be atrocious, requiring the player to effectively ""babysit"" their units. The AI, while capable, often relies on spamming one or two unit types, forcing the player to spend a large amount of time fighting off whack-a-mole raids.

Overall, [i] Age of Empires: Definitive Edition [/i] is an excellent remake of what I feel to be an unjustly forgotten classic RTS. If you love RTS games, ancient history, or both, pick this one up.",1579035710,1579035710,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Back in the 90's you could make a custom map, versus 1 AI opponent, put all the resources on your side of the map, protect them with laser towers, put impassable walls as dividers, and one narrow path to get to you, And the AI will still run down on your early in the game with units that cost gold!

This game is time killer af. New Music, New features, New models, New Animations are totally lit! And they changed the UI. And all of those icons too. Same campaign but this time they fixed every problems. Like before you have to choose builders what to do after they finished their work, but now they do their own works. And the difficulty level AI is better than ever. New texture quality is damn so good. They customized every single campaign and optimized them. I liked the stone and gold textures and water animation. They changed the UI for everything, now you can see how many people you have on your kingdom and objective showing on top right. Also they fixed villagers stucking bug. They changed the setting as well, they added 4k And I bet they added some new campaign story.  And Fuck ya!

For the first hour in the game. here's my pros and cons

Pros: 
+Great remastered game, a very nostalgic feelings
+UI is nice
+Visuals/Graphics are 9/10, it's an RTS, I don't really expect high/realistic graphics on small units, it will just make your pc lag, unless you have a beasty spec'd PC

Cons:
Difficulty is ridiculously stupid. 
I don't even remember how hard this is, even in [b]Easy[/b] and [b]Normal[/b] mode
I CAN EVEN PLAY WHEN I WAS LIKE 6 YRS OLD IN NORMAL DIFFICULTY
From what I remember from the original games, number of enemies will come per cycle depending on the difficulty
For example:
On easy mode: 1-2 enemies will come often through the gameplay
Normal mode: 2-3
And so on...

The difficulty is not playable for me. I've played tons of RTS like StarCraft / Star Wars Empire of War / C&C and etc, those are the games are playable even you are new or play on a harder campaigns. Heck I can even take on up to Hard AIs only.
Multiplayer is not my thing on AoE series because the upgrades/techs are very complicated, so I am sticking to campaign

In conclusion: Campaign is not friendly user to new players, Easy/Normal Difficulty is probably broken.
I cannot recommend(FOR NOW) to the people who are not very fond to RTS player or just playing RTS campaign/custom campaign because you just want to build and defense your base
But for the people who loves AoE series, it's probably a must buy game for ""collection"" or who have passion for this game's historical theme RTS


Note: I have no idea what Pathfinder is, when I was little, I only give a shit how I enjoy the game and how I manage to build an empire then conquer enemy's lands and islands

UPDATE:
Additional on Cons:
-Since the difficulty is stupid, I notice that the enemy base don't even expand their base regardless on what difficulty that you're in

This is mainly an aesthetic update with some technical changes to the timeless classic age of empires and as such does not improve the pathfinding or any other issue the game had since 20 years and thats probably fine. 
However while most aesthetics of the original have been captured really well, some characteristic visuals have been reduced or cut completely for no apparent reason.
- Far less blood and no more blood on bodies.
- No rotting bodies or skeletons (if wc3 reforge can keep their skeletons and imporve upon them why can¬¥t AOE?)
- If you turn the detail level up you won¬¥t be able to zoom out as much.
- Bodies of water now all have a current, making lakes and rivers weirdly swell and contract.
Others issues:
- Game now allows population settings higher than 50 (up to 250 like aoe2) which the AI Players can¬¥t handle at all.
- The AI and difficulties for MP are borked and have never been fixed.

Path finding is a joke, You will constantly have to babysit every unit or it will wander off.

The game will try to keep the formation of where your units are standing when you select them.

Well in my humble opinion, anyone, who was amazed by the game 20 years ago and has a bit of good faith might enjoy playing this game. This remaster has many improvements while keeping the spirit of original Age of Empires. Let me summarize in points:

Definitive pros:
- graphics is MASSIVELY improved, the game is beautiful. Especially on 4K display, it's one hell of eye candy, almost want to say a piece of art.
- gameplay is improved to a level of AOE2 - you can walk over building foundations and over farms, you have queue on units and techs... so basically farming is not annoying, it's even better than in AOE2 (auto-rebuild button triumphs over reseed queue)
- pathfinding IS improved. Allthough units sometimes get stuck on each other, which happened in the original game also, they find way MUCH better. There has been some hate on this DE version pathfinding, but I must confirm, that it is significantly better than in the original game.

Questionable changes:
- the game has been a bit rebalanced, but main mechanics stay.
- campaings have been recreated, some of them or now a bit different, but they are playable and nice. But yeah, some legendary maps, such as Opening Moves, now works a bit different.
- sounds in the game are changed a lot. While some of the changes are easy to welcome, for example triremes aren't damn noisy and overall the game sound is not as disturbing as it used to be, other changes are a bit sad - some building sounds now are alienated, some of the legendary villager taunts (such as ""homals"" or ""zugata"") are lost. That is something, which takes down the legacy experience, but it is acceptable.

Cons:
- can't think of something, that is screwed.

If I were to rate this game, I would give it something like 8/10, but in moments of amazement over the visuals combined with feelings of the past the overall impression goes definitely higher.

This game gives you most or all of what you're expecting; it's Age of Empires (including Rise of Rome) with proper widescreen support/functionality on new PCs with a few features which were introduced in Age of Empires 2 (and a few new ones). This means you can walk over farms, there's auto farm-queuing, idle military unit button, waypoints, etc. The units/buildings/art is also updated to look more modern/presentable. 
The campaign missions menu (and victory/defeat screens) also now have voiceover and not just text.

The cons are:
1) Some of the drawbacks of the original game are still there - pathfinding for instance.
2) The game plays the ROR music not the original vanilla music, unless you're playing classic mode.
3) There is a classic mode but it has the new icons/buttons not the original ones.
4) The game overall is still somewhat outdated by modern standards - it's mostly still the original Age of Empires.

If you played the original Age of Empires back in the day and simply want an HD remaster, go ahead and buy this when it's on sale like what I did. I spent ten bucks and have received many hours of entertainment from this game. However, if you've never played this game, I'd much rather recommend one of the later Age of Empires titles such as II or III. It's not that this game is terrible; the mechanics just haven't aged very well and it can be a very frustrating gaming experience. 

An example is the AI. The AI is terrrrrrible. Soldiers don't do what they're told or they go way out of the way to perform a simple task. There's no way to program your troops, ships or citizens to perform tasks according to importance; you basically have to micromanage everything or else your empire will collapse. I've had so many cheap deaths due to the crappy AI, and a loss of productivity due to the massively flawed AI. 

Other flaws include the population capacity of 50, along with the inability to destroy your own ships (this is especially true of fishing ships, which take up population and once they're done fishing, they're basically a waste of population.) You would think that they would have fixed many of these issues with this remaster; but it's simply a graphical upgrade, the game itself is still broken from over twenty years ago. 

Like I said, I have had fond memories of playing this game back in the late 90's and early 2000's and quite enjoyed this remake. If you're new to the series, though, I strongly recommend II as a starting point. It fixes many of the flaws of the original game, and a much more enjoyable gaming experience.",1577470102,1577470102,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Then I found out that only W10 will be supported, so that was a no-go for the original price and that I'd rather find my way back to the original game. So I did.
Steam Winter sale got me to change my mind - ‚Ç¨5? Man, let's see the ""product"".

First of all, GRAPHICS is well done at first sight, I love(d) the zoom in/out option at first. Only until I fully zoomed in.
Now, I wouldn't have had a problem with this at all, but this game swallowed 16GB of my disk space - and frankly, my expectations where on a very different level. Better not to offer the zoom-in options when there isn't much to offer.
7/10

Moving on to MUSIC.
Here I am satisfied, mostly. Most of the tracks were remastered in a way that I like them, I can still get the feeling that it's the same music that I spent hours and hours listening to in last 20 years.
On the other hand, some of the tracks should've stayed the same, or with minimal changes.
8/10

Next stop is GAMEPLAY.
I've enjoyed the single player and toughest AI that this game could provide for years, taking into account that in the original game were so many bugs, but I got used to them over the years. Now, I expected, that most of these things got fixed in the remastered version after 20 years. And some have been. Pathfinding is somewhat better, but when your units glitch everytime they move, you get a feeling that something got wrong somewhere, when Microsoft decided to greenlight this re-work and asks me to pay ‚Ç¨20+ for the job.
Oh and the AI - so far, I like the improvements (but there was really a lot of stuff to improve)
7/10

Performance of the game on my rig is not what I'd expect either. Game stutters for a few seconds every now and then (but runs well otherwise). It's not a problem, unless you are trying to micromanage your units in an assault, then it really sucks.
6/10

BUGZ BUGZ & BUGZ
It's not that I haven't got used to these glitches and bugs over years, but man, campaign, Hittites, 1st map. Sea is divided by a narrow strip of land, so you have 2 seas that are not connected at all. My fishing ships from the northern sea want to ram through this strip of land to the south. Why? Because I built a secondary dock on that ""bridge"" - on the southern coast  and this one is CLOSER in a direct line that the dock they can get to. Hilarious. It was impossible to fix a problem like this?? Unbelievable.
Known bugs & problems fixed: 4/10

My conclusion is, that if I haven't bought it on a sale for ‚Ç¨5, I'd be really pissed about this remastered AOE game - which is why I can't recommend this game, at least for the full price.
But I still hope that most of these issues will be fixed (optimization, bugs) before this game gets old. Again.

-Huge maps are not huge at all. 
-Music lacks the magic of ancient times, and sounds like happy utopia. It lacks war or drums feeling. I keep playing with original AOE soundtrack as its better.
-Graphic is pretty nice, comparing to the old one ofc, but ui looks like to be finished fast to catch deadline.
-Worst thing in this game for now i noticed is pathfinding. Units blocks with each other all the time, and its hard to do anything because if any 2 units get close they stand like braindead zombies not willing to move for few seconds, then they move again. Its 2019 and pathfinding for just damn 20-50 units should be something easy to apply to the game.
- Another design that its really annoying is when you make a group of soldiers and try to give them orders. They will keep roaming around stupidly, so you have to click click every second to fix their attempts to suicide. What is even worse is a fact, that when you have a group of units, and want them to move closer to each other you usually click same point on map waiting till they hug in the area to get formation. Here? No way man! Dont even try! When you click move order to a group they will keep being spread but move a little left or right. So if i want my 6 swordsmen to stand one next to each other, i have to manually move every single one. Because no matter how long i will click move order, they wont gather into that point.
Edit:
- After more time playing.. no big change here. I dont remember if that was like this in original AOE, but when like 4 upgraded arrow turrets cannot fast kill one slinger.. something is wrong here. It looks like that for sake of balance they made towers super weak, which can be ridicilus when few cavalery units just ride by your base and ignore turrets. Just check how much turret can deal damage. Unless u upgrade it to balista (which not all civilisation can do) its useless. 
- I never was AOE pro, but i remember that original game gave me fun. Here im constantly losing games on lowest difficulty setting. Its a bit annoying. Thats the reason of difficult settings to let weak players interesting game and same for pros. Even if i finally win something, it doesnt really give any fun.. its just spamming units until somehow u have more than them. 
-AI is hard some way, but its terrible stupid in another.. for example. You can do Zig Zag wall labirynth as only way to your base, many turrets beside like 10-20 and enemy units will follow this damn zig zag getting hits from turrets, wasting resouces instead doing a proper siege with catapults.

Quality of life improvements include a villager bar to tell you how many you've assigned to each resource. Idle villager count. Farms can be toggled to reseed themselves much like Age of Kings.

I later filled out a survey regarding the future of the series and gave them my opinion on this subject with AOE DE and future AOE games and how they shouldn't be exclusive to their store. I was happy to find out that they had listened to myself and the community and put the game on Steam. However as much as I enjoyed the nostalgia of the taunts, sound effects, music and aesthetic of the game, I found it was wildly unpolished and its AI unplayable. There are several quality of life issues that needed addressed in the original game that should've been fixed when bringing it to 21st century. These include but aren't limited to idle villager buttons, better pathing for units, updated AI and LAN ffs. I highlight these because they were the most noticeable within my first two hours playing against Computers with a friend who also bought the game. As far as a competitive online experience, I could never see myself playing with its current pathing. Sending literally 5 ships down a 5 tile wide river feels like watching one of those old Rush Hour games (game where you have to move a red car to a gap by moving the vehicles around it (Look it up.)) The pathing can turn battles around and makes it near impossible to care about microing units unless its one by one. A lack of an idle villager button hurts because you cant see outlines of units through buildings and they can be idle the whole game if you forget about them. The AI are HORRENDOUSLY easy. I played AOE 2/3 in my childhood and was an 1850~ nonVoobly player recently. I could've been brand new to the game and beaten a Hardest AI 1v1. I played 2v2 with my friend thinking it would be a challenge seeing how the newer AI's in the AOE 2 games have come so far. After stomping the 2v2, we decided to 2v6 which was another waste of time. We decided that the only way to challenge ourselves was to go AFK for 10 minutes at the beginning and play on the most open map. We actually managed to lose that game. The AI all came and singled out one of us with higher tier units and completely walked around the other. If we tried again we would come up with a better strategy and most likely beat them. If the AI are so easy and poorly done that the only way of making it a challenge is to AFK for most of the game, they aren't fun to play with. Until they modernize the game or actually put some money into it, I probably won't play it again.

-----

I love Age of Empires. It was the first PC game I really sank my teeth into back in the day, and the whole franchise is near and dear to me. Just so you understand my bias.

Definitive Edition makes for a nice graphical upgrade, running at modern resolutions and with nice textures, performing flawlessly for me.

But the game is still as clunky as it was in 1997, and the AI ""upgrades"" are just terrible in their execution. 

Regarding the clunk, unit collision and pathing is really bad. Your units will get stuck and require fiddling with - like a lot.

Regarding the AI, playing the campaigns - some of the missions the AI just sends a trickle of it's villagers straight into your base without gathering it's own resources, thereby crippling itself. On other missions the AI consistently sneaks cavalry around your flanks to kill all your gold miners. It seems totally random as to whether the AI is going to work well or completely shit the bed.

AI units are also inexplicably elite projectile dodgers which just feels really ""off"" when taken with the rest of the AI's issues and quirks.

Overall I still really enjoyed playing the definitive edition's campaign content and it was great to revisit an old classic, but the promised gameplay improvements are not here and if anything they've probably changed AI for the worse.",1576920739,1576920739,True,34,4,0.722958564758300781,0,True,False,False

Don't buy this until they fix the client, FPS issues and prevent the split community due to two different versions still available.

[h1] Long story [/h1] 

[b]Introduction[/b]
Played Closed Beta and actively contributed in bug hunting, testing and other required activities. Why? Because Definitive Edition looks really good. Love the graphics, love the remaster.

Post Closed Beta, things looked bad. Silence from the developers. No updates, except for critical ones. For a moment, after critical fixes, the game was playable. But then the Steam announcement and Crossplay came. We were happy. A lot of people were truly happy. Finally the stupid exclusive Windows Store only would go away and hopefully draw more players to the game by allowing Steam and Microsoft Store crossplay. It was very positive.

[b]Horror of two clients[/b]
But then the client was released on Steam and Windows. People couldn't update their existing version. Those who did update ran into terrible bugs. Not only that, but the client was completely changed. The UI of the menus was ugly, big. As if playing 640x480 resolution again. 

Worst of them all, there is a split community now. Majority still plays the old client version 27374 and the others play client version 28529. Why there are two clients, nobody knows. But we know that 27374 is more stable, has better UI and more clear browsing. But ELO is messed up and contains bugs, such as no coop mode. The new client, 28529 suffers from FPS issues when doing large wars.

[b]No active development[/b]
There is probably no budget any more for this game. Time is up. And that is how business goes in development. No money == no time. Because of AoE2DE and AoE3DE or any other project have focus now.

Also somewhere on Reddit there was a post from someone on the team, that said that some developers have messed up the project and that saving it was near possible. 

Basically, your typical case of cash grab from Microsoft or any other publisher. Yet I still bought it, because my love for the game has been since 1996. 

Do I hope for a fix/update? Yes, at least if minimum: The split community being united.

Will there be an update for this game? No, I don't think so. Knowing how this business works: No money == no time == no development. Simple as that.

[b]List of messed up[/b]
- No active development any more. Probably no budget allowance for dev
- ELO, they messed up the implementation. 
- Game lobby browsing they messed up. You cannot see Random Map or Death Match difference. It is all reported as 'Custom'. Only ranked games show the game mode. The old client had better overview
- Crashes randomly
- Player positions in team games are bad. Some players are isolated or surrounded
- Map generation is poor and resources spawn in terrible locations or inaccessible places.

20 years of anniversary has been flushed down the drain. Even AoE2DE has been rushed and buggy as hell. AoE2HD was a success, because it had active development. The DE versions get the short end of the stick.",1575574015,1575574015,False,1,0,0.520958065986633301,0,True,False,False

Yes the AI sucks.
Yes some of the buildings with techs don't make sense.
Yes pathfinding is a nightmare.
Yes there is no unit management.'
Yes, the computer players still control EVERY UNIT AT EVERY GIVEN MOMENT.
However, its a 20 year old game, and it plays exactly how I remember it. Even the same cheats work! (Best cheat units of the series right here.)

So lets get on to what I think is good about this remaster.

Quality of Life Improvements: It adopts some of the nicer things found in AOE2, like AUTOMATIC FARM RESEEDING. You can also stack technologies in a single building to research, instead of micromanging them one at a time. It also shows progression squares on the upper left of the screen for each tech and unit. You can add 20 units to the queue at a time, instead of 15. A 250 unit population limit, however that is hard to reach because the game was designed with 50 in mind so making excessive armies just seems senseless. The UI is overhauled nicely, and is clean, intuitive, and helpful. Tooltips are where they should be, and not where you don't want them. And there is an idle villager/fishing boat button.

Graphics: At 18+gb, you'd hope that they improved on the graphics. And yes, they're certainly improved. If you don't think so, play the original or even look at screenshots. Animations are much smoother, and higher in detail. However they kept true to the unit and building design across all civilizations. There are small details you notice right away coming from the original game, such as piles of wood where a woodcutter is working, light sheen on the water, and more.

Music: The soundtrack is nicely overhauled, while keeping true to the OST. If you played the original as long as I have, you'll quickly pick up on the tunes representing the songs in the OST. Some could've been improved better, such as ""Battle"" however, while in the game, it doesn't sound repetitive like it does when you listen to the OST loop for a full 3+ hour game. I do think they randomize.

All in all, if you understand that this is a 20 year old game, and just enjoy it like I do, despite the AI quirks and whatnot, you'll have a fun experience with it. If you want something a bit more refined, grab AOE2 (2013) and add texture mods. I also recommend playing Empire Earth 2, with Mona Lisa's EE2 Overhaul patch (Currently called Unofficial Patch 1.5) for a nice nostalgic RTS kick.",1575404821,1575404975,True,1,0,0.515151500701904297,1,True,False,False

Could have introduced the same mechanics from AoE II for AI when it comes to alliances/enemies.
In the original version you could get around that by making everyone on their own teams with locked teams setting on.

Even the pathfinding from the original game is kept the same, which may be annoying to a lot of people but to me, it was totally acceptable because it felt like i'm playing THAT game. The only difference was the graphics of course, and I think it was done very well; game felt so modern and looked gorgeous.
So the reason i refunded was because I was hoping I could have fun with the online multiplayer, but it was a letdown because after trying to find an online game without any region filter, all I could find was 2 half-filled rooms in SE-Asia. It just seemed like no one was playing this game anymore even though it was newly released this month, or I might have done it wrong there idk.

I came from the AoE2 DE remaster and thought to give this classic a shot because thats the one that got me started.
But compared to the AoE2 DE remaster, this remaster looks worse, plays worse, feels worse.
The looks is weird. Im used to rather pixelated figurines fighting and working, buildings nice pixelated buildings and harvesting pixelated resources.
In the AoE2 DE this style is still there while looking higher resoluted, in AoE1 DE it feels weird and too 3D.
I recommend looking at the screenshots on the store page and focus o nthe units and buildings in correlation with the environment, then moving to AoE2 DE and doing the same.
AoE1 just looks out of place. Its hard to describe, but when i started the game the first time and accidentially set the view distance closer, it looked like a different game than i remember, simply because units seem to be rather weird 3D models.

Dont get me wrong, the old version also looks attrocious, but this is not the style i expected to catch the spirit of the old game.
The remaster of AoE2 kind of set an expectation to find a game with a similar visual style AND the convenient features.
Some of these features are still in, yet the gameplay, the UI, the way some things are handled, felt off and not in line with the other remaster.
That might have a simple reason. Because i played AoE1 more when i grew up and ignored AoE2 mostly, i didnt realize how advanced AoE2 was. I never had an actual comparison between the two, never sat down and played both.
AoE1 cant stand up against AoE2 and in fact its so bad i had to refund it. I just would not play it.
Sadly.
So i cant give this DE, Remaster, however you call it a recommendation and rather point to the outstanding AoE2 DE. Which plays better, looks incredible and catches the spirit of these games much better.

Having said that, this being both 22 year old game and first entry in the franchise, it falls behind it's successors in having old game mechanics that were expanded in other Age of Empires games later.

The hit of nostalgia , finally we can play the game that started off the series.The definitive edition makes some good changes but its still really only slightly better than the aoe gold edition jewel case cd that still is being sold on places all over the world , 
There are a lot of hits and misses but given that the original release had some glaring flaws that are fixed here it's rough game that's playable hopefully more patches bring up the game to clean state. Given the history of the game and its legacy its easily worth picking up in any sale.
Pros:
1) All content included just the same as the gold edition
2) Voices added to the campaigns descriptions
3) good quality improvements in game such as auto farm seeding, idle villager indicator ,  numbers that show how many villagers are allocated to what task, smart ai.
4) A bonus for achievement hunters most of the achievements are focused on single player so as to not force others to the horrible laggy multiplayer part.
PS: Ask nicely on the aoe de discussion forums if someone can help you out with the one mp achievement
Cons:
1) The game is slow feels sluggish poorly optimized.
2) Given the original game was such a small size it could have been included in the package as a standalone
3) The promised switch to retro graphics as a option is very limited
4) The UHD ui/visuals is not that appealing the the original retro ui was clean and still stands out better.

In almost all skirmish games vs the AI, it will resign sooner than expected, not letting you ""taste the victory"" - sometimes not even letting you taste a fight. 
In 4 out of about 10 matches it happened to me that the AI resigned all of a sudden, when no attack was ongoing at its base. Some other times, it resigned after merely killing a few of its units.

My feeling is that the AI checks how much its score is surpassed by the enemy team, and resignes if it is many times larger.
I play vs AI 99% of my games, so I consider this problem pretty bad, and it severely decreases my ability to enjoy a game that would otherwise be a decent remaster.
I will edit my review in case improvements are made.

EDIT: A half workaround seems to be to play on Conquest victory mode, because then the AI is being forced to stay in-game until you raze it entirely. However, this sucks if you desperately want to play and win with Artifacts or Ruins, or Wonders.
EDIT 2: The game also has missing features compared to the 2nd game, this is not really something I should expect, but something that makes the game much less enjoyable than AoE II. Formations are non existent, military units move around with no order whatsoever (speed isn't even reduced to the slowest unit for mixed armies)... Units also have a large ""box"" and easily get stuck in passages.
Lack of gates is also something I don't like. I understand maintaining an original gameplay and all, but I just don't like it.

Overall my opinion on the game is 60% nope and 40% yes, so if I could I'd rate it so-so, rather than making a negative review, but I cannot.

EDIT as of 30.11.19
I made some more matches in the last months.
Conquest as the sole victory option is not a fix. The enemy surrenders incredibly fast, presumably as soon as his economy is almost bankrupt and cannot produce units (this is a speculation though). This means that you spend time preparing your production, tech all up, recruit good armies, launch an attack... only to see the AI surrender after a brief battle.

pros
- looks nice
- QOL features (eg. autofarms)
- campaigns seem fairly nice so far (currently only Voices of Babylon 1 was bit annoying due enemy unit spamming)

cons
- enemy ai has good microing + often knows where you are despite no los
- ai might need bit rework for random map games (from what I've read)
- your own unit pathfinding is really bad ; dishonorable mention to catapults which are outright more dangerous to you than opponents

[h1]The game functions more or less the same as the original, but with some updated stuff, such as:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Gather points
[*]Traversable farms
[*]Slightly more aggressive AI
[*]Slightly better pathfinding
[*]More intuitive UI
[*]Rebalnces to techs, civs and units.
[*]A few more quality of life things.
[/list]

I would suggest if you expect the game to be more or less the same as the 1997 release, then give the game a go. This game is by no means better than AoE 2, and won't be, even if they completely overhauled everything. 2 is more advanced, and is overall just a more complete RTS experience.

If you have any expectations that this game will be any better than the 1997 release, then this most likely won't be a game for you, since it can be pretty hard on unskilled RTS players, it's still the same game from 1997 with a lot of updated things. It still has some of the same bugs the original had and a few new ones even.

Overall, I like the game, despite that I grew up with AoE 2 when I was younger, I can still appreciate what the original did, and still enjoy it from time to time.

[h1]I'd say get this, if you:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Loved the original, despite its flaws.
[*]Don't have any high expectations for the game to be anything more than an average RTS game.
[/list]

[h1]However, do not get the game if you:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Expect this to hold a candle to modern RTS or even AoE 2.
[*]Have bad patience.
[*]Can't handle moderately hard games.
[*]Have any high expectations for the game.
[*]Expect this to have updates to mimick AoE 2.
[*]Can't handle lowered frames when zooming.
[*]Have only multiplayer in mind.

I know it sounds like the game is bad when I say all this, but I do like the game, and the original 1997 release with the Upatch, I just think the reviews speak for themselves.

The reason I say that is because since this is a newer version of AoE, there aren't very many mods for the game compared to the original. The online for the game operates off of the ELO ranking system which I do like. (ELO is the same system used by Halo 3 back in the day and I find it superior the the ranking systems used by Starcraft, Halo 5, and R6 Siege since it gives you a more accurate reading of where you stand in the rankings.) My biggest gripe with the game is the campaign narrator. The narrator is absolutely obnoxious. Talks like he is speaking to a bunch a 5 year olds. It's so bad I don't even pay attention to the campaign descriptors which gives you info on the mission, background history of the event, and hints on how to complete the mission. If they added a way to mute or disable the campaign narrator, then I'd be grateful. Another small nitpick I have is the building destruction animations are too smooth. It's like the building just kind of melts on itself. Nothing collides, it all just kind of slides on itself. It's hard to describe, but it is noticeable when you watch the animations.

But if you read them, most of them reveal wrong expectations not faults of the game itself. The Game is called: ""Age of Empires - Definitive Edition"". It is not called: ""Entirely new game that includes completly new game mechanics but is losely based on Age of Emires"".
Now, it's obvious: If you buy a game called Age of Empires, you'll get Age of Empires. Stupid to believe anything else. We know that Age of Empires had flaws like weak path finding, no formations and things like that and although pathfinding was improved, it's still weak and you won't get formations, gates for your walls or anything like that.
There are some new features like auto-replacing farms (without having to pay them in advance like in AoE2) which I think is a huge bonus. As a downer, at least for me, you can walk over them now like in AoE2. So no more farming fortresses...
Of course there are some points that can justify a negative review. Like I experienced some crashes or frozen screens. And the hardcore fans of AoE might realise very quick that some of the campaign maps have changed. Simple example: The tutorial map where you have to convert the siege weapon, where they changed the weapon from a Heliopolis to a catapult and it's position from the bottom right of the map to the bottom left. That might be a downer for Hardcore fans that I could fully understand as a reason to give a negative review.
On the other hand, the grafic look quite nice, the orchestral music is done very good, although I think they played the main theme a little too slow for my liking and they added voice acting to the campaign briefings. Overall, I'm quite willing to give a positive review but add that you might want to wait for a discount as the game mechanics itself are, well, 22 years old and you feel that.

You must play it on your own screen with your own resolution, and in doing so you will see just how beautiful Age of Empires is. I am truly in awe at the beauty given to the game without destroying what made AoE the first AoE in the first place. Not to mention the higher resolution and updated graphics enable you to see your troops' armour and weapons, so you really feel like you're commanding a force to be reckoned with. I really like the animations as well. Very WarCraft 3-esque,

However, graphical update or not, AoE 1 is still AoE 1. Troops travelling independently of other troops is all well and good when they all wield guns - Command and Conquer is a prime example - but when your soldiers have swords it can be very annoying not having formation options to keep them together to ensure they engage the enemy at the same time. Because of inevitable separation of troops, the soldier who reaches the enemy first is likely to die before he can be backed up, and the same can be said for the second, and the third, etc. It can be a headache working on keeping your army as closely knit as possible in order to maximise survivability, whereas AoE 2, we all know, introduced formations and always kept the troops who moved together close together. This is also quite a difficult game. My adult experiences in AoE 2 have seen me increase in performance from my childhood, but at this game I am just as terrible as always. It's a game requiring absolute focus and a swift mouse hand. Note, there are some, as they say, 'quality of life' inclusions; auto-seeding farms, villager chain-building, etc. This does improve upon the original release.

I do recommend it for those who played it as youngsters, and perhaps some of the modern generation would enjoy it. However, there is a reason AoE 2 is named the timeless, ageless, perfect RTS, and not AoE 1. If you're looking to get into an AoE game, it is perhaps best to buy AoE 2 in three days. I certainly will be getting it myself, as an AoE lover since a single digit age. If they've done for AoE 2 what they did here for AoE 1, I can firmly guarantee...

It's going to make history.

The biggest concern I have found is the horrendous path finding. Villagers and military units often get stuck or just stop what they're doing making it very challenging to navigate large groups of military/villagers. This is especially evident when there is a tight space or many enemies/terrain on either side. An example of this can be seen in the campaign Crossing the Alps. Additionally, the lack of military formations is a feature they should have included in this game. You'll find yourself having to micromanage your units far too often that what I would like. The calvary will always move in first, when you might want to send elephants or infantry before. Regardless, I recommend the game! I only pointed out some of the glaring concerns. I still have a great time playing.

Age of Empires 1 is only worth the time for its nostalgia value, it was the first RTS I ever played and I have fond memories, but the balance and gameplay is just not up to the standards of its sequels. Each civ plays very similarly with only minor bonuses to distinguish them, no unique units or techs, no real differences in strategy, it mostly boils down to cosmetic variations. And what strategy is here is also lacking, theres a limit on strong counter units and trash units, defences are generally poor as the lack of gates   mean leaving your walls open so you can get your own units out, the saving grace here is that the pathfinding is terrible so units will often struggle to get at you anyway, that of course goes the other way too though and often you'll find your units getting killed as half of them have gotten lost trying to walk around a small rock, they also retain their relative positions so you have to manually group them up after they get separated by the bad pathfinding and thats not to mention that units with different move speeds will seperate out while walking, leaving the likes of priests and siege units vulnerable.  Its a shame that this couldn't be adressed or the various formation functions from AoE2 couldn't of been added to this new edition after all if you're remaking a game why not add in some useful functions that have since proved themselves in other games in the series.

Then of course there the multiplayer, there are games available but not many so it may be difficult to get a game in your region, what you do get will be of variable quality none of the matches I played were ranked so I could often get games where I crushed my opponent only to be crushed in the very next game. On top of that the lack of early game defences (like town center garrisoning in AoE2) means theres alot of early game rushes to deal with. In several team games one player would do a VILLAGER rush knock out another player and then the entire team would fold. The other issue due to the low numbers of other players is teams on discord, in several games I played 2v2v2 team matches only to find that one member of each team was in fact   from a group of friends on discord who all turned on their ally to secure an easy victory (Teams weren't locked), it can happen in other games but like I mention the low numbers in multiplayer make this much worse.

Everything is very good. The picture quality has been upgraded, and the background music is better. It's worth a lot to the old players. In addition to the sound effect of the unit, I feel that the original unit sound effect is better.

i finally jumped on and got to have a go for myself, and i enjoyed every game i played. its such a refreshing experience after spending hundreds of hours in Age 2 HD to find myself in a new but old world, with new but old units, it was just an amazingly fun time, they did a great job of capturing the original essence, but with updated graphics and new lovable features. this game will always go down as one of the best games of all time in my opinion, but still doesn't rival Age Of Empires II. 

PROS:
Remastered Music
Fresher Game-play
Classic Mode
4K Graphics
Beautiful Water
Better Path-finding

CONS:
The Menu's seem a bit basic.
The AI is alot harder than expected at first
Not enough settings.
Zooming in can make the game look terrible,

Two decades later the game has been remade with updated graphics, but not really updated gameplay.

I want developers who remake old games to stop thinking the original is infallible and unable to be improved. There's a reason people moved on from Age of Empires to Age of Empires II when it came out. The game was much better. There's a mode in the game to have it be played with the original style graphics and gameplay, but the new mode doesn't seem to fare much better.

While there is some gameplay improvements that help bring the game into more modern RTS's, it should have been improved significantly in terms of gameplay (more in line with AoE 2 or AoE 3) and you can play the ""Classic"" mode which emulates the original game. I think the current state the game is in would be a great ""Classic"" version of the game, with its slower pace and bad AI. The updated mode should fix all of these issues and make it a stronger RTS that works more in line with current RTS's.

The original campaigns could be updated so they're not capped at 50 population. It's just a shame that the devs, who remade the original AoE II so beautifully, couldn't improve the gameplay at all.

I think most of that stuff is in the SLP folder which contains unit animations.

There are some small changes as well - i.e. farm maintenance is a hell of a lot easier and the UI is different and a little better.

Can't say it's because this is the soundtrack of my childhood or it actually sounds better, but I do prefer the original MIDI version. Wish there'd be an option to toggle between those two music options.

Apart from that, it's exactly the same game.
I mean, I wanted to see if a cheat code i used to use still works and the black rocket launcher car is 100% the old version. Old texture and all. This is the original code base with some extra stuff. Not terribly thrilled about all the new stuff, but I do like the fact that I this game has been future-proofed to a certain extent.

I was expecting more though. For some reason, I thought this was a faithful 3D remake and redesign from scratch. Was disappointed I could not rotate the camera at will and see the back side of buildings, etc... but it is 101% AoE and I love AoE... so I guess it could have been worse.

Lastly, since this is obviously nostalgia bait, and for what it's worth, I don't feel like I've wasted my money buying this, It'd be better at that nostalgia thing with the aforementioned option to enable the MIDI music and possibly the original ingame sounds as well.

Another thing that is great is the AI. Do not listen to those who complain about the AI, probably they lose on easy vs 1 CPU. Finally the enemy units wont get stuck on the first tower that they meet on the way as on AOE from 1997, they will try to assault your center of the city. Walls wont help too much because there are no gates and that means that towers are not as efficient anymore, enemy units will just pass by and you cant hide your villagers in the Town Center (as on AOE 2) and that means that you have to start building units before you get to Iron Age.That means that a cheesy tactics wont work as before and the overall tactics of the game has more depth. The AI is not perfect, though, if you find it's weak spot you can exploit it. I dont know if i should call that tactics or exploit? :D

Playing the campaign with this AI makes the game feel really fresh. Try playing the mission ""Crossing the Alps"" on hardest. It is what it was suppose to be since 1997. Enemies everywhere, from all sides, crushed by gigantic elephants. Very cool.

I have not tested multiplayer yet. I have joined the lobby just to check it out. I found 6 games about to start in Europe and 1 in USA. It seams that you can start a game in minutes.

What i dont like is the pathfinding, i dont know why but they have altered the ""size"" of the units in a strange way. For example, a villager occupy more space than on the origina. That will make it get stuck on trees and building. Another annoying thing is the performance, sometimes the frames drop so low that i can barely play. But the most annoying thing are the explosions. The boats and the ballistas shoot some big arrows but when they hit the target they transform into stones instead of a explosions. I think they have mixed some sprites by mistake? It is really annoying to see this glitch, especially when the graphics is so polished, almost perfect.

Overall, the remake is high quality, improves the original game from all the points of view. A lot better than the other ""remakes"", AOM: Extended Edition and AOE2 - HD. Has some bugs (i got a boat stuck in a building) but it is not as tragic as some other people say. Not at all.

It's AoE 1 as you know it, with some _really_ nice QoL improvements, graphical enhancements, and a gorgeous re-recorded soundtrack.

Both the graphical updates and the soundtrack recording maintain the original feeling and character of AoE 1, but bring up the fidelity significantly. Animations are much smoother, textures are higher resolution, the live soundtrack sounds beautiful, but it still distinctly feels like AoE 1. For me, this is up there alongside Grim Fandango with best remastered soundtracks.

Quality of life improvements include idle villager selection, idle military selection, auto-farm reseeding, farms you can walk over, attack move, rally points, unit queuing (over multiple buildings too), jump to event with hotkey, and grid layout for hotkeys.

You can also increase the population cap over 50! Big battles are finally possible.

All of these seem like baseline staples of modern RTS', but they were completely missing from the original game! One of the biggest complements I can give is that most of these QoL improvements go unnoticed, because they feel natural and in line with modern RTS' while not  detracting from the original game. They're just what you'd expect if playing this game for the first time in 2019.

One exception: For veteran players, this means you can no longer use farms as defensive walls (which makes a lot of sense, but) might alter strategies a bit compared to the original game.

Cons:

It's AoE 1 as you know it, with many of the shortcomings that come with an old RTS. Pathing is still broken to the point where it's actually exploitable as a gameplay strategy. It's also still possible to spawn at the start of the game with an unfair food/resources advantage/disadvantage based on RNG map generation. The game is also generally a lot slower and more relaxed than modern RTS', however this isn't necessarily a bad thing.

Multiplayer is generally very stable over LAN, but will occasionally micro-stutter.

I've noticed many other reviews hating on the game for crashing lots. I haven't had a single crash yet, although I don't run AV outside Windows Defender. Perhaps they have patched the game, as of September 2019, the game feels very stable.

Overall:

If you liked AoE 1, you'll probably love this edition of the game. The best thing about Definitive Edition is it makes AoE 1 truly enjoyable again by modern standards. However in saying that, if you've never played AoE 1, you may *still* find this feels outdated.

Small things, like roman Scutum leaning against the wall of the barracks, make all the models pop. Some certain oddities of the original still remain, however, such as the tiered hills. As well, cheat units didn't receive the same facelift as the others, so don't expect an HD version of the Zug 209. The music was also updated to use actual instruments instead of being digital, to mixed result. Some songs sound amazing, but some end up feeling wrong, or more in place in AoE3. Fortunately, when playing a custom game, you can choose to use the classic graphics, which also uses the classic sound effects. The music however, remains in the updated version. Finally, there are no cinematics,and the opening cinematic has been replaced by something incredibly uninspired that just serves as a reminder that Ensemble wasn't involved. Overall though, it was still an enjoyable experience for a veteran player to go back and revisit where it all began. If you're new and haven't experienced the Age series yet, I'd just wait for the Age 2 definitive edition in November",1567875479,1567875479,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Despite the fancy name, this is for the most part an aesthetic overhaul, albeit one of substantial girth. The Definitive Edition comprises all the original Age of Empires content plus the Rise of Rome expansion, and also features the short Hittite campaign that served as part of the original game's demo. The Definitive edition also includes support for local and online multiplayer, and comes with a new list of achievements for players to unlock.

Meanwhile, the graphical side of the update aims to bring the game up to a 4K standard while maintaining the timeless, picturesque style of the original Genie engine. All the models for buildings and units have been entirely redrawn, while the game takes advantage of modern effects for rendering water, reflections, and shadows.

For the most part, I think the remaster looks splendid. I especially like the new destruction animations for buildings, which now visibly collapse into a smoking heap of rubble, rather than simply replacing the building model with a brownfield sprite. I'm less convinced about the new zoom function. Although having more of the map onscreen and lets you better show off large armies, up close the new textures look smudgy and blurred.

The Definitive Edition isn't purely a visual makeover. New audio has been recorded for the game's music and sound effects. The former is superb, its rousing orchestral swells bringing a fitting depth and grandeur to the game, pairing up nicely with the bolder visuals.

Beyond the changes to visuals and audio, the game is pretty much identical to before. It's business as usual, which also means that some of the first game's shortcomings, such as the rather shoddy AI pathfinding and the heavy focus on what today is extremely rudimentary combat, remain intact. I understand that Forgotten Empires wished to stay as true to the original game as possible, but that also means it remains a flawed game, and those flaws haven't improved over time.

Such pondering assumes there will be new players interested in visiting a 20-year-old, highly orthodox RTS, and this, really, is the sticking point. You see, I love Age of Empires. I probably love it more than Alexander the Great loved his actual Empire. And for a few hours, playing the definitive edition provided me with some lovely, soothing waves of nostalgia. Exploring those early maps, watching my settlements slowly spread and advance, imagining names for my villagers like ""Rogan Josh"", all of it amounted to a pretty good time. 

I don't care if you buy the game or not, but I know I will, for rest of me life; every time there is a new Age of Empires game, I will buy it. I originally bought the game on MS Store (sure you can laugh), then I bought it here again to show game's developers that die-hard fans of this franchise still exist, and are not going anywhere anytime soon.",1567871522,1567871522,True,1,0,0.459363967180252075,0,True,False,False

They gave you the option of a higher population limit than the original, and you can queue up techs and units. This is the only improvement. The graphics aren't as improved as you'd like, as the text is SO SMALL, you can't read anything on screen. The pathfinding has not improved. Your army and your villagers still have no idea on how to reach a destination and panic at the slightest problem. Your army could get strung out reaching a destination, and as soon as the first unit makes the trip, the rest of the selected units stop. 

You're paying $20 for a facelift and tech/unit queue. If you know what everything says already, the text size isn't a big deal. It is not worth the price in my opinion.

If you played Age 2 a lot, like myself, you will miss some features here, like gates, castles, buying ressources, trade or garrisoning units inside a tc/castle/tower. At least I would have want gates, formations and full market, but I understand that the devs didn't want to change the core game. 

What is good
-the core game is still great, though not as good as Age 2
-A lot of comfort features which weren't in the original
-great graphics
-great sound in general
-only one crash in about 60 hours
-campaigns are now voiced, at least the mission briefing and after you win or loose a scenario

What is neutral
-fps is limited to 60 and if you move around the map with your mouse you loose some fps. The reason I think this isn't that bad is this is a RTS. It's still well playable at lower fps.

What is bad
-no formations
-you can't buy/sell ressources like in Age 2 (Well, I guess you can sell ressources for gold, but in Age 1 this is like trade in Age 2 but really not effective and you need an enemy/friendly dock to do)
-pathfinding is bad
-units bump into each other and get blocked, especially vills
-sometimes a ship spawns from a dock and is stuck inside it. You either have to deleat the dock to free it or deleat the ship
-in normal games you can increase max population quite a lot, BUT in campagins the max is still 50. This sucks, because usually that's just not enough to have a good eco and a good military. Either you have a good eco but then only about 10-20 military or the other way. What I usually did to solve this problem is, first I get a good eco rolling with just a bit military to defend, and after some time if I have stocked up a lot of ressources I deleat vills to get pop space for miltiary. But really, this sucks.
-not beeing able to garrison units is a huge problem, also that your tc doesn't fire arrows. Because these two things mean, you are extremly vulnerable the first 2 ages. If you are beeing attacked by let's say axeman which are quite strong in the early game, you have almost no way to protect your vills, because you can't garrison them in your tc and tc can't fire. You basically have to rely on walls and towers. Another problem connected to this, if you play vs the AI and you are beeing attacked, the enemy units usually ignore your army and go straight into your eco and kill vills. This is so annoying, also in Age 1 there is no loom, so vills die extremly fast. And because there are no gates you have to completly wall of your base and if you want to get in your base with units or leave it you have to deleat some part of the wall, get your units through and then rebuild it. 
-german synchro is bad, at least some of the texts, the voiced lines are good
-the difficulty balance in the campaigns is rather bad. I played all the campaigns on medium difficulty. Some scenarios were pretty easy and some really hard, where I had to restart multiple times because the AI just overwhelmed me
-in my opinion the user interface is too small. Luckily you can increase the size of it in the options menu, but for some reason it gets saved for the current session, but if you restart the game it didn't save it.

So overall I am sounding really negative here and I can understand why some people are rating this game negative, but I still had a lof of fun with it, it's still Age of Empires. I love the series.",1567519142,1567549956,True,52,3,0.805217921733856201,0,True,False,False

I would tentatively recommend this game based on what your expectation for this game is. 

If you want to re-live the childhood memory where you sit besides your dad and watch the cavemen on screen slowly evolve into genocidal maniacs then by all means please grab it.  The game remains largely the same, but modernized slightly with some much needed QoL changes (such as idle vilies button, walkable farms and auto re-seeding), graphical improvement (not a complete overhaul, more like hi-res textures with high fidelity) and minor balance tweaks. The feeling of the game is preserved perfectly and you could instantly recognize almost everything in game if you have played the original. Also, some ""authentic"" annoyances got carried over (the most glaring problems being unit pathing and weird hit boxes). The soundtrack also got remastered with live orchestra, which is pretty neat.

However, if what you want is a total reboot of AoE 1 with modern game design philosophies then you might want to wait for sale or give it a pass. Peeling away the nostalgia, the game really does feel like it's more than 20 years old. It feels clumsy in terms of design yet sparse when comes to features. After all the underlying engine stays the same as it was 20 years ago. Playing this game makes me appreciate AoE2 (and 3 to some degree) more, seeing how much more enjoyable they actually are compared to AoE1.

The voice acting is just marvelous, both campaign narrations and unit grunts. Normally I wouldn't mention that, but it is too smooth and professional to be overlooked.

The music is also really well done. I had heard that it was an excellent remake of the original, primitive midi soundtrack...and that turned out to be right. The soundtrack is very fitting and stays enjoyable throughout the game.

There is a few stutter issues though. When you first start a new game, the game stutters before it starts playing smooth again. There is random FPS drops across the game. The priest sprite is also stuttering in some positions (like moving straight upwards).

Now it does need some effort in terms of pathfinding as well, but I can't complain because pathfinding in the original 20 year old game was horrible and this one is much better and playable at least.

They also need to remake the original intro and other cutscenes in my opinion. The game doesn't feel same without their old charm.

The only major downer for me is the lack of an Indian civlization. Despite being the richest ever imperial civilization in human history until industrial era (and extremely powerful in AoE1 era, at one point the largest in the form of Mauryan Empire), the original MS devs left out India for some reason. So did the Definitive Edition sadly. I would love to see an India civ in the game, either a unified one like in AoE2 or broken into two distinctive cultures - Arya and Dravida.

You might ask why is the development and time taking so long to re-make this game. It is because they are using the ORIGINAL engine which is completely ancient for today's standard. And why did they do this? Because they wanted to keep the same feel and style of the game. Much like many games of that era, 3D models were not used, the beautiful 2D drawn assets were used to make this beautiful game. 

I'm a huge fan of Age of Empires and grew up playing it until my Adult hood. 

Forgotten Empires has done a incredible job of remaking the game and the music is amazing. Yes it will take time for the game to get better but they are doing their best with the engine they have. 

Bottom line, do you love the ancient era?

Do you love RTS games?

Did you play this gem when you were younger?

Then do yourself a favor and buy the game. There's so much content in the campaign (45h) along with a custom game option and lets not forget CAMPAIGN design and LEVEL design which most people never talk about. Its included in the game and it will give tons of hours of game play.

On one hand, this is a great graphics improvement with finally arrived zooming ability, gives you remastered OST based on the original, 22-year-old songs, addresses lots of bugs from the original AoE and makes the entire gameplay easier to handle with improvements like more technology research in a row and automatic farm reseeding, which were truthfully frustrating in the original game...

BUT!

I‚Äôll start my review saying that this game doesn‚Äôt deserve all the negativity is getting. People love the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IgAVQdHJQ4]wololo meme,[/url] and also love to bash the first Age of Empires. The biggest characteristic of the Age of Empires series is that every game is unique in its own way. If you‚Äôre expecting a similar game as AoE 2 you‚Äôll be disappointed, but if you keep an open mind, you‚Äôll find a lot of enjoyment. Now to the actual review:

[h1]Remastering the game that started it all[/h1]

Despite the great reworked graphics, this game is more of a remaster than a remake. This means that it‚Äôs very faithful to the original game, including its oldschool clunkyness. But still, the Forgotten Empires developers have added some great quality of life features, like farm reseeding, tech queues, indicator of how many idle villagers you have, walkable farms, higher population cap and other minor additions. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that the AI has greatly improved compared to the original and compared to the Microsoft Store launch last year. These AI improvements, made primarily to add more spice to skmirmish matches, have a side-effect of making some campaign levels unfairly hard. The game also features a reworked soundtrack, recorded with an orchestra. Personally, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1846861089]I don‚Äôt like it too much[/url], as the composer in charge have changed several melodies here and there, killing the nostalgic mood ‚Äì imagine if someone re-recorded the classic [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bTpp8PQSog]Indiana Jones[/url] theme, starting fine and changing some notes in the way: that‚Äôs how it feels to me. 

[h1]What if I don‚Äôt want all this fanciness?[/h1]

Then you can enable the [url=https://youtu.be/I_1S5OqAo4w?t=214]Classic Mode[/url] in custom games, which uses the original graphics, soundtrack and gameplay. This mode is very poorly implemented, though, for several reasons: 1) You can‚Äôt use it on the campaigns; 2) You can‚Äôt use it on multiplayer; 3) It starts with the vanilla soundtrack rather than the Rise of Rome soundtrack like it used to in the original with the expansion; 4) The interface is the same as the Definitive Edition, so it‚Äôs not totally nostalgic; 5) You can‚Äôt choose between the MIDI and the recorded soundtrack from the Gold Edition. I‚Äôm hoping these issues can be solved in a near future. And it would be good if we could choose to use the original sound effects outside Classic Mode, as some re-recorded sounds are truly awful. Yeah, they have changed the classic ‚Äú[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYdbcIQ-pQ4]Rogan?[/url]‚Äù sound to another ‚ÄúRogan?‚Äù that sounds like it came from a drunk and high pitched voice actor. Unbelievable.
 
[h1]What sets AoE 1 apart compared with AoE 2[/h1]

If you never have played the first Age of Empires, you should know that a lot of strategies from Age of Empires II don‚Äôt work here. For starters, there‚Äôs no gate ‚Äì I actually love this, because no one is ever safe, and you need to be creative with your walls placement, sometimes even creating some mazes that mashes with the environment. There‚Äôs also no land trading and no way to buy and sell resources on the market, so you need to plan a good strategy ahead as soon as you uncover the map. No army formations as well ‚Äì it‚Äôs all brute and raw. There‚Äôs no scout at the start, so if you want to explore the map without hurting your progress (avoiding using your villagers to explore) you should advance to the second age (Tool Age) and train a scout ‚Äì you could also use a Clubman, trained at the Barracks, but they‚Äôre too slow and don‚Äôt uncover a lot of the map. And the pathfinding is a lot simpler/poor (even if it‚Äôs slightly better in the Definitive Edition) compared to Age of Empires II, which to me it‚Äôs not a huge problem, as micromanaging units it‚Äôs one of the pillars of the RTS genre. Everything stated in this paragraph is what makes Age of Empires 1 my favorite in the series ‚Äì it‚Äôs much less automated and comfortable than its successors, providing a more strategic experience.
 
[h1]It‚Äôs worth the full price?[/h1]

As much as I love the first Age of Empires, I‚Äôm not sure if I could recommend it at full price to everyone, as it‚Äôs a whole different beast compared to Age of Empires II and other more modern RTS games. However, if you have enjoyed the original and/or you are used to older games, go ahead and pick it up right now; if not, wait for a sale. As for the Definitive Edition features: they‚Äôre a hit or miss sometimes. It‚Äôs certainly not definitive as it should be, but I‚Äôm glad that we at least have it, considering that the first Age of Empires is a very underrated game, shadowed by Age of Empires II, Age of Mythology and even by Age of Empires III.

And this is great, an opportunity for die-hard fans to play a classic game on modern hardware, in a modern way.

What's not so great is the execution. I have a GTX 1070,  i7 7500U setup. Although it's very CPU bottlenecked, you'd think it wouldn't have so much trouble running a game that is effectively from 1995. Although I can run most modern games I play at 144fps (save for EUIV), this one seems to get 39 at most, which is abysmally poor. The graphics settings don't help much with this either, as the only setting that makes any discernible difference is the 1x, 2x, 4x scaling drop down menu, 4x putting me down to 10fps, which seems to affect which sprites are used and how zoomed-in the game is, rather than anything that might affect the actual CPU usage.

Save for the main menu, every other screen looks straight out of 1995, or a D tier no-name you can only get by buying a random steam key on G2A, it's that bad. Multiplayer is a chore as well, trying to navigate the menus to find a lobby, having to deal with the fact that ranks have been broken since launch a year ago, and therefore ranked matching, and finding a game in general as I've only ever been able to find 2-3 other people online despite a much higher playerbase.

From a game standpoint, this title doesn't hold up either, especially against greater titles such as AoE II and AoE III (yes I know), both of which run very well, have proper looking menus for a game of this magnitude, a consistent online playerbase, and most importantly: civilizations. No doubt, the lifeblood of every RTS game are the minute advantages or disadvantages each civilization may have over another. An RTS game where every civilization is the same would grow old very fast, which is exactly what Age of Empires: DE is. The original, being an early RTS game, included a number of civilizations, none of which had their own advantages (e.g. speical units, special buildings, etc.) but instead found their de facto differences owning entirely to which units from the great pool they didn't have access to. Which is to say, the difference between the Chinese and the Greeks is that the Chinese don't have access to the Phalanx upgrade tree. In the original, there were also bonuses that exacerbated the differences between factions through gameplay changes, such as the Hittites having a 100% health bonus on their catapults, but even these were changed in DE (lowered to 50%), making the difference in gameplay that much less between civilizations. This explains why. unlike Age of Empires II: DE, AoE: DE didn't see the addition of any new civs, because there's no way to differentiate them from the already existing civs without adding new units for them not to have access to.

Although I enjoy this game for what it is, it's really only to tide me over to the release of Age of Empires II: DE, and I can't recommend it to anyone looking to get into an RTS that isn't explicitly Age of Empires I, because this is the best (and only) version of the first game you can run on modern operating systems.

However, the game itself is almost exactly what it should be for a remake of sorts.

As someone who have been playing this game since it's original release in 97, this version does a good job at keeping what was fun about it fresher and less clunky. 

Some thoughts, considering I played a few single player missions from different campaigns and some custom maps, but haven't touched multiplayer yet. 

Pros:
[list]
    [*]Graphics feel very nice in comparison to the original. Architecture is spot on and units remain distinct from one another in a glance. A striking contrast between what has been going on with Warcraft 3 remastered thing. Optional faction-unique unit differences would be great as well.
    [*]Unit queues with research from buildings, minimap options, rally points comprehensible Tech-tree, all QOL things that only make the game up to standards set by games released afterward, specially Age of Empires 2. I would love if they had added action queues (shift-clicking) as well, but nothing is perfect. 
    [*]New campaign based on the old Demo version of the original game, about the Hittites. It's not the same missions but made a lot more interesting.
    [*]Works with resolutions without needing a fix, runs well (turned off bloom) unless there are 200+units on screen at once.
    [*]New music is great at times, inferior at others. Some tracks had their melodies altered in ways that feel just wrong. You can make the vanilla OST play first instead of the Rome Expac one by swapping the filenames in the game's folder (music into xmusic / xmusic into music) so it changes the order in game.
    [*]They thankfully haven't added gates! This and the game's lack of a Castle equivalent makes it so you aren't absolutely required to build siege units. I really like this aspect of AoE1 and they respected it in DE.
[/list]

Cons

[list]
    [*]Voice actor narrates missions, but they didn't add different narrators for different campaigns like Age of Empires 2, which makes it feel cheap and adds 0 character to campaigns. I'd rather have no one at all.
    [*]While pathfinding is better than the original, Villagers still get stuck on one another in busy locations. This is specially annoying when there's stone, gold, wood and wild animals gathering on a single Storage Pit.
    [*]Stil no colorblind civ color mode so you can play as Red even in the campaigns.

Overall 8.7/10, better than what I expected in some parts, but worse than what it could've been in others.

I expect to be able to move with the WASD keys or to be able to rebind to it easily without having to hunt through an unbind hundreds of other random context binds. I expect to be able to alter graphical settings without a crash every time.

Frame rate just suddenly goes down with not even a 100 units. 
Never happened with the original or any of its successors at their time with even the max units +2000. 
No real graphic options.  4K should be a free a DLC, most people don't even have a display or hardware for that or want a little bit more of space just as R6 does. 
There's also missing content, not even a single cutscene from  the original. There's also no glossary or encyclopedia that made the game so special as a history game, not even aside from the main build (the original had it apart). 
Units are overly sized (same as the original), they couldn't fix that, and the pathfinding is as bad as the initial release from 96 which improved with patches and the expansion. 
How does this game has the same minimum requirements as AOE II : DE?
Optional: No Mod support.
AOE: DE Theme at least should have a loop option at the main screen.

NEUTRAL

UI could get improve.

PROS

Music is just AMAZING.
Structures got really nice textures.
Slightly better gameplay for today standards.
Cool and original Cinematic Intro

This is both a good thing and a bad thing. I‚Äôm a bit biased towards it as it was one of the first computer games I played in my youth, but will try to be as objective as possible. While I have an original disc of the Gold Edition, its ‚Äúease of installation‚Äù on modern OS‚Äôs and hardware was questionable, so I decided to buy this day-one, simply for the nostalgia factor.

In brief, it is a good game and definitely worth playing if you‚Äôre a long-time fan of the series or strategy games in general. However, if you‚Äôre picking this up for the first time, be advised: it plays ‚Äúold-school‚Äù and may feel clunky if you‚Äôre accustomed to newer titles such as Dawn of War or StarCraft 2.

[h1] The Good [/h1]
What this game gets right is the complete 3D graphics overhaul; that is fantastic! Overall, it is a beautiful and faithful recreation of the original maps. It also adds some small quality of life improvements such as unit queues, navigation way points and villagers per resource. There is also an integrated tech-tree button if you want to know a specific path to unlock a certain technology. Xbox Live has integration for multiplayer and then there‚Äôs LAN as well! Yes LAN! In this era of online-only forced on DRM based services, we get LAN!

[h1] The Bad [/h1]
It is a recreation of a 22 year-old game and stays largely faithful to that. There are no revolutionary new mechanics or special features to speak about. 

The most painfully obvious flaw becomes clear after the first few minutes in-game: pathfinding! Pathfinding is atrocious and I‚Äôm not really sure why it is this terrible as the developers would have to create it anew for this game. There are constant unit collisions where two units will just freeze in place and need manual redirection. Grouped units will often wander off in some split direction as well. I‚Äôm hoping this can be improved with patching, but considering it was already released a year prior on the MS Store, I‚Äôm a little doubtful.

There is also the clunky putting down buildings without the possibility of queuing your villager‚Äôs build or post-build tasks. Units still cannot move in formation (that‚Äôs apparently exclusive to AoE II and III ? I‚Äôm guessing). The unit stand-ground command exists, but is not toggle-able as far as I can tell and not really sure what it does behind the scenes, but units obey when clicked.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
This is a game that stays true to the original and if you don‚Äôt expect anything more, you will probably enjoy it. It is rough around the edges in a few areas, I‚Äôll fully admit that, and perhaps I‚Äôm looking upon it with nostalgia, but I still enjoy playing it every now and then to simulate clashes of ancient civilizations.",1566421153,1566753672,True,20,2,0.66727602481842041,0,True,False,False

This game is very special to me as Age of Empires was my first RTS game (yes it's not StarCraft). It made me like the RTS genre and became very interested in history.

Now to non-biased review, here are my pros and cons of this game (I just finished the learning campaign):

[b]Pros:[/b]
~Graphics were improved compared to the old.
~Remastered soundtracks.
~Narrated campaigns (the old one was purely text)
~Multiplayer support (never tried this one yet because I'm more on campaign guy)
~Modern resolutions support.

[b]Cons:[/b]
~[i]Lost connection to multiplayer servers[/i] always pops up every now and then even if I'm only playing single player and wanted to play offline in the first place. (which is kinda annoying)
~[b]RANDOM CTDs[/b] Be sure to save everytime if you're playing Campaign.
~FPS drops when zoomed out and scrolling the map.
~Path finding sucks
~AI is unusually aggresive (in the first mission of Babylonian Campaign)


Overall, solid game but with annoying bugs so far.

Having got my hands on it I have to say that it is indeed great fun to play the game again after all these years and all the nostalgia is coming back hard.

The little quality of life improvements are quite pleasant and overall I've had a wonderful experience retreading familiar ground and imagine I will continue to have such going forwards.

Now with that said I would not recommend this game for anyone who did not grow up playing it and is instead looking for something new and interesting. This is not such a game.

The pathfinding is awful and all the little quality of life improvements are not worth the fact that you're buying a game that is two decades old whose core mechanics have not been refined to match its sequel (Age of Empires II) which is ultimately a superior game and is about to get a new re-release of its own.

If you're buying this for nostalgia's sake like myself then go ahead and get this game. It is glorious fun to have it available again. If you're new to it then understand that this is a game of its era with all that entails. Don't expect complex gameplay or intelligent units.

Personally if I was going to buy a remade AOE game for the first time I would wait until the new version of Age of Empires II comes out and leave this game alone.

Altought this does not go away from the fact that this is something we should not be dealing with. So devs, if you ARE reading these, please issue a permanent fix for it! (if you can)

Afternoon i get an e-mail, saying AOE DE is available!
Naive me YEETS money into screen.
Starts game, launches first campaign.
""Something is interfering with the game, no do boos.""
All afternoon goes by, i try to find the cause of the issue. No luck. I check reviews... many have same issue.
So here i am, hyped for this game since it was announced, didn't know 'till today it was coming to steam, and hell if i was to get it on microsoft store. And now... i have broken hopes and dreams.
It's a negative from me untill this issue is fixed.",1566247310,1566489097,True,0,0,0.502247631549835205,0,True,False,False

The FPS for me (playing in 1080p, 144hz) are most of the time at steady 144fps, but can go down beneath 100 if there is a lot going on ingame (fights, buildings collapse, etc. at same time).

People arguing that they have beast graphics cards and a game like this should run way better, simply don't understand a thing about hardware and game engines. This game relies the most on the 2D acceleration of your graphics card, which only improved a tiny bit since the original AoE was released, because the manufacturers only improved 3D acceleration which doesn't help here. So in fact your CPU has to help out a lot.

The next point i would like to talk about is people complaining about the path finding. If you played Age of Empires the time it released (as I did for example) you totally recognize the behaviour of the units. This Definitive Edition feels like the original game while playing it, just with a much better look. Not only better but fitting for modern PC's in terms of resolution and datail. So if you expected the developer to change core game mechanics for this remastered/remade Version you fooled yourself. The devs were fully transparent with what you will get if you buy the game. 

It simply wouldn't be Age of Empires if they changed things like that. If you liked the original AoE then you will like this one too. If you don't like the style of it just don't buy it. You want a modern, probably better looking RTS game, with probably way better AI, pathfinding, etc.? Then simply wait a couple more months until Age of Empires IV gets introduced in detail.

Only thing i can confirm is the fact that buttons sometimes overlap with text, or text overlaps with frames onscreen.

I must say some parts are better than they were in original, thats for sure. Graphic, sound and new models are really nice. But even though I really tried to get into it, I could not. Because main parts of the game are kind of problematic. I get it, they tried to keep core of the game untouched, but I dont think, that was good idea. They should at least make some changes in control, UI, AI, because it feels like nobody actually tried to play it, before they decided to send game out. 


Minor issue: 
Objectives, for example destroy all enemy farms... I destroyed AI¬¥s town center and all core buildings near it, but even than I had to look everywhere, wasting my time. Why? When AI is pretty much done, they could at least mark objects on the map. Or even better, let game end without finishing this non-sense objective.

Major issues:

AI:
AI felt silly, same as it was 15yrs ago. One would thought, they make it better, but I guess, I was wrong.
AI keeps sending small armies to your town center, even thought, its obvious it wont do any harm, because you have fortification in place...
During the game I actually remembered old days, to be more specific IWD, when you could lure enemies to the next room and kill them one by one. You can pretty much do the same here, kill whole AI¬¥s army by luring them one by one out side of range of AI¬¥s fortifications or even better under your towers. (perhpas the highest difficulty can fix this, but to be honest I didnt try it, because AI wasnt main issue for me)

Path-fiding:
The worst I have seen in years. One of the most annoying parts. Units can get stuck just by walking next to each other, no to mention, when you need them to move through the middle of your/AI¬¥s town, to keep it short, dont even try it, it ll be end of you. (I played only with 50 unit cap, and I already had hard time to control my units as I wanted them to)

Lack of formations:
maybe I missed it, but I had to manually create formations, I wanted to use, becuase AI has tendencies to keep original formations. Meaning, if you have units all over the place, it just keep it that way, is like you would copy&paste positions of selected units and redo it in new position, centered around your cursor. So before the combat, I created formations for every group, manually placing every unit where I wanted them to be, and then I send them to the attack. After ""battle"", I had to do it all over again, especially meeles.


Combat:
All those 3 things leads to the one thing, combat is one big mess. Even with 30 combat units it was annoying like hell, so I dont want to see game, when you control 200vs200 units...

The Forgotten Empires Dev team have had a rocky time of it in the last few years, with some of their releases being hailed really well, and some not so much (Age of Mythology HD, common guys). This one seems to be one of the good ones, aside from some catastrophic bugs that are having peoples' games crash. 

Game wise, it's still the game you remember, or not if you're not over 25. Plays like Age of Empires 2 with 3D models. While they are much higher ress than its sequels 2D spites, there is a simplicity and beauty that AoE simply doesn't have. It also causes issues in path finding when units bump into each other and cause blockages, where AoE II simply did not suffer from.

Campaign wise, the game explores the Ancient classical periods, with its campaign exploring ancient Greece and various other periods in history. A good bunch! in fact, I think i prefer them to AoE II, in setting at least

I did play Age of Empires III and The Warchiefs expansion.  So I approached this with memories of enjoying the classical civilizations, agriculture, fishing and ballistas.

Having read the reviews on here and on metacritic (although these were mainly from launch) I had some doubts but in the end this is a lot of content for not a lot of money and I missed that classical world.

The steam launch reviews talked of bugs.  At the time of writing I've played for just over 4 hours and these are my initial findings.  My steamapps folder is excluded from my antivirus programme (Bitdefender) and I also allowed access through Windows firewall (it asked twice and each time I took care to ensure that access was enabled on my private network).  I believe this has been responsible for me having no issues with the anti-cheating self monitoring mechanism in the game.

What bugs did I find?  Well one,  the poor text formatting at the summary after being ""Victorious"" on a quest .  Not a big deal and something that I expect a patch will fix soon enough.

Gameplay is pleasant, the music is relaxing and the game is stable.  Pathfinding seams better than the original but at this stage I haven't ran into any difficulties.  I suspect older players will be more relaxed with this having memories of the original game and it's quirky eccentricities.

The graphics are improved and although it's a personal preference I think the smoother animations are good and it's visually enjoyable.

The sound adds to the experience and is like returning to a familiar place.

I am enjoying being back and it's more than nostalgia.  So far this gentle start is just what I was looking for, a game I can relax and build a civilisation.

I bought it together with Age of Empires II DE and think one would struggle to find so much content for so little.  A little care with the firewall and antivirus at install went a long way for me and I think the game deserves a much warmer reception than it has had.  I am a very happy customer.

If you have nostalgia goggles for Age of Empires, you'll get some enjoyment out of this regardless of its flaws. I debated getting a refund, but ultimately decided I'd enjoy revisiting the scenarios from my childhood again despite the flaws.

First off, game looks pretty. Animations are lovely, everything looks vibrant. I really like the UI too. The score has been redone and is nice enough.

Performance can be choppy. Frame rate stutters sometimes for reasons I've yet to make heads of. It's not too bad, but it's noticeable to the eye.

Pathfinding is TERRIBLE. I don't want to sound like I'm exaggerating, but every game has been bogged down by it at least once. Moving single units isn't too bad. Moving a group - sometimes they'll walk past where I tell them to go and keep going. In at least one occasion an axeman couldn't get to a tower to reach from one side of a forest so walked around the entire forest to reach the other side. When he got there.... he walked back round to where he originally was despite the fact that he had an opening. All the while being shot at. People walk into one another and stutter and struggle to sidestep (I actually remember this being a pain in the original, which makes it more baffling how it's there after 20+ years). Sometimes these are minor, but others can make the game a chore.

If you've only ever played AoE2 and are thinking of checking this out, I will say this feels slower gameplay wise, just like the original.

Some really nice additions (at least I think they are... been a while since I played the original). You can queue up different unit and tech orders in the same building. Some touches from AoE2:HD come over like auto-renewing farms, but not as many as I expected.

Some of the menus don't render correct for me. The victory screen after a match has buttons showing over the victory text.

I'll remain open to amending my review with further updates, I think with a few clean ups this could easily change to a recommended, but I'm a bit grumpy that these weren't ironed out sooner (hasn't it been on Windows Store for a year already? How weren't they caught then?). It does feel a little like I've paid for a beta.

Graphics are a great improvement, and you can even zoom a little bit. 

Wish they would have added a few features from AOE2 like being able to put units into formations, as they wont stand anywhere close together, which makes planning a battle a bit clunky, since you have to move each unit into place individually.

Listen as a calm and beautiful soundtrack plays gently now and again between moments of silence with nothing but the chopping of wood, chipping of stones and cuttings of fresh gazelle as you watch clouds roll over the terrain your growing tribe is labouring upon. 

You lead them through the Stone Age into the Tool Age as your small economy grows and new technology paves the way to establish a small village. You explore the surrounding areas textured in HD graphics and detailed UI descriptions. Things only get more interesting as you manage your people through into new ages. A Bronze Age and finally an Iron Age.

You are not alone however as you expand you discover other ancient civilisations, opposing rivals or allies in your lands. Command your armies in conquest, or capture and hold artefacts and ancient relics, or build an economy of which you construct and defend a colossal wonder as a testament to your rule. Achieve victory as you see fit. The AI is much better organised then the original.

This game is a faithful remastering of the original Age of Empires from 1997. I remember the day my father pulled out this CD from the inside of a Kellog's Rice Bubbles cereal box in the early 2000s. I played this game almost everyday, the first thing I did getting home from school was booting up a game of AOE on my cream coloured box computer screen. A classic real time strategy game is now remastered... For a game which originally had sold over millions of hard copies. For Microsoft to come back and remaster this series... it's so unexpected. I am very grateful for this. I thought I'd never see the day.

I will be spending quite a bit of time on here. I'm glade you (microsoft) have finally brought it to Steam. It should have been here in the first place and I think you guys know that too. There are only have a few touches left of polish and this game will be a gem. As of this time there is flickering and overlapping UI in the Campaign mission aftermaths (love the voiced briefings tho). And the Computer AI has no diplomacy working during gameplay which would be amazing if you Microsoft can implement it or at least keep it as a random chance like it was in the original. Another gripe, however small, is upon zooming in on units and textures close up there is blurring. Path finding is much improved over the original as well, it can still happen but to me that has always been apart of the experience micro those men right and you will have no problem. Avoid tight spaces... fight in open ground unless you have missile superiority (cause then its a shooting gallery). Plan your city so you have easy routes for troops to move through.

To everyone out there this game is a must buy! To the old fans and to anyone young or new, this game will be great fun and well worth the price of around $20. This game has heaps of replayability and always has a active multiplayer community of truly hardcore fans.

The game looks beautiful and has some quality of life improvements over the original that make it less of a pain to play, but at the same time does some things even worse than the original:
The pathfinding is monstrously bad, villagers bump into each other and stay there for a solid 10 seconds before finally figuring out what to do, stand idle if there's too many of them in the same resource (even though there's clearly enough room for one more) and military units get stuck on the terrain more often than I'd like.
The AI is somehow worse than in the original, which is surprising for a 20+ year old game, not sure how they managed it. In Random Map, even in moderate difficulty it doesn't attack or make military units except for a few catapults. And in the campaign I've had it resign before I could complete the objectives, which is like the whole point of the campaign...

If you loved the original game and want to experience it again, get a copy of the original game and search for and install the ""UPatch HD"", which will give AoE modern resolution support, add the CD music, and give other fixes to make it comfortable on a modern OS.

For having bought the game on the Windows 10 Store at the time I played it a lot and it's really a good game and I think that if the pathfinding was a little less farting because we already had this kind of problems on the 1998 version there are still problems and it's absurd for a game that supposedly has been redone.

However, why do I put ""NO"" to my recommendation in my first Review ? 

Simply because this game is a paranoid game indeed in order to prevent cheating the game cuts itself off if it detects processes that affect the game, problems : 
Every 5 minutes the game crashes because it conflicts with a lot of software: overlay Steam, antivirus, DirectX (I'm not kidding).
So the game is unplayable as it stands until they fix this ""bug"" because the game cuts your game and returns you to the menu with the options in grayed so apart from leaving the game you can't click on anything.

How to fix the ""Conflict bug"" :

Extremely disappointed to get f*cked up when they had a little over a year to fix these problems already and beyond if the developers had launched their game they would have noticed it after 5 minutes.
To fix the bug, Add the folder steamapps/common/AOEDE to your Antivirus exception, this problem show the ""don't care"" attitude of the development team.


Conclusion :

So in conclusion in the state it's playable but prepare to fix the ""bug"" yourself  (I do not exaggerate) so wait for the updates if you are interested if Age of Empire II: Definitive Edition meets the same problems it is scary for the future.
But Age of Empire will stay the game of my childhood and even it's a great game I just really hope that Microsoft really care more about the game than that they showing us now",1566273662,1566288176,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

However, the amount of stonewalling I am getting because this game doesn't like the security protocols and programs, and whatever the heck is insane. Did Microsoft even beta test this on Steam!?! 

DO NOT. I repeat. DO NOT buy this game until the developers fix this glaring issue. And don't give me, the ""um well I am playing it"" fine your playing it but what about the rest of us who is still having this problem despite the ""fix"" suggestions the devs are offering through the support link. 

Now if you get pass that issue what about the rest of the game? Well it's a different AOE experience you can really feel it playing for the first time. And for the love of god turn up the game speed because you'll be doing these scenarios, matches, etc. For a long time. 

You can't just hope for the best in the beginning mind you like in AOE II and III, etc. Because here A.I. will mash out a ton and i mean a TON of units and settlers early on, which can be downright annoying at times. Obviously certain empires can't get certain things, and of course you have your standard multiplayer match types against either players or A.I. you can even once again customize and upload your own maps, etc. 

I would love to give this game a thumbs up. However the annoyance of having to troubleshoot a game FIRST rather than PLAYING it second turns me off a bit.

PROS:   

1. Some QOL updates that AOE didn't have were implemented in. I could go into detail but I just got back to my PC and wanted to throw a positive review up before hopping back on!

2. Updated graphics, I was very excited seeing everything brought to life in so much more detail. Seriously the buildings crumbling down look so good and immersive, well done!

3. The music really captures the feels and my sweet sweet nostalgia

4. It feels like a brand new game to be honest. I can't wait to dive in more. A good buy for RTS lovers and AOE1/2/3 fans!

5. No crashing or any major problems for me so far, I will update this if any are found.

CONS: 

1. Minor UI problems, like overlapping UI here and there that's visually annoying but not at all game breaking

2. I would have liked to have seen the 3 separate zoom options put all in 1

3. I'd like to have a hotkey for selecting my town center ect, perhaps that's just a simple trip to the hotkey options but it be really odd not to have one already set up if it does exist. Maybe someone can drop a comment.

4. There doesn't seem to be a ton of Random Map options, would love to see more added on, but it's definitely enough for now.

5. The biggest gripe I have though is there doesn't seem to be any workshop implemented, that simply MUST change for this game to live up to the potential it deserves. Seriously Microsoft Studios, if you could only do one thing, it should be this 100%

6. Microsoft Studios didn't really announce the release, I would have liked to make plans around this so I could have been playing a lot more by now.

7. No formations would be my second biggest gripe, this was a huge QOL and immersive improvement that wasn't addressed. Hopefully we will see it implemented.

Overall Grade: 7/10 

A solid release! It just lacks the polish I felt the original games had, but very much captures the same excitement. REALLY needs a workshop implemented. That alone would put it up to 8.5/10 simply due to the love the community would put into fixing every little detail and implementing some great stuff.",1566255258,1566257954,True,17,2,0.613988101482391357,1,True,False,False

Aside from that, delivers what I expect (which to be fair isn't much, I just want to play the game, preferably with some opposition).

Quick update on AI later same evening after playing a couple of 50 pop games:

Low level AI shared with player (primarily pathfinding) always had issues in AoE. There seem to be slightly less traffic blockades now (farm fields passable!), but they are still there. Of course, I am experienced with the game's shortcomings so it's likely a beginner would have greater trouble with these. Some other problems I noted here probably always were there as well, such as my army often dissipating while I multitask something else because it decided to walk further and further to chase villager spam into defending towers. Yeah, there's stand ground command but a default behavior that remembered initial location would have been nice...

High level AI flips between challenging and completely unchallenging. Example: On a large island map I was invading the Korean faction counter-attacking me with one swordsman a time (predictably getting slaughtered), until I blew through half their base, at which they suddenly attacked with 10+ and wiped my siege force. Other enemies liked sending one ship at a time on repeat; not sure if this is any different from original. Sometimes the targeting is not too smart and units prefer to move a lot instead of shooting (at worst even spastically getting into indecision loops moving back and forth).

I did get the impression that when the high level AI works, it can put up a fight to pose a threat, but perhaps not enough to change the outcome, making most battles still feel like cleanup. A beginner might have more trouble, though I am far from the best AoE player. If I had to compare it to what I remember from the original game, the strategic AI may well be slightly better now, but it's difficult to tell without going back and play the original (which I won't for a Steam review).",1566240619,1566250318,True,45,4,0.714377045631408691,0,True,False,False

Cons,
Firstly, there are no troops formations and as we move the troops, they become buggy on the map and they look disgustingly formed, more like random constant movements among troops like they are not programmed to be formed in a certain formation like those in old AOE games.

Secondly, massive FPS stuttering when you move around the map.

Overall,

Graphic: Stunningly Detailed and beautiful

Sound: No bugs at the moment

PC specs requirement: Medium or High end

Game play: Just like old time, good o' Age of Empires game play but as I mentioned above, there are some issues with the game plays.

I purchased this once on the windows store but I wanted it on steam due to windows store's chronic uselessness. 

It seems to be working without major issues so far.

The UI is a bit dodgy with scaling (text overlap) and buttons flickering when hovering over them but nothing game breaking. Not had any crashes but I did have to make sure the game was allowed through windows defender or I got an error message that stopped me from playing until I allowed permissions.

I am not a hardcore AoE player by any means, I play it a lot more casually. This means I can't speak much for balance and high level gameplay but I can praise the detailed tooltips and the updated graphics and animations really capture the feel of the old game and are very smooth.

If you're like me and only played AoE 1 single player casually and wanted to recapture the game from your childhood then this is perfect for that. 

Will update if I encounter any game breaking issues.

EDIT: So after a few more games I ran in to the old problem - the unit pathfinding is pretty bad, it's not the end of the world and it's exactly how the old game played but it would have been nice to see that improved and may put off some players. Units get stuck on each other all the time and it requires a bit of micro managing to separate them out a bit which gets a bit grating during longer play sessions.

-Extremely low maximum unit supply, at least half of which is taken by your villagers, so enjoy rebuilding a handful of units 10 times before you can break an enemy base.
