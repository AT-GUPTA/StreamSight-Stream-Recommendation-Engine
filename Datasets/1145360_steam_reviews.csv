I like how it combines combat with story when it comes to the characters you can get to know. The fast pace makes it nice to play when you just have an hour or so to spare. Or you can spend longer playing and not get bored thanks to all the different weapons/boons you can use and the drive to uncover more of the different characters' stories.,1708928243,1708928243,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When I was a kid, getting your save corrupted on your memory card meant that you would throw your PlayStation 1 out of the window in blind hatred and everyone outside nodded, as they understood your plight very well. Nowadays, losing progress is a feature in games. Even in normal games, saves have been replaces by checkpoints that are placed ever further apart.

Hades, however, at least gives a good reason for that mechanic. You are an immortal, trying to escape the underworld and dying in the underworld just means that you are going to be reborn from the pool at your house. At least, the mechanic makes sense in this context. However, I must say that this format of game is, at its core, still quite unfriendly. 

As you get stronger, you play for longer, as you get further into the levels, but you can't just save your game and go get groceries or go to work, because you will lose all your progress if you do that. Furthermore, on each play-through, you are still forced to go through all the bosses you defeated previously, and your strength often depends on random chance, because the power-ups that become available to you are somewhat random, so you can still die at one of the ""easier"" bosses if you are not very lucky or sharp. Getting far in the game and then dying, though, makes you lose the will to live, as you realise that you have to do it all over again, including fighting all the previous bosses.

After many attempts, I finally got to the final boss with the right power-ups and brought his liffe bar to the bottom only to see his life bar refill to 100%. I don't know how many lives this boss has, but I think I am now done. Go f*ck yourself, game. Now, additional content does get unlocked after losing to the main boss, so I know this is all by design, but at this point, I am quite done with the game. I just don't have the patience for games that waste my time like this.

Nonetheless, the fighting in this game is fun and the game itself is pretty, so that the gameplay is sufficient enough to make you come back to the game (after you do something else for while, out of frustration). If you have more skill and patience than I, then I bet you will have fun with Hades and will see it through.",1708380726,1708872633,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Gameplay[/b]

The concept behind the game is simple; you need to get through three levels containing multiple sub-levels. 

Initially you are extremely weak so you derive enjoyment from trying different things to get a bit further each time. Later it becomes easier to get through the levels so you will want to look into trying different weapons and builds. I highly recommend looking up builds as some of them are really cool but unintuitive.

I'm not really emphasising it here but the game has a massive amount of replayability.

[b]Everything Else[/b]

I feel that the absolute main focus of this game is gameplay, everything else was chosen to be cost effective but implemented at the best quality. For exmaple, the graphics have a very simple 2D top down appearance but are beautifully drawn with atmospheric lighting. There are only three levels... but each has a very unique setting and atmosphere. The cutscenes aren't animated, but the voice-acting and character portraits are top tier.

The overall theme is quality over quantity.

[b]Closing Words[/b]

It scratches a very specific itch for me: nonstop action and story optional. That said, the story is clever and actually quite moving, but more than anything I appreciate that the story is *optional*, rather than a bunch of writers jerking themselves off over how hard they had to force the story down the players throats through cut-scenes.

Trully the best Roguelike out there. Outstanding gameplay, story, acting, music and vibe in general. Even though I am not even someone who has ever liked Roguelike games. They are fun to watch on stream, but to actually play them myself, always felt boring. And then I found Hades. The first time I saw this game was back in 2020 when it was nominated for pretty much every game award that exists, and it felt strange to me that a game looking like that is up there with names like The Last of Us Part 2, Ghost of Tsuhima and all the other amazing games from 2020. It really caught my eye but I didn't really feel like I was going to enjoy it so I didn't buy it, until recently when the game was on sale. Turns out I f*cking loved it. Can't remember the last time I had so much fun in a Single-Player video game. It's An Absolute Masterpiece. It has a very unique and special aura around it. As a person who absolutely loves Greek mythology, I was pleasently suprised with how accurate their spin on it was. It would be even more exciting to see all of the gods from Hades return to Hades II, on top of all of the new gods who will undoubtedly be present in a sequal. Imagine getting to build around the powers of like 15 gods, it would be insanely awesome. Either way, I was easily hooked to this franchise and now I'm forced to sit here and watch as the time passes by, waiting for Hades II.",1665048926,1708709558,True,53,0,0.778910279273986816,0,True,False,False

The gameplay, story, characters, and voice acting are incredible as well. Combat is satisfying and it's fun to progress through the many layers of Hell on your journey to escape the underworld. The world that the devs created comes together and just flows, especially when you start to talk to the characters more and learn more about their stories.

The game hits all the right notes and was a joy to play. I would recommend it to anyone! 9.5/10. However... there are a few flaws that I would like to point out that I can't get past.

First, the main story does not conclude in a way to me that makes sense. [spoiler]You need to escape 10 times in order to fully complete it, and on run 8 or 9 your mother comments that she is not coming back to the House and will remain on the surface, forever. However, very shortly after she changes her mind, has her bags packed and ready to go, abandons her home on the surface, comes with you to the underworld, everyone cheers, story done. What? This progression of meeting your mother > she refuses to come back to the house > nevermind let's do it was WAY too quick for me. Perhaps I grinded the game too quickly which gave the illusion of this speed, but I can't get past it, even many runs and hours later. It took away from the immersive narrative that I spent so long investing into, only to have this 'oh.... okay' moment at the end. Don't get me wrong, it was a great time and I still fully enjoyed the story. But this part made me think that the ending to this story was rushed. I'm fine with the fairy tale ending of everything working out, but I feel like there could have been a bit more build up or conflict.[/spoiler]

Next, the epilogue is even worse. [spoiler]You spend hours grinding through playthroughs, maxing your bonds with all the gods, performing favours, leveling up etc., only to have your hard-earned epilogue be a voice over narrative with ONE new image depicting Hades and Zeus shaking hands. This, again, did not feel like a proper conclusion to A. the amount of time and effort put into getting to this point and B. the story itself. Once again, there was a huge build up of 'how will we get the Olympians to be okay with this?' and the answer, was just to have a dinner party. Ok! All is forgiven. The entire post-main-story game was spent wondering how will we stop an all out war from happening when the Gods find out the queen has returned, only to have all of them forgive all at once, in a lacklustre cutscene.[/spoiler] I really really love this game but the weak endings to both stories just left me unsatisfied and wanting it to be different.

The last point I want to bring up is the replayability of the game. [spoiler]The four regions and four identical boss fights get old, quick. Even with the slight variation, fighting Meg, then Bone Hydra, then the champion+bull, then Hades is exhausting after a while. I don't want to fight the same bosses every time - the boss fights SHOULD be exciting and rewarding. But sadly, after a while the lack of variation feels repetitive and more like a chore. ""Here we go again, hit big snake head, then small snake head, then big snake head...."". Knowing exactly what you are going to fight every single run for a boss is tiresome in my opinion.[/spoiler]

I could go on about how the weapons don't have much difference in their aspects, or how the boon system doesn't feel like it impacts your run in a meaningful enough way, or the enemy variety, but the truth is I really enjoyed my time playing this game. I WANT to be able to pour hundreds of hours into it because I love it so much, but due to the above points I really don't see myself continuing to play now that I have most of the achievements done.

I'd like to conclude by saying these are all nitpicky points that I'm making after playing for 50+ hours. I still would recommend anyone to try this game and experience the masterpiece that is Hades. Excellent job Supergiant, I can't wait to see what else you have in store for us in the future.",1708569277,1708581820,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is a masterpiece that seamlessly blends elements of Greek mythology with gameplay mechanics reminiscent of Diablo and World of Warcraft’s Torghast tower in Shadowlands.

The game’s narrative is deeply rooted in Greek mythology, offering a fresh and engaging take on the timeless tales of gods, goddesses, and mythical creatures. The story unfolds as you progress, keeping you hooked and eager to uncover more.

The gameplay is a delightful mix of strategy and action. It’s clear that the developers have taken inspiration from classics like Diablo and World of Warcraft, but Hades stands out with its unique twists and mechanics. The challenges are well-balanced - tough enough to keep you engaged, but not so difficult that they become frustrating.

The graphics are stunning, with a distinctive art style that fits perfectly with the mythological theme. Each level is beautifully designed, and the character models are detailed and expressive.

But what truly sets Hades apart is its replay-ability. Every run is different, every decision matters, and every death is a new beginning. This game will keep you coming back for more, eager to explore every nook and cranny, unlock every secret, and conquer every challenge.

I cannot recommend Hades enough. Whether you’re a fan of Greek mythology, action RPGs, or just good games in general, Hades is a must-play.",1708550948,1708550948,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had extremely high expectations going into [i]Hades[/i], aside from the game getting a ton of praise this year including multiple relevant GOTY nominations, it's developed by Supergiant Games, the award winning studio that developed [i]Bastion[/i], one of my favorite games of all time. Additionally, the combat and graphical style of [i]Hades[/i] looked similar to [i]Bastion[/i] which really raised my hopes for the game.

[i]Hades[/i] is a roguelike that has quite the expansive story. You play as Zagreus, the son of Hades, and you're trying to escape from the underword through all of your father's undead defenses. You call upon the Olympians for help on your journey and they grant you different skills that make your escape attempts easier, and different than the last. You also have multiple weapons you can choose from which dramatically change how the game is playing. 

Without spoiling anything I'll say there is a ton of content in [i]Hades[/i], the main story took me 20+ hours to complete, and I just finished the epilogue with 100 runs logged. There is so much to do, unlock new weapons, upgrade weapons, build relationships with other characters, unlock new items, upgrade items- even now with around 80 hours of playtime and all achievements earned I don't have all relationships maxed out, weapons fully upgraded, or prophecies fulfilled. 

Furthermore, Supergiant created a modifier to the games difficulty called ""heat"" which makes runs as challenging as you like far after you've rolled credits. On the reverse side, upgrades through the mirror of darkness and the house contractor will continuously make runs easier until you get to the point where you win every single time unless you're challenging yourself by increase the heat.

Artistically the game is stellar. Each mythological character has been imagined in a new unique style by the Supergiant team, and they all have hundreds of amazing voicelines. Meanwhile, Supergiant has continued its trend of having beautiful music in its games. [i]Bastion[/i] and [i]Transistor[/i] both have countless memorable tracks from Darren Korb and Ashley Barret, and [i]Hades[/i] features some of their most enjoyable music yet. 

I've really enjoyed all my time with this game, it's fun, addicting, and challenging. You can focus on the story and play on god mode with no heat, you can play on high heat and suffer, or you can challenge yourself to squeeze all the content out of the game.

Ultimately, this is the best Supergiant game and easily one of the best games ever. It took everything that [i]Bastion[/i] did right and implemented it into a fast-pace Greek mythology-based roguelike with a ton of well-written, voiced-acted story content with difficulty options that give the title nearly endless replayability. It makes complete sense that [i]Hades[/i] is getting as much praise as it is based on the product, and makes even more based on the price; this game is a steal. I would highly recommend [i]Hades[/i] to anyone.

This is the game that started my love for rouge-like games as a whole genre, and became one of my top 10 games of all time.This game offers amazing game play for those who want a challange. Great storytelling and diverse characters.  The graphics are truly one of a kind. The voice acting is some of the best I have heard from any game. Darren Korb did an amazing job on the sound track, as he does with any game he does the OST for. There is truly nothing I would ever want to change in this absolute gem of a game. I think it goes without saying, I cannot wait for the second game. Full on 10/10 experience right here.",1708299982,1708401017,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The characters are all beautifully designed, wonderfully written, and brilliantly voice acted. The entire writing of the game is very amusing and sincere and every character has an amazing personality that fits the character they are representing. 

The story is pretty simple, but because of the nature of the gameplay, it always makes you want to come back for more (especially after you beat Hades). The main story is very simple to keep up with since it progresses for each run you complete. The side stories can happen whenever and all depend on certain things. You'll get special dialogue if you're carrying someone's Keepsake; your relationships with certain characters will deepen depending on how much Nectar/Ambrosia you decide to give them. But there are no requirements to complete any of that, you can beat the main story without doing the rest if you so wish. 

The art style is absolutely incredible and one of the most beautiful ones I've seen in a while. Every character is just so amazingly designed with this distinct art style that it's basically eye candy anytime I interact with them. That even goes to the level design as each level of the Underworlds is just incredibly amazing. What I found interesting about the game is the 2D levels, but the 3D sprites. It really made the visuals pop. 

The gameplay is absolutely amazing. This game (being a roguelike) has so much replay value it's insane. But because there are so many things you can do/complete, you'll want to keep doing runs. There's lots of stuff to collect such as Titan's Blood, Treasure, Darkness, etc. There are 6 different weapons that you can do runs with which makes sure that each replay will be interesting and unique (along with all the boons that you can get that really do effect how you will play the game). Once you complete your first run, you'll get new challenges that will make the game much more interesting to play. However, if you are just here for the story, there is a God Mode that you can turn on so you can solely experience the story, but I think the gameplay is genuinely fun and once you beat your first run, you'll be beating them like crazy. 

The music is on another level. This soundtrack is one of the best and each level has its own theme along with each boss and they all just are *chef's kiss*. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend this game to someone who's looking for a genuine fun game to play with lots of replayability that will allow you to sink hours into. The eye candy of the visuals and ear candy of the music and SFX are also huge side benefits that will add to the enjoyment of the game.",1708399376,1708399376,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Smooth & fluid action packed dungeon crawler with good replay value. At it's core Hades is a very simple and ""small"" game but man oh man, the level of depth in this game is something else. A single successful run won't take more than an hour at best, probably like 20-30 minutes if you're a veteran but the roguelite dungeon romp itself is just half the package.
Death and defeat, while gruesome and bitter at times does not feel all that bad in Hades due to the rather unique story structure that takes full advantage of this core feature of the genre.

Death, instead of signifying a setback will serve as a vessel to advance the story and allows you to explore the characters further. It's not overly complex really but given that the art, writing, voice acting and the overall theme is all neatly packed together and quite high quality makes the ""failure"" feel like progress - and it is.
I wouldn't quite say you WANT to die at times but it's probably not far off. Part of the enjoyment with Hades is to take a break back at home after you melt in a pool of blood and just chat with people. Witty dialogue and good presentation makes it a very compelling experience.
It's hard to do justice to the writing with a review just telling it's good. I don't want to hype it up to be something extraordinary but it simply does captivate and entertain you in a way you'll rarely experience in games. You can tell that the dev team put a lot of effort to it and it shows.

Gameplay itself feels just right. Combat is simplistic mechanically, but the vast variety of skill & perk combinations coupled with half a dozen of different main weapons makes for quite rich experience. Your typical ""easy to learn, hard to master"" system done correctly.
Dungeon design is quite structured and rigid, consisting of single rooms you clear in order to advance to next one and the meta dungeon is always the same. Act 2 will always have same environmental hazards and so on. This might seem like a boring and uninspiring design choice but while actually playing, it doesn't feel bland at all. It adds certain consistency to the game world and in the end you'll be more invested in seeking out cool new combos and killing enemies in new fancy ways.

At the time of writing this, I've died 22 times and beat the game twice. Both victories felt like impossible luck giving all the right pieces for a smooth run and I can't imagine to have that all the time even going forward after two actual victories although the permanent upgrades do make things easier alongside the player getting more experienced.
With some 19 hours banked in the game it feels like I'm still midway with the content. There's more story to explore, certain weapons I haven't barely touched at all, basic permanent upgrades are still work in progress not to mention the customizable endgame difficulty setups.

So. Good aesthetics and good gameplay. This is one of those rare diamonds of a game out there and deserves a straight 10/10.

This game isn't just about battling your way out of the Greek underworld; it's a deeply immersive experience that combines challenging gameplay with a narrative that's as captivating as any epic saga.

The brilliance of Hades lies in its ability to make each run through the ever-changing labyrinths of the underworld feel fresh and exciting. The combat is exhilarating, with a variety of weapons and powers that allow for a wide range of playstyles. The game challenges your skills and reflexes, making every victory feel earned and every setback a chance to learn and adapt.

But what truly sets Hades apart is its narrative and character development. The story unfolds with each attempt to escape, revealing more about the protagonist, Zagreus, and the richly drawn characters he encounters. The voice acting and writing are top-notch, bringing depth and personality to the gods, heroes, and mythical beings of the game.

In conclusion, Hades is a triumph of game design, artfully blending action, story, and strategy. It's a game that's as rewarding as it is challenging, with a depth that keeps you coming back for more.

I've faced so many bosses that I'm starting to think the Underworld is hosting its own managerial retreat. But hey, dying is just a minor inconvenience; it's more of a spa day for my soul. I've made friends with the shades, had heartfelt conversations, and even organized a dance party in Tartarus – because who said the afterlife can't have a good beat?

The gods keep giving me boons like they're Oprah on Mount Olympus: 'You get a boon, and you get a boon, everyone gets a boon!' But despite all the divine help, I still manage to get smacked by a Hydra head or charmed by a Gorgon. Maybe I need a divine intervention or just better reflexes.

I'm not going to let the Styx take me before I have expressed my biggest thoughts on this game. But I'll make the headline apparent:

Hades is phenomenal. Without any question. 

I had this game put off for the longest time since I wasn't confident in it aligning well with my preferences, so after expressing mild interest and acknowledging the game indeed did look really good, I had it gifted to me. After having finished the main quest now, with more still to go, I really sincerely wish I had purchased the game myself.

Hades at it's core feels like a love letter when it comes to giving it's own interpretations of the Greek Mythology, following the son of Hades in his attempts to escape the underworld, battling through different biomes of increasing difficulty and unique enemies in order to escape to Greece, all aided by the Gods of Olympus granting their boons to help him in his efforts. Each God, each character, feels like a really authentic interpretation of the Mythos (which, granted, I am not familiar with in any capacity), and it doesn't require that knowledge to really get into, and further aiding this is the fantastic voice acting for each character. Everybody sounds distinct and provides the proper flair that each God deserves. From the chilled out carefree tone of the God of Wine to the imposing booming voice of Hades himself. It doesn't need a lot of detail, it's just really damn good voicework. Simples. 

The son of Hades, Zagreus, is your playable character through this. He's honestly the star of the show, because it would've been easy for his role to fall into the angst, rebellious level of teen archetype that this sort of narrative would encourage, and he isn't that in the slightest. Zag carries himself with lots of warmth and a kindhearted nature towards all the other characters (except his father). He knows what he has to do is causing strife within the Underworld, but it's not stopping him from doing what he can to make amends with people and build relationships with others. Everything about Zagreus is extremely likeable, and he's probably one of the best protagonists I've played as. Definitely can't wait to see how they handle his sister in the sequel.

Oh, as we're talking visuals... It's an incredible; You're greeted by beautiful environments oozing with colour and personality, with each of the characters, Gods/Goddesses all being illustrated in uniquely wonderful portraits. The visual identity of Hades has so much love poured into it, and it shows in how seamless everything blends together. The effort even extends into how the different visual effects for the boons of the gods stack over each other, as well as enemy attacks and environmental hazards. I can still keep track of everything going on despite the visual colour war going on, because it's just handled that damn fucking well! Supergiant really brought their S-Rank effort into this element of the game and I cannot praise it high enough.

Gameplay is split between your escape attempts and your roaming around the hub area, that being the House of Hades (all shown from an isometric top down perspective). Every escape attempt has you jump down through your escape route and battle your way through chambers of varied creatures, each room leading to randomised rewards, be it money to spend or one of the gods granting you a series of boons to pick from to boost your power. As the nature of this is rogue-lite, there is a lot of combinations that you can have of these God favours, which can lead to crazy different play-styles with each of the 5 weapons you can get to play with, depending on how you get buffed. There is also a hammer that can be used to select a permanent change to your weapon, which can range from altering how you attack with it to increasing it's damage output in a specific way. 

The above would be moot if the combat itself wasn't phenomenal, and I can assure you it absolutely is. The controls alone are extremely tight for both controller and m&k, but the combat itself is fast paced, intense, and fluid beyond all belief. Zagreus moves so seamlessly between his moves with each weapon, bolstered further by how things get further altered the more upgrades you apply to him. You can feel like the most powerful hybrid god fighter with the right combo, and even if you DON'T, it still feels like an extremely fair game in how it presents it's challenge. Will it be easy? Hell no, it'll get really brutal if you get unlucky, but it IS fair, and it leads to a masterfully crafted combat system that feels incredibly orgasmic and satisfying when you get good at it. Admittedly it does fall into the button mashing issue that fighting games can fall into, but I find that trivial to nitpick on due to how much the combat gets done beautifully. The runs themselves will not take you much longer than 30-40 minutes if you're able to complete them, with 4 areas each with an ending boss fight; Boss fights offer the correct amount of challenge and variety for their area, and each feels unique and the aforementioned variety extends to how some of them have proper 'variations' where they're fights are different. I love this, as it can really helps alleviate that repetition that comes from fighting the same bosses over and over. Furthermore, beating the first run unlocks the Pack of Punishment; a Hades contract that will offer you the unique rewards again in exchange for adding additional difficulty modifiers to make things much harder on yourself. It's completely optional too, but it's damn tempting if you wanna test your skills and get more rare items much quicker than waiting for them to appear in the hub shop.

But since this is the Underworld, and it is brutal, you're going to die. A lot. But what makes Hades a star in this aspect too is how it uses each death. As you climb out of the River Styx each time, you will get to wander round the House of Hades and chat with each of the characters, each run giving you new lines of dialogue and the ability to gift rare items to each of them to start forming bonds. It kinda turns into an RPG style mini-game, because aside from talking with people, you can put in contract orders to customise Zag's bedroom, maintain the state of the court, and change the cosmetic appearance of the different areas. As you progress you will also get to add more additions to your upcoming runs to aid you, and with some other items in-game you can go into Zag's room and use the mirror to upgrade your base stats while also unlocking new ones to keep making Zagreus permanently stronger and more capable of getting further in each run. So with every death, you're still progressing, while also getting the opportunity to spend time in the house with the different characters as more information get drip fed to you. Plus, a couple of them you can romance with enough dedication, both male and female, and none of it feels forced in. It's a wonderful little bonus they didn't need to add. Not a bit add, but it's still a really welcomed one. 

I nearly forgot to talk about the soundtrack, so to end off on my favourite aspect, the music is fantastic. Every single track is a joy to listen to. From soothing melodies or quiet peaceful tracks to the bombastic sounds that blare during major combats and boss fights. Special shout out to the final boss...just look up ""The Unseen Ones"" if you're morbidly curious. It goes SO HARD.

It goes without saying: Hades is incredible and I love it to death, so it's hard to be super objective after all. So... so if you'd per-perhaps.... consider picking it u-up... if this sorta style of game is your jam.. then.. ugh...

First of all the Hades boss on its own is a good boss fight but in the context of the game is badly designed in terms of difficulty.  Throughout the game there was the odd difficulty spike which is welcome such as the first and third boss and the poison rooms before Hades but the Hades fight itself is about 10 times more difficult than anything else in the game.  This is poor balancing.
What comes after it is far worse.  Upon 'finishing' the game when you are sent back to the beginning I looked up how many times you would need to kill Hades to get an ending and was shocked (10 times).  I think what the developers have done is quite disgusting to dangle players on a string just to keep them playing.  It's probably the worst ending in terms of concept I've experienced since Mass Effect 3.  In fact I think it's worse than that.  I don't even want to watch the ending on YouTube as I feel I'd be paying the developers too much respect in watching their content, respect that they haven't paid me.  When I was playing the game I had plans to play it again on God and Hell mode (I was playing on normal) but such a deflating last 10% of the game has totally removed any desire to play it again and I don't think I'll be buying Hades 2 either.",1702236545,1707649514,False,3,0,0.477653622627258301,0,True,False,False

Thing to note, Zagrius is not actually a strong representation of the mythology he is based on so a lot of liberal narrative choices have been taken with this story.  But, it is good!  
The mechanics of the game are tied very well with the story and one clearing of the dungeon is not enough to mark the game as complete.  Despite having completed the story I do find myself coming back to the game which is more a testament to it's gameplay than it's story.
The biggest thing this game has going for it, despite my previous praise of gameplay, is it's characterization.  Every character feels like a person, not one dimensional and very responsive to your in game choices.  However, that is also a limiting factor as your in game choices do not impact the narrative.  You can unlock more of the scripted narrative but you cannot mold it.  This is not a strike against Hades, but more a forewarning for those of you who enjoy your decisions having an impact on the game.
I think the developers took a very careful and thoughtful approach to this game, and wanted both the story and gameplay to mesh.  I believe they have succeeded but I also believe there are things to be improved upon.  I think that given they are using an unestablished demi-god, of the underworld they could be a bit more liberal with their story, but they do choose some rather boring decisions for conflict and progression.
Most of the interesting dynamics writing wise are through side dialog.  
The mechanics of the game are fairly simple and get harder (or easier if you prefer) based on how you choose to start each run.  I find the weapon variety satisfactory, and the perks to be fairly diverse.  
If this is your first rogue-like game (Starting from the same starting point to progress towards the end with rng elements of upgrades) then this is a great stepping stone into this world.
If you are a Veteran of this genre, you may find it lacking in certain aspects, and if you are here for the story, while I will fully die by the sentiment the first 3/4 of the main story are gold.  I will aslo admit, the end of the story and many of it's resolutions are lacking and feel like an afterthought.
I would definitely recommend this game overall, but with caveats.",1707567087,1707567096,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Godly music by composer Darren Korb. He proved that perfection exists. 

And content that keeps going on after you think you've finished the game.

[u][b]TL,DR Review[/b][/u]

An exceedingly well-made rogue-like, Hades has everything that even some AAA games fail to deliver. Excellent voice acting/music, a really good story, and an addicting game-play loop. This is not a game you want to miss.

[u][b]Full Review[/b][/u]

Supergiant Games has created their best game yet with Hades, a isometric fast-paced hack-and-slash action game with an engaging rogue-like loop. You'll be playing as Zagreus, the immortal son of Hades and prince of the Underworld. Who is trying to escape to see the surface world despite the efforts of his father to stop him.

Combat entails entering chambers\combat arenas and facing off against different enemy types depending on what region you're in with a boss at the end of the region to face. You are given a reward with completing each chamber and this can vary from currency, added max health, gemstones or a boon from an Olympic god. The Olympic gods are distance relatives to Zagreus and their boons vary from alterations to your normal attack, special attack, dashes & more. What items you'll be able to carry over after each run allow you to upgrade passive stats like higher tier boon rate, health regained when exiting a chamber, & more. There's much more going on than what I'm outlining here but I'll leave that for you to experience yourself.

Outside of combat is where to story is where much of the story is fleshed out, with dialog with Cthonic gods like Nyx, Chronos, & Charon. You'll find that there is more going on with keeping Zagreus in the Underworld and may have some connection to his real parental origins..... The story here has been engaging throughout my time with this game and the writing so far has been very good. Voice acting is well done & the music is perfect for the setting, it doesn't falter at matching the combat in any point in a run. Visually it looks great with some amazing digital artwork that nails the look of the Greek Underworld.

There is so much to do & see in Hades, even in early access there was a ton of content to experience. I'm nearing 70 hours and there is still new dialog to hear with more to unlock as well. This is objectively one of the best rogue-likes out there and one of the best bang for your buck purchases that you can get. I'm not sure how Supergiant can top this with their next game but if it's in anyway as good as Hades, it'll be an instant success.

+ Lots of ways to customise the difficulty

- A little more boss variety would be nice
- Screen can get a bit cluttered with effects

The combat is extremely fluid, smooth and above all fun. It rewards skill, but also the power progression curve is very smooth, so you always feel like you are getting better. Every weapon feels different. Every run feels different with all the random upgrade.
Lots of dialogue and charming characters. The story is also quite compelling. 
Boss fights, while wuite fun could be a little more varied, but that's about the only complaint I could think for this game. Rouge-Likes like isaac have a bit more customisation and replayability, but Hades shines in combat gameplay and just charme. It's also quite pretty.

     It's a fun as hell rogue-like that somehow manages to pull off a progressive story over the course of... a lotta runs, gonna be honest. But the mechanic fits so well into the universe you almost look forward to each death. The characters are familiar spins on classical Greek myths and give the game so much spice it's like Arrakis out here. But the actual meat & potatoes, and what made this game the 2020 GOTY (Last of Us Part 2 won b/c it was controversial not a better game. [i] Come at me[/i]) is the buttery smooth combat and downright delicious soundtrack that blend eargasmically.

     You know that magical feeling in the newer DOOM's when the nightmare-synthmetal syncs up perfectly to your murder-ballet, and the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end as you feel your pupils dilating? Hades also conjures this same witchcraft. Only now you're unleashing divine fury gifted by the Greek Pantheon upon the tortured denizens of the underworld, whilst metallo-greek riffs get your blood boiling during every ascension. Honestly, I just want some DLC. I'd pay $20 for a $25 game's DLC, that's how blisteringly good this game is. Why are you still reading this, [b] BUY IT AND PLAY IT ALREADY! [/b]

Sure, it's still technically in Early Access, but it's almost completely done. The randomized boon system, keepsake system, and weapon upgrade system are interact amazingly with the main character's own dedicated levelup system, allowing progress to be made.

It's also quite hard. As a veteran roguelike and Binding of Isaac player, this game still beat the shit out of me.

This is Supergiant Games, so the dialogue and story are top notch. It's a little less then some of Supergiant's other titles, but it is also a roguelike - that said, they make the roguelike aspect make perfect sense, and Zag's snarky remarks and commentary are amazing in the interactions with everyone.

If you like Roguelikes, or Bastion, even Transistor, or just generally well crafted games, then this is well worth more then the full price. If there's a sale, grab it. If you hate fun, then good luck with that I guess.

PS - Megaera best waifu, accept no subsitutes.

Edit: Just a update, it's fully completed for a while, finally beat the main story, but has such good replayability I'm still playing it as one of my go to games.

It has several cool mechanics, and it presents them to you slowly, so it never becomes overwhelming. I won't talk much about the mechanics themselves because part of the fun is to learn them as the game progresses, but I will mention the one that blew my mind. You get to choose how the game gets more difficult. Not the usual enemies-become-damage-sponges-that-kill-you in-one-hit, which is the only way most games progress. You get to set what you find more fun to be your challenge. You want the tradidional way? Cool. You want something else? Deal. There are several options.

Another striking quality of this game is how balanced it is. There is no clearly weak weapon or god. All of them provide useful bonus and cool mechanics. Moreover, as the game progress, you get ways to slightly nudge the game randomness in the direction you prefer. These two factors (good balancing + a bit of control over the randomness) make this game much more enjoyable than most similar games where basically you keep praying that you don't get only crappy options to choose from. There's almost always something useful to work with. And if it's crappy, just sell it and buy something else.

Lastly, the final piece of brilliance is that the quests and achievements in this game are mostly directed to have you experience the different facets of the game. When a god give you his options, most of us (myself included) tend to always go for the same ones. But if you wanna complete the mission, you will have to at least once choose the options that seemed worse. And the beauty of this mechanic is that sometimes, when you choose the option that seemed worse, you get to see its advantages that were not clear to you beforehand.

Set in the richly mythological universe of the Greek gods, the game follows Zagreus, the son of Hades, as he attempts to escape from the underworld to reach Mount Olympus, seeking answers and assistance from his Olympian relatives. This review evaluates ""Hades"" based on its gameplay mechanics, story and character development, graphical and audio presentation, replayability, and overall entertainment value.

Gameplay Mechanics
Rating: 9/10 - Excellent
""Hades"" combines fast-paced, fluid combat with a deep arsenal of weapons, abilities, and power-ups, known as Boons, granted by the gods of Olympus. Each escape attempt from the ever-changing labyrinth of the Underworld is unique, thanks to the procedurally generated rooms and the variety of enemy types that challenge players to adapt their strategies. The game expertly balances difficulty and progression, ensuring that even after failure, players feel a sense of achievement and growth.

Story and Character Development
Rating: 10/10 - Masterpiece
The narrative of ""Hades"" is compelling and richly layered, exploring themes of family, rebellion, and fate through witty and poignant dialogue. Character development is a standout feature, with each run revealing more about Zagreus, his divine relatives, and the inhabitants of the underworld. The game's storytelling is dynamic, with characters reacting to player choices and successes, making the world of ""Hades"" feel alive and responsive.

Graphical and Audio Presentation
Rating: 9/10 - Excellent
Supergiant Games is known for its distinctive art style, and ""Hades"" is no exception. The game's visuals are stunning, featuring vibrant, hand-drawn characters and environments that bring the world of Greek mythology to life. The audio design, from the adrenaline-pumping soundtrack to the voice acting, is equally impressive, enhancing the game's atmosphere and immersing players in the action and drama of Zagreus's journey.

Replayability
Rating: 10/10 - Masterpiece
Replayability is one of ""Hades'"" strongest aspects. The rogue-like nature, combined with a vast array of weapons, Boons, and upgrades, ensures that no two runs are the same. The game's narrative unfolds across multiple attempts, encouraging players to keep trying not just for gameplay but to discover more of the story. Additionally, the introduction of post-completion content and challenges adds even more depth and longevity to the game.

Overall Entertainment Value
Rating: 9/10 - Excellent
""Hades"" offers an exceptional entertainment value, blending challenging gameplay, a compelling narrative, and beautiful presentation into a cohesive and addictive experience. It's a game that appeals to both fans of the rogue-like genre and those who might not typically enjoy its inherent difficulty, thanks to its engaging story and character-driven progression.

Overall Summary and Score
Overall Rating: 9.4/10 - Masterpiece
""Hades"" stands out as a masterful blend of action, storytelling, and artistic design, setting a new standard for rogue-like games. Its innovative approach to narrative integration within a genre known for repetition and difficulty makes it a landmark title that is both accessible and deeply rewarding.

A must-play game for fans of rogue-likes, mythology enthusiasts, and anyone looking for a richly narrative-driven game.

And then I played so much that my chronic tendonitis flared up again. And then I convinced another friend to buy it. And now we have a fourth friend convinced to try it too!

I highly recommend this game if you like the sound of an RPG with hack and slash combat taking place in roguelike instanced dungeons. No matter how much this game is simply marketed as a “roguelike”, it is more accurately a hybrid of genres. For the story, you have to beat the final boss 10 times, which I completed in about 50 hours. But it doesn’t end there! In post game, there is also a final story epilogue to unfold. After reaching the final story conclusion, you might still be in the process of befriending all NPCs, unlocking hidden versions of each weapon, achievement hunting, decorating your house, or challenging yourself by turning on the “Heat” to make it harder.

I would prefer to play with keyboard and mouse, especially for ranged weapons, but the apm requirement of this game is quite high. I pretty much had to switch to gamepad to avoid seriously injuring myself because I'm nuts. 

Hades is my personal Game of the Year because the final product is extremely polished: 

1. Art

The character portraits are gorgeous. From each NPC’s dynamic pose to wardrobe design to the color palette, the art is a visual treat. During the gameplay itself, the art is more simplified, almost cartoonish but stylized. The depiction of the underworld especially reminds me of Disney’s Hercules. The game is set from an isometric bird’s eye view, like Supergiant’s other works.   

2. Story

Simple story, good characters. If you have general knowledge of Greco-Roman mythology, you won’t predict exactly how the story ends up, but you won’t be too surprised by the plot. The same goes for the thematic concepts present in the game. Although I didn’t find the commentary on relationships, communication, family, and parenting mind blowing, each had its place. The impact was simple and effective without being proselytizing.

The NPCs are complex, and you get to know them better as you continue to interact with them and deepen Zagreus (Zag)’s relationships with them. The reactive dialogue pools are no joke. Over 125 hours in, and I am still receiving new lines and interactions directly building off on previous interactions. Some of Zag’s lines are long winded and come off fanfiction-y, but I can forgive them because the character interactions make me genuinely laugh, smile, or otherwise react. 

In comparison to most games, the Steam achievements and in-game goals for Hades are fairly easy to unlock if you simply put in the time. I honestly don’t set out to 100% games; it burns me out. Although I mainly knock out what I can along the way, I am surprised to see that I am close to 100% completion for Hades. The reason why I didn’t stop after completing the post-game epilogue is because the game is still unveiling new subplots based on my maxed out NPC relationships.

The only complaint I have in this area is Zag’s weird British accent. It sounds like someone pretending to be British and trying really hard to sound the elegant kind of British. Why is he even British? Hollywood usually associates ancient civilization with British accents, but not all NPCs in Hades have one. Skelly’s New York accent sounds oddly restrained too.

3. Gameplay

Although the chambers (instanced dungeons) have randomized rewards, enhancements, and minibosses, there are permanent combat-enhancing elements in the game. The first are Keepsakes, or items that you receive after having one level of affection with each NPC. Keepsakes can buff Zag’s stats or provide some other benefit for wearing it. Certain NPCs with maxed affection will gift you a Companion that you can summon a limited number of times for a benefit. Finally, the Mirror of Night in your room acts like a pseudo skill tree of sorts. The Talents (Mirror benefits) are permanent, but you can easily reset and respec the points to better match a build you want to try. 

Weapons are fairly balanced and each of them have a unique playstyle. Everyone has a different personal ranking for them because of how they like to use them. Dealing damage is split into 5 main categories: Attack, Special, Cast, Dash, and Call. These categories are enhanced by Boons given to you by gods that you encounter in chambers. Boons and other dungeon rewards are randomly generated. They can be influenced by Keepsakes and Mirror Talents.

Combat can be punishing like any roguelike. One seemingly innocuous decision can unravel your entire instance with snowball effects. The game is most difficult at the start when you have few Mirror Talents, and at post-game when you turn on a large number of Heats. You have to open your eyes and learn. Do the prophecies (in-game completion goals) to learn all possible Boon combinations and evolve your playstyle with each weapon. 

My gripe with the combat is that RNG can be frustratingly unfair, resulting in playing with the same builds repeatedly. Many of my attempts to create something new go downhill due to staunch RNG. For example, I once wore a Keepsake that was supposed to guarantee a god to show up. I went through two entire maps without seeing them! I gave up and either took the same old build or killed Zag off to reset the chamber reward permutations. I’ve also lost to the final boss because I couldn’t complete my build in time due to RNG. I know this isn’t unique to Hades, but most roguelikes do not give you the option to influence rewards in the first place. Thus, I expect it to be easier to accomplish with Hades.",1609727097,1706950151,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

At the start it was awkward and frustrating and I didn't get it, but I'd get a glimpse of something really fun when I'd dash through an enemy at just the right time. Getting enemy timings down, using dodge properly, etc. was rough. I didn't even realize at the time how bad my boon picks were. Then I beat the first boss, and on to struggling with the second area. Then I spent a lot of time banging my head against Theseus, but while I was stuck there spinning my wheels, I started spending time playing the dating sim that's embedded, and redecorating the palace. Then I beat Theseus and soon after [REDACTED] himself. Then it became a game about designing the perfect combo of weapon and boons to get me through the next heat level, and even some speed running. I ticked them up one level at a time for a while, before I realized I'd started growing faster than the difficulty and started jumping 5 or more levels per run. I've beaten the extra-double-final boss and seen the whole epilogue and gotten all the achievements. Nowadays, it's meditative. I can grab any weapon and casually tear through low-30's heat (except the sword. Still high-20's with that guy). If I want a challenge, I can dial up the heat 'til it's frustrating to deal with. And someday, maybe, even that will feel trivial.

All of that stuff felt impossible when I tried it the first time, and eventually I got to the point where blowing up Theseus's dumb chariot is practically a given. Sometimes it's frenetic and chaotic and other times it's sentimental and occasionally, it's very chill.

Also the soundtrack goes so fucking hard. Good Riddance and The Unseen Ones are both worth listening to on their own and somehow both fit in-context, even though one is a gentle duet about the perks of being dead and the other is a high-speed electric guitar smasher about [spoiler]beating your dad to death with your Fists[/spoiler].

This game experiments with the relationship between story and gameplay. The characters ""die"" but they don't forget what happened, so stuff that happened in past runs influences what characters talk about in future runs. The game actually executes on this very well. It never feels formulaic. It is often hilarious, like when Zagreus gives a boss a nickname and then that becomes its actual name, and again in future runs.

The only issue is, it quickly becomes very difficult to follow the story. It's not a complicated story. The problem is that as the story advances, the levels stay exactly the same (the only exception to this is the bosses, which get more powerful versions). In almost every other video game that has ever existed, story events are associated with specific levels, making them easier to remember. There is a good reason for this. We (human beings) remember things by association.

Don't take this as a criticism of the game. We need more experiments like this in video games. I also have no idea what Hades 2 is like.",1706764226,1706764226,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game's strongest aspects by far is the character design, dialog, and voice acting, creating a truly one of a kind experience, I still find myself listening to the dialog and interactions on youtube from time to time.
 I enjoy the combat, it definiately feels great, but it lacks the needed variation for a roguelite, and after exhausting all the dialog (which takes a remarkably long time), it does start to feel quite repetative. Heat is added in the game to solve this issue, and it does for a short period of time as some heat options are fun, while others are obviously artificial difficulty (Enemies do slightly more damage, slightly have more health, spawn a bit more in each room). Its in your hands to create an experience you find thrilling, which can add a few more hours for the game's enjoyment, or a few hundred hours depending on the type of gameplay you enjoy. 
 Overall, this game gives one of the strongest performances I've experienced with witty dialog, interesting characters, which strongly drive the gameplay loop forward for about 70 hours, but because if its strong dependence on characters rather than gameplay, it faulters after the interactions are all done, leaving the player without a strong reason to go back after they have experienced it all.",1623674428,1706697480,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story: They couldn't have handled the Greek mythology and the messed-up family dynamic that the Olympians have any better. I am normally the type of player to skip dialogue almost every chance I get but in this game? No chance. I played hours upon hours just to learn a little bit more about each character.

Gameplay: It has a gameplay loop that somehow manages to never get boring, even after hundreds of escape attempts thanks to the customization of each run. You can have thousands of different runs with different weapons, different boons, different mirror abilities and different keepsakes! You can also micro-manage games difficulty for your liking. The game has 10/10 replayability, I find this extremely hard for the Roguelike genre.

Graphics: All of the characters look tasty. Amazing art style that has inspired me as an artist. I have even studied the art style a little bit to improve myself. The character personalities are also top-notch; their dialogue never gets boring, even after your 100th escape attempt.

Music: It's simply godly (pun intended). The sounds are also tasty. That's all I have to say.

Hades, a masterpiece by Supergiant Games, seamlessly blends Greek mythology with enthralling gameplay, earning it a solid 9.8/10 from me.

The Good:
Soundtrack: Divine music elevates every moment, from atmospheric exploration to intense battles.
Story: Sharp writing and witty dialogue create a captivating narrative, delving into the complexities of the gods.
Replayability: Ever-changing chambers, diverse weapons, and unfolding storylines ensure each attempt feels unique.

The Bad:
Initial Story Pace: It takes time to fully appreciate the narrative; early runs may feel repetitive.

In conclusion, Hades is a must-play, offering a perfect blend of storytelling, sound design, and addictive gameplay, solidifying its place as a modern gaming classic.

I enjoy a ton of other roguelites, but I feel like the variety of builds in Hades is significantly lower than most and the lack of much procedural or variant layouts makes most runs feel strikingly similar. The lack of boss variety and differing paths to take also really hurt the experience of the game for me, as games like Dead Cells of Risk of Rain 1/2 provide incredible variety of paths to take and side areas to explore.

I can say one thing that absolutely differentiates this from other roguelites is the emphasis on the story of the game and the amount of progression between runs. The game takes advantage of the roguelike format to allow you to see all the characters in the story and see all of their own questslines and characters develop while playing the game over and over, which is honestly the game's strongest point for me. The story, writing, dialogue, and incomparably the art are just honestly incredible. It makes me sad the game just doesn't scratch the same roguelite itch for me, as the game encourages repeated runs by giving insane bonuses to you with enough invested currency. While many argue they aren't necessary, I think most would agree that you can't experience the game in full without all of the progression systems and difficulty settings. 

Understandably, most people still like the game and the progression systems. I share the love for the incredible art and VA in the game, but I personally couldn't get into the flow of the game despite my love of the genre already. If you enjoy the feeling of gaining permanent powers and progression in a more static world, you might like Hades. If you prefer variation in runs and branching paths with less permanent progression, then I can't say I recommend Hades, which saddens me.",1706413511,1706413511,False,1,0,0.47134438157081604,0,True,False,False

I've recently been coming back to it on Steam, starting from a fresh save, with the goal of finishing off the epilogue and other content I never got around to.

Somehow I got significantly more absorbed on this second playthrough, which is damn impressive considering how enamored I was to begin with.

The narrative presentation of this game is simply sublime. The voice acting is hands-down the best I've ever heard in a video game, ever. Dialogue is oozing with wit and charm while still leaving room for more somber moments. Character designs are gorgeous. The depiction of mythology is simultaneously a faithful homage and a creative new take.

In a genius move, this narrative is sprinkled throughout the gameplay loop as you keep coming back for more runs to gradually progress storylines and hear more dialogue. Of course, that gameplay loop is also sublime. You get six unique weapons, which each have 4 upgradeable variants to choose from, which then get further customized by random god blessings and hammers during a run. After a run, you get to take the resources you earned and funnel them into permanent upgrades, weapon unlocks, and decorations. Once you get good enough to where the game becomes easy, the modular difficulty system allows you to mix and match stipulations for harder runs to keep earning resources. Variety and replayability is insane. If I had one minor complaint, the endgame (like, about 60+ runs deep good lord) can feel a bit grindy; over-cranking the difficulty is a great challenge, but it's impractical since easier runs (while more tedious) also make it easier to keep gathering permanent resources.

Combat feels fantastic. Enemies are fair (with a few exceptions, particularly at higher difficulty levels) and hits are satisfying. With the weapon variety on offer, you're practically guaranteed to find favorites. And the right builds can take weapons I don't usually like and make them a lot more fun.

The story is also something incredible, in the sense that it doesn't take too much of your ingame time, but it's still sprinkled all throughout your playthrough to keep you engaged and guessing and always wanting to explore more and everything possible.

If you have any interest/doubts about this game or happen to be my friend: please, read this review.
It contains meme-tales of my personal experience + actual game info for you to see what you'll be dealing with.

At first glance at Hades -- I wasn't impressed. I didn't even understood why people like it. I miserably failed my 1st run and didn't think about coming back to the game, wasn't exactly my type of game. My pal, who introduced me to Hades, was very shocked by that fact and convinced me to try again. And so I did, after couple of weeks of consideration.
And then I fell in love with this gem of a game.

I've had 3 sessions of Hades obsession. After 1st break for couple of months and return to the game I was so fascinated and couldn't understand why did I stop playing, the game is a damn masterpiece. In couple of hours I remembered: my fingers and hands were hurting from smashing those buttons, I just couldn't physically continue at the time. :D
Good gamers with great reaction will not understand, but me, being pepega such as I am, I've panicked and pressed too many buttons to kill and survive. Took me a while but I've learned how to play it not like a guitar hero but to learn timings and positioning.

The game itself is very well made on each and every aspect:
[olist]
[*] [b]Story, dialogues and voice acting[/b] is on the next level. I have about 200-300 screenshots on my pc from this game and most of them just dialogues. They are witty, fun, wise. 
This game, if you read and listen, can show you and teach you a lot. Psychology have always been my hobby and it was cool to see how this game shows: at least 3 types of problematic relationships between children and parents(indifferent/abandonment, overcontrolling, cold+tyranic); about 3 to 5 examples of romantic relationships(friendly romantic, toxic tough love, kinky exploring type, etc); bunch of situations regarding different friends/aquitances, god-mortal, god-to-god, and ofc it has Cerberus, whom you can pet as many times as you like.
Your progression thru the game and progress with certain characters changes your interactions with them and their lines. 
You going to dislike some characters at first but will grow to love and respect them(avoiding spoilers) and this is a great experience.
If you are a fan of Greek Mythology, you're going to have a blast looking at all the interpretations of the appearances and characters of mythic creatures, gods, heroes and monsters etc. Every character, especially gods, are very well represented and have amazing and unique vibe. Sometimes the gods going to be pleased with you, sometimes they'll be angry and it's cool to see how they change in a matter of seconds, it all feels like they are real characters and they would say/act the way they do.
Trust me, there is much more to tell, but I'd love to avoid spoilers and the size of this review is getting out of hand.
[*] [b]Variability, weapons, god powers and staff.[/b]
The game has 6 weapons, each weapons has 4 aspects, each of them offer different playstyle and has different passives and bonuses, each of these aspects can be upgraded up to 5 times, this upgrade stays forever. And during the run, usually you stumble upon Dedal's Hammer, up to 2 times, which have number of upgrades for your weapon: these are staying only for the current run. They can change your gameplay drastically.
During your run/escape attempt, you going to get help from Olympian gods. Each god have number of unique powers and combinations with other gods. All this powers work differently with different weapons. Zeus is all about lighting, Poseidon all about crushing force of the waves, Artemis - crits and hunt and ofc we have Dionysus, who's all about the booze and hangover effects for your enemies :D
Variability is insane. You have to see for yourself. I have yet to try many cool builds.
[*] [b]RNG[/b] 
Hella annoying how it should be in any rogue-like: you think you know what build you going to get and you end up with half of what you wanted but it works. Sometimes your build becomes so strong you really feel like a god and think that this should be nerfed. Then you try to repeat the build and you realise it was very good run and ton of luck, probably won't happen again. Apreciate what you have and learn combinations and boons. In this game RNG will teach you new things, it'll teach you lessons, you'll appreciate it. RNG here isn't like unforgiving RNG in Darkest Dungeon, it's kind. But don't get fooled: it'll tease you and you'll have to respect it and be smart about your choices.
[*] [b]Difficulty.[/b]
If you're struggling or just want to go thru the story - game has God-Mod option in the menu. You'll be hella strong. Especialy after you die. Yes. Spoiler alert: you going to die. Nobody gets out alive. But I might be lying to you. Find out for yourself ;)
Games too easy..? No problemo, senior. Game has Pact of Punishment system -- you can up the difficulty yourself, you're choosing exactly what's going to get harder. Up to 64 levels of Punishment, I think. That's going to be insane, but it's possible. Examples of punishment: 1)+% number of enemies; 2)+dmg/hp to enemies; 3)enemies/bosses have additional abilities. And for each additional difficulty lvl you going to be rewarded ofc.
[*] [b]Progression[/b]
Well, during the run you have progression which mentioned above, but you also progress by collecting some resources during the run, which can help you make yourself stronger in the long run, you can change cosmetic aspects of the Underworld or use resources to help certain characters with their troubles. Oh, yes, sometimes you can fish as well to get more resources, it's pretty fun :D
[*] [b]Music.[/b] It's simply godly. Never gets old. You'll listen to it even outside of the game. Trust me, nothing to say here, enjoy it. Once again, work well done.
[*] [b]Imo art style/graphics[/b] of the game are one of the best there is. I think it's going to stand the test of time and will be amazing to look at whenever.
[*] [b]In game achievements[/b] and steam achievements will actually help you to experience this game to the fullest. It's more than possible to get them all. This is one of my most enjoyable 100% of the game. I really felt like I've done something cool, worthwhile and maybe even significant.
[*] [b]Game supports controller and keyboard.[/b]
I sticked with keyboard but sometimes thought that controller could be better. Don't stress it and pick what you enjoy.
[*] [b]Out of 10. [/b] c:
[/olist]

I think it's pretty cool that it took me exactly 100 escape attempts to 100% the game and by that moment I had 50% escape(win?) rate. But let it be known that I'm pretty bad at games like this and It took me a while to learn how to dodge stuff and git gud. Fun fact: I still repeat same mistakes, just less often. 
Also! I fully support price spike even tho it's a bit too much for me personaly to pay. But the game worth all the money they ask for it.
It was very fun to play it on my own and also very enjoyable to stream it and introduce people to this game or discuss with experienced players the story, builds and everything else.


I can't wait for the Hades 2 and I'll continue to play Hades.

It has interesting story with a unique spin on the Greek mythology, looking at them as one big dysfunctional family where everyone are way too good looking.

The roguelite mechanic is really polished and always pushes just ""one more run"" feeling while also heavily still relying on you getting better as a player, not just the loadout getting better. The fact that there is even a speedrun category for no death clears illustrates that very well.

Music is also superb - each level has it's own identity. Both through visual and audio medium.

But I must admit that after the initial ""honeymoon"" period I find that I struggle to choose Hades over other games I have installed. I guess because if I jump back in after a longer while, it will take a run or two to get back in the combat rhythm and start slaying.

Or maybe it's just my wrist pain, that unconsciously makes me choose games that doesn't require extensive attack button mashing.

Not to mention it took me about 80 hours of playing before I even heard any line that wasn't for the first time.  Massive content in that regard in this game.

The isometric camera angle can block the view of enemy attacks in certain areas which was probably the only thing I wasn't a fan of.  But that is minor.

My only complaint is how slow the endgame gets. The story starts at a good pace, gradually introducing all the characters. After that, it slows down considerably, with most players not even reaching the epilogue, as it takes many half-hour to hour-long runs just to advance two pieces of dialogue.

All in All the game seems well balanced. I did not need to turn on ""God mode"" which makes the game 20-80% easier, scaling the more you die.  (After 17 attempts it would have been 52% easier on the 20-80% easier God-mode Scale)  The game is not over, there's more story-line and more game-play, so after 30 hours I feel like I got a good amount out of the game, and could play it for another 200 hours to 100% or lets say 99% everything, but this feels like a good time to make a review.  The different ways to attack and the different modifiers do to things I like, you can pick how you want to play, and you it changes it up each time a bit too. Some of my play sessions were drastically different from others, and I found some things I like a lot better than others, but multiple ways have been really fun.   

THE MUSIC! I can't end my review without saying that the music is so good. There are only a few games I'd compare this music too that I've played in my life, Some of the Bethesda games like Skyrim, the Age of Empires / Age of Mythology series. The Hades team did an amazing job creating music for this game.  

The story is great, and certainly long enough, the gameplay is fun, just difficult enough, if you don't have this game, get this game.

As a player who has grown fond of rougelike games as I have discovered the genre, with other titles I've played including Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth and Enter the Gungeon, Hades has become one of my favorites. 

The story painting Zagreus as a rebellious teenager trying to run away from home and his overbearing father is a brilliant angle on the Greek mythos. The artwork for the characters and environments is stunning! The voice acting for all the characters makes them seem real and alive, making it easy for me to care about them, thus making an effort to jump back out the window to find Nectar and Ambrosia for them all the more worthwhile.

The sense of progression feels very natural. Fighting your way to the end boss of Tartarus feels like an uphill battle for the first handful of escape attempts, but collecting Darkness to acquire passive upgrades and learning each main weapon earns the player more power to take on the boss and navigate the higher floors a bit better on later attempts. Fighting the last boss is an insurmountable task the first time, but the adrenaline rush you get after defeating them the first time is exhilarating, and makes you want to come back to do it over and over again!

I would recommend this game to anyone who is learning to love rougelikes as I am and players who enjoy constant fast-paced action.",1705676496,1705676496,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For players like me who don't play this kind of genre very often, I thoroughly enjoyed it, especially since every run is unique in regards to the chambers, the boons you get, how you choose to play it, and how you choose to end your run. It has different difficulties and different playing styles, so a player can truly create a unique experience fro themselves and have fun trying to escape over and over again.

As a fan of Greek mythology, I really loved the characters and how they were portrayed, as well as the main and side stories. It was awesome to experience such touching moments, but also to laugh at some of the silliness from the dialogues. The voice acting, the art, the music, everything is just stunning.

You could talk about all the niche interactions that appear under very specific circumstances, as well as there being 21,020 voice lines! Even Charon, a character who literally just groans, has 120 unique voice lines. This game is the absolute peak of detail and content.

The dialogue is just one part of this indescribably massive game. So much depth, so much mechanical complexity, so charming, so many ways a run could go. Of course, that last aspect is common among all roguelikes, but where Hades shines is in it's story progression. Considering roguelikes forego story almost entirely, seeing Hades still have story progression even after death is extremely refreshing, and something I never seen before.

Despite my (as of time of writing) full DAY of playing this masterpiece, I had never had the same build, nor the same playstyle. I cannot stress enough the fact that I feel like I only scratched the surface of this game, and I seriously feel like 100 hours on this game is still not enough. This game is so intricate that it really feels like a living breathing world.

The devs made an indescribable amount of love, care, and passion, and crammed that into every single corner of this game. I would happily pay 100$ for this game just to support the devs alone while you couldn't pay me 100$ to play an average modern AAA title. I could go on and on, like how Zagreus is a perfect vessel to experience the game through, being hilarious, as well as always asking the same questions the player was having, but I think you get the point. Buy it. If you read this whole review, thank you, it means a lot.

This is not my go-to genre but it is a solid recommendation to any gamer.  I'm 44 and not the target demographic but the following really captivated my attention:

1. Story writing.  To have a story this engaging for this type of experience is not super common.  It's very well written, cheeky humour and overall very witty.

2. Acting is 10/10 and their voice work is better than most AAA studio's.  I forget who you visit around mid-game.  It's a female character that is cooking and offers a variety of power up options.  Her singing is truly mesmerizing and something you would hear on American Idol or playing in your home it's so relaxing and pleasant. 

3.  The Core as I touched on just before is truly 10/10.  

4.  Animation work is pretty flawless and all the effects, weapons and boons have their own unique personality.  

Overall, the fun factor is high and while it may not re-invent the genre, it sure does everything really well and it's a solid purchase on or off-sale.",1705634405,1705634405,True,1,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,False

At first, I didn't care about the lore, the characters in the lobby or anything about the story - I just wanted to go and play.
That slowly but surely changed, to the point where I found myself chilling in the lobby, talking to the NPC's and even decorating it! 

The gameplay is super satisfying - highly responsive, varied and very fun and rewarding. You will struggle at first, but you will notice that slowly but surely things starts *clicking*. Before you know it - what seemed to be an insurmountable challenge has become trivial. This is the result of very well tuned game design.

Special shout-out to the devs for the difficulty sliders that extend the game's shelf life after the first 'win'. The soundtrack is also just a major banger.

The discretization of difficulty in rogue-li(t/k)es is often coarse, but Hades has literally refined it to a very high degree of customizability. I highly recommend this game for those looking for a highly mechanical action-based rogue-like with a greater emphasis on movement and enemy attack avoidance rather than numbers games and economization. Hades does eventually play the numbers game once the player turns up difficulties that require the player to clear a run within a certain time and make enemies more difficult to face, but it cleverly does not force these things upon the player until they are ready.",1705557279,1705557279,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It should be mentioned that the story contains optional adult romances. The scenes are not explicit but are highly suggestive. With that being said, if the overall theme of the game isn't a problem then I personally find it doubtful any of the romances will be. 

The story itself really helps to give a good change of pace between runs. Although, one of the biggest chores is to get a particular npc, that I shall not name, to complete it's dialogue. I must have missed a suggestion to upgrade the lounge! The game has a 98% positive reviews for a reason and hopefully lightning will strike twice with the upcoming sequel, [i]Hades 2[/i]!

I've played this on the Nintendo Switch back a few years ago. I didn't like it. There was something that felt unsatisfying about the game, and after I got to the end a few times, I thought ""that's it?"". I didn't understand quite what people revered the game for.

Then I got into roguelites and roguelikes, I've gotten obsessed and binged on every single one that I could get my hands on. The last year, that's almost everything I've been playing.
Then I got back to Hades, give it another shot on the PC to learn why I didn't like it, because it has to be a problem with me and not the game somehow. So then I try my best to like the game as a roguelite.

But the thing is, you have to like the story. You have to get invested into the story and the characters. Feel for them, feel with them, listen to them. Because if you only play for the action, something is missing. And I swear, once I got invested in the story, all the action felt fulfilling.  There was meaning in getting to the end, over and over.

Not the greatest review.  This is only how I learned to love the action, and it was worth it. Personally, story-based games are games I mostly try staying away from. Maybe because I always think they won't be fun. But I'm always wrong. When I do get into a story-based game, I really get into it, and those games are ultimately the ones I remember and love the most.",1705493339,1705493339,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

The Combat covers a wide variety of playstyles with it's roster of weapons, boons and abilities. Crafting the best builds for the different weapons was the part of the game I had the most fun with.

The Story is interesting and keeps you wanting to do more runs, however once beating the ""main"" story, it can be difficult to get the side character plots to progress sometimes resulting, in some side stories taking a long time to complete due to pure random chance.

Hades, performs very well on high end computers and would run decently on most modern computers, my very not gaming laptop can run it with ease.

Overall, a great game to pick up as I believe anyone could complete it, though the 100% experience can get tedious really quickly.",1705430310,1705430417,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplay is amazing, plenty of different styles you that can play and fit your taste, with decent amount of boon choices (power ups).
Game encourages you to get our your comfort build and try other weapons and for that it rewards you, which is great, I had so much fun experimenting and trying to make shit work, and this brings me to the 

games biggest problem, the length and variety, you go through same 4 regions and basically same bosses over and over again, no different paths to take and not much enemy variety. It's not balanced to pair the wapon/power up system. (pact of punishment does not count by any means, it just adds perks, does not change enemies.)

Also, if you're 100%-ing, it gets grindy, for same reason.

Its engaging, has a great story you tease out over multiple runs, great gameplay that doesn’t punish you unnecessarily and an amazing soundtrack and vocals. I can’t recommend this game enough, if you haven’t played it you should. 

[B]Story[/B]
You play as Prince Zagreus, son of the god Hades who is desperate to escape his father Hades, and his infernal realm. After the gods of Mt Olympus become aware of your existence they make contact with you, and offer boons in order to help you in your efforts to escape. Each run has different gods contact you and bestow different blessings, and slowly introduces a wider range of side characters you can interact with and explore their stories as you get closer to the surface and escaping. After my first escape (after many failed attempts) I thought it was a great story, only to find out that it’s really only the beginning of the story and as you complete more runs and converse with the NPC’s you expose all the secrets that gods have been keeping and start escaping to help avert a war between the entire pantheon.  Most of the creature and locations lore entries are expanded by visiting or encountering them enough times, however NPC’s need gifts after a set amount of visits.

[B]Gameplay[/B]
The gameplay while not being unique, is extremely rewarding. Essentially you start off in Hades palace where all the dead arrive, where you can converse with NPC’s (which moves their stories forward one conversation at a time), get scolded from Hades for being useless, trade items for rewards, spend money to upgrade the Palace and edit the weapons, perks and difficulty of the next escape attempt before setting off.

While every escape attempt is different, the premise is the same, with you having the clear 3 layers of the underworld and the temple of Styx you have to trek through, defeat their guardians and inhabitants who are being ordered by Hades to stop you. It’s a neat idea that by “killing” the inhabitants you are meting out the punishment they deserve, and that by stopping you they are ensuring the security of the realm (no dead souls have ever escaped), or in the Satyrs case killing the heathens who defile the temple of Styx and don’t venerate the gods.  
 
Everything useful to you during a run is lost upon escaping (or death), and it becomes a balancing act of deciding picking boons that help you in the current escape attempt, or items (gems, darkness, gifts) that will be used for future upgrades or conversations with the NPC’s and various gods. 

Replayability is very high and hasn’t just been tacked on as an afterthought as the whole story revolves around completing multiple escapes. The game actively encourages you to increase the difficulty (after a successful escape attempt) by limiting the items required for permanent weapon upgrades and different weapon aspects (each weapon has multiple forms that all change how they function) to only be awarded by each boss once at each difficulty level. When making runs harder you have full control over what setting you increase (it could be extra enemies, standard enemies have abilities, harder bosses, you lose boons as you progress ect), and you eventually get to a point where you need to have multiple of these selected. The game also keeps a record of the highest difficulty you have escaped with for each weapon, and the fastest attempt for those who limit to compete.

Each of the god’s boons can affect your primary moves in different ways (dash’s, attacks, magic casts, dodges and summons), and have different effects depending on which other boons are selected or what weapon is being used. Each of the boons have different tiers and levels, with a higher tier boon having better effects (say increase in damage %) over a lower but higher level boon. The Gods (while sounding friendly) are jealous and can offer to replace an existing rival’s boon with a higher tier one, or very rarely combine boons together so you get unique abilities that combine the best of both gods.

[B]Graphics[/B]
For a game that’s essentially a display on family dysfunction the graphics are crisp and colourful in a way that cel shading exploits. Each arena has an abundance of hues that help define each layer of the underworld, with Tartarus having a darker dungeon setting, Asphodel being the traditional hell of bubbling lava and Elysium having softer blues and greens where the righteous live in dead. As the relationships expand you can tweak the house with different upgrades
Characters and enemies are all animated extremely well (enemies have tells to advise you of their attacks), and secrets are hidden in plain sight in the fishing games. The UI is minimalist so it doesn’t interfere with the action happening on screen, and each character really stands out. Traps aren’t hidden, though will catch you unaware if you don’t pay attention and the action can be quite hectic. The De-motivationals that usually play at the start of each run are hilarious (basically Hades musings on how you will fail, or why everything sucks).

[B]Music[/B]
The vocals and music are amazing. They absolutely nailed the soundtrack for the game, with plenty of string and percussion tracks that align with the action happening on screen, with the more sombre music or tracks with vocals playing in resting areas or after certain events. The vocals are also amazing, with the dialogue between Hades & Zagreus being a standout. Hades put-downs are quite humorous to listen to (of you, when you change items around the palace and when he’s berating having useless minions or those in his court who displease him).

[B]Achievements[/B]
Getting 100% achievements will take multiple runs through the game due to the random nature of stage rewards and conversations, but is highly worth it and nothing too strenuous, though time consuming

Gameplay - 9/10

The gameplay is pretty astonishing, and stayed fun for many many hours. There are several abilities which can each be used in different ways, with several weapons that handle completely differently, as well as several upgrades you can get for each weapon that can completely change how they are played, as well as boons that will affect how you can use your abilities as well as duo and legendary boons that can change them even further. There are SO MANY potential builds you can have that you will struggle to find guides, as you almost always end up with a different build each time. The game has a lot of RNG features and while the game does provide many ways to circumvent this and put control back into your hands, sometimes you just screwed over and don't get the legendary or duo boons you wanted because they just weren't offered to you. However, the game is very fair and even if you have basically nothing it is definitely still possible to win and it can feel great when you do despite having a crappy build.
The pact of punishment adds another layer of difficulty, letting you customise how you play the game and how you increase the difficulty in your own way. The game has a system as well that encourages you to seek out and use upgrades/boons you haven't tried before instead of locking yourself down to the same weapon/boon/upgrade. [spoiler]Unfortunately, after the first few clears the game does slowly start to feel less and less rewarding, especially when you finish the game as there is no story incentive and before that when there is story incentive dying at the very end of a run acts as a blockage to reaching story you want to have. It can be frustrating. They try to prevent this feeling by having lots of other progression systems, but it still feels like a punch in the gut when I value the story over all of them.[/spoiler]


Story, World and Characters 8.7/10

At first the story amazed me. Roguelites typically don't have stories so to find a game not only flowing with story but also fully voiced, it was incredible. The characters are so good too. Hades, probably my favourite character, is great. An intimidating and powerful ruler constantly belittiling you. Over time you can give Nectar to characters, and they will start treating you with more respect. There are so many dialogue options that even after 10s of hours I was still finding new dialogue. However, over time the story slowly gets spread further and further out. You have to wait longer and longer between dialogue that progresses the story, since the game seems to prioritise random jokes and yapping from characters than important dialogue you want to trigger. There is a reason why less than 10% of players have completed the epilogue, and that is because it takes so long to fulfill the long list of criteria to activate it. I remember I went to Hermes several times with the requirements needed for the 
dialogue that progresses the story to activate and the guy just wouldn't say what I wanted. When one of the best ways to progress the story is by continuously dying at the start of the game to trigger new dialogue options, the game starts to get tedious when you play through full runs like I do. At around the 50 hour mark I got fed up, and no longer cared about earning the game's story opting instead to watch the game's final ending online. This wouldn't be an issue if I didn't play with the incentive of finishing the story as I often do in games. If you decide to play this game definitely but the story on the back burner and only be there for the gameplay. The best way to play is by letting the story play out in the background as you play it, rather than play to complete the story. Overall, the story is decent especially for a roguelite. However, due to how the game is made and how progress is achieved it would have been extremely difficult to get a story as good as you can find in a dedicated-story game.


Graphics and Audio 9.3/10

The game looks great, with thousands of hand-drawn graphics and animations. The main problem is that sometimes there is so much visual clutter that I can't actually see what I am supposed to be doing. Sometimes because of this I felt myself almost ""button-mashing"" especially in the River of Styx sections when there are lots of small rats. The music rocks, with tens of in-game poems that you can buy and listen to. The fact that all the dialogue is fully voiced is amazing as well.


Replayability, Value for Money and Extra Content 10/10

The game is designed to have hundreds of hours of replayability. With an insane amount of extra side content and variety between runs, I can see how you could easily get hundreds of hours in the game and not get bored.


Innovation, Impact and Technical Execution - 9.7/10

The game innovates on the roguelite genre massively, and has greated a major impact in the gaming landscape. This game will have a major impact on all future roguelikes and roguelites. I very rarely encountered any bugs or issues, both on PC and Xbox. The only issue is that if the game crashes, or your PC crashes, or your power cuts, then the game treats it like a ""Give Up"" and sends you back to the start of the run, which happened to me multiple times while playing. This was probably on purpose to prevent cheating from save-scumming, but since this is a solo game it detracts from the game instead. The game feels great to handle, both on controller and on K+M.


Overall - 93/100 - There Is No Escape...

An incredibly experience, that was a blast but went out as a fizzle. With an amazing replayable game, as long as you don't play to finish the story and just play to enjoy the game you will have an incredible time. Truly an exceptional game...

A beautiful art style, a banging soundtrack, a story with complex characters well-drawn. A truly great story is always about now, and though its characters may be pulled from Hesiod and Homer, it tells a modern tale of family, fate, and finding purpose in a futile struggle.

As you battle the wretches of the underworld in top-down isometric hack-and-slash style, striving to escape your grim and harsh father, the god of the dead, you are presented with a variety of boons from the gods of Olympus. These are modifiers that change your abilities or boost your stats, all themed to the various gods. These can take the form of; the chain lightning of Zeus,the surging knockback effects of Poseidon, or the poison DOT effect of Dionysus.  These In combination with 6 different weapons, all of which have 4 different aspects, leads to a huge variety in build composition and approach. Sometimes you'll struggle; other times, you either, through luck or strategic planning, feel it all click together as you send the assembled minions of the underworld to an even deeper part of hell.

The real secret sauce is the synthesis of narrative and gameplay; there's no Ludo-narrative dissonance here. Your struggles as a player mirror the struggles of the Prince as a character, and thanks to an astonishing amount of excellently voice-acted dialogue, failure stops feeling like an end state and becomes just another part of the journey as you are greeted by unique interactions with the characters that populate the House of Hades each time you return.

""One must imagine Sisyphus happy,"" well, no imagination is needed here. You'll see the grin on your own Sisyphean face reflected on your screen as you toil endlessly against the legions of the underworld only to end up back where you started, promising yourself ""Just one more run.""",1704696933,1705124874,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also, the most beautiful game to play, ever. Stunning graphics and art design, consistent all the way through, with gorgeous character design and so many lovely settings. The soundtrack is often haunting and soothing at the same time, then seamlessly bursts into an invigorating fight sequence. It's easy to get lost in just the glamour of the game's aesthetics.

Finally, it's also an incredibly attentively researched storyline, incorporating mythological characters and stories in a delightfully unique retelling. You'll see mainstream gods alongside some of the lesser known figures, each with their own personalities and bonuses to offer.

The dialogue: Always different from the last coming in with my 140hrs of gameplay completionist playthrough; there wasn't one that was mentioned twice.

So why the thumbs down?
The gameplay loop can be repetitive and downright tedious.
If you arent good enough to beat the game by your 2nd or 3rd try you are subjected to playing 40minute loops just to get 50 out of the 500 <input currency> you need for an upgrade to make you stronger, and hopefully carry your a bit further. Unfortunately getting a little bit further doesnt really mean anything. Getting to the next boss probably means you are getting 5% more currency. 

Whats worse is that the bosses pretty much turn into damage sponges that fill up the screen with AoE, which will have you spamming your dash button.

The ending is unique and downright wholesome..until its completely ruined by the fact you have the beat the game 5+ times to get the full ending. Endings 2-4 just have you going back and forth passing notes along. Basically meaning that a 5 minute ending is expanded by having you play 10 more hours. 

If you are one of those individuals that accidentally made it to the last boss your first time you played, this probably doesnt apply to you. But if you are player that needed meta upgrades to progress, it can be joyless adventure.",1704816262,1704816262,False,6,0,0.487499743700027466,0,True,False,False

The story is simple yet heartwarming. You're basically the relationship therapist for the entire Greek mythology family. It's a lot of grinding to get these characters back together and I feel like it is very worth it.

The gameplay is simple to learn, but can be hard to master if you really want to get down to the tiny details. You get a variety of weapons to choose from and honestly you only just need to use the one you enjoy the most if all you care about is the story. You will die quite a lot at the beginning and like all rouge-likes, the RNG you get can make or break your run, this is especially true in the early game or late game pact of punishment. I remembered my 3rd or 4th escape attempt I got such good RNG that I managed to reach the final boss before eventually dying. But no run is wasted as you will be grinding out currencies to upgrade your talent tree and make your future runs easier. Each run you do will always be different which makes things feel fresh. I enjoy the fact that anyone of any skill level can play and finish this game. Of course, the game rewards skill by rewarding harder clears and you can reach goals faster but for the most part, if you're a casual player, you can still finish the epilogue with no issues. The pact of punishment is unlocked after your first clear but is completely optional if difficulty is not something you are interested in.

The characters are very well written. There are so many dialogues that each character can say to you depending on your save file. (for example I didn't know that Hermes will comment on how you broke your clear streak until I broke my 15 clear streak T_T) Small details like this is what makes this game charming. I enjoy how it feels like the characters are reacting to what or how you're doing, feels lively. 

There is a lot of replayablity in this game. Once you complete your first escape, you have to do it 10 more times to get the ending. Then you have to grind even more times to get the true ending. The game doesnt stop once you get the ending. There is just so much to do.

I originally bought this game because of the art style. I never played any rouge-likes before so I had nothing to judge it on. But after playing so much, I started liking rouge-likes more so I expanded my library. I now play more rouge-likes but at the back of my mind, I will always judge it against Hades. The art is amazing, great colour theory, great lining style, reminds me of comic books a little... The music is so hyped. It's a mix of metal music for some of the boss fights. I listen to the soundtrack in my day top day life to hype myself up.

TL;DR:
Art 10/10
Music 10/10
Game Feel 10/10
Overall 10/10

The drawback and the reason I don't recommend is the game is that it's too balanced(hear me out)  because you are limited from a lot of content and upgrades early on and getting them unlocked is quite the time investment and as you progress you have to raise the difficulty to keep that progression and never feel like you are getting anywhere.  I put in a ton of hours on console and recently re downloaded to steam to get back into it starting from scratch and it's rough. 

The only way to be successful out the gate is to play like it's a dark souls and be extremely defensive which isn't the optimal way to grind out the materials for the good upgrades so it's counter intuitive. You end up not playing to win but just grind for materials. What makes it tough early on? the builds are very balanced... too balanced, so much so getting the rouguelike OP god build is near impossible, when you do find a good combo they require the boons/upgrades to be very high LVL AND high rarity to progress. Higher rarity is very similar to being higher lvl but you can get higher rarity only from RNG(and one other way with limited use) while the levels require specific drops and you start at lvl 1 no matter what. You can improve your RNG but only after purchasing the right upgrades.

In addition a lot of abilities don't stack like you would want them too likely due to balance. Example you can unlock an upgrade that turns your basic attack into projectiles AND get a boon that turns your basic attack into chain lightning on hit. one might think now the projectiles from the attack also count and create lightning on each hit but they don't only the initial attack(the initial swing in melee range) will proc this sadly. They have no interaction and this come sup a lot in this game. Hoping the next installment will let things get a little more out of hand with the right luck and play into the rogue like fantasy. After all even the most OP run must come to an end.",1704768776,1704768776,False,2,0,0.479094088077545166,0,True,False,False

---Pros---
Artwork, Music

---Cons---
-Game Progression: The game is desperately trying to keep you in the loop with new encounters. Once the new additions to the game are done, you have to repeat hours and hours of randomized runs for a small piece of the story. By design you progress by dying and are rewarded for dying.
-Story: The story is literally copy pasted from greek mythology, so its only interesting if you were dozing off in history class. Other than that, due to the story itself and the writers portraying it in a twisted way, most of the dialogues (90%+) are filled with hatred against your character aimed to annoy, berate and drag you through the mud as much as possible. Instead of being stoic and focused on the actions of the characters with less words, its just a twitter drama comment section.
-Game Design: You have 3 specific win conditions in the form of powers from gods. If you are unable to get any of those 3 specific powers by the half point of the game, it's better to kill your character and not waste any more time. (Note: you lose all achievements and progress you've made during the run for pressing the ""give up"" button in the menu). By the half point of the game you probably picked up some powers from other gods and by game design you are more likely to get powers from them, instead of a new god. There's no point in trying for another 10-15 minutes only to have no chance of ""winning"". You could start a new run and be back to where you were with better RNG.
-Long combat animations/input lag: both of them combined lead to a frustrating and clunky gameplay that are outperformed by classics made in the early 2000s or even some NS games 40 years back..
-Combat: You have to aim and dodge the shadows on the ground 50-100pixels below the enemies/projectiles. Your character has full hitbox together with its shadow, but the enemies (even bosses) have a tiny small circle below them for hitting no matter how large they are.
-Dodging: You have to dodge the enemy's ""charged attack"" animation where they ""slowly"" become completely white before attacking, instead of actually dodging its attack. If the enemy charged up their attack and you are in the way, you are 100% getting damaged. There are no iframe dodges, no immunity, if your character hitbox is in the way of an attack, you get hit. There's no last moment dodge.",1704736980,1704736980,False,4,1,0.462382614612579346,0,True,False,False

The story is somewhat interesting and the character voicelines are pretty good. The gameplay is simplistic but fun for what it is. Early on the game shows its very grindy nature though expecting you to constantly go through the same sections over and over in the attempt to beat it while your character somewhat slowly becomes stronger from certain buffs.

Once you beat the game for the first time and the advanced options show up is when it completely falls apart for me as Hades literally forces an awful grind on you if you want to continue. After escaping the underworld for the first time the game unlocks a heat mechanic which provides additional difficulties and rewards. Unfortunately all of the rewards are always weapon and difficulty specific. That means you have to complete the game at least 6 times on the first difficulty to unlock the rewards for all weapons. Then you have to repeat it for heat 1, heat 2 and so on. Every run can take over an hour. So you can see how Hades pads its gametime through an endless grind while trying to hide it somewhat bethind story bits and pieces after each run through character interactions in the house.

The story is not that exciting to successfully masquerade the grind for me though and Hades became just a tedious bore for me when the patterns became clear.",1704650541,1704650541,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Along with it's action, it has a very interesting story with really good dialogue and voice acting. Before each run, you can purchase permanent upgrades using items which make your run a little easier and make you feel a sense of progress but at the same time having everything maxed out still keeps you on edge because of how unique each run is. Not only does it randomize maps but it also introduces new enemies or patterns as you progress. I like the diversity of weapons to choose from as it allows you to choose according to your play style and your preference for boons. There is a huge possibility of builds you can create in this game. The only drawback I would say is the fact that the boss fights aren't the most memorable.

It's a very tightly design game, enemies are tough but fair, everything is very readable and demands just enough of your reflexes to keep you engaged, decision making is fairly important, and in between zones they brake down the themes explored with an appropriate boss battle. Just all around a fantastic game, must play if you are into rogue-likes/lites.

( !!! Minor Spoiler ahead, I talk about characters appearing in the ending); Edit after beating the game and watching the credits roll, the game culminates in a very powerful note, with some of the best hard hitting dialog lines shared between the King, Queen and Prince of darkness after a beautiful and enchanting song, the endgame explanation of letting you keep trying to brake free from the underworld is quite appealing and smart, and they give you total freedom + even more voice acted character dialog, i seriously cannot get enough of this game. I cannot wait to see what mythologies and gameplay mechanics will be explored in Hades II, since there is some room for more weapons and perks to be designed.

I'll end my review by saying that Super Giant Games was not on my radar before even after hearing about Bastion and other cool games they did, but they defensively hooked me right in, they seem to be a bunch of very talented and creative people who actually care about their creations, and I appreciate that.

Don't trust the tags. Hades isn't actually a roguelike game. It has immense number of upgrades in-between runs that turn the game from almost unbeatable on the first run to braindead beatable every single run. The game becomes so easy that you need to make runs more difficult with Heat mechanics. Beating the game on higher heat gives you further rewards that allows to get even more upgrades.

I respect the idea of managing game's difficulty on your own, but due to the facts that runs are rather short, in-between runs upgrades provide shit ton of value, and lack of actual combat content (~25 enemies & 4(5) bosses) this game is just not for me.

If you are unlucky and get only shitty boons from the beginning there is no way you sell your boons and get something better further in the game. R in RNG is not that random, as there is no chance to get a strong build if the game doesn't want you to have it. If you get shitty boons from the beginning you will get them all the way until you die. So if you don't have a decent build before the first boss just die and start from scratch.
If you have 3 resurrections left, go to shop and 2 out of 3 items replenish one resurrection. Why TF do i need it if resurrections are full? If you have 0 resurrections, you won't get a resurrection replenishing item in a lifetime.

No tutorial AT ALL. You see a chest with some currency? Open it and you will be attacked by a wave of mobs. You had 10HP when opened it? oopsie you should've known that opening the chest starts another fight for some shitty currency you can get anyway. You encountered the currency for the first time and have no idea what it is for? your problem.

""Story"" and ""quests"" are a fking joke. You need to go to every NPC dozens of time just to listen absolutely irrelevant gibberish from each of them. Talked to an NPC? you will have to do it again next time you die.

2 more things. I play this on the Switch and on my ROG Ally. Both handle this amazingly well. Plus the time I spent on it is more than 100 hours.

Poseidon has knock back, Artemis has crit chance, ect. you could play this game a  thousand time and never get the same build twice.s (Warning spoilers ahead.) If your starting to get bored by how easy the game use the pact of punishment to have 15+ different ways to get harder. And even after all that you think that the game does not have enough weapons you would be wrong. after enough runs and meeting certain requirements you unlock 2 new ways to play that weapon. All of the new weapon types you unlock all feel new and refreshing. Then after more time you can unlock a new secret form for the weapons.

There is a wide range of variety that keeps each run fresh: weapon types, of which there are 24; daedalus hammer upgrades that change the way weapons function; boons that add abilities, both active and passive, have different rarity levels, and they can interact with each other, which unlocks duo boons; artifacts that add bonuses to various things like increased boon rarity, additional HP, stronger attacks in certain situations, etc; mirror of night upgrades, which do things like give you additional dashes and casts, or change the way death defiance (a limited number of 'extra lives' before you die and start over) acts; my last example, the pact of punishment, or heat level, which can be used to add different types of difficulty to a run.

Then, we get to the story, which has plenty of depth, can advance relationships with many of the characters, and unlocks active ability trinkets gifted by advancing some of those relationships.

I'm 140 hours in and I haven't explored the entire game. Sometimes I just get caught up in figuring out new ways to make a specific weapon capable of a beat down. I put just as many hours into playing on the steam deck as I have on my PC. Game play is flawless either way.

The unique artstyle, amazing character designs, fluid gameplay and astounding soundtrack really fuse into something really fantastic. I felt immediately immersed into the experience and seein what Zagreus was goin through. On top of that all the special interactions between the gods & other characters is really fun and intresting. One of my main concerns though for the gameplay which is one I know from many rougelikes is repetitiveness. I personally do not mind gameplay loops but others do find it a bit boresom. From playing i've seen their are so many different combinations of weapons, boons, weapon upgrades and keepsakes that really shift up how you play. It truly is a great experience doing one run with a sword focused on raw damage & lifesteal, to goin to a spear zipping around with lightning strikes.

A few years ago, one of my friends, who is much more of a gamer than I am, was telling me about some games he wanted to try and Hades was one of them. After that conversation, I immediately went onto the Nintendo store from my Switch and purchased the game. After first run through, my skepticism melted faster than an ice cube on an Arizona sidewalk. I have 150+ hours logged on the Switch version and I can confidently say this was one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.

The fast paced game play is buttery smooth and only get's better as Zagreus becomes stronger.

So Hades is great if you like rng and fun combat, but for me.. something clicked and i dont like this genre anymore. no offense to people, i just cant take it anymore.

One thing that pissed me off alot which might actually be the reason I quit, is that you have to talk to npcs and interact. You can skip alot, but its really frustrating when you lost a good run and need to watch a slow death scene and zip past everything mashing dodge to restart. I would have loved if there was a simple retry and go from the start right away. I dont care for the story at all, and it sucks having to listen to it sometimes when you get pissed at losing a run. Its like a slap in the face and you have to suffer this right after.

Claramente inspirado na cultura grega, Hades traz personagens icônicos que marcam muito por conta das suas diferentes personalidades e poderes, que incrivelmente podem ser combinados, e essas combinações podem ser a chave do sucesso da sua jogatina

Ingredients
Cake:

2 ⅛ cups all-purpose flour

2 cups white sugar

¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder

1 ½ teaspoons baking powder

¾ teaspoon baking soda

¾ teaspoon salt

3 eggs

1 cup milk

½ cup vegetable oil

1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Topping:

2 (20 ounce) cans pitted sour cherries

1 cup white sugar

¼ cup cornstarch

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Frosting:

3 cups heavy whipping cream

⅓ cup confectioners' sugar

Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans; line bottoms with parchment paper. Place a medium bowl in the refrigerator to chill.

Whisk flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla; beat until combined. Pour cake batter into the prepared pans.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool layers in pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. Run a paring knife around edges to loosen and invert carefully onto racks to cool completely, 1 to 2 hours.

While cake layers bake, drain cherries for topping, reserving 1/2 cup juice. Combine reserved juice, cherries, sugar, and cornstarch in a 2-quart saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly, over low heat until thickened. Stir in vanilla. Let cool at room temperature for 30 minutes. Transfer to the refrigerator to cool completely before assembling cake.

Combine whipping cream and confectioners' sugar for frosting in the chilled medium bowl. Beat with an electric mixer at high speed until stiff peaks form.

Split each cake layer in half horizontally using a long serrated knife. Tear one layer into crumbs; set aside. Gently brush loose crumbs off top and sides of remaining layers using a pastry brush or your hands. Reserve 1 1/2 cups frosting for piping decorations on cake; set aside.

To assemble, place one cake layer on a cake plate. Spread with 1 cup frosting; top with 3/4 cup cherry topping. Top with second cake layer; repeat layers of frosting and cherry topping. Top with third cake layer and frost sides of cake.

Pat reserved cake crumbs onto sides of cake. Spoon reserved 1 1/2 cups frosting into a pastry bag fitted with a star decorator tip. Pipe around top and bottom edges of cake. Spoon remaining cherry topping on top of cake.

Store covered in the refrigerator until ready to serve.",1704110468,1704110468,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat is awesome and the huge combination of god-boons and weapon upgrades makes for a great deal of versatility. The story is cool, and the way they made it to where everytime you die it advances it and provides you with a small permanent upgrade gives you just enough reason to keep going. My favorite game in a while honesty! 81 attempts, 20 wins so far, and the story is still going and I have enough weapon builds unlocked, the fun hasn't stopped for me yet. 

The only negative thing is that, it is a rogue like, so its random, and you can go thru an entire attempt waiting for a boon that's key to your build and just not get it :(

Nearly everything about this game radiates quality. The story is very entertaining and emotionally compelling, and the narrative is in perfect congruence with the gameplay. The voice acting is on par with my favorite RPGS, with so many unique lines of dialogue that I only stopped hearing new ones after well over 150 hours on a single save file. The artwork is fantastic, especially shining in the enemy designs and weapon movesets. Portraits ooze the personality of the character speaking, and I can't think of one I thought was lazy or a poor fit for the character. The music is great, I think the final boss music is the best example of how much the music adds to the game. The twangs at the beginning begin to invoke anticipation rather than nervousness, and whenever the theme comes on in my playlist I get a shiver that is only matched by Wake Up Mr. West transitioning into Heard 'Em Say. And when you've mastered the fight, the Extreme Measures version of the song jarringly ramps up, perfectly coinciding with a panic the player is almost certainly succumbing to. But thats all fluff at the end of the day, as most of my time with the game was spent doing repeated runs with 10 aspects listening to Destiny debates or blasting my own music, and those are my favorite memories of the game. 
The reasons I kept playing for several hundred hours after acquiring the platinum trophy were the genius Heat system, the variety and flexibility of builds, and the fundamentally excellent mechanics. The heat system is a collection of difficulty modifiers that unlock after clearing the first run, which range from basic stat modifications (take more damage, face more enemies, enemies move and attack faster, etc), to adding a time limit to every zone, to giving every boss more health and a majorly enhanced moveset (and dialogue). Each modifier has a Heat value, granting more resources when escaping at higher and higher Heat ranks. There are also 3 trophies you walk past before starting a run, each being unveiled at 8, 16 and 32 heat respectively. Most difficulty modifiers are manageable on their own even when maxed out (except routine inspection), mixing them to reach 32 heat can become unbearable though. So far I have cleared 32 heat with all 4 aspects of the Bow, 2 aspects of the Shield, 2 aspects of the Adamant Rail, and 1 aspect each for Stygius, the Twin Fists and the Eternal spear. Each one of those aspects plays very differently from the next. Unfortunately not every weapon has a selection as excellent as the bow, with the fists especially standing out with only one great aspect, that of Demeter. Every aspect can have a great build come together with clever usage of RNG manipulation and the right upgrades however, and the best aspects have many viable builds. Merciful End with divine dash and Doom on the attack is good on basically anything, but shines with the swords special/dash attack combo, instantly triggering and dealing doom damage with every dash attack. A crit build is also hard to mess up, working well with fast hitting and slow hitting weapons alike. Zeus attack/call with aphrodite special and their duo boon is a winner with the aspect of Demeter or Eris rail, fast hitting chain lightning being able to clear whole rooms and having very easy access to a very powerful damage dealer on an automatic cooldown. Eris especially so with Cluster Rockets, easily capable of killing the Heroes of Elysium in under 30 seconds. Any chunky cast with some Duo boons centered around cast damage will contribute to the highest damage numbers you'll ever witness with the aspect of Hera and Beowulf. A build can be built around practically every Duo or legendary boon however, and the variety is part of why grinding dozens of high heat runs was so bearable. It doesn't hurt that every boss becomes incredibly fun once you learn their moves and figure out which moves you can exploit for huge damage uptime on the boss. Extreme measures and Middle management keep the fights more engaging and varied, as well as learning to fight every boss when they are swing and moving up to 40% faster (depending on your heat modifiers). Bosses in most games become fairly boring after repeated kills, with every souls game until Bloodborne and Ds3 being especially egregious in my experience. The bosses in Hades hold up on a second encounter though, and Meg holds up even on my 300th. Smacking around basic enemies becomes incredibly rewarding when you become skilled enough to lock down entire groups of enemies, clearing entire biomes only getting hit in mini boss or boss encounters. Movesets are very well telegraphed with a handful of exceptions in elysium particularly, but most enemies can be reasonably dodged even with 40% extra attack speed. Benefits package (a heat modifier that gives armored enemies special abilities) makes every encounter meaningfully different from the previous chamber, adding many more things to worry about and counter. Rooms rarely start to feel unfair before pumping the Heat meter past 20, but some nasty combinations can start to cause problems especially in (again) elysium.
Aside from some issues with RNG not giving you a specific upgrade needed for a build or some overwhelming enemy layouts forcing you to lose a death defiance, the game is incredibly polished. Most games with great dialogue or stories have boring combat (The witcher trilogy) and most games with great gameplay have boring stories (Sekiro). Games like God of War and Hades that excel in most areas are a rarity, and it easily cements Hades as one of the most well rounded games I've ever played.

It's really fun to play, even if you're bad at these types of games (like me). Combat is very smooth and the update system adds tons of different builds and allows for both melee and ranged play styles. The weapons also change your combat style quite a lot and each of them can be modified even further which delivers a lot of replayability.

Gfx, sound, music and voice acting is outstanding. Almost every time you'd encounter any of the gods (your 'family'), you're given dialogs that progress based on how far you got and what you've done previous or current run. It's amazing how much voice acting is in this game. And if you're not interested in all that flavor text, it's easy to skip.

The upgrade system (boons, hammers, poms, etc.) started to make more sense, ""Builds"" started to become clear (e.g., which boons go well together with which weapons).

My problem with the game is that the level variety, enemy variety, and boss variety are just not there at all. Not by a long shot. With the amount of runs you need to do to unlock everything, the game gets pretty old pretty fast. I do like the weapon and item variety though. Boon variety is alright. 
I'm hoping the sequel can improve on the content and make each run more dynamic compared to the last. 

Also, the game was a bit easy in my opinion. I know it has a built in difficulty slider, which I did use, but the bounty system encourages a very slow and gradual increase in the difficulty slider. Doing that, I was beating the final boss nearly every single time. Out of 57 runs, I escaped 33 times. With the majority of the fails being either in the beginning before unlocking weapons and items, or at the final boss. After that, I started failing runs on purpose to speed up the process of unlocking content. 
I'm conflicted on the process of unlocking stuff. It's random. In some ways I like it, but it does require a grind if you're going for a specific thing, and that's not fun. 

I found myself constantly comparing it to Binding of Isaac. Which I've only played the original and early versions of Rebirth. But Isaac usually came out on top in my mind.

I just don't feel the weight of each button press like I do in other action games. every input feels so meaningless and inconsequential. it's not fun. maybe for some people, being really fast is fun. for me, being really fast is very boring.

that brings me to one last criticism - the game is built under the assumption that the player will eventually start speedrunning it. that's the endgame of hades. speedrunning. that's the most difficult content in this game. if you plan to play this game for 1k hours, expect to be a speedrunner at the end of it all. if you don't like the sound of that, then this is absolutely not the game for you. 

the game's main adventure is fun and was definitely a positive experience, but at the end of it all I can not stand to think about playing another run. even on high heat I am finding myself being bored.

The sprites for the characters. are second-to-none amazing 10/10. The actual enemies and the like somewhat less so, but everything is still very solid-looking.

The gameplay after a certain amount of runs gets very, VERY boring and repetitive, to the point that I don't think I want to bother beating the game.

  As a roguelike game, the early performance of this game is still quite gorgeous.  The exquisite character visual effects and the sexy voice of the voice actor are enough to be a masterpiece.
  But if you play it for a bit longer, you’ll find that compared to other ‘roguelike’ games, this one falls short in terms of gameplay.  The beautiful graphics result in fewer scenes in the game, and there are not many bosses.  You may also notice that the art style of some monsters does not match the background.
  These flaws lead to players purely speeding up the game for the sake of clearing levels, so how can we extend the playtime?  The game requires players to ‘clear’ multiple times to reach the true ending, but the rewards each time a player clears are less satisfying compared to similar games.  Over time, this can lead to dissatisfaction with the game design, especially when seeing Greek mythological characters with strange skin colors.
  In other games, you see the ending after repeated failures and finally succeeding. However, in this game, you are required to repeatedly succeed to see the ending. This game design reflects a lack of game content and also reduces the player’s interest.
  As similar games continue to update and add content, this highly publicized game has not changed much, which is disappointing.
[strike] If you don’t mind the game featuring mythological characters with strange skin colors, then I recommend waiting for a discount to purchase it.
  I believed the media hype and bought this game a long time ago, but it was a terrible experience back then, so I definitely wouldn't give it a good review. [/strike]",1646641695,1703668354,False,1,0,0.405544430017471313,0,True,False,False

I like how Zag interacts with everyone and how unique each run can be. The runs are evolving until you get to your 20-30th run. (around the time I could make it too Hades consistently) 

The Combat, Art, Character Design and story are amazing. 

 My favorite part of the game is the final boss fight, it has so many stages and was so fun to fight. although from run 25-30 is when I kinda got burnt out of grinding just to get too Hades and fight him. 

There are three things that I dislike about this game.
-The Hydra Boss Fight, felt really easy and I beat that thing first try. became a really big pain in the ass to fight him at times. as a boss fight which was shown in the promotion trailer, I feel like he should have been way more fun to fight and harder. his different versions were not very special ether. 

-lack of reward, When you beat a boss you get these... artifacts or items, which are used too.... do what again? so the boss fight with Meg and her two other sisters on Tartarus give you the ability to upgrade weapon aspects. The Hydra Diamond on Asphodel was used for what? the commisions to build stuff... but like I am not grinding to do that... which brings me to my next point, to get more of these artifacts you need to beat the boss with diffrent types of wepons. This just makes me not want to do them at all. 

-the spear is clearly broken. idk why use anything else 

-----conclusion-------
-good game
-prob should play if you have never played a rogue-like
-no it isn't as hard as dead cells. 
-yes, it's hard enough for a challenge

As I started the game and became familiar with the boons and effects, each further chamber I reached became a victory of its own and the pursuit of getting better at the game kept me going. Here the main reward system is not the victories and escapes in themselves, but how much smoother the player becomes in each run and how much more they can do in inflicting damage and mixing better powers. What helps this process especially in the early game is the fragments of story you receive between runs through short conversations. This brilliant method of storytelling helps negate the urge to quit at the time when you're probably the worst at surviving the game. Furthermore, world building, characters, and the unique relationships between Zag and the other NPC's turn the segments between runs a welcoming experience of calm juxtaposed with the violent nature of the escape attempts. This complete formula in game making is the result of repeated experimentation by Supergiant Games throughout their developed games which has come to full fruition in Hades.",1703482929,1703533922,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Between gifting friends, buying for myself and playing on xbox gamepass, this is currently Supergiant Games Magnum Opus. Ive played almost all previous Supergiant games, missing only Pyre, and Hades is the culmination and application of all the experience they have gained throughout the years has indie devs. Its a love letter to their long time fans and themselves. A true labor of love and one can debate its the pinnacle of action rogue lites. 

The art is beautiful, as always, and very unique to them. Darren Korb absolutely kills it again with the stellar OST that just really adds to the excitement and tension of each run, while the more somber songs really sell the ambiance and melancholy felt by its characters. Talking about characters, its truly fun and amazing how Supergiant games were able to create believable, fun and relatable characters out of a over used theme such as greek mythology. The amazing VA really elevates the story telling to whole new levels, and its insane how they achieved such a feat of so many voicelines for all characters and how their appear in game to not repeat unless your starting a new game from scratch. No character ever repeats a single line, and they all have more than hundreds. 

Gameplay what is there to say that it hasnt been said before and cant be appreciated with just the trailers. Its fast, thinky, fun and it pacts a punch. Each floor of levels have unique themes with unique monsters that each requires certain thought into how to beat them effectively, and you can just also try going head first and try coming out alive, either is fine and fun lol. All weapons are very unique yet balanced in a way they are all viable, and all the blessings are versatile to have thousands of possible combinations. Multiple runs in in multiple copies, and ive BARELY scratched the surface of all blessing builds and combination. 

Hades is truly something special. A indie masterpiece and darling that simply CANNOT be denied its greatness and influence in the gaming industry. Its setting a standard of how a game should be released in this modern age of broken AAA games and promises. Hades 2 is the true most anticipated game of the future, and we cant wait for more.",1703444700,1703444700,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Woke up one morning and got a dm from my buddy drake (gods plan) he hit me up and  just said hades. I said hades what? He said hadeez nuts in yo mouth and dropped a album the next day. At that particular day i decided that i needed to get  HADES. then i bought hades and played it a bit. Then i did a 3 year break from the game and watched the new godzilla movie. After that i played some kanye on my phone and closed my eyes. Then i woke up with tears in my eyes and decided it was due time to lay haydeez nuts back in the game. Then i booted up my ps2 and went to play some haydes with my grandmother. after that i forgot about the game and havent played it since. then i wrote this review. I hope this convinces everyone to buy hadezzzzzzzzz and paly some droke! Hit me up on my facebook if u need any help with your credit card information.

You do not have to be and I was not a fan of this genre before however somehow this game experience is so overwhelmingly good that I got hooked right at the beginning. 

Your sense of hearing will will tell you right at the beginning that it wants to hear more of what the game can bring. The same goes for your sight ... because you will want to see more first time you die. 

And then there is a story to be unfold. And for that story you will be willing to die countless times and it will not bore you at all because will want to know more about ""gifts"" from Olympians and how strong can you become combining them. This is especially funny :D ... and as you grow stronger you can make creatures you encounter stronger as well... for which you will be rewarded with stuff that helps you unlock new weapons and their variations that allow you to fight in slightly different way. 

In short -> great story, great graphics, great gameplay,  great music and sound effects, great leveling mechanics, great overall experience",1703246842,1703246842,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1703244302,1703244302,True,18,2,0.523125708103179932,0,True,False,False

I had watched some of my other friends play it and I had heard great things, so I bought it and was waiting for the opportunity to try it out. On Thanksgiving week 2022, I had a lot of time available, because I had contracted Covid and wouldn't be able to see my family that year. On top of that, the day before I got Covid, my dog died. It was one of the worst weeks I'd had in years. Enter Hades. I spent most of my time with Covid sick in bed and asleep, but the time I was awake, I spent playing this game. The sense of discovery this game has is amazing. The voice acting, art, and central premise make the game very immersive, and the finely turned mechanics with new weapons and boon combinations caused me to become highly invested in doing runs just to try new things out. This game is a masterpiece, and a year later, despite in how bad of a place I was in, I still feel nostalgia for playing it fresh. Hades is a 10/10 life-changing experience, and I would recommend it to anyone.

I mean that in the most positive way. Not every roguelike (or in this case, roguelite) is balanced so well. Some runs are ""normal"" and you combine passive buffs and active abilities as best you can; now and then, luck and/or judicious choices will get you an overpowered perfect combo build that is immensely satisfying to play. Not to mention the wonderful artwork, awesome music, touching story, and lovable cast of characters. Oh and the sexy voice-acting. (I mean literally, most characters have very... attractive-sounding husky voices, I don't really know how else to describe them.)

Lastly, on its own, I want to mention the game's references to Greek mythology. I'm a huge mythology buff and like most mythology buffs, I adore Greco-Roman myths because unlike those of many other cultures, they are comparatively plentiful and well-documented. In addition, I personally have always had a strong affinity for psychopomps and the underworld, so the theme here is right up my alley. It is very obvious that the writers of this game did a crazy amount of research and worked hard to make stuff be both ""accurate"" to the mythos while also bringing a fresh new perspective to one of the most popular (some might even say overused) stories in Greek mythology. Everything is on-theme from the ambrosia you bribe people with to the personalities of the gods and I love it.

Lastly it must be noted that you can pet Cerberus and he is super adorable! (If any dev ever reads this, I want to say, without spoiling anything, that I REALLY LOVE how you guys dealt with Cerberus.) I know being able to ""pet the dog"" is a trendy thing in games right now but I don't care... as a dog-lover I welcome every single game that embraces this trend, and anyone who doesn't like it can eff right off.",1703171400,1703171400,True,34,0,0.740678548812866211,0,True,False,False

As for the bad... I haven't heard a single bad thing about this game so have no idea if any bad things you've heard would be true, but damn, it does not leave a lot of room for improvement.

I do wish there was more variance in biomes or levels. I wish there were more bosses and not just reskinned versions of themselves with different move sets. But honestly, that's about it. And seeing as how the game is progressing I may change my mind about those things. 

So far, Hades has done a great job of keep a repetitive game feeling fresh, and the grind less grindy. 

The art style is fantastic and the voice acting is god-tier, honestly. The slow progression of story between characters between runs is intriguing and well written. I'm invested and will continue to play.

For what it's worth, I escaped Hades on my 13th attempt, which was about 7 hours in, I think. And while escaping Hades is ""beating the game"" it's far far far from over. I would pick this up any day of the week, I don't know why I waited so long. If you're at all leery just wait for a sale or return it before the two hour play time limit is up.

[b]Why do I feel so bisexual?![/b] 

I've been an avid fan of the Roguelite genre for years, yet I've never encountered anything that rivals the sheer, unadulterated fun offered by this game. Embracing death as a new player may initially seem like a negative, but the struggle to escape the pits of the underworld immerses you in the narrative of a naive boy attempting to break free from his father's tormenting realm. The first encounter with Styx immediately reveals the benefits of progressing in a run, granting substantial upgrades for subsequent attempts. However, it doesn't end there; when taken by Styx, you return to the House of Hades, where character interactions advance storylines, each character offering valuable upgrades or trinkets. The game's fully voiced characters, portrayed by expressive actors, add charm and depth, and the captivating plot draws inspiration from Greek mythology in countless ways.

Just as monotony threatens to set in with your move-set, the game introduces a whopping five additional weapons, each boasting four unique styles. The plethora of synergies and creative builds achievable with just one weapon style is downright absurd. The attention to detail and love poured into the Roguelite system's balance are unmatched. Completing the game doesn't mark the end; players, upon finishing their first run, are presented with the option to heighten the game's difficulty in exchange for rewards throughout subsequent runs. I've never encountered a game offering players such flexibility in determining the level of challenge they desire. Do you want bosses with new movesets? Or perhaps everything dealing one hundred percent more damage? Maybe you fancy traps instantly ending your run? The choice is yours, and I doubt I'll ever perceive difficulty in games the same way again. In summary, this game is a masterpiece—captivating characters, a unique story, and gameplay that consistently beckons me for more.",1703116910,1703116935,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Hades incorporates an easy to grasp yet challenging combat and gameplay structure, whilst simultaneously featuring a captivating design and intriguing narrative. The game takes place in the underworld, and the way you play the game, feels akin to a story dictated in an amphitheatre in ancient Greece rather than a game which yearns for you to rip your hair out. This game is unlike many of its genre, where it rewards you with unique dialogue each and every turn throughout the game, as well as by providing different challenges through the randomly generated nature of the rooms and runs in the game. The game actively rewards for doing things differently each time, and even rewards you when you fail! The replayability of this game knows no bounds, since it always never fails to bore me since, it isn't all that repetitive. While the lore and gameplay is in a whole other, you should take the time to truly appreciate the aesthetic and design of the underworld and its inhabitants. The vibrant palette of colours and textures accompanied by the hellish yet beautiful landscapes of the regions in the Underworld, is truly a curse if you don't appreciate detail on the finest level. However, the icing on this devilish cake is the music by Korb, the compositions made by him truly encapsulates Zagreus' innumerable perilous escape attempts in the Underworld, and seamlessly transitions well between combat beats and haunting melodies, immersing you in the world of Hades. This game truly deserves to be in every gamer's library, and is a modern classic that takes you on an odyssey that beckons to be returned to.",1702967534,1702967534,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really struggled to get through to an official ending of this game.

But to call this a bad game? No way. 

I came to know of Hades through rave reviews via word of mouth from friends & coworkers alike.
And to my experience, the game's got beautiful art / graphics, excellent sound design, engaging game-play, meaningful lore / relationships, and a wonderful fundamental story arc that ties everything together.
It's even boosts its replay factor with randomized boons, randomized weapons that are bonus drops, optional difficulty increases, weapons with different play styles & variants, etc. It even had features for players with skill-issue like God Mode, etc.

Like objectively on paper, it should sound like I had a blast. I really did try to find different builds or weapons combinations or punishment conditions to make it a more fun game. It was an engaging, but I did not have fun.

I'm guessing that I just might not like games of this sort of genre, since Hades is the 1st of this genre type I've played. I'm sure it's a great game for its genre, just not for me.

Hopefully, this doesn't deter people who know they like games of this genre, but for people who know they don't already, it's okay to not be interested in a game like Hades. Just don't go around bad-mouthing it.",1702962505,1702962505,False,3,0,0.498098850250244141,0,True,False,False

it got a little repetitive getting the 10 wins for the story, just because i KNEW I could win with the shield, and all the other weapons were a little iffy, so I played a TON without switching weps and it got pretty samey. there was still a lot of variety because of the huge amount of boons, but forcing my best builds got boring fast- the thing is, it felt like self sabotage NOT to

one hell of a game




Hades is the only fucking story based rogue-like, where dying doesnt feel like a defeat because now you unlocked new dialogue options with your gay roomate. 

Also I like that the game's difficulty can be customised to your precise standard and the fact that you have to keep making the game more difficult to progress while also making your guy stronger to be able to keep up with the difficulty scaling. 

All the weapons have unique and fun interactions with the different boons (power-ups) you get from gods etc, as well as different forms for countless customisation options. 

The level variety is good enough, although after 7 billion runs some rooms do start to seem more and more familliar. However, there are a lot of different enemies that appear on different floors to make you feel like there's more variety amongst the different levels.

Also there's Cerberus

You can pet Cerberus

The game actually has very little content, all runs will feel very similar and you'll probably die around the same time every run.

That being said, i'm at 37 hours and i'm no where near bored or done with the game, i very much like the gameplay loop of playing a run, unlocking meta progression stuff for permanent upgrades, and doing another run.

Long version: I'm not usually big on rogue-lites, but after I enjoyed Pyre so much, especially for its surprising depth, narrative, and character arcs and relationships (which I was not expecting in what is basically 3-on-3 cosmic basketball), I decided I'd take a chance on Hades. I'm really glad I did. For a start, the way that you retain certain upgrades after each attempt, while losing temporary ones, means the game does get easier the more you play it, but also stays fresher than if every run was truly the same in terms of perks and route. I rarely felt bored or like I was going through the motions, especially since my run times got faster and I got better at the game with most attempts. So, the balance felt right, especially for someone who's not really into the genre. 

And like with Pyre, I was impressed with the depth of the game. There's so much going on with relationships between all the characters; I talk to everyone I can in the House of Hades after dying. The dialog is funny, the graphics are clean, the narrative arcs are well-done, the game is fair, and there's a trophy for petting the dog. 

Lastly: if you've beaten the game and haven't gotten the trophy for petting Cerberus ten times, what's wrong with you?",1702688724,1702688724,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That difficulty isn't your fault, though - the game is genuinely just straight up rigged against you to lose unless you buy the metaprogression upgrades, which feels hugely counterintuitive for a roguelike. Metaprogression should unlock new options and playstyles, and maybe make the game easier, not turn it from impossible to playable. 

Then, you get used to the game and unlock more upgrades and items. This bit's cool, but it takes a while to get to - maybe 4 or 5 hours of playing, which is tough to stick through with progression slowly bleeding out. There's a story running parallel to the game, which progresses every time you die, and sure, that's cool in theory. But in practice, I just became far too stressed to enjoy the game, because I felt the need to beat the final boss before the story ""ended"". Every failure and subsequent progression of the story made me more frustrated and upset with the game.

The story itself isn't even that interesting either. The characters are all really quite boring, bar a handful, and the game is far too dialogue-heavy, giving fully-voice acted conversations that I actually originally listened to the whole way through - until I realised that it's just way too slow. Spending five to ten minutes at Hades' house between runs broke up the flow of the game far too much, meaning it loses momentum. Other roguelikes - Isaac, Gungeon, Nuclear Throne, etc. have little to no hub area to fuck up the momentum. In the end, I'd skim character's dialogue as a chore, because I'd rather play the actual game itself. That, or at least lean in further to the story aspect and give us more areas to explore in the hub world than Hades' tiny mansion.

Speaking of, the gameplay is fluid and fast-paced, which is great, and the boons are kinda neat. Daedalus Hammers and Chaos boons are unique and provide a great change, which is why it's a shame you normally only see two or three per run. The enemies are unique enough, but there's just not enough variety given the size the game makes you think it is. Maybe less than 10 enemy types per area means they become repetitive quickly, and the small number of (pre-built) chambers don't help this problem either. After you've beaten the game two or three times, every run feels like a slight variation of the last.

After you've finished the game, it also becomes a grindy slog to ""complete the other stuff"", like house contracts (hub-area cosmetics) or fated prophecies (missions), with progression slowing down and down and down until you're left with seemingly no reward for each run. This is the point I'm at, and I just kinda don't care. I don't want to put in another 50 hours to beat the last 5% of this game, it's just a waste of time on something I don't enjoy.

Balance is also a huge problem, both in weapons/boons, and enemies.
If you take any dash upgrade bar Athena's, you're shooting yourself in the foot. All the other ones SUCK.
If you take any attack upgrades bar Hermes' or Demeter's, you're shooting yourself in the foor. The others are consistently worse.
It's harder to beat the game with no difficulty modifiers and an Exagryph than 7 or 8 difficulty modifiers and an Aspect of Chiron Bow. The balance is so UNBELIEVABLY shifted there that it's almost like a joke. 
Of the four areas, the THIRD has the hardest enemies. The warriors who can revive themselves - especially the borderline invincible ones with shields - are so irritating to fight. I end up losing more health chasing after them to finish them off than I do fighting them normally. 
The fucking TINY VERMIN enemy is harder than the FINAL FUCKING BOSS. are we serious right now like bruh

The soundtrack and visuals are cool. I can appreciate them, even though they're not my thing. Team did a good job there. A lot of developers put a lot of hours into this, and it's almost there. It just needs a rebalance and a focus shifted more on combat and gameplay than lore and story. But it's not made to cater to me, so at least it fills that ""story roguelike"" niche. 

If you're like me and you ADORE roguelikes for their gameplay, don't go in expecting to love this. It could go either way. I regret this purchase and the time I put into it which I could have spent elsewhere.

Just about everything in the game feels perfect. I honestly don't know how they're going to improve on things in Hades 2, but I'm really excited to find out! Despite the fact that this is an action game, the story, characters, and voice acting are incredible. Zagreus' personality and the hilarious and friction-filled dynamic he has with his father really stand out. The art and use of colours is also fantastic.

This IS an action roguelite though, and I think what really shines through the most is the addictive and compelling gameplay loop and the snappy, responsive combat. It makes the skill improvements I made as I progressed through game all the more satisfying.

That's a huge, huuuuge mark against the game. A friend said it gets more varied... it doesn't get varied, it gets to a basic, acceptable level. At least they finally made a satisfying combat system.

I like and dislike many details about the story side, but it doesn't matter that much to me so I won't get into it. Which is actually a huge negative, because as cool as I find this game's take on the Greek pantheon, I've been a fan since before I learned to read, it's part of why I learned, and it should impress me more. The flavor of the whole game is great, including interactions with gods that give you favor. The upgrades (besides the hammer) are mostly inconsequential, which is why people think Athena is overpowered, all of hers do something (the same thing really). There's a lot to unlock in the hub, that's cool I guess. Music is great. Game is consistently pretty and smooth.

Fun for a while, it does a few things great, but it only does those things.

Long version: Hades was my introduction to the roguelite genre as well as to Supergiant games. With its incredibly high quality, has locked in my interest if Hades 2 goes the same early access route: something I cannot say of any other game. 

Gameplay: Hades has four stages, with the fourth having a radically different structure before the final boss. Each available weapon is totally different from the others; on top of that, each weapon has subweapon styles that make the way it plays even more unique. I have most of the game's achievements due to my love of experimenting with all the different subweapons, though I did not get all of skelly's trophies for the last 2 or 3. Those involve manually bumping the difficulty of lategame runs up to very, very high levels beyond what is needed to finish the epilogue. Those are rough if you want to go full completionist.

Graphics: Although the art is 2D, with the outstanding attention to detail, it hardly looks like a game that could have been released 20 or 30 years ago. Alongside its attention to detail, for such a fast-paced game, Hades does an excellent job of drawing the player's attention where it needs to go. Enemy attacks, your attacks, and drops are easy to pick out of the play area.

Audio: The sound effects are appropriately meaty for a fantasy setting and the voice work is amazing, notably the god of the underworld himself. Many people swear by the music of this game, which based on the Noclip documentary featured one of Supergiant's developers singing in one of the tracks, but it doesn't click with me. For all the praise I have for this game, I am not attached to the music, unlike the rest of the game.

Story: As a roguelite, dying sends you back to your home base to level up. What sets Hades apart is how the persistent story develops between your runs. In every other roguelite I have played since Hades introduced me to the genre, I have missed the in-depth story this game offers. Seeing it through to the epilogue requires 15 successful runs, if I recall correctly: something I would not have done if I lacked interest in the narrative. My own interest in the story is buoyed by Supergiant's loving attention to the original Greek myths. Zagreus did indeed exist in the old pantheon and was even venerated to a limited extent by the ancients: a deep cut that a lesser developer would never have considered.

Overall, if I were to rate this game on a 10-point scale, I would give it a 9/10. One point is deducted for the latter heat challenges being punishing and the music not clicking with me. I consider everything else about the game to be perfect and give it my recommendation.",1702516641,1702516641,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In a nutshell :

1) the gameplay and gameplay-loop is mediocre (see paragraph below).
2) enemies are both extremly weak in variety (the roster) and designed to be frustrating / non-interactive (240° shields, self-revives, endless waves of swarms, poison puddles, groups of bowmen sniping you across the room and skatering if threatened, ...).
3) the roguelite element (the mirror and weapon aspects) is a forced 60 hours grind so that you can max out stats that should've been given to you for free (or maxed out after 10 hours at worst), which is surreal.

6 weapons, each having only 2 attacks. Every weapon has 4 aspects, but there only ever is one (or two in rare cases) that is viable per weapon. So based on weapon alone, the gameplay variety is very lacking. Now, where's it's supposed to come from are the boons that you receive during runs. Except 80% of the boons are trash, generic and inexpressive. Weaken, Hangover and Doom are simply alternative ways of dealing damage which all feel awful. No boons (except duo-boons, more on that later) ever truely give you an alternative way of playing the game. Picking up boons that do not contribute to a perfectly optimal build feels as if you didn't picked up antyhing at all, they are deadweights (like why would I ever pick Ades cast saw blades ? It's a dps loss). And the best boons (duo-boons) are locked behind a very specific build order (so no freedom) AND the mirror stat grind... bascialy, expect mindlessly spamming X and A for 60 hours before looking into the 6 playstyles available. Only good thing are the hammers but they restrict your gameplay a lot too.",1702308181,1702308992,False,2,1,0.416666656732559204,1,True,False,False

So addictive, in fact, that I would actually suggest that people with addictive tendencies should actually *avoid* playing this game. Between the heart pumping music, constant action, visual overload, and seemingly infinite dialogue, it is *very* easy to slip into the ""just one more game"" cycle with Hades.

Now, onto my actual review.

--First Impressions--

What impresses me most about Hades is how deceptively deep the game is. You're dropped into the game as a guy named Zagreus who is trying to escape the Underworld, and by the time you finally escape the Underworld... you have only scratched the surface of Hades. There is *so much dialogue* and every single bit of that dialogue is voiced. Even after a hundred fifty successful and unsuccessful runs, I am still occasionally hearing new dialogue. There are literally 21,000 voice lines and roughly 305,000 words of dialogue in the game according to the developers. That is roughly the same voice line and word count as *Mass Effect,* an RPG well-known for its sheer scope. As I kept hearing new lines and tidbits, I kept thinking ""how did these indie developers manage to afford *this* many lines of dialogue?""

It isn't just the massive scope of the written story that manages to impress, either. The gameplay itself appears very shallow on the surface, and yet it has proven to be very intricate underneath. My earliest successful runs largely consisted of succeeding by virtue of sheer luck and existing mechanical skill, resulting in some hard won victories. My later runs made the base difficulty of the game a breeze: the game heavily rewards knowing how to manipulate boon RNG to get your desired build.

--Customizable Difficulty--

After beating the game on base difficulty, the Pact of Punishment system is unlocked, allowing players to very finely tune and customize the game's difficulty, which is overall represented by ""Heat."" I found it somewhat similar to Slay the Spire's Ascension system in the best of ways: the various conditions aren't difficult to deal with individually, but combined they can ramp up the difficulty quickly. The in-game rewards cap out at 32 heat, which I myself ended at. I was a little surprised there wasn't a Steam achievement for a 32 heat run, as 32 heat is still a very manageable difficulty.

I do think that zero heat/base game difficulty was a little *too* easy, as I nearly beat the game on my third try despite knowing very little about the mechanics at the time. I also don't like some of the heat conditions on account of how they can rule out certain playstyles entirely.

--Midgame is too grindy--

My biggest criticism of Hades is that everything about the midgame is too grindy. By that point in the game, I'd had enough successful runs under my belt and built a lot of confidence in my game knowledge, but the lack of meta-resources meant that my ability to freely experiment with builds and weapons was limited by my willingness to grind for Darkness and Nectar. This proved to be extremely frustrating, as the best way to farm for these bottleneck resources is to replay the game on zero Heat (which is, as mentioned before, too easy, and boring to repeat).

Even more frustrating is that advancing some parts of the story required that I deliberately fail runs. It feels like a massive waste to play for fifteen minutes to slowly deliberately die to specific enemies, or to pray to RNGesus that the right NPCs will show up so I can talk to them later.

However, the most frustrating part is that Hades does not need to be this grindy, as the game itself already provides all of the necessary enjoyment to keep playing. For me, the best part of progression was not unlocking new talents in the Mirror, but the way in which my growing game knowledge started translating into successful streaks and pushing Heat.

Once the midgame grind was over, my first thought was ""Now I can finally play the game,"" and the experience became far more enjoyable.

--Too much clicking--

This will sound like an odd complaint, but I also felt like the game was a little too clicky. Because the gameplay is so fast paced, a lot of strategies in Hades require an enormous amount of spamming the dash button and spam clicking your attacks in order to stay alive and maximize your DPS.

I feel like this setup is unnecessarily hard on both players' hands and on players' gaming equipment. There are certain in-game upgrades that I will always take because they serve as quality of life upgrades: being able to hold down left mouse button for auto-attacking rather than being forced to manually click over and over feels like I'm saving a year's worth of service life for my PC's mouse.

With my spacebar feeling *significantly* looser since started Hades (and I game fairly heavily on this keyboard without much issue prior), the excess of clicking is a major reason for why I've stopped playing Hades.

--Those Loading Screens--

After over 150 runs, I would kill for the ability to skip/shorten certain animations in the game. Namely, the victory screens come with voiceover narration that I assume are hiding a loading screen, but if not, I would love to be able to skip them at this point as I've heard them all. I think I've spent a solid five hours of my life sitting through some of those sequences, over, and over, and over.

--Concluding remarks--

Despite my issues with the grind, the clickiness, and the frustratingly addictive qualities of the game, I, overall, wholeheartedly recommend Hades. There is an enormous amount of craftsmanship, love, and expertise poured into making this game, and it shows; every inch of it radiates with the developers' passion.

这款游戏的画质，剧情，人物对话极度丰富，细腻又清晰的剧情让玩家每次死亡回到家里，都能解锁很多新的对话和剧情。玩法来说，这款游戏较死亡细胞内容确实少了很多，主要就是通过选择武器和祝福搭配来获得不同的效果。虽然祝福种类多种多样，可供选择的武器有24把，但是武器大概也只分6个大类，而核心祝福也只有5个大方面，其余的祝福更多的起辅助效果。虽然这款游戏打击感强，非常好玩，但是不得不承认他的内容比较有限--在完成主线剧情（通关10次）以后，这款游戏可玩的地方就是装饰自己的家，挑战更高难度（但是关卡本身内容不变），或者使劲肝，收集非常多的道具达成真结局。对局中也只能通过祝福来使每次游玩的体验多样化，实在是一个比较有限的手段。打到中后期就会发现每局的重复行非常高，这也是这款游戏最大的缺点。这个过程相当漫长，而且确实比较无聊。不过总体来说这款游戏想要达到主线剧情的结局，难度并不是非常高，而且一般来说也不用花费过多的时间。这款游戏我强烈推荐给所有玩家～～如果你想体验精致的画风，爽快的打击感，紧凑清晰的剧情，有趣的人物对话，在寻找一款难度中等的肉鸽游戏，或者是一位希腊神话爱好者--无脑入，你不会后悔的～

Gameplay is fast-paced and addictive with a staggering number of weapon and power-up combinations to choose from.  The ""one more run"" feeling is always there and every run requires a slightly different approach depending on build.  The challenge level is on the easier side for the genre, but is customizable with added difficulty offering greater rewards.

My only complaint would be that some of the side content is paced out a little too slowly.

The simplicity of the player kit and enemy design allow for a fun little game where there's lots of variation on playthroughs but is easy to understand. You may get a run where you primarily use your special, others where cast is the difference between winning or not. Your offensive abilities also deleting projectiles is an extremely smart decision.

After about 40 hours my only real complaint is the lack of enemy variation. Most enemies in the game key off of another similar enemy, which works well but i wish there was a wider variety of different shapes and sizes of them.

Just few stages, just few enemies on each stage, just few room layouts, and their combinations stop feeling engaging really fast.

When I first heard about it, I was like ""oh, Greek mythology, eh whatever, not my thing,"" but HOOOOO boy, [i][b]don't judge a book by its cover!!![/b][/i] Everything about this game just FEELS fantastic in a way that's hard to describe. The loop of smashing through the underworld, cobbling together a crazy build, and using your resources after every run to unlock MORE power, and more dialogue with all the super well-written characters... So good.

It does everything in its power to soften the tremendous impact that death normally has in a roguelike, and it makes every death feel all the more encouraging. Sure, your run's over, but now you can dump all the resources you've collected in to unlocking like 3 new permanent upgrades that all have very tangible impacts! And in the meantime, you spruce up the lounge with some cutlery and a fireplace, and maybe you give your dog a comfy bed, because he's a good lad.

Probably the only problems / minor nitpicks I have with it are:
- Some irritating enemies [i](though none are too bad)[/i]
- Dark Thirst can be annoying, sometimes made me feel like I had to pick the same weapons over and over whenever it decided to cling to a specific weapon [i](looking at you, Adamant Rail!)[/i]
- Making progress [i]too fast[/i] is a thing - certain NPCs might suddenly talk about things you've done like 5 runs in a row as if they're [i]totally new happenings,[/i] lol

But that's basically it!

Hades is just full of so much love and personality and chaos, it might honestly top Dark Souls 1 as my favorite game of all time. Even though I've gotten all the achievements, I could [i]absolutely[/i] see myself booting it up again and again to unlock every little bonus item and codex entry possible.

Despite facing the same kinds of enemies repeatedly, it doesn't get old for me. On top of the gameplay, Hades has a fantastic story that makes the less enjoyable parts (of dying over and over again lol) satisfying to complete. It's rare that I love both the gameplay and story/slice-of-life elements, and I almost never see them complement each other so nicely. Once the game clicks with you, it's so addicting and fun.

I love this game. It's not my favorite game ever (I'm one of those weirdos that played Xenogears at that perfect impressionable time in life, so it will always be my favorite), but I 100% believe Hades is the greatest game ever made. I can come back to Hades anytime, and have a blast. This is the only game that as an adult, I can still catch myself up playing at 2am and saying to myself, ""dude, you need to go to bed... ok one more run I swear"".  I am not good enough with words to explain just how much I love this game.

But I'll try to explain it like this:

I have never been a real hardcore gamer. I've never really been the type to keep playing a game in an attempt to improve at it. I usually find my ceiling in a game pretty quickly, and I'm content with that. As long as I'm having fun I don't care, and since I hardly play multiplayer games who cares if I'm not ""good"". Hades is the only game I've noticed myself gradually getting better and better at over time. I'm no freak. I still have many many heats left to go, and a lot of weapon aspects I still suck with. The thing is though, I'm not getting better at it because I'm actively trying to learn the game, and get better. It's because I enjoy playing the game so much that I just naturally do get better. I don't know. Like I said, me no word good, but I do own 3 copies of this game if that means anything. The only other game I've done that with is Catherine, and one of those is the remake.

But this game is built around repetitive and extremely fast-paced combat with very little margin for error, so even experienced players have to stay on their toes all the time.

Each and every character sparkles with personality and life (the voice-acting is *incredible*) such that you want to keep playing just to interact with them more. Which isn't to say that gameplay isn't good- it is. The variation in weapon and boon combinations is nearly endless and the Heat system allows you to tailor your difficulty to taste, but that's not what I kept playing for. I got so invested in the story and characters that I was willing to put in -checks stats- over *87* hours and 70+ runs to see their story to its finish.

Everything was perfect for gameplay, atmosphere and story. Only thing that i criticized was soundtracks and sound design but toward the end of the game it also got better. In my opinion, this game has done everything perfectly without carrying any concern about being creative. I'm not saying they are not creative. Of course there are many things that never seen on any other game before but, i can sense that they focused on being perfect at the fundamentals on game development. And then they poured their imagination into reality. For me, this is why this game is basically perfect.

This is by far the best roguelike game I've ever played. I reached 40 hours of gameplay in just 4 days.

Generally I loathe games where enemies play by a much more favorable set of rules than I do. Compared to me, enemies have tons of HP and high damage output.  Healing items are too infrequent. By the time I finished, I had learned to dodge constantly and spam attack all over the place. That kind of combat is not fun at all to me. I can rarely understand what is happening because combat is much too fast. I don't enjoy the nature of re-playing the same content over and over again to gain a tiny drop of random story progression. Sometimes I'd complete a story element, then it would be 3-4 hours and 4-6 runs later before some NPC would acknowledge my accomplishment. I don't like how everything is so random. I would have enjoyed a more tailored experience more than this mess. Why should I do another 30 minute run through the same content I've already completed just to get the NPCs to give me 2 new lines of dialogue? It feels like a total waste of time. Given the random nature of how the story unfolds, it never feels finished. I don't like how lategame areas have enemies that lay down huge puddles of poison on the ground right in front of the fountain to cure poison. I also don't like how many bosses can go invulnerable for an extended length of time. Gee wouldn't it be nice if I could do that too? Unfair bullcrap - I hate it.

This review is positive strictly for the quality of the game itself - it is well made. I just found certain design choices to be infuriating and I would have enjoyed a less random experience that didn't rely on split-second timing and lopsided difficulty for combat. The art, lore, world, voice acting, etc., are all very good.

Also the Epilogue was rotten! [spoiler]The NPCs talk about a grand feast they all had and how much fun it was. There wasn't even a cutscene for the experience. I guess these devs never heard the expression ""Show, don't tell."" What a let down.[/spoiler]

Its visuals are stunning with a mix of 2D portraits of characters for dialogue boxes which pair well with the 3D designs of the base game, along with amazing graphics and a beautiful art style. The Ancient Greek mythology setting makes for a great story that explores various characters from Greek mythology as well as adding some new characters into the mix. The gameplay is decently easy to get into if it's your time playing a rouge-like but has a high skill ceiling. The base difficulty is fairly hard but you can make it easier with a setting, after playing for a while you can add various things to make runs more challenging. The gameplay is also very re-playable and there is still new stuff to unlock even after 100+ hours of playing. Finally, the music in the game is stunning at times and it is definitely recommended to play with audio to be able to hear the music and fully voice-acted cast members of Hades.",1701227967,1701227967,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The visibility/visual clarity in this game is unacceptably terrible. If I can't see what is happening on the screen because it's too noisey, or if the enemies tells are too visually subtle to actually notice or recognize, then I can't play the game. End of story. I couldn't play the game blindfolded either -- if I can't see what's happening then there is no game. Sure, I can try and play, but at some point my eyes just glaze over and the feeling of boredom and sadness creeps in because there is nothing I can do to make my ocipital lobe see better.

I'm sure most are not effected by this problem enough for it to ruin the game for them, but this is still an issue, and this game is absolutely deserving of this negative review. Of the hundreds of thousands of positive reviews this game has, this one negative one won't make a bit of difference anyhow in the grand scheme of things (I would not have left a negative review otherwise)

It's the first time I've seen such a combination of story and gameplay put together. From the beginning to the end I felt engaged with Zagreus quest, and restarting over and over just to unlock new dialogues or storylines never felt like a chore, something that usually happens to me in this type of game !

The gameplay is extremely addictive, combat is dynamic and you quickly feel in control of your character.
The amount of boons, upgrades and weapons makes for a very nice replay experience. With the knowledge that will come with multiple runs, you can really define and (almost !) choose how you want to play a run. 

That will feel satisfying in the end !

Don't hesitate with this one !

I have been hyper focused on this game for over a year(it is impressive if my hyper focuses can stay consist and active for 3 mouths), i have loved every second of playing Hades and I have 300 hours logged (at time of writing and even tho I'm done with the mine story there is still things to do! I am still lurning new things and getting new interactions. the game play is DIE-namic (not sorry for the pun), unique and flied. you have a ever changing revolving door of abilitys and weapons and yet still enough control for a lot of strategy! it scratches the puzzle solving, strategizing, story telling, curious and music loving parts of my brain! there is so much mythology it is flowering!
 the world and characters have so much depth, the whole thing from story to characters to world feels so cohesive and immersive! i have been engaged with every single part and there are sever parts that I normally find disengaging, annoying, boring or even triggering in the panic attack or bad thoughts kind of way, and between choice, involvement, creative decisions and genuine emotion and me not realizing at first I never disengaged once!    

I have enjoyed every moment of this game I have loved it as a story, a game, an escape, a space to be and feel excepted in a way I haven't felt in a game ever (and in so few places in real life) Hades has helped me thru so much mental and emotional pain /distress (and continues to) , I love it in a way I cant fully articulate but it holds a place that nothing else has managed to come close to
P.S. I am a person who has ADHD, dyslexia and am on the spectrum, I deal with a lot of unexplained pain (like migraines, joint and stumic) regularly, I am Ace( repulsed to neutral) and gender nonconforming the game world felt so immerse, kind and excepting that even if I didn't see any of these thing even if they didn't have story's around theses thing or use are language I truly felt like there was and is a place for me in this world the way I am, no changes no fixes just me I have a place as is in the story I can do theses thing I have a place in the story's i am not just an observer or passive. and I haven't felt that since i was little.

I am usually a very critical guy when it comes to games, so for me to say that ""Hades"" has almost no issues at all, says a lot about the game. If I had to provide an assessment of ""Hades"" I would, as for that moment, give it a solid 9.5/10. While I am writing this review I only have 10 hours on the game, so I guess I haven't really experienced all there is to the game and for that reason my review may not be as helpful as others, but one thing I can tell you for sure. ""Hades""is definitely WORTH buying, if you are into that genre of games.

UPDATE (128 hours) !

I have played a little bit more than 10 hours now and I have completed all achievements in the game and I can still say that this game will remain ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I have ever played. The Story, the mechanics, the artstyle and most importantly the SOUNDTRACKS are just magnificent. I've literally stayed afk in-game just to listen to the different soundtracks.

Instead, I got probably the most masterfully executed rogue-like I've ever played. The characters are charming and lovable, the weapons are diverse and fun to use, the random elements are able to be influenced often so you can keep ahead of the game if you know what your run needs going from room to room. The fantastic art style is the final nail that sends this game into the stratosphere and on top of that, all the animation work is gorgeous and snappy. If I could nitpick anything, I have some issues with how artificial the difficulty feels on the final region with large enemy health bars with excessive amounts of poison damage. It feels like the polar opposite of what a majority of the game feels like prior, but frankly the segment is not that long and the boss fight that follows is one of my favorite experiences I've had with games this year. Overall, I would recommend this game to literally anyone that enjoys games at their best from developers that clearly care about this game being amazing.

Gorgeous graphics and beautiful music as always from Jen Zee and Darren Korbs.  

I've never really seen the appeal of the roguelike genre so I wasn't quite sure what to expect from Hades.  I couldn't pass up on a Greek mythology inspired game from Supergiant though so I had to give it a go.  I've only got 5 hours on Steam so far but have now played, beaten and platinumed the game on PS4.  The characters are all great and the story is fun and engaging and keeps you coming back run after run.  Every run feels a bit different from the mix of Boons, Weapons, Keepsakes, Mirror upgrades and different room arrangements and that keeps it from ever getting boring.

I loved Bastion and Transistor but I have now spent more time playing Hades than any other Supergiant game.  And I haven't gotten sick of it yet.  It's a game that's just really fun to come back to over and over again.

Out of all the rogue likes I've played, none come close to the storytelling, voice acting, and characters that Hades has. Hades' story and its characters are expanded upon during and after every single run you do. Besides the 6 different weapons you can enter a run with, you can also meet many gods throughout your run, offering different play-styles and synergies between each other.

Hades stands out as an exceptional single-player game, offering an unparalleled value, especially considering its price point on Steam.

While many reviews have thoroughly covered aspects like gameplay mechanics, camera dynamics, action sequences, and graphics, I want to focus on the meticulous attention to detail that sets Hades apart. The narrative is masterfully delivered by a compelling lore teller, weaving an engaging story that keeps you hooked. The dialogues in the game are remarkably situational and refreshingly non-repetitive, enhancing the overall immersive experience. Each character is distinct, displaying unique personalities that add depth to the game world.

The thoughtful design extends to the gameplay as well, with a diverse range of weapons and skills that allow for numerous playstyles. This variety contributes significantly to the game's replayability, a quality that is becoming increasingly rare in modern games.

Everything about this is just amazingly well done. Here a few examples:

- Visuals and soundtrack are (as always with Supergiant) absolutely beautiful.

- Huge variety in gameplay through the weapons and their variants.

- Weapons are well balanced, all of them feel great to play. Even though I did not like some of them at first after a few runs you will find a good build for them that is fun.

- Progression feels powerful and also gives you ways to experiment.

- Combining a Rougelite with a story is an ingenious move. Failing (or ending) a run is never frustrating when you look forward to progressing the story. The story itself is also well suited for the run-based structure so even if you're not a fan of it, it should not bother you too much.

- Lots of content: If you take your time you can easily spend a hundred hours getting to 100% This is also the only thing I would criticise about this. A lot of achievements are purely based on getting certain dialoges done, so it is quite random how long it will take you to unlock all of them, which can feel a little bit frustrating.

In conclusion I simply cannot recommend this game enough. Apart from those who really don't like hack and slay kind of gameplay I cannot think of anyone who would not enjoy this. So if you haven't already do yourself a favour and get this!

Thanks for taking the time and reading my review! Hope you have a great rest of your day!",1669147663,1700864460,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

It is fun, challenging, and rewarding, with a lot of replay value and variety. The game has a beautiful art style that captures the mythological theme and the personalities of the characters. The story is engaging and immersive, with branching paths and dynamic interactions. The voice acting is superb and adds a lot of charm and humor to the game. The game also has a great soundtrack that matches the mood and atmosphere of each area. The game is not too hard or too easy, but just right for anyone who enjoys a good hack and slash adventure. The game also has a lot of customization options and secrets to discover, making each run unique and exciting. Hades is a masterpiece of game design and storytelling, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves video games.

Art direction graphics 9/10 Nice setup and although repetitive like similar to dungeon crawlers map, every stage was designed perfectly with the setting. 

Sound 9/10 Voice qualities and interpretations are good. Background music are on point. But noteworthy ones are quite limited.

Gameplay 10/10 The loop is fun and really engaging. Love how fast pace is the battle. The randomness of perks makes it strategic somehow to keep your toes always eager. Probably a skill game. Plus for npc relations, upgrades and difficulty adjustments to achieve and unlock more contents.

Story 8/10 Even though the contents are detailed. It is up for players to read the lore and somehow tie it to the main story and the world. The main plot was simple yet the extra world building details rounds the whole setting to make it interesting.

It's an exceptional gaming masterpiece, offering a captivating story, intense action, and dynamic rogue-like game-play. With striking visuals, an immersive soundtrack, and well-crafted characters, it creates an unforgettable journey through Greek mythology. While the steep difficulty curve and repetitive environments may pose challenges, the game's replay value make it a must-play for fans of action-packed adventures.

After getting all the achievements, trophies, and a full codex, I feel like there's still 100 hours of game-play to go. That is how much of effort and content these developers put into this. This is a must-play for every Steam Deck owner.

If you're unsure about the game, or can't seem to progress then look up a speedrun, or watch a streamer go through a run or two. That'll give you ideas on how to use the weapons and how builds are done.

There's some behind the scenes videos on YouTube about the making of the game, and I can highly recommend them.

All these elements should be enriched by a sense of story progression and empathy with the main character. 

Hades, as a roguelite game, excels in all those aspects.

The gameplay is perfectly designed. The RNG mechanics are fun and well implemented. The overall atmosphere is gorgeous. You will be hooked on the neverending loop of diying/respawning for a pretty long time. 

Since the game is now out of early access and I've pretty much unlocked/ finished everything the final release has to offer, I have a better overview of the full experience. Ultimately I can say that the game feels complete now, it has a proper story ending and even some endgame content.

The roguelite mechanics are very satisfying. The sense of progression is huge and it's not only related to the stats and weapons you will pemanently unlock, but also to the knowledge and skill you will build up as a player. Basically the game provides 4 RPG core groups (this is a simplification of course): 

1) You have a skill-tree (called Mirror of Night) which can be uprgraded permanently, with different skills you can select for each run according to the build you want to create.  
2) There are 6 different Infernal Arms, each one with 3 different variations (the total number of weapons is actually 18). Before every run (escape attempt) you have to choose one of these, considering that every weapon will differ a lot and will consitute the base of your build, changing drastically the gameplay. Infernal Arms can be upgraded permanently as well. 
3) The RNG mechanics: materials farming and a huge run-dedicated skills spawning system. During each run you will have the opportunity to power up the character with various skills (Gods Boons) which will enhance your stats, your weapons, abilities ecc. 
4) Keepsakes and companions. These are various items you can equip during your adventures, which will grant some benefits and additional skills buffs.

There are 4 main biomes you have to pass through in order to reach the final boss, each one with a set of dedicated enemies and bosses. Finishing a run succesfully will take approx between 15 to 30 mins accordingly to the difficulty level (you can increase the difficulty of the game in order to keep farming materials) and the playstyle. 

In my opinion the story is OKish, but the devs have done a great job in giving all the characters different cool personalities and well written dedicated dialogues. The musics and the artworks are simply amazing.

I have been playing the game since it launched a combined 400 hours put into this game on EGS and now Steam saves combined, can easily say that the game is 100% worth it and worthy of the Overwhelmingly Positive rating on steam. Cant wait for the story to be complete so I can find out what happens after the final boss fight

This lack of annals molds Zagreus into the perfect protagonist, allowing Supergiant to craft their own primordial anecdote. Hades gushes red with an alluring 2d art style that comes from Supergiant games iteratively ameliorating all of their games art styles into this chef-d'oeuvre.

Reviewed after 100%. What can I say that hasn't already been said about Hades? This is truly a modern classic and pushes the rogue-lite genre in new directions all the while retaining Supergiant Games' renown coating of polish.

[h1]What I Liked[/h1]
This game is a masterclass in game design. From the art direction to the lovingly crafted (Thousands!) of lines of dialogue. I am not even joking when I say that I was still hearing new voiced dialogue in my interactions after well over 100 hours. The whole experience is brimming with charm, and comes wrapped in a package that you rarely see from AAA studios.  

The game-play loop may seem difficult at first, but it's in place to teach you the mechanics. Once you've mastered the boon system, you'll be saying ""just one more run"" in order to try a new combo you may have thought of..

[h1]What Could Be Improved[/h1]
There really isn't a whole lot I would change about this game. Even after 120+ hours in, I was still captivated. My only real gripe is after so much playtime, the 3 basic environments can get a little stale. If there is one thing I could request for Hades 2, I would hope there is more environment variety.

[h1]Final Thoughts & Rating[/h1]
If you like rogue-lite style games and have somehow missed this one, do yourself a favor and play it immediately. I'd probably put this in my top 10 games of all time category.

Gameplay loop is very fun thanks to the different weapons and it's aspects you can choose as well as the boon system. There is RNG but there are ways to slightly manipulate it so you can often times steer the game into the style you wish to play on a specific run with a specific weapon.  

The story is fun as it slowly unveils and the friendship system does not seem too forced. Be prepared however to spend time on all of it as progress is of course gated behind resources which you will not always get each and every run.

I have been playing this game since the early access (127 hour'ish on it)
The pros of the game are for sure the storytelling, gameplay and soundtrack.
Why these 3 specifically?
Characters lore and the voice acting is literally what baited me to buy the game in EA, otherwise i would have waited for the full release.
There is NEVER an identical run and the meta progression makes sure to make so (Unless you try to force specific builds).
Every zone, npc, character, boss fight has a specific related soundtrack and it's mixed differently for normal, elite and boss fights. If you have played other Supergiant Games u will know how much Darren Korb is good at creating and composing music.

Coming back in 2023 to still say this is a gem. <3

My only con is that the meta progression is a little slow, but for storytelling purposes it's really well structured.
I won't spoil anything about the current story. Just make sure u don't make Charon mad.

Update on the 26/11/2020: Easily my game of choice for the Game of the Year. Every single detail u see in this game you can perceive the love from the devs, voice actors, artists, everyone involved.

On one hand the story is absolutely fantastic, the characters are all done incredibly well and everything feels like it has a place.  On the other hand the grind required especially for the whole story but also if you want to do such things as max out weapons or items.

The characters and the narrative setting is the best that i have ever seen in a rouguelike.  Every character is fleshed out and has a personality that changes over the game.  The setting builds perfectly into the story and even the side quests and characters have personality and depth I have not seen in many other games (Love Bouldy). 

In terms of gameplay it is very fun in the beginning however compared to other rouge likes there is less overall depth to the builds that you can make because you cannot create synergies as well with different abilities and effects.  That is not to say that it is bad gameplay it is still fun however as you play more and more it can become far more repetitive in nature with differences in play style coming predominantly down to the weapon you choose rather than the boons you collect along your run.

In terms of the difficulty scaling that is in the game that you can activate once having beaten it.  Some of it is very fun adding more challenge to runs and creating obstacles where there normally wasn't before however some of the other perks are very annoying and can feel like bashing your head against a wall at times, this is especially true once you stack a lot of the modifiers together later on in your playthrough.

All in all if you want to beat the main story of the game and maybe complete some other minor stuff i would absolutely recommend however if you are looking to go through the whole story including the epilogue i would still recommend just with the warning that the game might become somewhat stale as you play.  If you are looking for a rougelike that will give you tonnes of replay value and be able to loop infinitely i would still recommend Hades but I would say look at Risk of Rain 2 or Binding of Issac first.",1700095213,1700095213,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I loved how it kept you trying new weapons and new abilities through out, though I recommend you try complete as many different combinations, and do the list of quests, as these progress the storyline in a kind of hidden agenda kind of way.

I needed someone to give me tips at a few key points, as the progression of weapons and new quests kinda got stuck and i just didnt realise that you should have been cycling through the weapons each run.  So if you feel like that I suggest you look on youtube for a few tips like I did.

There's always something new to explore in the story when you least expect it, and the quality of this content is so good. Building close relations with each of the characters in the story feels very natural throughout the course of the game-play.

The combat is easy to understand, and offers a lot of customization to fit the player's play style. It's pretty button-mashing heavy, but it's addicting nonetheless. 

The visuals are an absolute 10/10.

I enjoyed my playthroughs alot ( even though I sucked most of the time), and honestly thought that was all and stopped there. But later I was told that the first run is just the beginning. Recently though I picked the game back up in hopes of reaching the epilogue and delved deeper into the game and boy have I been missing out.

This game has soo much to offer despite it just being going through the same 3ish levels over and over again. I began experimenting with weapon builds, combining different sorts of boons, exploring the dialogue, working my way towards the ""True Ending"", using the pact of punishment for extra challenge and more. The replay value is insane here. Also the fact that the flow of combat, weapons and movement is so satisfying just makes it even more enjoyable and strangely addictive.Then there's the aesthetics, the music, top tier voice acting, art direction and sexily drawn people. The writing and storytelling is just excellent. the portrayals of the Greek Gods are  really well done.

This game just hits every nail on the head that makes it a great no dare I say God-like game! Rouge-likes never were my thing but after playing through Hades, I'm more than willing to give it a chance now. This game may not be for everyone but give it a chance who knows?

I don't think you need me to convince you to play a game that's a little over 3 years old (almost five if you include how long it was in early access) that everyone, their mum, and their mum's dog have praised to hell (hehe) and back, but in short: I recommend this game.

I've played through the game and those types of reviews get the general gist of the game. This is a review of the main gripes I notice about the game and things I would change.

Onto the main gripes:
The amount of time that is just sapped away at not playing, it takes 5 seconds to go through a door, it takes two seconds selecting a boon. Alt-tabbing not progressing game time I can understand but needing to watch the same unskippable animation of the character moving for 5 seconds every minute or so is the worst.
The worst in sapping your time is resetting, the game doesn't ""reset"" if you quit and close, you have to intentionally die which given an upgraded mirror can take a bit.

The amount of time needed to get to a fully gameplay-complete save file is just too much. See above. You will get to a point where you can see what that entails which you then start to factor in how long each run takes and all those unskippable animations sap away on top of the time spent in gameplay is just way too much. Now there is additional cosmetic features that are included in the game that don't affect gameplay that you can grind that can be what takes a long time to complete but that should be the point if you want to continue playing not to the point of getting to a fully gameplay-complete save file.

The boss at the end of the run is not the final boss. It just doesn't feel right that the end boss you encounter isn't the final one that you have to intentionally turn on at the beginning of your run even though they are very similar. I would feel much better if there was an option mid-run to turn it on or if it was an additional objective afterwards rather than feeling like I am missing out on the full experience simply because I didn't turn it on beforehand for that run.

The game is so close to having all gameplay elements explained to you or figured out after some time. Like you will eventually get all the NPC interactions that affect gameplay eventually but you'd never know that turning on the timer heat shuts off certain rooms.",1699807449,1699807449,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

This game does everything right. It invites players to 'fail' which progresses the story no matter how often or where you fail in your mission to escape from Hell. I finished the main story and there is still SO much to do post credit sequence. The music is amazing to listen to, and the voice acting was beautifully done. It's reignited a desire to learn more about Greek mythos again, and I'm excited to see where they go with Hades II.

It's a greek mythology-based hack&slash action roguelite game that's focused on the son of the greek god Hades and his personal growth.

[h1] Which people probably won't like this game [/h1]

[b] If you don't like roguelite games [/b] (dying repeatedly, playing the same sections of the game over and over again, getting stronger with each death, having meta progression that persists between runs etc.) [b] then you'll probably not like Hades. [/b]

It's simple as - the game is repetitive in its gameplay loop, while the things keeping it fresh throughout its run are the story, the unlocks, build variety and weapon variety - the enemies, zones, bosses and general layouts stay basically the same all the time.

If you hate gameplay and theme repetition, you'll probably not like Hades.

[h1] The good [/h1]

If you're a fan of roguelites and their progression, of build variety, of beautiful art and music, of fast paced, reflex-based gameplay, of a fun spin and take on mythology then this game is for you.

[b] No microtransactions, DLC, expansions [/b] - The game is complete.

[b] Gameplay [/b] - Fast paced, dash-based, reaction-based action gameplay with a variety of weapons. It's fast, it's pretty and it's fun - readability is good, the enemy telegraphs are good, the bosses are amazing - it's mechanically perfect and it does exactly what it wants to. There are some very, very rare attacks that aren't perfect animation/design-wise, but considering how the HP economy works, the learning process of expecting those attacks isn't that annoying really.

[b] Music [/b] - It's great, it fits the theme, there's unlockable tracks in game (in-game currency only), it's even tied to a character in the story.

[b] Sound design [/b] - No complaints here - the sounds are meaty, the enemies sound nice, voice acting is perfect (not one voice line out of many of them is even close to being mediocre, let alone being bad).

[b] Story and characters [/b] - I don't usually play games for the story (barring a few exceptions like Yakuza for example), but the story really is inherently connected to the gameplay and the whole dying repeatedly thing this game like so much because it's a roguelite and it's a nice story, engaging till the end because of the well-written characters.

[b] Surrounding systems [/b] - As you play more and more you unlock more and more systems that help you get further and further - some of them are passive systems akin to permanent buffs, others are more engaging and require managing limited use items (per run).

[b] Graphics [/b] - The game is absolutely beautiful from beginning to end, including UI, the player hub, character portraits, enemy and friendly character models, spell effects, different god powers etc.

[b] Difficulty [/b] - There's a really, really nice difficulty selection and customization screen unlocked later on that allows players to fine-tune their game exactly how they want to (for example giving enemies bonus affixes ala ARPGs like Diablo or forcing themselves to give up bonuses that make up their build every once in a while or even just giving bosses more moves and phases etc.).

[b] Controls, optimization and UI design [/b] - The game is smooth, the gameplay is smooth, the UI is not cluttered and it's not minimalist to the point of being useless, the menus are clear, the game's mechanics are beautifully explained. It's a really intuitive game to get into.

[h1] The bad/mediocre [/h1]

So I've already said that the game is repetitive, but this isn't a bad thing for everyone - I personally don't mind it and it's obvious why repetition is necessary with a game like this and a story like this.

Another thing people might not like (but, again, this is more of a consequence of not liking roguelites in general) is the game basically forcing you to die to progress - theoretically it's possible for a first time player to just never die, but realistically the game needs some knowledge that gets accumulated through multiple runs (which is in sync with the story and is required for the story to actually advance, so it makes sense).
I personally can't lose a run of the game anymore (unless I'm going for ridiculously high difficulties sometimes for fun), so the game does reward pure skill.

Other than that... Uhm... Some weapons become somewhat useless at higher difficulty levels... I guess...

Yeah that's that, can't think of any other con.",1699636114,1699636145,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Too tanky enemies, too long runs with too little meta-progression.
That is, unless you find the process of bashing enemies fun by itself.

While it's not hard to memorize attack patterns and dodge, the enemies have a lot of HP, so you have to repeat same pattern again and again. 
Hit hit hit dash. Hit hit hit dash. Hit hit hit - one armored lout is down, four more to go.

You can levelup between runs, but per-run rewards are small and most of the options increase your survivability, not the DPS.

What's especially frustrating is that it is [i]borderline[/i] enjoyable - I like the story, characters, graphics, and (in theory) overall gameplay loop.
Maybe I would've enjoyed this game more, if simply all damage (even damage you receive) and rewards would be scaled 2x-3x-4x.

For fans of Roguelites this is a must play. The gameplay is quick, flows nicely and allows for different playstyles while retaining long-term engagement through different sidequests, that drive the overall story and allow you to unlock fluff and cosmetics and gameplay changing feats (different permutations of the weapons for example).

Supergiant Games is a studio I trust to have high-quality game design. I've played Bastion and I have Pyre in my game list to play through shortly. I was hesitant to play Hades, as I'm not really a fan of roguelikes (I earned three Boss Souls in Dead Cells before I gave up) even though I do enjoy some hard games. But the setting was intriguing and the art style, as always, was great.
Cue to me actually playing it.
The parts of the roguelike that make it a roguelike got to me. The difficulty and repetition (ESPECIALLY in Elysium) was disheartening to work through. Though the entire process was smooth and easy to manage actually playing the game was frustrating and difficult. I ended up turning on God Mode, with a 44% reduction in damage overall. From there, the game was much more enjoyable.
I didn't 100% the game. I progressed through most relationship tracks and I found the epilogue, but beating the game entirely leaves me feeling numb. It's a great game, don't get me wrong, but I like a game with a defined ending. Roguelikes like Vampire Survivors I tend to need some other certain something to keep me going, in most cases listening to podcasts while I played, and unfortunately the music and sound design in Hades is far too good to play on mute.
So, all in all: the game won me over to at least finish it by having top-tier design and direction every step of the way. If you're even a little amenable to roguelikes I would recommend this game. But if you don't like roguelikes at all, this game will have all the hallmarks of the genre that make it a tough ask, in which case I'd either recommend God Mode, or just watching a playthrough on YouTube.",1699591386,1699591386,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Quality across the board in almost every aspect. In modern day, apparently almost no shining gem escapes the fate of adding mindless grinds to pad content. Most things in Hades are high quality at worst. Combat, voice acting, character development/writing (especially for this genre), art, music... it's all high quality. It's been a long time since I had as much fun in fights as I regularly did here. Upgrades are varied enough, bosses change abilities between runs. Really all of the actual gameplay rocks. I mean all that genuinely, so don't be thrown off by the below. 

Despite Hades' general awesomeness, all big hits apparently need a slow-drip dopamine IV system. The game is an utter grind, forcing you to repeat the same stuff an insane amount of times to not only get upgrades and progress, but see the game's ending. This clogs up the game every step of the way with countless currencies, and many other facets for endless repetition disguised as content. 

You have to beat this at least 9 times to see the actual ending. This feels really exploitative just like the forced grind related to currencies and other unlocks. How is it an enjoyable design feature to constantly give you the choice of ""pick crappy upgrade to get further through the grind, or pick actual useful upgrade that increases chance of winning""? The story is well told, yet you have to keep beating the whole game to get a few lines about the actual story - repeat for a couple more. The storytelling could have been done in far less playthroughs and felt better instead of like I'm getting one bite of a cookie a day.

Ridiculous grinds disguised as content are a growing poison to gaming and I'm getting really fed up with it. Still the rest of the game is damn good so I just let it waste my time and pretend it's fine. Addictive substances do sell well, eh.

One of the best things about the game is that it manages to have a story in a way that no roguelike before has had. I found myself actually caring about the characters and their storylines. The voice acting is top notch, each character's personality coming through wonderfully. It is also incredible that after 65 runs, I don't think I've heard any character repeat a line. Even if I have, it is amazing that there is such variety that I can't remember it. The writing is just so good. It manages both humor and heartfelt moments to such a high degree of quality.

The gameplay is also some of the best I've seen in a roguelike. Even near the end of my playthrough, 65 runs in, I still enjoyed each one because the combat is so satisfying. Each run I could try a new weapon, a new aspect, a new trinket, or a new build with my boons. The variety on offer here is endless. The fact that I was never bored despite all my grinding for resources speaks to how fun and varied this game is.

The heat system is a brilliant way to introduce difficulty. It is great that you can slowly add more heat to your runs to get used to new challenges and modifiers, and it is just another way the game introduces variety.

I'm just happy I finally completed this game. Yet I still have things to see. I cannot wait for the sequel to arrive and hopefully somehow improve on a game that is already so good.",1699373586,1699373586,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The actual game is incredibly short. It's just elongated by having an enormous grind attached to it. Literally had a perfect run that took less than 30 mins... that's how short the game is content wise.

The progression within the game is nonsensical and monotonous with no feeling of reward once you've spent literal hours to earn something. What you can actively make choices on to benefit your character results in a few % points increase if that for something that took ages to grind for. You gain resources to upgrade weapons from 1 boss, but have to kill the boss on the next tier to be able to upgrade the weapons. You are finally able to unlock certain items AFTER you have killed the last boss which doesn't make sense for a game about progression. 

The game promotes being very quick since you end up dying a lot to progress. Yet, there are times where there are valuable chests and urns with money dotted around that are highly useful to your run along with fishing. But in turn, you have to pause to look around for them. It completely breaks the pace of the game, especially when you see one mid fight and forget about it.

Due to the fast nature of the game, i gave up listening/reading dialogue that was often slight variations of what was said before.

Pyre uses character-driven storytelling

Together, they created a Greek mythology of greater freedom and freerfighting. They recreate the subtle relationships between the gods of theunderworld and the antagonism of the gods of Olympus, which, inCasavin's own words, ""allows the player to observe his own dysfunctionafamily."" Then, from the unique perspective of Zaglios, the ""Hades escapeprince"", it interprets a unique, sacred but comedic ""family farce"". Becauseof the intricacies of Greek mythology, Kasavin and his team designed morethan 10 hours of NPC branch dialogue to skillfully present the volatilerelationships between gods and heroes (including the problem of multipleorientations) without changing the general direction.

It's an incredible take on the rogue-like skill-based dungeon-crawling games. This one has story that requires you to die several times for you to slowly progress it. It's really masterful. It keeps you coming back, wanting to do your best gathering resources during your outings to be rewarded with new little pieces of fully voiced dialogue, and all VA did a stupendous job!

The weapons give you a ton of variety, as do builds, compensating for you using the same guy during your probably hundreds of outings when you're done with the game. I love the little nods they give to the Greek mythology they're based on, like the little jokes Zagreus plays on Orpheus about a certain connection to another god. There is tons of character developing while still making sense while your quest has to be never ending, regardless, and if you want to go to the deep end, it'll be a while before you have the currencies to fully pimp out your house and get all the cool knickknacks and useful accessories.

It's just such a blast to decide what your next run is going to be like, and it's always a little bit harder, but just a tiny, little bit in a way you can decide. I'm not kidding.

First off, the game plays well, and if you just want to play it, try the weapons, and experience the dialogue, maybe use the nectar/ambrosia to get some more, have some nice runs but not try to win, unlocking as much as you want, go for it, that's honestly the highlight of this game for most people.

Anything more than that, though, and RNG, required difficulty modifiers and the last level and boss rear their ugly heads.

To get the basic ending of the game (the one that gives you the credits but not the ""real"" ending), you need to beat the final boss 10 times and then win one time after (with new modifiers that you set before the run each time if you use the same weapon, so 6 free wins and 4 you have to do with some modifier if you CAN manage to win with each weapon), and then for the canon ""secret"" real ending after that, you need to progress all the athenean god's relation meters with farmed Nectar/Ambrosia and then visit them each once after to get the real, definitive end of the story.

The problem is getting there, though. Rng will give you gods that aren't just Ares (pure damage) and Athena (Bullet deflection and mitigation), and the last level is literally designed to chip away gradually at your health and revives, and you CANNOT get it all back before the final fight because the shop costs are too high by then. Thus a lot of runs will be failed just because you died too much earlier or took too much damage in the last level, boons and performance beforehand not really mattering too much (if you got enough gold on the way to heal and get your revives back, that is) because the final boss projectile spams and will likely kill you at least twice, so you need at least 2 revives AND enough damage to actually kill him before you run out of hp.

This being said, Hades 2 is in production and that last area issue could be fixed in it, so. Maybe give this a try if you wanna just play it for awhile, but, honestly, just look up the real and secret endings, don't try to get them unless you really, really want to.",1699097446,1699097446,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you are into action roguelikes or Greek mythology, Hades will be your favorite go-to game. Help Zagreus escape the Underworld and discover what a bird even means (he doesn't know.)

[h1]Full Review[/h1]

Let me start from afar. Video games as a medium are a way to escape unpleasant or uneventful everyday life. That is escapism, a necessary psychological device to divert thoughts from sadness, loss, or boredom. You can see it in every type of entertainment, not merely video games. Likewise, roguelikes have deep roots in literal 'escape' concerning their narrative (the hero always tries to escape a dungeon or labyrinth or even their fate). We might call it double escapism. At the same time, stories in most roguelikes only distantly resemble real-life situations. That is where Supergiant makes a difference. They not only create an addictive game with exceptional style and music, but they also tell a deeply allegorical coming-of-age story. You know, the type of story every one of us might live through at some point because there are no ideal families or relationships. It returns us from the whimsical world (should I say Underworld?) to our everyday life with new feelings, thoughts, and a desire to sort everything through. That is the highest praise I could imagine for an entertainment medium.

Hades follows the story of a young godling Zagreus, or Zag for short, and his relationship with his tyrant father, Hades, the god of the Underworld himself. Hades (the god) demands from his son, whom he scornfully calls 'boy,' to be responsible, respectful, and obedient like a servant. At the same time, he is reluctant to show some love or appreciation toward anyone in the House. For Zag, there is only one way to deal with the situation: running away to relatives on Olympus. The problem is that no one can escape the Underworld, even a godling! And so we start our desperate journey as Zag, trying to leave the domain of the dead in search of a better fate. The story goes deep; its narration threads through many dialogs with different characters, intertwined between escape attempts into one whole piece. Slowly, the perspective shifts: the initial father-son conflict reveals underlying problems and broader themes. My favorite includes exercising honesty and outspokenness and why it is not always the best course of action in a manifold family to tell everything head-on. I love Greek mythology and Ancient Greek literature, and I must admit the level of detail is brilliant. There are many myths from different sources; Supergiant mindfully chooses its interpretations for a consistent story. It is worth noting that they had a certain degree of freedom regarding the protagonist and his relations with everyone due to his minor significance in Greek mythology. Even there, though, in late interactions with Dionysus, we can learn about [spoiler]how the Orphic Dionysus Zagreus tradition has an internal explanation.[/spoiler] So, yeah, the immersion in the theme is brilliant. I mean it!

Gameplay-wise, Hades is as addictive as a perfect roguelike should be. You rely on your wit, reaction (sometimes even sense of rhythm), and luck to fight through the ever-changing environment with hundreds of possible adjustments to strategy and tactics. I could play games like Crypt of the NecroDancer or Dicey Dungeons in short sessions, but Hades? Nope. I play it, and play it, and play it. Again and again. It is so very addictive! Different weapons, boons, power-ups, and combinations result in some weird and powerful twists to efficient tactics, which is an example of RNG done right. If you die, you can start again a bit stronger (if you gather enough Darkness, that is) through the process amusingly called Reflecting. [spoiler]This technicality, by the way, means the game belongs to the roguelite subgenre.[/spoiler] Core mechanics might seem harsh, but mastering them requires only time. Just play some more, and you will naturally overcome the obstacle. Despite this 'intentional replayability,' it starts to feel repetitive only when you finish the main story. At that point, the only way of raising the challenge is through the customizable Pact of Punishment, a plot device to make your post-story runs harder.

As always with Supergiant, the voice acting and music are exceptional. Beautiful melodies combined with heavier riffs and reverberations greatly suit the game's style and story. And when Orpheus (Darren Korb, the composer) and Eurydice (Ashley Barrett) start singing, their verses seem out of this world. It is not a simple task to assume the roles of the legendary musician and his partner/muse. Somehow, Darren and Ashley pull it out so smoothly! I had tears and goosebumps listening to In the Blood during credits. Magnificent!

Lastly, I want to briefly mention the Fated List of Minor Prophecies and the detailed statistics menu in the Administrative Chamber. It all adds depth to the choice-making during escape attempts. Nuances like those contribute to the entire thing, making it much more enjoyable. And, well, there is also fishing.

However, what makes Hades different from the other rogue lite games on the market is its narrative and its amount of dialogues which are driven by the game's cycle.

In Hades, death isn't death. If Zagreus dies, he returns to his father but Zagreus is never defeated and that is part of the beauty of Hades as a game. Your character dies and when you get back home, you'll have new dialogues corresponding to what happened in your last run. Then, you'll have some characters helping you and some will even complaint about you defeating them in your attempt to escape. These dialogues and the intricate personalities of the characters makes it incredibly immersive as you'll feel like your previous attempt at escaping the hells (Because yes that is what the game loop is about find out more by playing) feel like they mattered.

When it comes to its progression system, you'll have the opportunity to unlock new passives which will make escape attempts a lot easier. Eventually you'll gain items from characters and by equipping one of them, you'll be able to shape what type of game play you want to go for. That is, do you want to tank the living hell out of every hell's layers or will you make this a full on glass cannon and show off your bullet hell skills? Which brings us to the next point, you'll get to pick weapons which each have specific bonuses in their game play and different boons, some reward timings, some reward dexterity and other rewards being tanky. Eventually you'll even get to upgrade them, gaining extra useful perks by doing so.

In the end, you'll notice that the achievement to escape the hells is pretty common amongst the player base, that is because Hades doesn't end when you think it will. For the sheer reason that I won't get into any spoilers, you'll have to discover that one out for yourself.

Overall, Hades is an incredibly fun rogue lite which nails its core rogue lite mechanics and spices its gameplay up with its game changing narrative.

Hades is one of those games where you start out about as strong as a piece of wet tissue, die a LOT, and get a bit stronger each run. Think Vampire Survivors. Combat is not like Vampire Survivors though, as you have full control of the main character.

Great music and art style.

You have to talk to a lot of people, and several stories unfold concurrently during your runs through the stages. Think Soap Opera.

You slowly unlock different weapons, each unique and fun to play. Some make finishing a run easier, while finishing a run with others isn't so easy. Different boons (status effects) are more suited to certain weapons.

I'm not personally much for these types of games where you run through the same content over and over, mixing and matching status effects, and intentionally bumping up the difficulty to see just how much pain you can endure.
