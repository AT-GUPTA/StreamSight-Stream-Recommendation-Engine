DIFFICULTY: 7.5 / 10
Undoubtedly, the first hours of the game will be spent on the first - second floor. The variety and diversity of ETG never ceases to amaze me even after so many hours. The enemies are smart, they turn the tables and can squeeze you. Of course, over time you will get used to it and be able to play almost without damage, but the beginning in ETG is countless deaths.
Roll - good and evil.
I had 3 phases of opinion about the roll:

""Damn, immortality during a roll?! That's imbued!""

“I hate rolling! I always fly straight into a bullet or into a hole! I’d rather just walk!”

“Oh, a roll is good, but the main thing is to watch where you do it, and sometimes It's better to just pass""

And so, I ABSOLUTELY recommend playing ETG, because the different mechanics of the characters make them really different, the rooms and floors are complex, the bosses are interesting, the graphics are beautiful.
What did I NOT like? Perhaps the fact that the 5 main floors and secret floors have no analogues, the locations quickly become boring.
The boss rush appears at the moment when it is no longer needed and you are already accustomed to most bosses, and besides, it also requires payment.
Some achievements are strange and are obtained in an extremely dubious way through actions that you are unlikely to do during a regular race.

In conclusion, I want to say that I absolutely recommend playing ETG for people who are partial to bagels, because people who have not played this genre will find the game too difficult and you will most likely quit it.

""Enter the Gungeon"" is, without a shadow of a doubt, a spectacular masterpiece in the world of indie gaming. From the very moment I stepped into the whimsical, trigger-happy world of Gungeon, I was utterly captivated. This game isn't just a run-and-gun, it's a relentless barrage of creativity and fun that keeps you hooked for hours on end.

The first thing that grabs you by the eyeballs is the game's unique and visually striking art style. Every pixel is a work of art, from the quirky characters to the intricately designed firearms. It's like playing a Saturday morning cartoon, only with way more bullets and explosions. The attention to detail is astounding; you can't help but admire the loving craftsmanship that went into creating this world.

But ""Enter the Gungeon"" isn't just about looks – it's got the game-play to match and exceed expectations. The core mechanic of dodging and rolling through torrents of bullets is exhilarating, making every gunfight feel like a high-octane dance of survival. The controls are razor-sharp, and mastering them is a satisfying journey in itself. As you progress, you'll find yourself weaving through bullet hell scenarios that require a blend of quick reflexes and clever strategy, making each encounter feel fresh and exciting.

The sheer variety of guns and items in the Gungeon is staggering. From the basic pea-shooter to the ludicrously overpowered makeshift cannon, every firearm has its quirks, making experimentation an absolute joy. It's hard not to cackle maniacally when you discover a new weapon or unlock a game-changing item. And don't even get me started on the synergies! The combinations of items and guns can lead to some absurdly fun and powerful load-outs that keep the game-play endlessly entertaining.

Speaking of endless entertainment, ""Enter the Gungeon"" features rogue-like elements that ensure no two runs are the same. The procedural generation of levels keeps you on your toes, and the unpredictable boss fights are both challenging and satisfying. Each character you can play as comes with their own unique abilities and story-lines, adding layers of replay-ability. The excitement of discovering new secrets, hidden chambers, and quirky NPCs is boundless.

The soundtrack deserves special mention. The music in ""Enter the Gungeon"" is a glorious symphony of bullets and beats, perfectly complementing the intense action on-screen. It's one of those rare soundtracks that you'll find yourself humming long after you've put the controller down.

And let's not forget the humor! The game is packed with puns, references, and quirky dialogue that will keep you grinning from ear to ear. It's clear that the developers had a blast creating this world, and that joy is infectious.

In conclusion, ""Enter the Gungeon"" is a bullet-hell ballet that's as fun to watch as it is to play. Its unique blend of pixel art charm, relentless action, and endless surprises make it a true gem in the indie gaming universe. Whether you're a fan of rogue-likes, twin-stick shooters, or just looking for a game that oozes personality and fun, ""Enter the Gungeon"" is an absolute must-play. So, lock and load, dodge those bullets, and dive headfirst into this quirky, chaotic, and utterly fantastic adventure. You won't be disappointed!",1693840855,1708874972,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This wasn't one of those games that just immediately hooked me and had me playing non-stop.. It was the kind where I played a little then decided I wanted to play something else. I'd come back to bum around the game a little, then go play something else. For a while I had decided I really didn't want to play it anymore at all. Then, I guess, at a certain point it kinda clicked, and that's when I racked up my hours of playtime.

Here's the issue with this one - a lot of roguelike games like this, you've got a certain amount of meta progression - depending on how well you play each round, you'll earn some kind of 'progression currency,' and once you go back to the main menu, you can buy health upgrades or attack upgrades or whatever... Well, the meta progression in ETG is a lot more basic. I may not have progressed far enough to find out otherwise, but so far I'm finding that I'm not upgrading my total health, attack power, or anything like that, but rather just unlocking certain guns and items for future runs. So while you might unlock a great gun for future runs, you're always going to start with the same basic stats, and you just kinda hope you get that cool gun you unlocked in each run.

This was partly why I kept stopping playing - most games of this type give you that sense of making progress. You won't get very far, but you get that progression currency and buy a health upgrade, so the next round you get a little farther, get a little more progression points, buy an even better upgrade, get even farther. In ETG, it's all play skill - you only get farther because you get better at playing. While that is a nice challenge, it just wasn't as fun to me.

I kept coming back, though, because the gameplay is actually pretty fun. There are quite a few guns to be collected (more as you unlock them), it's bullet-hell-ish without being completely overwhelming, and the levels (procedurally-generated) are 'different' enough that you don't wind up feeling like you're just doing different versions of the same thing over and over. 

The old-school-ish graphics are fun and entertaining, the sounds are silly and engaging, and the world has lots of flavor. It's also pretty darn silly. The lore in the game is actually fun to read - in between runs, you can read silly background facts about the enemies, the different guns, the items you can collect, and so on. And some of it is just absurd. (Such as the bullet-shaped gun which fires gun-shaped bullets, each of which fire bullets at bullet-shaped enemies carrying guns that shoot bullets at you. Yes. That.)

So while I do give this game a 'thumbs up,' it is with a caveat: if you're anything like me, you may not really 'get into' this game right away, or you might lose interest altogether. This game would probably be sitting in the back corners of my library, untouched, if I hadn't randomly decided to give it another go at a certain point. Because again, while it's fun, that real lack of meta progression (besides 'unlocking items that you can find in the gungeon in the future') kinda threw me off.

But, now that I've put in a decent amount of time, I've had quite a bit of fun with it, have enjoyed myself, and have gained a little skill, so I do halfway ok in the world.

Worth full price? I don't know. I'd wait for a sale before pulling the trigger, because I could see some people giving up (like I did for a while) and I'd hate for people to be disappointed. You may find in the end that you believe the game to be well worth the fifteen bucks, but why take a risk? Just wait for a sale or buy a bundle or something, just in case you don't.

Not my favorite game in the world, but it's fun, and I like it.",1708791127,1708791127,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The reason that this beta build garbage managed to become not only overwhelmingly positive but one of the most well regarded indie games I know of is so far beyond me the only reason I know it exists at all is that it was recently picked up by Voyager 2. The bosses are bullshit, the enemies are bullshit (fuck you lead maiden), the game itself is more focused on overdone references than providing a playable experience, losing a fight feels like dying for no reason, winning a fight is either ""Wow, that worked?"" or ""Wow, that shouldn't have worked."" and worst of all, none of the guns are satisfying enough to be actually fun. They always kill in 2 to 3 more shots than you expect, and anytime you find one you actually like, you'll run out of ammo within this floor or the next and you'll probably never see it again. If you want a fun roguelite shooter where your arsenal slowly becomes more and more powerful against an endless army, try either Atomicrops, if you've got a soft spot for strategy, time management, or farming in games, Risk of Rain 2, if you like hero shooters, modding things to high heavens, giving yourself epilepsy tests, and interesting lore, or Vampire Survivors, if you like turning your brain off and shiny colors.

I never felt this way towards EtG myself; I think it's a very well-paced and well-designed game. In fact, it's the epitome of Roguelite game design - design that has not waned in the face of competition for 8 years on the market now.

The unique presentation of EtG certainly played a big part in its appeal to me. In the pursuit of the gun that can kill the past, players are dropped into a dungeon where everything is gun or bullet-themed; the stages (""chambers"") are all plays on gun-related themes or words. The elevators are big bullets, the enemies are shells or cartridges, even the bosses are made of guns or are named after guns, like the Ammoconda or Dragun.

Currency is dealt in casings, cursed enemies are aptly named ""jammed"" instead of ""damned""; this corny theme reveals a well thought-out universe with a sense of consistency to it, making you want to see more of what it has to offer. The spritework is downright gorgeous, and the game runs well. Significant effort went into making each stage feel like a lively micro-cosmos, as if the players have intruded on the inhabitants' daily lives by simply being present.

Tables are laden with food and drink, getting scattered across the floor as shots whiz past them. Crates, pots, vases, barrels and armor stands outline each room, soaking up projectile damage if taken cover behind, or shattering if bumped into. The walls gradually fill with bullet holes when shot, characters leave dust clouds in their trail, and the mayhem left in their wake further takes form in spent bullet casings, spilled liquids, and enemy corpses on the ground.

This is what sets EtG apart from other games in the genre - the attention to detail. The player and the enemies are not the sole focus of the stage; great effort went into making each firefight feel like it came straight out of a movie. Not all objects and particles are there just for show, though: there is purpose to the braziers, lanterns, liquid drains in each room, indirectly aiding in dealing with your opponents during the fight.

Explosive barrels can be kicked across the floor, then neutralized with a shot or a roll depending on the desired outcome. Levers can be pulled to drop chandeliers or rocks on top of unsuspecting foes. Barrels full of liquid gas or toxic poison can help deny areas from enemies if utilized to their fullest extent. There are holes in the floor that foes can be pushed into, or spikes, fires, crush traps players must be careful not to trigger.

Tables and coffins can further be used during battle to create temporary cover, or a means to gain invulnerability if slid across. The latter incorporates the dodge-roll mechanic, a neat multi-purpose design that takes after the dash from other games in the genre. Not only does a player gain invulnerability by dodge-rolling, they also neutralize hazards in doing so, and can leap over traps and pits as if they were jumping. On top of that, the roll is able to deal damage.

Enemies then appropriately react to these actions, taking cover behind tables themselves, or shooting where they predict the player will move next. The AI is competent - it telegraphs attacks well, and tries to shoot explosives near players if any are found within their vicinity. Some enemies might feature multiple attack patterns, or explode into revenge-bullets on death, and some can even be used to kill other enemies in stark contrast to other Roguelites.

I would like to point out a flaw within EtG's design, and that is the health scaling used to strengthen the enemies in later game stages. In my eyes, it serves as an unnecessary gear-check, an artificial barrier that stems from the weapons becoming less efficient the longer you play. I'm glad new stages offer new enemies to face off against, however I don't appreciate old enemies gaining more health and resilience to my guns.

That said, the weapon selection aiding in dealing with these foes is so vast, their health often does not matter. Some weapons take after their real-life counterparts, such as the M16 or the AK-47, others are completely imaginary or abstract. As with any other good Roguelite, there are plenty of references to other videogames, and weapons can even synergize with others in your loadout, empowering one if another is picked up.

You'd think that with hundreds of weapons on offer, the selection would get repetitive, but most weapons are surprisingly unique and efficient. Some fire in bursts of varying degrees of accuracy and rates of fire, some are semi-automatic or require charging, others fire in a spread or in a beam configuration. Many interact with the debuff system, causing enemies to burn, freeze, get slowed, poisoned, or even turn into harmless chickens.

More importantly - and this is something I’ve never seen another game do - is their interaction with the reload system. Many weapons will switch phases upon reloading, changing the behavior of the weapon to a more damaging mode with less ammo, or a burst-fire mode, or a different projectile entirely. This makes you adapt to the weapon you’re carrying and gives it a unique personality or quirk.

I believe the main issue players have with this game is the amount of drops initially being very limited, forcing them to fight the first boss with sub-optimal weaponry, making for a very tedious fight. I do also believe over the course of the game’s lifespan the devs actively attempted to address this issue, and as far as I'm concerned, they did so successfully.

Players start with one key for one out of two chests that spawn per level, and during the first floor they further gain enough currency to buy another key or another weapon, with both guaranteed to spawn in the first shop. This can potentially get them rolling (no pun intended) provided luck plays in their favor. There are other means with which players can get weapons, such as discovering secrets or playing minigames.

I personally compensate for this design by playing one of the two characters who sport two starter weapons; all the characters would have been given the same treatment if it were up to me. Switching weapons and using an Active diversifies each engagement and adds to the decision-making aspect of combat. In that, the design of the other characters remains lacking, but provided how easy it is to obtain new weapons I don't give this much significance.

The Actives and Passives are somewhat forgettable, I assume intentionally. They take a back seat to the weapon selection the game puts on offer. Many of the Passives raise max health or improve damage and accuracy, which is pretty boring. Many Actives are about throwing or setting down explosives to temporarily boost damage output. It will mainly be the weapon selection that will draw your interest and provide a reason for you to keep playing.

EtG is a very accessible game, and does many things right that its predecessors do not - for example, teleporting between explored areas, which I believe this game pioneered. Currency magnetizes to you when you finish a room, you can drop, sell, or combine weapons you don't need, and gain health ups by defeating bosses flawlessly. If not for its other strengths, it's also a highly replayable game, thanks to its strong meta-progression system and roster of NPCs.

It's quirky and humorous, I honestly don't see a reason not to recommend this - provided you can stomach the slower-burning runs, and the occasional run-in with bad RNG.",1707303018,1708377995,True,31,2,0.774706065654754639,0,True,False,False

Whats the point of having a hub when the unlocks doesn't do anything to help you ease into it when you start? It is mainly stuff for people that can already clear it, shortcuts, more gunzzz, challenge runs. The game play is reliant on having a range of fun guns, so your base set is poor.

The game's roster of adversaries spans from the quirky to the downright badass, creating an engaging experience that caters to both casual and hardcore players.

One of the standout features of Enter The Gungeon is the variety of enemies encountered throughout the game. Some foes feel like they were tailor-made to be your personal punching bag, allowing for satisfying and strategic combat encounters. On the flip side, there are adversaries designed to make  every run a living hell, pushing you to adapt and improve your skills.

While the character selection may seem limited at first glance, the game compensates with an extensive arsenal of guns and items to choose from. Initially, I was disappointed by the lack of character diversity, but as I delved deeper into the game, I found solace in the vast array of weapons and power-ups. The developers have done a commendable job of ensuring that each playthrough feels unique, offering a plethora of tools to experiment with and discover new, exciting combinations.

One thing to note is the inclusion of intentionally weak and useless guns and items. While these additions may induce frustration initially, they contribute to the game's charm by encouraging players to experiment and find unexpected ways to turn the tide in their favor. It's all part of the learning curve that makes Enter The Gungeon both challenging and rewarding.

One of the game's highlights is the presence of guns that can truly turn the tables. From the awe-inspiring to the downright absurd, there are firearms capable of obliterating bosses with a single, well-placed shot. This element injects an extra layer of excitement into each run, keeping players on their toes as they hope to stumble upon these game-changing weapons.

In conclusion, Enter The Gungeon is a must-play for fans of bullet-hell and roguelike genres. The diverse range of enemies, coupled with an extensive arsenal of guns and items, ensures that no two runs are ever the same. While character variety might be lacking, the game's emphasis on strategic combat and unexpected surprises more than makes up for it.",1707649620,1707649677,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Basically everything is great, so I'll just list the cons. 

Health system is frustrating, and the loot can be abysmal. There's a lot of luck involved. It's the sort of game where you don't feel like pushing forwards all the time, and it kind of hurts to play at times. You might beat a stage and end up on 2-3 hit points, which is what you start with next stage. It feels like it wants me to restart runs if I get poor loot and take some stupid hits, which is pretty common given the existence of plenty of environmental hazards.

If that and the difficulty doesn't bother you, give this a try.

[h2]The good[/h2]
The game is 99% skill-based. I'll get to the other 1% in a second, but rest assured that dying is almost always entirely your own fault. Items and guns are certainly impactful, but the biggest deciding factor is simply how good you are at shooting enemies and dodging enemy bullets. You will not roll into gamebreaking invincibility combos like in Isaac.

There is also strategy to be found in how and when to spend your resources. Arguably there is less in this regard than Isaac, but it's definitely there. This ""meta"" aspect is what Isaac mainly focuses on, while this game mostly focuses on skill and the actual gameplay instead. I like both, for different reasons.

There are ""cheese limiters"" in place and this is actually genius game design. When you get an ammo box and leave the room, the Resourceful Rat will come in pretty quickly to steal it. Same with keys. This prevents degenerate or boring strategies, like leaving all ammo pickups on the ground and then picking it up right before you leave the floor. This is also done with weapons and items, to prevent players from cheesing the game by swapping active items all the time. The Rat forces you to make meaningful decisions at that current moment... and the game even gives you a rather roundabout ""out"" to remove him from the current run if you wish. This means the developers can just balance the game normally and not have to worry about making mechanics too weak when un-cheesed, or making them too strong if cheesed.

After all these years, while writing this review, I just realized the Rat is a pun on him being an anti-cheese mechanic which I find endlessly amusing.

The game's art style is good. It works well, it looks charming, and the game clearly telegraphs dangers. Other than a single floor sprite in Level 5, I have never felt like I unfairly took damage from something I couldn't very clearly see... but more on that later.

The tutorial is good and serves as a good way to get people to learn the game. Big props for not just dropping people directly into the game until they learn by trial and error.

The game has plenty of secrets, but some are really hard to find. One is hidden in the tutorial which is a place people generally won't search in. I like the secrets. Secret rooms are hit or miss (especially their rewards vs. how hard they are to find) but I appreciate that they exist. The secret stages are fun and rewarding.

Rainbow Mode is interesting. I find that it makes the game too easy, but it's a fun alternative way to play the game. I just fear that newbies will be grasping at Rainbow Mode to get the unlocks, stick on it forever, and won't learn the game properly.

The soundtrack is fine. It's not very memorable, but it sets the tone and sounds good. It's not an absolute banger but it fits the game and I like it.

The technical aspects of the game are about as good as you can ask for. It runs well, runs at any resolution, runs at any framerate/refresh rate, and I have encountered zero bugs (even minor ones) in all my playthroughs. Big plus for letting controller users manually force certain button prompts, too! If the game doesn't recognize my PS4 controller as being a PS4 controller, I can just force the button prompts into the PS4 icons.

[h2]The Bad[/h2]
I said the game is 99% skill-based, for a reason. To properly ""beat"" the game, you must first work towards completing The Bullet That Can Kill The Past in your runs. This means doing a specific thing to get 1 out of 4 items, and then beating the first ""final"" boss while holding the item. You don't have to do them all in 1 run at the same time.

The problem is, acquiring 2 out of 4 of these items is RNG-based. One item needs flight or a liquid gun, the other item needs you to gather enough money before a specific floor. These are not guaranteed even if you play perfectly.

I like the concept that some of these items suck up resources like money or an active item slot, and I like that you might have to make a potentially dangerous detour on Floor 5 to turn these items in. Because it requires you to ""punch above your weight"" a little bit before you can proceed further into the game. But they could have handled the random aspects a little more gracefully.

Unlocking The Robot as a character is incredibly tedious. It's not hard - just really tedious. I question what value is added by having the Broken TV be [i]dropped[/i] when you roll. It's an annoyance at best and it feels like a cheap trick to catch you off-guard and force you to restart a few times. Mechanically speaking this would have been much more fun and interesting if it simply hogged an active item slot, and nothing else. If this isn't enough, maybe it should have just prevented you from picking up or using armor instead.

The game suffers from momentum just a little bit too hard. You do really poorly in the game and get very little rewards until you get over this ""hump"" and then you suddenly do [i]REALLY[/i] well because you're getting rewarded left and right. Getting hit by an enemy means they drop less/no money. Getting hit during a boss means you lose out on an HP upgrade. The rich get richer, the poor get clapped into more poverty.

This is a [i]positive[/i] thing for some people and it can feel rewarding to obtain proof that you beat bosses hitless, but I don't like the Master Round or ""damage = no money"" mechanic as a whole.

The game has ""Magnificence"" mechanics in place that prevent you from getting insanely lucky by getting a lot of high-quality chests or a whole bunch of pickups all at once, basically preventing you from steamrolling the game through luck alone. Problem being that Magnificence does not apply the other way around. There are safeguards in place against getting a whole bunch of red chests, but the game is perfectly willing to give you only brown and blue chests for the whole game if you get unlucky. This is a minor nitpick but it feels really cheap.

Pickup RNG isn't kept in check properly. This game is skill-based for the most part, and while the game guarantees you'll get randomly dropped pickups [i]eventually[/i], the game can still give you the middle finger and literally [i]refuse[/i] to give you any ammo pickups or keys, insisting on giving you only hearts and maybe some armor or glass guon stones the entire time. Or maybe the next run you get showered with 3 ammo boxes in a row that you can't even use because you're already full.

With ammo being this incredibly important in the game, they should have tracked it separately so that while you can still run out if you're not careful, you shouldn't be forced to play half the game with just the starter pistol.

Trap rooms feel bad. This is slightly lessened by the teleport mechanic existing, but a badly placed trap room is incredibly annoying and often leads to more damage than you oughta take just because you haven't wiki'd the best way to get past them yet.

The ""on fire"" debuff stays until you roll to put it out. This could have been made a little more obvious, perhaps a loading screen tip? The first time it happened to me was about 40 hours in (it's a rare status effect), and I just saw all my health drain away until I died. On a related note, some floors in Level 5 set you on fire and this isn't as clearly telegraphed as it probably should be.",1522166788,1706740284,True,0,0,0.384179413318634033,8,True,False,False

- runs are really tough but completely skill-dependent: as soon as you start growing into the mechanics you can beat the game with the shi t tiest guns (albeit it'll be a chore)
- artstyle is fantastic and nailed the D&D backdrop perfectly
- contrary to Isaac battles are very well balanced: you cannot 1shot all bosses and rooms as well as you don't have damage scale bosses which was a lazy ass cringe mechanic to combat being OP as hell with the right items. Even with great guns bosses are still a challenge and you need to time your dodges right, without it you will just perish
- crammed full of details that make each room exploration a treat, music is godlike
- near endless replayability due to how varied the RNG feels like here
- pop culture references feel done right, they're not in your face and will probably age a lot more gracefully than referencing rage comics and old memes (looking at you Edmund again)
- everything is shooting and guns: this has been referenced in countless reviews but it is a very important aspect, the humor and gun-ness of this game is just perfect, it's basically a giant homage to firearm culture and history

all in all my favourite roguelike at the moment and something I gladly fire up to let out 40 minutes of stress - if you liked Isaac I highly recommend grabbing this one as I view it to be superior in almost every way. Just don't be put off by the difficulty curve, it may seem impossible at first but trust me you'll git gud and see it through.",1703590227,1705945617,True,3,1,0.509536802768707275,0,True,False,False

While it may not quite have the sheer number of items found in The Binding of Isaac, the core mechanics and gameplay loop are very finely tuned and dodging around the various enemies and boss bullet patterns never stops being enjoyable. The game can get very challenging but always feels fair.

Not to say there isn't significant variety either, as while the number of items and guns is lower there is arguably more variety to them. Many of the guns are very creative where a lot of the items in The Binding of Isaac are simply stat boosts. On top of that there are synergies available for almost every gun in the game, and these can range from stat boosts to completely changing how guns function, summoning a familiar, dual wielding or combining two guns together into a more powerful one. There are also quite a few different rare characters/rooms that can be found occasionally, as well as rare bosses/mini-bosses that occasionally show up.

This isn't even getting into the presentation side, which is very charming. The soundtrack is also good, not the best you'll ever hear but it's got some catchy tunes which are fitting. I just wish there was more variety, like unique boss themes for the final boss(es). All in all an excellent game well worth the price.",1705260892,1705260892,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has loads of content, in the form of weapons, items, bosses, floors, and endings. There are multiple starting characters each with a different loadout supporting different styles of play (except melee, melee is a sin in this game). 

There are lots of secrets and unlockables as well, giving you a nice sense of progression in the game as you discover them. You will unlock thousands of unique items that you can find in your future runs. The other form of progression comes with experience: you will die a lot starting out, it takes a lot of time to learn attack patterns and enemy types. 

This game is THE best rougelike in my opinion. It’s always fast paced and you always have a chance of beating your run even if you get bad RNG. 

It’s very well priced at only $15 and has lots of content included.  The game has good quality pixel art and a majority of the guns are super smooth and fun to use.

The game has a pretty good modding community with tons of the bigger mods adding new versions of everything. Characters, items, enemies, floors, and bosses are some of the notable additions that come with the more popular mods. These can make the game feel fresh again after you feel the base game has nothing left to offer you.

The one flaw I have with this game is the slow start. In the beginning of the game you have to unlock EVERYTHING. All the cool weapons and items are locked until you can afford them. This can be a negative and a positive to some people, as it gives you a reason to play and want to progress, but at the same time limits your choices in the beginning.

There are many weapons and items to unlock, from a wide variety of vendors, and a wide array of playable characters (including secret characters!) to use those weapons with. Of course, no twin stick roguelite would be complete without a rogue's gallery of bosses, which Gungeon also delivers on... Including secret bosses!

But the longer I've had this game, the more I appreciate it, and probably consider it one of my favorite games of all time.

A blend of bullets hell games and roguelikes that released soon after the success of Undertale (colloquially referred to as most people's first bullet hell game), Gungeon managed to be difficult enough for me at first that I gave up playing it after a month. I first got it on Switch after it received its final content update, so I already had access to all the QOL fixes and new content. I didn't see a lot of it though, since the game can be kind of tough. It's not Binding of Isaac levels of difficulty, but it can get borderline unfair at times.

Gungeon does offer some long term progression in the form of unlockable items and characters. Most items are bought with credits you earn by beating bosses, so even if you don't make it more than a floor or two in, you at least return with something. Some unlocks do require beating a challenge of some kind, but I would describe all but one of them as being pretty fair (what most would consider the final character to unlock, I think it was pretty difficult the first time.)

To get back to my point, I came around to this game because it's a roguelike that rewards you for getting better. The further you get, the more stuff you unlock in future runs, which you learn to use and then go even further. On my first run on Steam (which is my third playthrough) I've reached the point where I could kill the final regular boss and reach the end, so even at the very start, it is possible without any of that long term progression. But finding all the wacky items and trying everything really makes the game fun. Getting broken builds late game is always fun, and the game definitely let's you become overpowered. It can ruin the game at times, like trying to go back to playing normally after using some kind of godmode cheat in a game and now the game doesn't even feel fun because your dopamine receptors are fried.

Anyway, the game has hundreds of unique items and guns, referencing a wide range of media and weapons. From medieval crossbows to lightsaber assault rifles, the game finds funny ways to bring them all together.

Even the lore is good, surprisingly making a lot of sense in explaining why both those guns would exist under the same roof. The Gungeon exists in a wide universe that we may never see more of thanks to the radio silence from the developers, which is a huge shame. But the lore raises cool ideas and builds a world outside of the game that explains it well, and I honestly wish we could've seen more of it.

There are a few problems with the game, of course. Visibility can be an issue, as the game is actually a 3D environment rendered in Unity, so there's real lighting going on. Pitfalls can be so poorly illuminated that I still walk into them because I can't tell they're there to begin with.
Sometimes it still feels like things come down to RNG, even though the game does a very good job at minimizing the role luck plays in player success. Mostly this comes down to things like keys, money, or ammo not dropping when they're desperately needed, but most of the time you won't have to rely on the starting gun.
The four starting characters aren't balanced very evenly, and I think there's a pretty clear tier list of who is the best choice. I think its kind of unfortunate since they all have distinct identities, but their starting kits are just not useful enough to justify picking them. Unlockable characters have much stronger starting kits, arguably too strong compared to the main cast, but the new characters also have gimmicks that make them fun and refreshing to play.
Late into runs, most characters start to lose their identities though, at least when playing optimally. As you get more powerful items, you usually end up trying to find the same small batch of S or A tier guns to really annihilate the last bosses, but all the characters use them exactly the same. So while each character starts a run with a different playstyle, they all converge late game into the same optimal strategies revolving around the same high tier items. In some ways it is what Brimstone is to Binding of Isaac. Too good to pass up. but it can be repetitive.

There's a lot to love about the art in the game. Besides the hundreds of times designed, every floor has a unique theme. Enemies do get reused, but generally each floor tries to introduce new ones on top of the old, and by late run you only see much harder enemies. But every enemy has a fun design, every boss is unique. Many fun references from things like Dungeons and Dragons, Zelda, to the game Snake. They turned Snake into an entire boss (although it's kind of a hated boss, the concept is really cool.) Progressing through the game, there are times where I actually find the visuals to be really cool.
There's even cut content from the game which has the same level of polish, and it's a tragedy it'll never officially see the light of day.

Good time to transition to modding. The modding scene is big, although not as large as some other games. Not on the Steam Workshop, but on Nexus and the R2Mod Manager, there's some good ones. Even ones that restore the cut content. I find a lot of the mods to be pretty unbalanced compared to the base game, but there's a lot of fun items to try.

I don't know how to wrap this up. This game is so fun and I find myself returning to it more than almost any other game, and always having fun with it again. It's not perfect, but I feel like it comes close for me, riding that thin line that a roguelike needs to rely on randomly generated elements but gameplay which highly encourages players to improve their core techniques and skills, and still rewards them for it in both the short and long term. Even once you've mastered it all, it's still fun to return and start a fresh run and just dive through it again. I take breaks from it for sure, but I think I'll always come back to the Gungeon.",1704171193,1704171193,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You play as ""the gungeoneer"" with a choice of 4 initial characters, four more unlockable as you play. Every room is randomly generated and every floor has its own theme and set of enemies. The lower you go the more challenging the game gets. 

There is SO much to do in this game despite the repetitive nature of its gameplay. Unlocking new weapons(of which there is a ton) and items to use is such a joy. Almost every weapon is unique with references to different games, media, and memes alike. Every boss, enemy, and ally is either a gun pun or a reference to something; its amazing. 

The game, as I said before, does not get easier as you play but rather your skills get better. You start to learn enemy patterns, get a feel for the weapons and items, and learn which areas to avoid. The bullets don't get easier to dodge but instead you become fluid, dodging bullets left and right, ascending into a god of guns and destruction as you descend the into the gungeon.

A lot of the changes to the game from there almost seemed to directly address many of these complaints. Maybe one day I'll go back to it and write a new review but lol this has no value outside of a historic footnote.

I'll even swap it to a positive review. The fact that Gungeons and Dragons seemed to directly address the points below is super cool and I respect the devs a lot for it, even if I haven't gotten around to play it.

----- 2016 Gungeon Negative Review Below ------

There is so much love and joy and care put into so much of this game but it is perhaps, gameplay wise, the stingiest game like this I've ever played. The game is afraid to let the player have fun. The game will let you play for 40 minutes without cutting you any slack of the RNG before you realize the whole run was a hopeless waste of time. And it will do this a lot. Large stretches of the game become rote, yet if you try and casually go through them, your mistakes will have rippling effects into the later bit of the game. The game feels hard not because hard is fun, but hard because the developers were afraid of their game being too easy. It also doesn't help that so many of the items are boring and very situational and its super easy to get nothing but gag guns for entire runs. The characters are (outside their personality and very cooly stories and specialized ending bosses) really really boring. Of the starting classes, only Pilot is mechanically interesting, so changing classes doesn't give a reprieve from the monotony the is 'actually playing through the first half of the game'.

People like this game for a reason. The backhalf can be very fun and skill intensive in a way that doesn't feel punitive for the sake of being punitive. This, and the charm of the game surrounding the actual gungeoneering (the NPCs and goals and all that) makes me REALLY REALLY REALLY want to like it. And there is times I, for some glimmering moments, have a lot of fun. But where in Nuclear Throne, being screwed by the RNG is a small cost, in Gungeon it is a devestating waste of time. If any of these complaints sound like things you can live with, maybe you'll be one of the many many people who love this game",1481087569,1703940282,True,4,0,0.597972989082336426,61,True,False,False

Combine this with references from a multitude of other games and media, and you get a charming, fun, but also challenging top-down shooter game.

The game starts out a bit easy, especially if this isn’t your first top-down shooter, but it quickly ramps up by the 2nd floor onwards, with more unpredictable enemies and dangerous environments. You will die, but with each death you learn a little more, and bit by bit you’ll figure out how to overcome all the obstacles that the Gungeon has to offer.

There are a wide variety of guns to uncover on your journey. You’ll come across and unlock more powerful, but also peculiar guns. Some are off of real-life guns, but the ones that will really grab your attention are the cool and badass-looking sci-fi ones; some of them are not as cool, and arguably even lame, but I think each gun has a charm in their own way. This flow of new guns to try out keeps your journey to The Gun keeps every run interesting. 

The pixel graphics are cute as hell; just look at the bullet kin! There is a great amount of attention paid to the details that you can’t help but appreciate. Great effort was also put into the text and dialogue, from Ammonomicon, to the various NPCs you can talk to, like the depressed alcoholic lizard. 

The soundtrack is stellar. It fills you with the motivation to explore the depths of the Gungeon and uncover its mysteries. The different musical tracks seamlessly blend into each other as you exit and enter new rooms, and can make a mix of the best parts of each track. At the end of every challenge in this game awaits an awesome tune to celebrate to.

The story element is kept light and brief, popping up only once in a while amidst the action, but it nonetheless contains some intriguing parts for you to discover and speculate on (or look up lol).

There is a 2-player co-op option, however, it’s local only. The co-op itself can be quite fun, and Remote Play on Steam bridges the physical gap with local co-op, but I’m still very disappointed to see this limitation in co-op.

One major complaint I have is the game’s lack of info on weapon synergies. Some of them you can figure out just from testing it out, but a lot are very obscure to the point where you’ll probably be unable to figure it out without looking it up on the wiki. This is something I don’t like to do because it often ruins the fun of learning and discovering on your first run.

In the grand scheme of things, the downsides aren’t too major. As someone who has enjoyed top-down shooters like Nuclear Throne, this game was extremely attractive to me, and it has shown itself to be one of the best that I’ve played. I loved its incredibly goofy style and the heart and soul put into it.

The game's main weakness is that although the areas are procedurally generated, there is only a limited amount of enemies and rooms you can find within one single floor. As you might spend dozens of hours on each floor in total, this can almost get a little bland at times.

It's strenghts however are numerous. As there are only few core mechanics, each of them are very polished and well implemented. While the game can be quite difficult, the difficulty always felt fair. Each projectile that can damage you can also be dodged, there are no hidden tricks or enemies that require trial and error to defeat. Because of this, even though the game is so difficult, it never got very frustrating for me.

Considering the low price of the game, there is a lot of content for very cheap here, including several free DLC updates. I highly recommend the game to fans of the roguelike and bullet hell genres.",1545777306,1703781693,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story and past of each character + the hidden secret characters is so wacky and entertaining.

Overall a great experience and a lovingly made game. 100% reccomended to the lovers of roguelike genre!",1703346083,1703346083,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It’s variety and gameplay ​structure keeps me coming back to it every couple of months despite beating it ​dozens of times. This game uses the genre’s simple design of clearing rooms one after ​the other has been tweaked to make every playthrough so vastly different that I rarely ​even get the same weapon between attempts.

The art style of Enter The Gungeon is truly something to be desired by other indie ​games with the pixel art approach to aesthetics. Every room is immaculately ​decorated with such passion put into the animations of enemies and objects that it ​truly has a unique style which has defined it from similar game art like Celeste and ​Shovel Knight. When you shoot a bookcase pages go flying across the room, each ​enemy has it’s own unique animation for running shooting and dying, each gun ​(around 300 of them) have their own unique reloads and projectiles.

The main thing to be praised however is the sheer scale of their weapon variety and ​creativity to differentiate each one from the others. There’s a bullet gun that shoots ​pistols, a rocket launcher that shoots bees, there's a cardboard box that shoots buzz ​saws. Every weapon feels like it has it’s own playstyle behind it aswell, which makes ​the way the player approaches each attempt challenge different aspects of the ​gameplay. Sometimes you get weapons that are great to charge enemies down with ​like a shotgun, sometimes you have to duck behind propped up tables or nearby walls ​to take a calculated shot. Because weapons are found in chests it’s completely up to ​the player to balance the risk of investing in every chest, or waiting for especially rare ​ones, promoting a “risk it all to win big” approach to some levels.

The difficulty mainly comes from the aspect that if you die, you have to start all over ​again. My experience with perma-death before this game was hardcore World of ​Warcraft, or Baldur’s Gate honour mode and in both of these games a full playthrough ​is hundreds of hours, meaning every perma-death is usually a quit moment for the ​player. Enter The Gungeon streamlines the 90's approach to this by reducing the full ​playthrough to around 20 minutes of play. By doing this they can then crank up the ​difficulty to a ridiculous level in the hopes that the amount of progression made is so ​small, that people will repeatedly attempt to finish the game despite dying. They have ​essentially found a way to capitalise off the arcade game approach to player deaths ​within the modern age, and it makes for a game where I will often find myself trying ​once or twice every few months because of just how small of a time commitment it is.

Overall this game is a perfection of a rogue-like that we have never seen within the​ genre. The commendable amount of variety and fast paced gameplay has created a​ challenging but infinitely repeatable indie game that I will never tire of playing.​

Tip: turn off the music and listen to your own playlist. No offence to the composer, and the title song is pretty cool, but it can get distracting when you're actually fighting. 

No run will be the same. There is a crazy variety of guns from a mailbox to a bubble gun to a bullet that shoots guns (yes, I wrote that correctly). Apart from the final floor, there are 3 different bosses you can potentially fight on each floor, so you don't fight the same bosses every time. 

I played 28 hours in my first two weeks, but right now I'm taking a break because I arguably played a bit much and it can be kinda demoralising at some point to keep dying and going back to the beginning. but there is a lot of metaprogression (unlocking more guns and items you can potentially get in each run), and I'm definitely gonna come back to it at some point.

السلام عليكم فيديو جميل كالعادة لكن لدي عدة ملاحظات عليه وسأذكر أهم واحدة وهي: دفاعك عن صعوبة اللعبة وأنها لا تأثر على التجربة كثيرًا لوجود أنشطة جانبية تعطي الصعوبة لطالبها.
وملاحظتي على هذا الكلام لأمرين:
١- أن الصعوبة ليست الهدف بحد ذاته في الكثير من الأحيان بل لوجود شيء يعطي معنى لهذه الصعوبة فالإنسان لا يأكل الطعام برجليه وهو غير محتاج لذلك بالرغم أن الأكل بالرجلين أصعب لكن ليس فيه فائدة ومثله الصعوبة في الألعاب فالمعنى مهم ورأيي أن الخطأ كان في تسهيل المهام الرئيسية إلى درجة أن الزعماء فقدوا هيبتهم وأصبحوا مثل حدائق الملاهي فهي جذابة للنظر وممتعة لكنها خاوية ولو رجعنا ورأينا ما الذي جعل أفضل قتلات للزعماء في تاريخ الألعاب سنجد أن واحد من أهم عناصرها هو أن الصعوبة متوازنة تجعلك تشعر بقوة الزعيم وهيبته فتتطرّ لتعلم حركاته وقدراته والتخطيط لهزيمته بدون الشعور باليأس هذا ما يجعل هؤلاء الزعماء أيقونيّن لذلك جعل الصعوبة فقط في المحتوى الجانبي يكون فراغ في قصة اللعبة من الصعب ملؤه.
٢- الاختلاف في الصعوبة بين المحتوى الأساسي والجانبي بدون التحضير له أولًا في الأساسي قد يغر اللاعب الذي إما أنه يحسب أن توجه اللعبة العام هو إعطاء خيال القوة وأن اللعبة بأكملها متوجهة لذالك أو ضعيف المستوى لكنه يريد إكمال ما يقدر عليه المحتوى لتجربته ويصدم بارتفاع مفاجئ في الصعوبة وهذا لن يكون له أفضل انطباع في ذهن اللاعب.
ملاحظة:(أنا لم ألعب العبة فملاحظتي هنا عامة وليست خاصة باللعبة).

GAMEPLAY

Enter the Gungeon is a top-down roguelike, heavily inspired by the Binding of Isaac, which features the opporunity to select a Character and then descend into a procedurally generated dungeon filled with all kinds of threats. Over the course of a descent into the dungeon, the Player will find many guns with which to shoot at the varied Enemies, as well as a plethora of items that provide increases in power or intriguing effects.

The Player will also need to face down sublime bosses at the end of each level of the dungeon, with meticulously designed attack patterns and a clear incentive to partake in Trial-and-Error. However, one of the ways the game stands out from its competitors is its use of the dodge-roll, coupled with an emphasis on making the moment-to-moment gameplay, at least in combat, reminiscent of a Bullet Hell.

Dodge out of the way of countless projectiles, shoot the targets and secure victory, as well as potentially currency and a few usable items, so that the way to the final boss might open… Or is it the final boss? Aside from featuring a plethora of endings, based on each playable Character, Enter the Gungeon also features secret levels and additional gamemodes.

However, while all that is phenomenal, the game suffers from one thing – an overreliance on Random Number Generation (RNG), on luck, as well as a clear imbalance between the different weapons available to the Player. Some are very clearly just worse versions of others, and the bad versions are a lot more common than the good versions, which only leads into a lessening of the amount of fun that can be experienced by the Player.

Ultimately, the Gameplay’s smoothness is enough to nearly carry the game even in spite of its flaw, but by the time the Player gets good at dodging, they will start suffering from the RNG mechanics.

2/3

PRESENTATION

Enter the Gungeon is a phenomenal, in appearance, game. Powerful stylization, pixel-based graphics that have such unbelievable amounts of soul in them, a soundtrack that enchants the Player as though it were a fae in the woods, and animations so fluent and deliberate that it is astounding how some of them have come to be. 

3/3

STORY

In Enter the Gungeon, a group of hoodlums with various motivations have arrived at the Gungeon’s entrance and seek to enter, so as to find the gun that can kill time – or, rather, turn time back – because there’s something in their pasts that they need to set right.

Aside from that intriguing premise, there’s a plethora of colorful Characters and a bit of lore that can be unearthed through wandering about and discovering secrets, but that is as far as things go. There is a limited amount of story to be told, and there are even some slight inconsistencies that present themselves every now and then.

2/3

Legendary Point

Does this game get the legendary point, so craved and wanted by all and none at the same time?

 Considering everything stated by yours truly (me) so far, I have to inform you that the game does not obtain the legendary point. While it is true that I enjoyed it, greatly, it must be noted that much of my pleasure with this game came before I had truly come to know its intricacies, while the game was new and unknown to me, while I was still struggling to learn its ways. After I got decently good, I lost the joy I got from playing, as I would constantly find myself missing the keys or the items needed to make my runs through the Gungeon more pleasant. 0/1

CONCLUSION
7/10. Enter the Gungeon is not a bad game, at all. It is actually a very, VERY good game, if a bit too overwhelmingly praised by its players, though, when one considers what its competition is, one starts to see it in a different light. Alas, I review games based on themselves, and only themselves, thus EtG is just a very good game.

 I tuck it under my belt, another shining achievement that I proudly display. It could have glimmered even more brightly, but that will do.

Sometimes you get more chests than keys, sometimes more keys than chests, sometimes complete dogshit guns, sometimes op guns, sometimes no health for ages when you have no hp, sometimes you get 2 hearts in a floor where you lost no health so they go to waste. Really boils down to grinding for a fun run from my perspective. Otherwise you're stuck with a shit weapon and it takes ages to clear rooms and bosses. Maybe you enjoy using a shit gun forever to chip away and your run taking 2* longer, I don't.

I have played 103 hours of this game on PC (on epic games) and probably 50 or so on the switch. (Approximately 150 for all you math brains out there)

This is my favourite rogue-like game. In my eyes there really isnt any rogue-like close.

The reason I say this is because it is just pure fun. There is no other way to truly phrase it. It just has a ton of cool and funny ♥♥♥♥. I think Donkle said it great in his review, ""its cool""

Seriously I can't think of a better first experience I've had with the game. It's just awesome with a conglomerate of videogame references like Zelda, Mario, Samus, Megaman and basically anygame you think of.

there are so many good things about this game...

5/5 


My 2023:

Still good,

rat punchout is hard but if you mod it with thunderstore and practice it, it is quite easy.

the worst part of this game is easily trying to 100% it and getting those stupid bounty achievements

still my favourite rogue like

- It's unfairly, punishingly difficult

- Certain bullet patterns seem like they're designed to cause you to get hit, unlike Danmaku where you can weave your way through everything.

- Dodge Roll has way too little bay way of Invincibility Frames, ensuring you'll leap over one wave of bullets, then get hit by something that was unavoidably spat out behind.

- Good luck dodging anything from the side in an isometric game.

- No guarantee exists that you'll be given a key to get a gun beyond your standard starting one, and other times you'll watch as a gun chest is detonated in front of you, because the game only gave you a single key to open the gate before the locked chest with.

- Only one of the guns I got I enjoyed in the slightest, and I picked up over 10 of the things.

- Dark Souls II Design Philosophy of “just throw more stuff at them; somebdoy'll do it!”

- None of the items I got felt like they ever did literally anything, much less upgraded the character in any form or fashion, far less actually improved survivability in any way.

- For the amount of bullets they vomit out, seemingly without any actual effort put into making sure they can be avoided, bosses take wayy too long to kill.

- Rooms can sometimes spawn more enemies after the first wave is clear, but only sometimes

- ...and no visual indication exists to show a second wave will spawn after the first.

- To make matters worse, they also don't design the room around the enemies, rather just throw things in there and hope you'll get out of it.

- As such, spending wayyyyy too bloody long in a room clearing it with the default weapon as a result of you not being able to get anything else starts to wear incredibly quickly.

- Even with the teleporters, it takes an inordinate amount of time to get to the next room that you've not cleared out yet, to the point even my easily-amused Autistic brain chose twice to quit to desktop than wander all the way back to a room that will be a boring, unengaging, samey slog to clear out, only for more things to spawn in and artificially extend play time.

Verdict: Not recommended from someone who tortured themselves long enough to platinum the Binding of Isaac: Repentance.",1702087763,1702087763,False,2,3,0.427898645401000977,0,True,False,False

I love the pixel art, flashy animations, sound design, etc. Devolver's games have always been my favorite, but Enter the Gungeon will beat you senseless until you don't want to play anymore. It's so full of charm, but it's all just completely overshadowed by the game's ludicrous difficulty.
Yes, I know, 4.2 hours isn't enough to come to such a consensus. It could also be that I'm just awful at the game, and you know what, that's probably part of the problem. It's likely a skill issue on my part, but still. This game will make sure you die 600 times before even defeating the first boss. Out of all the runs I must've played so far, I only got to the second floor once before dying to a slime.
Sometimes, it doesn't even feel like the character you pick matters that much. The Marine does have an extra hit point, but that's only if you don't get hit before the first boss room, because at that point, you may as well restart the entire run. The Convict's damage boost after she gets hit doesn't feel usable at all. No matter what, you're only going to get to the second floor a few times within the first 10 hours of gameplay.",1702059234,1702059234,False,1,1,0.451842188835144043,2,True,False,False

to the enemies right down to the weapons, its all creative and filled to the brim with imagination, you can find a weapon that is a shotgun shell, that fires shotguns, that fire more shotgun shells for god's sake!

but, the game will get boring after a few retries in a row, but, the next day you'll want to play it again. unless you're weird or something.
the movement and shooting is a hell of a lot of fun and you'll probably never tired of switching characters and finding a new gun you've never seen before that does something brand new in each run.

99% of my time was spent in single player.  I didn't care for multiplayer because of the bullet hell nature of the game - an extra person just makes the screen more chaotic.

My only complaint is that it has a roguelite feature you find in a lot of others in the genre where your main source of unlocks are just new items in the pool.

The game is exceedingly slow, with you spending forever to beat each room and traversing the map itself being slow. The bosses are damage sponges that take what feels like an eternity to kill, even the death animation (in a roguelike where you are expected to die often) is far too slow and makes trying to start a new run feel less fluid and natural. The guns all feel like they're firing wet balls of paper, with tiny bullets that chip away at enemy health and are hard to use from the range the game clearly wants you to fight at given the utterly absurd number of projectiles every enemy in the game shoots. It is especially noticeable with the bosses who take several times as long as they should to kill and who all seem to be more fitting to a late game area rather than the very beginning.
The game's item system is also unbalanced as it is entirely possible to not find a gun on the first floor, in a game about guns and shooting them, which leaves you with the pathetically weak default weapons for the needlessly strong bosses
The artstyle is alright and the ability to save health for later is a very welcome one but I feel that the slow, awkward and spammy gameplay is by no means worth the occasional interesting idea
Nuclear Throne is a much more fun top down, gun based shooter with actual ammo management, fast and fun gameplay, bosses who are strong but don't overstay their welcome, far more interesting character design and unique playable characters with their own strong upsides, etc. I have tried to play this game but cannot find the passion or motivation to keep going, while Nuclear Throne was an immediate favourite game.

Soundtrack is good i guess
Skill barely matters, it's the RNG that carries you through the game
Balancing is off the charts
a lot of unfixed glitches/bugs. Game easily softlocks itself.
It's alright for a roguelike but as said, RNG is the only thing that carries the run unless you want to spend 10 minutes on a boss.
Dodge roll is broken, sometimes it doesn't dodge an attack at all
Clone softlocks you when you die while killing a boss, still didn't get fixed.

For me, it’s an obvious recommended, but I’m going first through its bad aspects.

I’ve personally met people that didn’t like this game. One of them an old friend from uni, another one myself, way down in the past. And the problem was the same for both of them/us: the difficulty.

Now, given that this is a game that I truly love (or learned to love), I think I have a ground to say that for NO GAME being difficult is a virtue. For me being difficult it’s just like the genre, some people like one or another, you shouldn’t hold against them that they don’t like your favourite genre, nor your favourite method of torture. And “git gut” is no an argument to make a game more appealing.

Because where some see difficulty, I see in this game a rather bad accessibility. This game is definitely, particularly odd with its learning curve. I’ve played a demo (ehem) back when it was freshly published, almost 7 years ago. And almost every year I would… Rent it… To play it again and again. And out of the five floors of the dungeon, I’ve BARELY made it to the fifth one in all those years, and only two months ago I managed to kill the final boss.

And you know what happened after that? Now there is no run where I don’t get to the fourth floor and I finished the game with every character in three days.

And it feels strange. The thing is, back then, I remember it vividly. It FELT impossible. I hate reading guides and letting people on forums and crap tell me which items are best and builds and such… And I almost felt like unless they held my hand, I was never gonna be able to even smell the finale.

From which I get the feel that, anyone that’d try the game could feel the same. And although I ended up loving this game, I can see some people not liking it because of how the experience is in the beginning.

And the thing is, there doesn’t seem to be an option to customize your experience besides cheating. Which is a bit sad, given that I believe that people used to a more casual experience are actually missing the great things in the game.

Which is another bad point for me. You get to choose between characters, which have pretty dynamic and interesting abilities that tell them apart, but that’s about it. Down the line, as you advance, the runs tend to equalize them. Their own abilities die down and are functionally replaced by what is found in the dungeon. Moreover, it felt like this game could really use an “infinite” or “arsenal” mode to experiment more with the equipment. Builds feels great, but you know that, as you approach the end (which past certain points becomes as I said a bit too easy to reach), you are going to say goodbye forever to them. 

And yeah, it’s a roguelike… But it’s not helped by the fact that the floors you go through are pre-selected and the same (at least for all the runs I’ve gone through). They are procedural, of course, but you expect the same combination of enemies and bosses for every floor, which tends to streamline the experience (feeding into that weird difficulty vibe) and again screams for a bit of a “freer” experience besides the core one.

With all of this tho… I’ve already mentioned that I didn’t like the game… But I kept coming, always coming to be cursed by the past…

This game, in little dosages, is really, really fun. And in many ways.

When you are starting or have a bad run, the enemies are out there for your blood. Fights are chaotic and frenetic, just quick enough to not give you any breather, but fair enough to make you feel your own mistakes. The bosses are quite dynamic, you feel their power. But they also give you down time to put some bullets into them.

The guns, save a bunch of life-mirroring ones… Are, of course, the best part. So many types of damage, shooting patterns, synergies and strange gimmicks with added effects: Seeking bullets, bouncing bullets, exploding bullets, bullets that clear other bullets, arrow-shaped wooden bullets, shotguns shooting guns that shoot bullets… Planet bullets (for some reason).

And yes, if you like stupid dad-grade humour, you’ll definitely find many parts in this game amusing or even hilarious.

The enemies are ridiculous, the bosses are ridiculous, the guns themselves are clearly ridiculous. So many bullet and guns puns… This game feels like a parody of some sort or some kind of long-drawn joke that someone got into too deep.

And there is a lot of content. Enemies aren’t that numerous, and after you beat it for the first time, you probably would have seen almost all of them (given again, that the roster for each floor is fixed). But there are a huge number of guns, so much that even to this day I’m not sure I’ve seen all of them and I still keep getting surprised.

The items, on the other hand, are a bit meh in my opinion. You can only carry one or two active items at a time, they require to deal damage to recharge every time you use them (obviously in the name of balance) and, ultimately, I find myself giving them a pass.

The passive ones are more interesting, as they are a big part of the synergy at play with the guns, enabling stuff like active reloads, piercing, poisoning and other effects… Or doing something a bit simpler like increasing your health pool. But beyond that, they may affect specific weapons to enable very specific gimmicks for them, which is quite interesting.

Also, once you overcome the tragic learning curve, skill has more weight than in some other roguelikes. At least, this is true for common enemies; eventually you can with most fights with well-timed dodging and even taking advantage of the room’s hazards. Bosses are a bit of another story. Having poor firepower can put you quickly on the stop, sometimes beyond what you can do, unless you’ve got an extensive practice against a specific boss.

No matter what, slowly (quite slowly mind you), you unlock new and powerful weapons to be found with the credits awarded from killing the bosses, which gives some sense of progression. There are also characters around the dungeon that you unlock to join the main hub so they can be found during your runs.

While there are certainly a couple of funny and interesting characters, gameplay-wise they don’t feel like a very important addition. They appear so rarely that you barely notice their presence, and most of the time they don’t really impact your run. Even the store that you find every floor is quite the hit or miss. It feels more like the only reliable place to get health, blanks (which help you by cleaning a room from bullets for a short time) and keys, than a place to invest your hard-earned money for some new guns.

To conclude, this is in general a really good game, when played with moderation. If you are going to buy it and aren’t used to usual roguelike and bullet-hell bs, you should be ready to be frustrated, many many times, before getting a hand of it. Otherwise, you may be condemned to throw it at the back of your library and never play it again. But, if you vibe with it, it’s one of the funniest casual experiences you can have.

First, I just want to point out that this game is really well made, and super fun, and I'm kinda bad at bullet hell, so just know that none of my critique is based on the fact that I'm bad at it. 

What I want to say is this: Gungeon is pretty far-off from something like Binding of Isaac in terms of the item synergy mechanics at the core of its roguelite gameplay. That confusing sentence is not a quality assessment, just an observation. In my limited time I've found that Gungeon does not supply you with infinitely compounding item effects during each run, but rather, a pretty tight load-out that you assemble from random items, and the shops, that consists of a few powerful weapons, and a few discrete (often non-synergistic) powerups/relics that assist your damage output but don't greatly change the way you play. 

It's a subtle difference. So subtle you might just think I'm out to lunch, but I find it very noticeable. I came to this from games like Isaac and Slay the Spire, and was disappointed in the lack of emphasis on compiling wacky synergies. That is absolutely a, ""to each their own,"" situation, and I don't hold it against Gungeon that it does things differently, but it isn't quite what I, personally, look for in a roguelite.",1698272484,1698272484,True,8,1,0.618747532367706299,0,True,False,False

It is very rare to become brokenly powerful in this. It's hard but fair, and pretty much never gives you the ability to completely cheese it without playing well. I can tell the devs wanted the game to feel fair, and made sure the value of skill majorly outweighs the value of luck. This is rare for the genre. If you want to be unstoppable and mindlessly blast every room with a million exploding bullets like in Isaac, you're not really gonna get that. You're going to have to play well or lose. FYI the reviews saying this game is all RNG are just crap at the game. This is the least luck-based roguelike I've ever played.

There isn't meta progression in the sense that you get permanent upgrades, but you do unlock items/guns that you can find on future runs which are generally better than the starting stuff. There is other progression such as unlocking npcs that can unlock more items or put special effects on your runs, and some character unlocks.

The gunplay and boss fights are what makes this game so good. Pretty much every fight is satisfying as you dodge around tons of stuff, which actually have good choreography and don't diarrhea all over the screen in a way that's unreadable. Again this game is hard but fair, and you will pretty much never be BS-ed into taking damage. It's pretty much completely your fault.

I like almost everything about this game. But ok, there are a couple annoyances.
- Many guns need the button spammed to shoot at max speed. Ever since contra 1 this has been a plague. It's annoying, tiresome, and is going to take years off the health of our hands, especially avid gamers. Please stop.
- Items don't give enough information so if you really want to make the best decisions and play right, unfortunately you're gonna have to look every item up. Again please stop.
- Hp is very limited which is good. The only way to increase max hp is beating bosses without getting hit. This makes things tense, but, the fact it's all-or-nothing to snowball to a victory is very annoying. Maybe a single hit taken could give half as much of an increase? No-hit reward system is a good idea but it's too strict and binary.

As a 50-year-old man navigating the winding roads of life post-divorce, Enter the Gungeon has been a welcome escape and an unexpected source of comfort.

You know, life can throw curveballs at any age, and for me, this game has been a delightful distraction, a chance to dive into a world filled with whimsy and challenge. And amidst all the chaos, the Bullet Kin, that charming little bullet-shaped character, has become my favorite companion in the Gungeon.

There's something oddly comforting about their determined little faces as they bravely face the onslaught of bullets and chaos. Maybe it's a reflection of my own journey, finding the courage to face challenges head-on and come out stronger on the other side.

Enter the Gungeon's gameplay, with its ever-changing layouts and vast array of weapons, has become a metaphor for life's unpredictability. Each run through the Gungeon is a fresh adventure, reminding me that no matter how tough things get, there's always a chance for a new beginning, a new discovery, and maybe even a treasure or two along the way.

The witty humor and clever design of this game have provided me with laughter and a sense of wonder, reminding me that age is just a number. In a way, my midlife crisis has led me to this gem of a game, showing me that it's never too late to find joy in unexpected places.

So, if you're like me, navigating the complexities of life and looking for a little escape, I wholeheartedly recommend Enter the Gungeon. It might just become your sanctuary, a place where you can find solace, excitement, and a newfound appreciation for the simple joys in life.",1697862975,1697862975,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On top of that there's just so much little shit in this game that just builds and builds one after another that just makes it so damn tedious and annoying to play through each time, so let me run through a few shall I?


The first issue i have with this game is the item descriptions or lack thereof, not that the game doesn't have them, but it's that it suffers from the fact that most of the fucking item descriptions don't actually tell you what the item you just picked up does, it just gives you some random useless bit of story or a stupid joke which don't help you at all you just have to fuck around until you figure out what it does, and even then good luck because a lot of the time the only point when you would be able to use it you would never fucking think to use it there, but either way good luck even making it to a point where you would get to use it since most of the time the average casual player wont be able to get through the first damn level and past the first boss because most of them just throw legions of shit at you with barely any space to dodge, even if you try to dodge through the rounds more often than not you just end up dodging into more bullets and take damage anyway. And another thing I hate about the bosses is as far as i know there's no way to skip the intro for them so you're forced to sit there for like a solid 10 seconds for it to do it's intro animation every single time and then spend another solid 5 or 6 second death animation of the clock showing up which you also can't skip, when you're first starting in the game hey sure it isn't the absolute worst thing, but after about the 12th damn time it gets irritating at best. Another thing that gets on my nerves is that despite the fact that there are 4 different characters to pick from none of them have significant enough changes from each other to actually make you want to pick one over the other except for the Marine who has one extra temporary armor point a weapon with the highest starting ammo count for his starter weapon as well as fire rate (at least as far as i can tell) and has an ability to call in more ammo for other weapons, so you have pretty much no reason to pick anyone else since the rest have shit like a weak AOE special and two junk weapons, a dog and a slow garbage revolver, or a small chance to either unlock a chest for free or make it inaccessible for good with a stupidly inaccurate slow firing laser pistol. All of these things combined just makes me want to lobotomize myself with an ice-pick after just a couple of runs.

I want to say that it's just a legit skill issue on my end because i like rouge-likes other games like this like the binding of Isaac and would really like to say i enjoy this one too, but i just can't say i do in honesty, there are just so many small things that build up and up throughout the game that just ruins it for me, if you have the patience for this sort of stuff and have the time to waste as well as the money to just throw out, go ahead and get it, but i really would suggest you just go play the binding of Isaac instead.",1697765804,1697765804,False,0,0,0.424915522336959839,0,True,False,False

After just 1 or 2 runs it becomes extremely boring. playing with a friend requires a 3rd party application. The main issue I have is the overall mechanics such as the dodge. I have found that using the dodge as little as possible is the best option since after the recover your vulnerable for what feels like an eternity and if you dodge in the wrong direction, such as in the same direction of a bullet you will 100% get hit cause you move at the same speed as most bullets. So while it is fun it becomes not fun very quickly.

If you're into very difficult games then you might like it more but for a rogue-lite it just seems a little too punishing for my taste. Especially when its the mechanic thats supposed to get you out of trouble that seems to screw you over the most. If you want to sit here and practice this game to get good, you totally can but I find myself getting bored way too soon for me to want to get better at it. Also the RNG doesn't feel rewarding at all. I can sometimes get almost to the boss of the second dungeon and have received very little loot at all, which is ridiculous for a rogue-lite. I originally planned on giving it a recommend but as I kept writing this review I realized that I just couldn't. This is one of the worst rogue-lites I have played in a long time. Also there is ""synergy"" with items but its basically pointless since the odds of you getting those items together is tiny.

I am still regularly seeing new content just from how the devs made unlocks happen. I do think the game can be a bit unforgiving when you are learning, mostly because the game doesn't give you many tips or hints at all, pretty much everything is on you to either figure out or look up. I think many more people would have gotten much further in this game if the tutorial had included more than the bare minimum practice required to play. That being said, if you do decide to take the plunge and really learn the game then you will experience one of the most challenging and rewarding ""BS hard games"" out there. I would wholeheartedly recommend EtG if you are looking for a dungeon crawler that is super satisfying to learn and master.

All that being said, here are some mostly spoiler free tips that I wish the devs hinted at in the tutorial:
1. Master the early floors - without getting into too much detail, doing good and taking no damage early will reward you even more and make the end game substantially easier. The other benefit to not taking damage early is that you will have many more shells later to buy ammo, guns, or items since you will not need to buy healing.
2. Synergies - some items, passives, and guns will totally change the way some other items or guns work in wild and powerful ways. Some of the synergies are super strong and very much worth it, and because they are such a huge game changer (literally) I really wish there was a catalog in game or some way of seeing which items would synergize with your kit before actually going and buying/getting that item since what items you buy can make or break the run, but since there isnt, the wiki is the next best place to learn about these.
3. On that topic... you can steal things! Very helpful if there is a very expensive item you want to test drive. or synergy you want. As to how to steal things, without getting into too much detail, anything that makes you invisible/takes targeting off of you is a good place to start ; ) 
4. More Characters to play as! - At ~150 hours, I still do not have all of them, but I am close. The game does not really give you any indication that there even ARE hidden characters, let alone how to get them so I would recommend looking at the wiki to see how to unlock them. They are VERY worth it, super fun and genuinely play different than the starting characters, which adds much needed variety after you have a ton of time in the game.",1509108348,1697701767,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

The only thing you can do if you are moderately skilled to increase your chances of winning is to try to beat the bosses without receiving any hits, they reward you with important buffs, but if you don't manage to do it, no matter how much you know how to dodge, if you don't get anything good, like important weapon interaction or at least some decent passive skills, winning would be almost impossible, the bosses have an absurd amount of life as you advance and they throw a lot of bullets in all directions, if you have nothing to destroy or repulse projectiles In some way, you will hardly last long, it is a very frustrating game because the difficulty lies only in that, the rng, the absurd number of enemies per room and the projectiles they launch, not because they have mechanics that are difficult to learn or something like that. In fact the final boss is easier than the 4th level bosses, thats crazy, it is entertaining but very unbalanced, in the end all the hours it takes you to spend its because you are gaining more powerful weapons and objects that increase your chance in long term of getting a good weapon or object, not for anything else like idk, unlock the possibility of selecting a weapon or maybe an object when advancing from chamber to chamber or something like a typical rogue like that works well.",1697499406,1697499791,False,2,2,0.456445991992950439,0,True,False,False

I don't know what else I can say that someone else hasn't already said about this game but I guess I can give you the perspective of someone who has finished the game multiple times with each character and obtained every achievement. 

Your very first run will likely go something like this:
>clear the first rooms 
>get some neat guns
>fight the first boss
>die on the second floor

And the second run will likely go similar to that, but each time you will get just a little bit better. That's where the fun in this game comes from. Learning just a little bit more about this weird Gungeon that you're exploring every time you attempt another go at it. It takes some time to get good at, but the closer you get to the end, the more you will want to keep playing.

My best memory playing this game has to be making it all the way to the final boss, only to die just before I was able to beat him... And then finding out one of the items I had revived me with full hearts and let me absolutely decimate the last bit of health the boss had left. 

Moments like this are what make Enter the Gungeon so much fun. You won't know how exactly any given run will go! That being said it can also be very frustrating to be at the end of a challenge run only to get screwed by something you could not plan for or ""get good"" at. 

Some of the achievements are incredibly frustrating to get for this reason as well because they require certain enemies or drops to appear, and the only way for this to happen is to just get lucky. The story is also pretty simple and there is some lore to discover but most things just boil down to reference or pun. 

Overall I still enjoyed the game enough to play it to compilation and I would recommend you at least play enough to beat the game with the 4 starting characters. The price is very fair for the amount of time you will likely get out of this so don't worry about if you should wait for it to go on sale or not before buying if you really want to play it right now.

While the game is tough and demanding, it also perfectly demonstrates that practice does indeed make perfect.  This isn't to say that the game is inaccessible to newcomers.  The game eases you deeper and deeper into the gungeon over time.  It reveals new characters, new mechanics, hidden characters, hidden bosses, etc.  These systems work well to not over-complicate the game and even give the player some form of awareness over what their next gungeon run might have in store.  Some things are hidden initially, but most things in the game will eventually reveal themselves organically to the player, save for a few exceptions that definitely are aided by guides.

Overall, the game is a 10/10.  The gameplay is tight, the art design is super charming, and the game is rewarding and remains rewarding over a long time.  If you need a new game to get, make it this one.",1696826339,1696826339,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Update 2023:
Also reason I managed to do this with ez is because I beat the game on the Nintendo Switch a while back so I had experience. 

I could have refunded lol because 2 hours didn't go by. I fully recommend the game even if you have already played it!

Guy who gave me Jester award must have been angry lol! New players will find this game hard at times because this is a bullet hell! A good one!

Bookworm, I'm studious
From my cerebral cortex to my gluteus
Back in kindergarten I aced my college entrance exam
Now, I'm no rocket scientist
Oh wait, I am
When I pour my Alpha-bits, I get nothing but straight A's
My retainer and headgear connect to a back brace
I've got a pocket protector, protector, protector
I broke my glasses on purpose so I could tape 'em together
Run back to Reddit and type stuff no one will see
You're a geek, that means you're just a hipster wannabe
That's right, I'm a geek
I've got brains and a personality
I wear my glasses sincerely
And my T-shirts ironically
There're some things you can't learn in a class
Or else I'd sign you up for ""Intro to how not to be a social outcast""
You're just so early 2013
I was the cool form of uncool before uncool became a thing
I use an app to pair pork with the perfect Bordeaux
Too bad there's no app to neutralize your B.O.
While you're lost in Second Life letting your fingernails grow long
I'll be syncing up my iPhone, tablet, TV and your mom
Sure grooming's not my thing
But I don't care
I look so good in chainmail that it's not Renaissance Fair
Doesn't LARP stand for Loser And Reject Party?
I'd rather cosplay with hotties than play fake army
I tried Dungeons and Dragons once
And I died of boredom
But I'll still kick your Assassin's Creed post-mortem
Mario party's the only one you're getting invited to
Your life is like Skyrim
An endless quest of solitude
Ooh, you beat Angry Birds
You're not a gamer 'cause you battle your friends with words
You click on cute icons, I execute commands
Do you really need a genius to teach you Garageband?
I landed the first Roflcopter
And took in orphans when I was 12
'Cause I'm an early adopter
I can wear Google Glass without looking like a dweeb
OK, maybe not
But I can yelp us some good pho to eat
You need 16 gigs of RAM to watch a Steve Jobs doc?
I keep an actual ram in my PC, his name is Spock
I'm a new console
Your face is birth control
I troll Brony sites, you look like an actual troll
I'm fluent in C++, see, you just suck
Can your iPhone auto-correct your dumb haircut?
Hold on a second, let me tweet this infographic I made
That illustrates the fact you'll never get to procreate
I just haven't met a woman of a high enough caliber
The only dates you have are on your G-G-Google Calendar
You're losing this battle, your foam sword won't help
In the future you'll randomly access this memory and crap yourself
Did I mention I built a dancing robot?
No one gives a Shatner about your skinny jeans
Do you even know what URL means?
You don't know what you're Tolkien about
You know
You are a classic example of the inverse ratio between the size of the mouth and the size of the brain!",1695550267,1695550267,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I ended up getting in this loop where I would feel like playing this game, to then uninstalling the next day. I never really took the time to really dive in.

Well, lets just say the past month or so, I actually did manage to dive in. You may think this simple rogue like game is all about shooting fun guns and killing bosses, but that is just the surface. The developers did such an amazing job throwing you into the gungeon and just letting you experience the game. The secrets and different ways to play is immense for what feels like a straightforward game. I'm about 100 hours in, have yet to unlock every item in the game, and there are STILL things I have yet to do. And the beautiful thing of it all is that the game doesn't give you any hints, you are left to your own devices when it comes to exploring the gungeon.

Totally recommend this game.

Developed by Dodge Roll and published by Devolver Digital, this game stands out for its innovative design and addictive gameplay.

Pros:

Challenging Gameplay: ""Enter the Gungeon"" provides a high level of difficulty, requiring players to master dodging and weaving through intricate bullet patterns. Each playthrough offers a fresh challenge, making it highly replayable.

Weapon Variety: One of the game's standout features is its vast array of imaginative weapons, ranging from standard firearms to bizarre and comical armaments. Experimenting with different weapons keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting.

Co-op Mode: The game supports local co-op, allowing you to team up with a friend for some intense, chaotic fun. Cooperation and communication are essential for success, adding to the game's replayability.

Humor and Style: ""Enter the Gungeon"" features a quirky sense of humor and charming pixel art style that adds personality to the game. The diverse cast of characters and the absurdity of their quest to find a legendary gun create an engaging atmosphere.

Randomization: Each playthrough is procedurally generated, meaning you'll never experience the same dungeon layout twice. This randomness adds unpredictability and keeps the game from becoming repetitive.

Cons:

Steep Learning Curve: The game can be quite challenging, and the learning curve may be steep for newcomers to bullet hell shooters or roguelikes. Some players may find it frustrating at first.

Permadeath: Like many roguelikes, ""Enter the Gungeon"" has a permadeath mechanic. Some players may be discouraged by the loss of progress upon death.

Repetitiveness: While the procedural generation helps keep things fresh, some players might still find the gameplay repetitive after numerous runs.

In conclusion, ""Enter the Gungeon"" is an excellent game for fans of challenging roguelikes and bullet hell shooters. Its unique weapons, humor, and co-op mode make it an enjoyable experience for those willing to tackle its difficulty. However, if you're not a fan of challenging gameplay or permadeath mechanics, it may not be the right choice for you.",1694845794,1694845794,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

A good selection of characters with different abilities and back stories (and their own boss) a pretty fair progression system. The NPCs are entertaining and numerous, the bosses are numerous and unique. Having 1 or 3 different bosses for each level adds on to the already massive replay-ability of this game.

Personally i liked the goofy and full of puns humor, but even if you won't like it, it's not in your face most of the time.
Soundtracks are solid and always fitting.
-Some of starting characters could be more unique. Also the first floor shoud have a better enemy variety as this is the place where players will spend most of the time.

I have 207 hours there, but the game was so good I felt the need to get it on steam (on sale) just to be able to get achievements/write a review/actually pay for such a good game. This is one of my top 10 games.

This is one of the most fun combat systems I've seen in any game with a bunch random little things you can do in this game, and it's art style is incredible. Almost every gun has some sort of cool ability or unique way of working, everything is some kind of reference to something else, and every thing in this game is some kind of joke (or a bullet). Gungeon is like a cheeky love letter to video games.

The progression in this Gungeon is so satisfying (at first), you always have some sort of goal or something to find/do in the Gungeon, always another reason to do another run always something too look out for, I love the way unlocking new items works, either through completing some sort of task, or spending the credits you get from bosses. Though once you near the end game of completing that damn ammonomocon... the progression just feels tiring and boring. Especially the hunts you have to do, it was a fun side thing to look out for at first but when you have to do runs specifically to floor 3 just to hope you get a single shambling round out of 20... yea the game just wasn't fun anymore.

There are about 60 enemies in the game, all pretty unique and really fun to fight, and about 30 bosses, that are (mostly) all fun to learn. and get down, the combat is super high energy and just the right level of difficulty. The incentive to always do bosses hit-less makes it never feel like at least the bosses never go stale.

Something I really appreciate is that unlike some rogue likes (((Isaac))) the game is always fun right off the bat. Runs arent boring or agonizing to start because the combat and enemy design is well done. Items are fun, but they aren't what make the game.

A big issue I take with the game, is it's clarity towards the player. This game has secret floors they never hit and and have INCREDIBLY arbitrary ways of getting to them, and hidden mechanics that they never tutorialize (coolness, curse, stealing). Also there are in game item descriptions, but they aren't really accurate. Most items only have some of what they do in there description, and a couple of them just have joke descriptions so you constantly need a wiki open for this game to know what you're even picking up. 
I will admit, exchanging information constantly with my friends where we all constantly asked ""what does this do, how does this work"" as we were all exploring the Gungeon early on, was a fun experience to have, and maybe more fun for me that way, but single player games shouldn't need that. 

This was my first rogue-like, and I used to think it was perfect since I hadn't played others. After playing about 40 hours of the Binding of Isaac, it's both given me more of an appreciation for this game, and it opened my eyes to realize this games just... too repetitive after a while. Don't get me wrong, they did a banger job, still got 200 hours out of it and had a ton of fun, though the further I got into progression the less fun the game felt. But there's not as much complexity to your build due to the fact there there's less item management as there could be with things like Isaac's consumables or trinkets. There aren't very many bullet effects, theres little to no interaction you have with the way you get items, most of the games variety comes from it's guns, and those get stale after a while. Every run usually comes down too ""Okay heres my boss clearing gun, heres my room clearing gun."" The inclusion of the rat stealing your items/pickups when you leave them in a room just makes the game anti item management. I thought it was for balance at first but I cant for the life of me think of how it balances the game, just makes it less fun.

The Boss DPS cap is kinda stupid and makes being overpowered not as fun as it should be, just drags out bosses when you have literally no chance of dying.",1653056565,1693241295,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game follows a group of brave characters as they enter a dangerous underground labyrinth called the Gungeon and battle enemies while searching for a valuable object. Filled with a variety of weapons, abilities and challenging enemies, this fun world offers players the opportunity to test their quick reflexes and strategy skills.

Unique Weapon Variety: One of the most remarkable aspects of the game is the vast and unique weapon collection. Each weapon has its own unique gameplay style and characteristics. The variety of weapons ensures that the game offers a different experience every time.

Challenging Enemies and Boss Battles: Players encounter a variety of enemies and particularly challenging boss battles throughout the maze. These battles test players' ability to react quickly and use strategy.

Randomly Generated World: The game offers randomly generated levels and enemy arrangements. This ensures a different experience each time the game is played and increases replayability.

Co-operative Playability: ""Enter the Gungeon"" offers two-player co-operative gameplay. Players can co-operate with friends and fight together against enemies and bosses.

Secret Rooms and Progress: The game is full of hidden rooms, secrets and special items. There is a lot of hidden content for players to discover throughout the game.

However, the game's high difficulty level may be off-putting for some players. Initially, it may take some time to get used to the game's difficulty and gameplay mechanics.

Overall, ""Enter the Gungeon"" offers a fun and addictive experience for players who enjoy fast-paced shooters. The variety of weapons, randomly generated world, and challenging enemies keep players' attention and skills firmly gripped.

While I've played and enjoyed my fair share of rogue-likes (Darkest Dungeon, FTL, Inscryption, and Hades, to name a few), and their sharp spikes in difficulty at times, I just did not have fun with Enter the Gungeon at any time, and I can chalk it up to a few key grievances I have with the game design: 
[list]
[*] [b] Little-to-no guidance:[/b] After a bare-bones tutorial that only explains the key controls, you are just thrown into the game. Spoiler alert: there is WAY more to the game than just the basic controls. For instance, there are hundreds of different guns you can pick up that each does its own special thing (which is arguably the game's selling point), but the game will not just tell you anything about them beyond its ""Ammonomicon"" entry, which is more concerned with giving you flavor text than any sort of pertinent information as to how the damn gun works. I shouldn't have to consult the wiki just to know basic mechanics of the game.
[*] [b] Needlessly punishing:[/b] There are so many little traps and mistakes you can run into that will punish you hard for no reason. Like how ammo pickups or items you leave behind in a room will be ""stolen"", never to be seen or collected again. Or how health pickups when you're at full health show you a ""Save For Later"" message, implying that if you pick it up you get to bank it on the spot, except what it really does is just destroy it forever. Or how the gun-combiner merchant that takes two guns and gives you a totally new one actually just gives you a completely random gun and not one that is necessarily better than either two you just sacrificed or even one that is [i]good[/i] in an objective sense. Case in point: I once got a Pea Shooter from them once, which is a gun that ends up somehow being weaker than the dinky starting pistols that at least have infinite ammo.
[*] [b] Pathetic characters:[/b] Each of the four starter characters are hella weak and underwhelming. They have low health, their movement speed is slow, and their aim with the guns THEY CHOSE is downright atrocious. The ""Marine"" has just as much health as everyone else despite literally wearing armor, and is only equipped with a dinky starter pistol. The ""Pilot"" has a lockpick that has a 50-50 chance of either opening a lock (go figure) or to [b]completely render the lock unopenable forever[/b] (NOT explained in-game) and only starts with a dinky starter pistol. The ""Convict"" brings a shotgun with so much spread it struggles to consistently kill basic enemies at anything except so-close-you're-eating-their-bullets range. The ""Hunter"" is the only character I bother choosing on account of her having a hard-hitting crossbow, but the accuracy on it is startlingly shit, often completely missing targets only a third of the screen away (not very far). Maybe there's a way to get permanent upgrades later on, but a feature like that ought to be available from the start.
[*] [b] NPC's hard to get:[/b] The game does something similar to Crypt of the Necrodancer, where the hub world NPC's start out unavailable, and must be unlocked by jumping through hoops to ""rescue"" them in the game proper. This is all well and good, except in Crypt of the Necrodancer, the NPC's consistently appear in the levels as long as they haven't been saved yet. In Enter the Gungeon, it's a crapshoot whether or not an NPC will even be available to save, and if you fail to save them (either because you die or don't end up finding their key) then there's no telling when your next chance will be. Overall frustrating and, again, needlessly punishing.
[*] [b] Boring soundtrack:[/b] The music is so damn generic and just fades into the background. Positively mediocre and unremarkable.
[*] [b] Game discourages backtracking:[/b] In most rogue-likes that allow backtracking, there's some sort of inherent risk to it, be it an existing time pressure or respawning enemies or some such, with the reward being additional flexibility in approaching your current run, or simply more time to grind currency or items. Enter the Gungeon handles backtracking rather poorly. Your character moves slowly and each of the rooms is rather large (as are the hallways connecting the rooms). To remedy this, the game has it so some rooms have a teleporter pad that you can warp to and from with complete freedom (emphasis on [i]some[/i] rooms...). And yet, as mentioned before, the game has a built-in mechanic that automatically ""steals"" items you may want to leave for yourself at a later moment, completely defeating the purpose of including this extraordinarily convenient mechanic that otherwise enables you great flexibility with how to approach a run.

In all, Enter the Gungeon is a punishing game for all the wrong reasons, sporting lackluster and unremarkable characters, frustrating gameplay, a listless and forgettable soundtrack, and a lack of all the qualities that I've come to love and expect from modern rogue-likes. Maybe someone can add a comment to this review and help me understand what makes this game so fun for the majority of other people, because I can't say I was anything apart from disappointed during my entire experience.",1693122020,1693122020,False,2,2,0.492307692766189575,0,True,False,False

I saw someone on my Steam friend list playing, “Enter The Gungeon”, oh my, what is this? I thought to myself.
I just had to munch on this game, I ran downstairs to find my piggy bank, tucked away in my basement (Binding of Isaac reference, for those who don’t get it) and continued to tackle it.
It had braken, and to my surprise, no money was achieved. I gasped, but remembered that I could steal my neighbor’s credit card, as I was already using their wifi without them knowing.
After I did so, I input the info into Steam and swiftly added the game to my cart. I purchased and installed it. 3 days later it had finished, I achieved the play button.
As I spent 35 minutes changing my settings, I had entered the breach.
I was shocked to see the large cast of playable characters, I decided to play the convict because it reminded me of myself, after I was sentenced to 2 death sentences in Lehigh County Jail in 1985.
I appeared in the game, my first run lasted about 2 and a half minutes, I died of a burning sensation.
Really? I thought to myself. In one fell swoop, I grabbed my keyboard and angrily typed “Enter The Gungeon cheats” into Bing.
I found a little thing called Mod The Gungeon. I installed it instantly and found the debug console made the game quite good. Probably a 6/10.",1526518310,1693119903,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

And that's a shame, because there is actually a fun game here with lots of unique weapons.

My main complaints are;
1. HP:  Not enough chances to recover health (drop rate is low and shop is expensive)
2. Bosses:  Way too OP
3. Weapon RNG:  Don't find a good weapon on the first floor? Too bad! Forget about winning the boss fight!
4. Room RNG:  Room might be big or small, have few or many enemies. You can be unlucky and enter a small room with lots of powerful enemies and no place to go behind cover. And no, you can't exit the room before you have defeated all the enemies.
5. Weapons:  Of all the weapons I have found, most of them are pretty weak. Maybe good enough for clearing rooms, but useless against the bosses.

No way of increasing your health or lowering difficulty or something like that. I would not even mind if I can't 100% this game but lacking any meta progression means that your individual runs basically mean nothing.

It's just not a game for me. The early game is so incredibly boring and tedious I just shut the game down during a boss because I realized I was going to be stuck for the next 10 minutes doing piddly squat damage and dodging everything and then the next few floors were going to be the exact same thing again. I'm probably not going to start it up ever again.

Reasons why it's not for me:
1) The guns are varied and there's some fun ones out there, but it's very stingy with giving you guns... and if your game is based around guns and you get so few, half your selling point's gone.
2) Progression doesn't really matter, you can unlock more guns but you're not likely to see any of them (see point 1 ), There's no character upgrades or ways to speed up the game to make the early game more enjoyable AFAIK, there's no particular reason to try and unlock things and there's nothing to look forward to aside from getting more skilled at the game. Which is fine, but not for me.
3) The Core gameplay loop is not fun for me. This is not a gun-game, this isn't a frantic game, it's only partly about the guns. The core gameplay loop is endurance: How long can you keep dodging bullets? Sometimes you have a very powerful gun and the bosses and rooms take a long time, sometimes you have a bad or no gun and it takes a REALLY long time. The only consistency is that you'll trying to dodge whatever they throw at you. Which frankly isn't for me. 

Again, I still recommend it, a ton of people have had a ton of fun with it, but it's a game that screams tedious to me and I don't feel a particular need to learn to get better at it because of that.",1691928253,1691928253,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The steam play-together feature is technically enabled, but entirely non-functional in any meaningful capacity.

While it's enjoyable on occasion, it easily takes 10 failed attempts before one even workable turn of RNG comes along and you can survive the first boss.
This can be countered fairly well by cheating for infinite keys and money, but even then it's a overly difficult by the fourth level of the dungeon.

Overall, I Would NOT recommend it unless you're fine with cheating or you're a masochist who wants constant, unplayably bad RNG disadvantages that could only be mitigated with having multiple players in the same session.

You're better off going to play Risk of Rain or Heros of Hammerwatch instead (because those games have decent RNG and devs competent enough to add online multiplayer).",1691720042,1691907577,False,4,1,0.420937299728393555,0,True,False,False

Enemy bullets move extremely slowly, making the entire game, including late and post-game bosses, super easy. Even small things like a lot of weak gun firing sounds make them so unsatisfying to use.

Enter the Gungeon is the very first rogue-like that ever clicked with me. For many of the starting hours, the challenge of making it past 5 floors of the dungeon will feel insurmountable unless you're a gaming god. But you learn, and adapt, and train your muscle memory and eyes to track the myriad bullets and enemies on screen. And with a nice dose of meta progression in the form of guns and items you unlock, the game feeds you more and more arsenal slowly, until the whole thing cracks wide open. And suddenly BOOM, you get your first clear! And then  your second... and they start coming more often, and the rest is history. And don't worry, because once you get regular clears, you will realize there's much more at the endgame than just beating the High Dragun, and that becomes a whole new set of goals.

In conclusion, very few other games have core gameplay this good. The shooting and dodging and gun variety are unbeatable, and I really love many of the bosses.

If all your answers were 'yes', then you might like Enter the Gungeon. [b] WELCOME TO BULLET HELL [/b] [i] (kind of) [/i].
Enter The Gungeon is really good for making player to go further and further, and to challenge youself too. In every Chamber there will be new enemies with different weapons/attacks, abilities and different quantities of traps. Game offers you four main characters with their own unique abilities to play as and to complete their side of the story in ETG.
Depending on the run you're having moments of easy can make quite fast 180° turn and get you overwhelmed. Only learning from your mistakes and learning the enemy patterns you'll succeed... or you just have the most dumbest luck and get through the game with easy, that's possible too.
Even when you get passed the ""[i] Final Boss [/i]"" you still have things to do, for example:
 [list]
[*]Free all the prisoners
[*]Open all the shortcuts
[*][spoiler] Defeat The Past [/spoiler]
[*]Try the mutations to spice the runs
[*]etc etc
[/list]
With all honesty ETG is good [i]pass your time[/i] game even for casual gamers (like myself), it might be hard and challenging at first but more runs you'll have behind you the better you'll perform. From RNG Chambers/floors to alternating bosses and weapons, every run is different and unique.
[spoiler] If you are a streamer, have played ETG through and would like to spice your runs a bit, ask and let your community to decide what to do in your run. [/spoiler]
Game also has local co-op (and maybe online co-op), altho I haven't tried the coop at all so I don't have anything to say about it. 😐 But play it with or without friend(s) I bet you'll be having fun with this game... at least until you don't.

This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you

That being said, this game is very fun! Excellent rogue-like with fun mechanics, interesting items, and super awesome guns. Everything in this game is a gun pun: your health, your bosses, your characters, they're all bullets or guns or shells or whatnot. This game is incredibly silly when it comes to the gun aspect and it goes all out, with interesting concepts and excellent gameplay. I'd say the game is also reasonably hard, but the more you play it the better you get.
HOWEVER, there are some flaws that the game has, such as it being a bit difficult to know how to advance in the game. Be prepared to do a LOT of googling and to download a LOT of mods, especially ones that tell you what the items do and what the rooms are, because without them you'll be lost. I especially recommend health bar add-on mods that show how much health each enemy has, which is something the base game lacks and can make for a really difficult experience, as well as mods that auto-reload and of course the Custom Characters Mod by Kyle (lets you use custom characters in the game). If you don't google every aspect of this game, you'll never know what you need to do in order to get more endings and get further in the game. That being said, including so much information could also interrupt the gameplay flow, so I understand why the game doesn't just tell you what to do and how to do it for the most part.
I love doing Gungeon runs and just throwing myself at it, especially because it's extremely fun to just shoot the guns and dodge around the enemy bullets. The concept is simple and the execution is awesome, I just wish there were more base game bosses and enemies that didn't need mods to be added.
Overall, I highly recommend the game, but I'd wait until it's on sale. Also, Mod the Gungeon is necessary to use mods, so download that first if you do.",1690093921,1690093921,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

The fundamental core of this game is quite well designed. The presentation is great, the gameplay is engaging and there is a lot of content to experience. But underneath all that are various features which make the overall experience a miserable chore.

Health upgrades are a massive factor in survival as they significantly extend the player's ability to survive, however finding health upgrades is totally random. It is completely random whether or not a health upgrade shows up during a given playthrough. The only consistent form of health upgrade is acquired by defeating bosses without getting hit a single time. Thus players must hold themselves to the highest standard of never getting hit against the biggest threats in the game just to consistently increase their health to have a far better chance of winning in the end. This consequently makes taking even a single hit significantly more destructive and frustrating because of how much it impacts the run.

The boss difficulty is extremely inconsistent, with some foes being far more dangerous than others. Certain attacks and moments in a given fight are disproportionately more difficult to avoid than others; like when a boss runs right up to the player and shoots at them point blank or random hazards converge in a way that is nearly impossible to avoid. This is a problem in general as even outside of boss fights this kind of thing will happen, but the difference is that if players get hit during the boss fight then they lose their chance at a health upgrade. This makes the standard of never getting hit during a boss fight even more absurd and infuriating because there is so much randomness at play throughout the course of each fight.

Players do have a special mechanic that allows them to escape dangerous situations, but it is a finite resource that doesn't work against certain threats and only works if the player has time to actually react. Thus the mechanic is at best a superficial bandage plastered over a gaping source of frustration and unfairness in this experience.

Most of the overarching unlock mechanics in the game are tedious and run contradictory to enjoying a run. Having to get lucky with hoarding and then burning a bunch of resources to unlock various things at various moments, having entire swathes of content or resources locked behind the player discovering obscure secrets, carrying an item all the way to the final area which drops out of the player's inventory every time they dodge and it disappears if they forget to pick it up again all just to unlock a thing, having to purposely do a certain unintuitive thing during a totally random moment multiple times to unlock something else, having to jump through obscure hoops and sacrifice resources to acquire certain items then successfully bring them all the way down to the final area to unlock an extremely important thing.

The game also offers special challenge modes, which require the player to grind resources just to even attempt them. The actual challenge modes merely afflict the player with random effects that randomly make things more or less difficult, thus making the challenge modes a gauntlet of luck.



The base gameplay of this experience is amazing; a varied, potently atmospheric and compelling rogue-lite. But most of its deeper mechanics are just totally miserable chores, which contort this otherwise amazing experience into a miserable chore. Ransoming almost any amount of meaningful progress behind obnoxious tasks largely driven by repetition, luck and self-sabotage.

Every run is the same and very rarely do you get a synergy, the floors feel repetitive since... there's little randomization and it gets to be a little bit boring after a while.

[b] GamePlay [/b]

Once again, I happened to be more engaged by the indie games rather than AAA stuff. Enter The Gungeon present [i] solid mechanics [/i]. The conjunction of them all are clearly thought to walk along with Dynamics, even though actions like rolling or table flipping are common enough to be boring, the design of the enemy bullets, and levels make them pretty fun, as you feel inmersed on a gunfight. Unfortunately after some hours (I have some hundreds on ps4) flipping tables are not as usefull as in the begging of the experience. 

[i] Comedy [/i] in this game is very important. Is not an deadass boring comedy like several movies, the game has a tone of sarcastic comedy that feels great but not overwhelming, just a right amount of it, and it's the heart of the game. Something I really like is having stories told by the description of items and weapons, they produce in you a touch of nostalgia and mystery  because of the abandoned dungeon context; they are *incomplete*, letting you imagine the rest of it. several items and weapons have a touch of comedy that it just makes me laugh, and others got me thinking about how that story could continue, something little games make me do willfully. Actually, this is one of a million games that encourages me to read as much as I can about the internal lore, it's just great. 

[b] Enjoyment [/b]

The lack of [i] Fun [/i] as a topic in movies and game reviews makes me think of incomplete analysis. Good games are design to be an experience more than just a game and even though a game's mechanics are common and etc... if you had fun playing it, something went well in the design. It could be the aesthetics, player's curiosity, the tone, blablabla. But Enter The Gungeon makes you wanna play the game, because it is just FUN. The overall possible combinations, the npcs, lore, guns itself gives you an amazing amount of fun to interact with. Discovering a gun that throws guns that shoots bullets is just amazing. 

I know the review is incomplete and i'm rambling to much in my topics, but I wanted to exposed those not so common great points about the game, and I am to lazy to continue rn and to summarize.

The game was a bit difficult at first but after watching some guides on YouTube I finally learned how to play and succeed only issue I have with the game is that some runs can get boring after a while that’s because those runs were unlucky run, and I had a bad luck so I received really bad things like guns and items, but it doesn’t happen that often anymore it only happens rarely.
The characters are cool like the marine with a shield I used to do my runs with him, but people say that the hunter is also good for beginners cause the dog can find you items like hearts, ammo and other stuff (and the fact that you can pet the dog is neat). and you also have second weapon the bow, the bow is awesome the enemies got no chance against you when you use the bow.
The music in this game is good the intro music sounds good as well and when you beat a boss that awesome soundtrack plays.

I recommend this game to anyone that like roguelikes 10/10
 
Update: I played this game for a while longer and I finished it twice with the hunter character. First time without the Bullet that kills the past and the second time with the bullet. So, this review is pretty up to date I just want to mention that when I was in the process of unlocking the elevators I was starting to hate the game so once I almost unlocked the 5 elevator the last requirement was to flawless a boss in the fourth floor and that floor is really difficult and the bosses are as well so I did not unlock the last elevator and I stopped playing.
So that said I changed my mind I don’t recommend this game it’s not for everyone especially for people that have anger issues.",1664573883,1689104650,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Everyone has regrets: something you wish you did, something you wish you didn’t do, something you just want to forget. So how far would you go to kill the past? Would you stare down hordes of enemies, explore an ever changing labyrinth, only to die and start again from the beginning? Would you… Enter the Gungeon?

In Enter the Gungeon, you play as one of the Gungeoneers: people with deep regrets who explore the mostly randomized Gungeon to find its great treasure, a gun that can kill the past. Each of them start with different weapons and items. For example, my favorite, the Hunter, starts with a rusty pistol, a crossbow, and a dog. The pistol has unlimited ammo, but is weaker than other character’s starting weapons. The crossbow is powerful, but has a long reload time. And you can pet the dog when it occasionally digs up extra items for you. All of the Gungeoneers have their pros and cons, but all of them feel viable and can use any of the Gungeon’s countless weapons. You can use the weapons you discover in chests throughout the Gungeon in satisfying and fun ways; from the baseball bat to hit back bullets to a gun riding a skateboard, every weapon is unique, incredibly creative, and have well written descriptions in the game’s Ammonomicon. You can play as a bullet, using a bullet that shoots shotguns which shoot bullets. What more could you want?

You probably want to explore the Gungeon. Each time you enter, the layout of each floor is randomized. Instead of complete randomization, every room is purposefully designed, and the game draws upon a large pool of them to create the level. This stops the game from generating cheap death traps, and instead you get… fair death traps. You can also find various secrets on each floor, from hidden rooms to entrances to secret floors. Each floor offers an abundance of choices to make each foray interesting and, more importantly, fun. Do you visit the shop to buy a new weapon or replenish your health, or do you head straight for the boss? Do you use one of your precious keys to open a chest, or do you save them to fix the elevator to start your next run on a lower floor?

The Gungeon itself is also gorgeous. All the enemies, characters, and weapons you encounter are colorful and intricately animated. Every single one is memorable, which makes it very easy to remember their attacks or how they can help you. The bosses especially are a visual treat. They all have an intro screen with some very detailed pixel art, and it’s easy to tell how each will attack you just from looking at their design, even if you’ve never encountered them before. After defeating a boss, you get some currency that stays with you after you die. You spend this in the game’s hub on weapons and items to add to the pool of treasures you can find in the Gungeon. It helps to add a sense of progression without making it feel like you couldn’t reach the end of any run. One of my favorite parts of discovering new items is to read about them in the Ammonomicon. Their descriptions can range from funny absurdity to interesting lore. I would open the menu every time I got something new, or sometimes just to watch the animation for opening the book.

Speaking of menus, which are all intricately detailed, Enter the Gungeon has some of the best options menus in any console game. You can adjust practically everything about the game, including button mapping and graphics settings. You can also set some options to change when you’re playing co-op with a friend. More games could really use an options menu like Gungeon’s: Why isn’t button mapping standard in every game?

While Enter the Gungeon is partially a bullet hell, you have plenty of time and options to avoid every single shot that comes your way. Every enemy and boss has a distinct shooting pattern, which incentivised me to deal with the ones I felt less confident in dodging first. If you can’t dodge by moving or rolling, you can hide behind walls or flipped up tables, and if all else fails, you can use a blank to erase all bullets from the screen. And thanks to the generous amount of aim assist, which you can also adjust or turn off, you never have to stop shooting. This along with all the different weapon types and items makes every single encounter feel strategic and different. It can feel exhilarating clearing a floor without taking a single hit, or just scraping by with a sliver of health left.

Enter the Gungeon is a game for everyone. I play co-op often with my little brother who mostly enjoys sports games and shooters. It has enough random chance that less skilled players can get lucky, and experienced players don’t have to rely on lady luck. It’s funny, frightening, cute, fun, and fair.",1686160912,1688769777,True,1,0,0.505102038383483887,0,True,False,False

+ 4 starting characters, +1 co-op, +4 unlockable (Gungeoneers) with different starting weapons and abilities (active/inactive items).

+ Huge variety of weapons and items of which many provide buffs when used in tandem.

+ Challenging and interesting bosses.

+ Ability to roll: dodge bullets and become invincible to them for a short period and get over gaps.

+ Blanks: Remove all incoming projectiles and push enemies away.

+ Beautiful pixel art and cool level design.

+ Armour and hearts or health bullets.

+ I really like the portals; you can quickly travel around in the current chamber (floor).

+ Shops with random assortment of weapons and items you can purchase with the bullet currency. Sometimes there are health dispensers and NPC's.

+  Chest rooms (requires a key to unlock). Sometimes non-locked chests spawn after clearing a room of enemies.

+ Hidden rooms with rewards

+ Target rooms with increasing rarity of loot rewarded the more targets you hit.

+ Unlock rooms and save prisoners with golden keys (princess peach).

+ Thrones and gifts from goddess.


The RNG (randomness) aspect can make some runs very unfair and some lucky.

Its generally a challenging game which requires practice, dedication, 
smart plays (which enemy/ies to prioritize, positioning, taking cover, when to play aggressive or passive, timing of rolling and using blanks) and 
planning (what to purchase, sell, trade in etc..) if you want to progress far. 

You should also experiment with all the gungeoneers and see who you like, fits your playstyle or which playstyle each one is ideal for.",1686696474,1688756700,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was a bored, misguided, lost, and broken child with 15 dollars to my name.. I needed to give it to something, but alas, nothing piqued my interest... Until I saw it... On the Nintendo Shop, a beautiful gem, a diamond in the rough if you will. Except this diamond was polished, clean, and dazzling. I saw the cover art, a simple yet enticing Bullet Kin running.. ""From what?"" I wondered. My heart pounded as I had to find the answers. I looked into it, ""Enter the Gungeon? That's a stupid name.."" is what I thought, little did I know I had found The Garden of Eden of games.. But instead of angels protecting it, a paywall... A 15 dollar paywall... I was skeptical, so I searched up a video. A video that made me question all I knew about my life, and more. Was I destined to find this gem? Is this God saying I am his child, this is what I was meant to have? The video was not only engaging but informative.. I decided to download the game, and that was the best decision of my life... I opened that game and I saw him.. The Pilot, Dash as ""Dodge Roll"" appeared, trying to crush him. I always thought myself a straight man, but when I saw that sexy rapscallion dash through, I didn't know what to think. I loaded in and was met with pure bliss. Four starter characters who all called out to me... I knew I had to play them all! I got onto my character, The Huntress and walked down into the Gungeon.. The orgasmic feeling of shooting a Bullet Kin, the satisfying tingle of killing a Gunnut.. They never faded, it was mesmerizing. Whether it was a Bullet King, Bullet Twins, and a damn Bird, I COULDN'T CARE LESS! THEY ALL BENT TO ME, THE ONE WITH THE CHAMBER, THE ONE WITH THE POWER AND THE BLANKS! Have you ever had an orgasm before? Of course not. You know why? You have never had the Cactus, Fat Bullets, and Blank Bullets whilst being the Gunslinger. The average male produces 1.5 - 5.0 millilitres of semen every time they finish. I produced 5 times that, and then some. Do you know what that does to someone? It makes them addicted, it made ME addicted. I played for hours, days, weeks, months on end on my tiny Nintendo Switch Lite. I had everything.. Everyone.. I was completely done... But I felt empty.. My heart yearned for more.. So I got onto my PS4 and downloaded the game there too. A fresh start, a new life. I enjoyed the game with friends. And I got to enjoy it all again.. And so I did, until I beat it on there too? No.. No.. That can't right.. It's only been three weeks this time.. I HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN, I NEED TO SHOOT ANOTHER BULLET KIN DOWN WITH JUST A STARTER FIREARM! So I got it on my pc.. It was only better then.. Better and better, this game only gets better! Until two weeks in, I did it: I got 100% on the game on pc. My room now coated in white, I finished... I leaned back as I saw that final achievement. I did not want to reproduce, I had never even considered it, until this game. I want to bare children so I can make them shoot the Shotgun Kin as they smoke the Defect with a Molotov as I hear them say ""Dad.. I know my purpose in life now."" Thank you, Dodge Roll.. Thank you for this tingly experience I have been able to enjoy for years and more to come. I do not just ""recommend"" this game, I implore you to get it. If you are unsure, don't be, Kaliber and her children are waiting. And I suggest bringing some tissues, because you will finish before the game does..",1687846982,1687846982,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Solid Difficulty Curve - you typically aren't asked to do something you can't do or haven't been trained for

Cons: 
The Wiki is a MUST
This game does not respect your time - Frifle's Challenges will wall you out if you want 100%
No matter how good you are, the game manufactures its own longevity for the sake of lengthening playtime
Challenge Mode (Daisuke) is ATROCIOUS - having beaten it, I can guarantee its not worth doing. You have to study every effect and READ every effect on every room, effectively slowing down the flow of the game.
Rat fight 3rd phase: extremely weird choice to unceremoniously slap another game's mechanics over here with no practice mode whatsoever

If that didn't convince you to buy, I don't know what will.

I've been playing Enter the Gungeon since 2017 I think and I kept uninstalling it and reinstalling it because there is quite a learning curve to it, but the controls are very easy to learn.

People I've personally encountered compare it a lot to Nuclear Throne, which I've personally yet to play. My impression is that Gungeon is slower paced and a bit easier. Gungeon was my second Twin Stick Shooter Roguelite, after Isaac. Isaac is a bit unique, so it took me quite a few hours before ""learning"" Gungeon, and getting my first win.

Some like Hades or Inscryption are shining examples of what the subgenre is capable of, others like dead cells have great gameplay but are so completely insulting that they retroactively make the rest of the game bad (un-subtly asking for money after a single completed run to add new areas to the game is seriously bad form), and some like enter the gungeon are just a resounding apathetic ""meh"".

The game works. The game is functional and I have not encountered a single bug or glitch in my 16 hours of gameplay. You shoot your gun, you dodge roll and you open doors; every single aspect of it works.
However that's really all there is to it, and the gameplay is just 'fine' and nothing else. Nothing about this game is bad, while at the same time nothing is truly rewarding or satisfying or makes you feel like you're really making progress. And while I haven't finished it, I'm about ready to throw in the towel.

A vast majority of the guns I've found are either dumb gimmicks or just don't do any damage, and as such, it's the only roguelite I've played that feels almost entirely reliant on luck. Other games of the genre do rely heavily on luck as well in order to put together a decent build on every run, but you can still manage to squeak by if you perform well enough. In ETG though, every single battle has so much crap flying everywhere in tight, confined spaces that just about every combat encounter becomes less a test of skill and more a battle of attrition. If you get to a boss and you haven't found a decent weapon, it's faster to just restart the run, because most weapons are so comically weak that you will be fighting long enough to make costly mistakes regardless of your skill level.

The only actual progress you make in the game is adding new weapons to the loot pool, new npcs in the gungeon itself that show up very rarely,  and opening shortcuts to later floors. But it doesn't really add much to the overall gameplay like upgrades in other games do, and so it feels like you're constantly spinning your wheels without going anywhere and I just can't muster up the desire to keep going.

As a final aside: this game is so kwerky that it's physically painful. Not once did I laugh at the game's lame attempts at humor [spoiler] ""See it's funny because normally guns shoot bullets and not the other way around."" [/spoiler], the enemy designs make my eyes roll into my skull, and while some references to other media are a nice touch like [spoiler] Barrett's arm cannon from FF7 [/spoiler] it only sparked my neurons because it's referencing something I love, and not because the game made something cool or funny itself.

All in all, while ETG isn't a bad game per se, it's not nearly gripping enough to entice me over the finish line. Gameplay is all it has, and the gameplay is just ok and nothing more.",1685772626,1685772975,False,2,2,0.450385361909866333,0,True,False,False

It's fast paced (it is bullet hell xD), like many other rouglikes you can just play one run from time to time and still have plenty of fun, it has relatively easy to learn mechanics that are not so easy to master and the 2D art is just so lovely, not to mention that soundtrack is also amazing, especially the menu track. And the world! Everything is a gun! It is both insanely creative and so funny. If you want both fun and challenge then you found a right game. 

Here underneath I have a bigger description for those who like to read xD:

=== Bullet Hell ===
Ok so you know how I mentioned bullet hell mechanics? Well there are A LOT of bullets on the screen, especially when dealing with bosses. This game is gonna test your ability to dodge just in time, to erase bullets with scarce ""blanks"" you will gather through the run and to manouvre around the room to not get yourslef cornered. You will die, but from each death you will come back wiser and after a while you will learn very well how to counter various enemies Gungeon will throw at you. 
=== Rouge-like ===
I am a big fan of rouglikes, even though not every one of them hit that sweet spot. This one deffinetly did though. Combination of bullet hell and rouge-like makes for fun and challenging gameplay. The vaast amount of both active and passive items makes for a very fun gameplay where sometimes you gonna get run-winning item on first floor and sometimes you will struggle with mediocre items and then it will all be down to your skill xD
Each playable character will require you to adjust your playthrough a bit (or more then just a bit) and the enemies will test you even after you get pretty good (you will also get frustrated with some, I sure did).
=== Lore ===
Throughout your runs you will gather pieces of stories for each playbable character, some of the NPCs and also wider story of The Gungeon, the magical gun-themed dungeon with an ultimate prize - a gun able to change your past, to kill time itself. I don't want to spoil too much with this section, but let me just say that the lore is fun, some characters have pretty nice if simple stories and progressing in game will reward you with some new fun characters (with rather unique traits) and variety of new items, so dig deep and get ready for a fight! 
=== Enemies ===
Both mechanics and designs for those are just so fun. They start off as pretty easy and simple, slowly becoming tougher and FASTER then anything that game throws at you at the start. Example? Bullet-kin, the most basic enemy, will have quite a few different varinats, some pretty tough for basic enemy of each floor. Don't wanna spoil too much here either so let me just say that you better watch out once you reach the final stage, The Forge. Enemies are overall very fun design wise too, most themed around guns and other weapons and explosives, I think from various rouge-likes I played this game might have my personally favourtie design choice for the enemies.
=== Bosses ===
This game has some very fun bosses providing a decent challenge. There are 3 possible bosses for each of the first 4 floors (you can get one of them at the end of each floor), with the main boss of the game waiting for you at the end of the 5th floor. Each one has its own unique way of fighting you so you will need to devise a strategy for each, some will keep you constantly moving with their quick attacks, some will make you carefully move throughout the stage with their wide spread attacks, one way or another, you will need to learn how to dodge xD.
There is a bunch of extra bosses too, some will spawn randomly throughout your runs, one will rpelace a random basic boss and some will await you on end of each secret floor. 
And last but not least there are bosses of each character's past. No spoilers here, but they are all fun fights and very fitting for each character's past. But be warned, messing with time will also get the attention of Dungeon's Master, so stay alert.
Oh and fu#k Ammuconda, you will learn why. 
=== Wrap-up ===
I could keep going about this game for a while, talking about all the fun deisgn choices for items, about how fun some NPCs are or how much of a bop main menu theme is. But I think best way to enjoy this game is on your own, I hope you dear reader will find this review helpful or at least entertaining enough to play the game, enjoy.",1685527022,1685571626,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While the enemy patterns and boss fights are pretty much skill based, your experience each run varies WIDELY based on the items you get. Some items are great, some are just fine and the vast majority are borderline useless and unfun. I cannot express enough how much more fun rainbow runs are, because you can get some cool weapons and items and just experience more of what the game has to offer you. A lot of the time in regular runs I realized I just wasn't having fun because I'd take a lot more time to clear floors and bosses because I had to use the default weapon, or some terrible item and gun and run out of ammo for it. The ammount of times I'd restart a run on floor one/two because I got 3 D-C quality weapons in a row is more than I can remember.
This is not to mention a bunch of hidden mechanics and item descriptions and synergies left intentionally vague that will just result in you opening a wiki to see what it does. We are not on the SNES days anymore where these things would have to be figured out through repeated playthroughs and discussions with other players, there is not much reason to not have these things explained in game on a menu.
I kinda wanted to give a lower score, but since I've played so much there is definitely something engaging and fun to this game. It just tries really hard to not let you experience it.",1685553570,1685553570,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- combat is difficult but fair
- well balanced RNG - you can win with most loadouts (in contrast to games like Binding of Isaac where balance is quite poor)
- fun synergies to look for during runs
- most additional game modes are fun
- extremely replayable
Cons: 
- trap rooms - rooms with horrible puzzles, in some of these rooms damage is very difficult to avoid - ideally there needs to be a practice mode where the player gets the chance to learn how these work because it took dozens or more attempts before I grasp how some of these rooms even work let alone complete them without getting hit
- rat punchout - similar to trap rooms this needs a practice mode to learn how to play this very niche part of the game
- there is no audio cue when you get hit and a very faint visual cue -- so sometimes you don't even know you've been hit
- challenge mode - it's awful - really sucks the joy out of the game; you need to memorise many different room modifiers and react to them as they pop up together in random variations; some of these variations aren't well thought out and can lead unfair rooms",1685436397,1685436678,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's not the Roguelike or Bullet Hell elements that are putting me off the most, it's the fact I never feel like I'm making any sort of headway.

Other games in the Roguelike genre always make the player feel like they're getting somewhere, even if a run doesn't pan out.  Dead Cells always feels like I'm making progress, even in failure.  Same with Rogue Legacy, Hollow Knight, even Binding of Isaac.  But EtG is all stick and no carrot.  Why am I going to try to grind runs when every run feels the same as every other run, other than the minuscule chance that I'll find one of the guns I unlocked (that turns out to be even weaker than my starting gear)?

Health bonuses shouldn't be gated behind not needing them.  You shouldn't have to mag dump all but the most basic enemies to kill them.  Item unlocks shouldn't feel pointless, but they do.  Most guns are about as weak as your starting gun, and that's only IF you get a useful one from a chest.  And ""better"" guns and items are all but guaranteed to only drop on later levels, the same levels that most players will need the good items to even get to.

Whether you're making a simple pound cake garnished with fresh fruit or spending days on an elaborate multilayered cake with multiple fillings and frostings, there are a few key tips that apply to all cakes. Cake baking is not necessarily difficult, but it does require a little organization and forethought—and these cake-baking tips will help you get your homemade cake right every single time.

1. Read through the recipe

This sounds obvious, but cakes in particular have certain requirements—such as the oven temperature, baking time, and ingredients—that cannot be altered. You don't want to realize too late that the butter you just mixed with sugar was supposed to be softened.

2. Assemble ingredients and ensure their correct temperatures

Get all of your wet and dry ingredients and equipment out on the counter before you begin and make sure that everything is at the proper temperature. This is especially important for butter and eggs: Soft butter makes for a smooth batter and a lofty cake, and room-temperature eggs keep the batter's temperature consistent.

To soften butter, leave it out for several hours; it should offer no resistance when you press on it. Or you can hurry the process using a microwave: Cut the butter into 1/2-inch cubes, arrange them in a single layer on a microwave-safe plate, then microwave on high for 3 seconds at a time, testing in between, until the butter is softened but not melted. Melted butter won’t hold the air you need for fluffy cakes, so keep an eye on it!

3. Preheat the oven before you make the cake batter

Before you begin, position the racks correctly: To avoid burning your cake, set a wire rack in the middle of the oven for cake layers or in the lower third for a tube cake, so that the top of the pan is not too close to the top of the oven.

Before preparing the cake batter, preheat your oven to the correct temperature. This might take awhile, and it’s best to use an oven thermometer to confirm; many ovens won’t report their temp accurately. You want to wait on mixing the batter because it will not react properly to heat if it sits at room temperature for 10 minutes waiting for the oven to get hot. Nor will your cake rise properly if the oven continues to warm up after the pan has been placed in it.

4. Prepare the pan

To ensure that your finished cake has the right shape, it's important to make sure that it will come out of the pan in one piece. The most common way to do this is to coat the pan with butter, but the specifics may vary depending on the type of cake.

For cake layers in general, you coat the inside of the pan with very soft but not melted butter using a brush. Follow that with a disk of parchment paper cut to the size of the inside of the pan. (Precut parchment paper sheets are a luxury we love to have on hand—get some to match the size of your cake pans.)

For a butter cake baked in a Bundt pan, coat with soft butter, and then coat the buttered surface with fine, dry bread crumbs (or finely ground nut flour), tapping the inverted pan to dislodge any excess. Follow with a quick coat of vegetable cooking spray for a guarantee that the cake won't stick.

Line a rectangular or square pan with foil by molding the foil first on the back of the pan, then pressing it into the pan. Butter the foil. This makes it easy to lift a cake that you don't want to invert, such as a crumb cake, right out of the prepared pan.

5. Prepare the batter

Instructions will vary depending on the type of cake: For butter cakes, ingredients will typically be combined using the creaming method; for sponge cakes the eggs will generally be beaten, then folded in. For the proper texture, be sure to follow the instructions closely, and then pour the batter into the pan or pans and bake.

6. Avoid undermixing or overmixing

It's easy to get carried away when mixing, but remember, the goal is to simply combine the ingredients. Overmixing will deflate necessary air from the batter and leave you with cakes that have a tough texture. On the flip side, of course, don't undermix. All the ingredients need to be fully incorporated.

7. Don't open the oven door

As tempting as it might be to crack open the oven door to sneak a peek at a cake in progress, resist the urge. Opening the oven door lets in cool air and significantly changes the temperature inside. That change in temperature can wreak havoc on your cake.

8. Test for doneness

To test a cake, plunge a thin knife, cake tester, or toothpick into the center (or halfway between the side and the tube if using a tube pan). When a cake is finished, you will find a few crumbs sticking to the knife or toothpick when you withdraw it. If the cake is not ready yet, wet batter will still cling to it.

9. Cool the cake

Most cakes are cooled on a metal rack for even air circulation. A recipe will indicate whether the cake should be cooled in the pan or unmolded immediately. Follow instructions carefully—leaving certain types of cakes in the pan for too long may cause them to stick. Angel food cakes and chiffon cakes need to cool suspended upside down in their tube pans or they will deflate and look squashed and unappealing when you cut them. Invert the pan over several inverted ramekins so that the edges of the pan are supported by them. It is best to figure out the system for doing this before you begin baking the cake by testing the empty pan over the ramekins to make sure your system will be stable.

10. Unmold the cake gently

When you are ready, gently run a sharp, thin knife between the edge of the pan and the cake. Then invert a rack or platter (as indicated in the recipe) over the top of the pan. Turn the pan over and lift it off the cake. You may be asked to finish cooling the cake upside down or instructed to turn it right side up again. Be sure to follow instructions, as each type of cake cools best in a different way.

11. Finish the cake

The options for finishing a cake are numerous. Some varieties, such as pound cakes and crumb cakes, are finished already when they come out of the oven and don't need any embellishment at all. For others, a simple dusting of powdered sugar or quick brush with a glaze may be all that's required. And some cakes, such as European-style layer cakes, can be filled with multiple fillings, frosted with a different frosting or glaze, and then adorned with elaborate decorations, such as piped buttercream or marzipan crafted into roses and leaves.",1684294943,1684294943,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And what I got, was a New, Unique, and frankly Breathtaking take on the survival genre. This game is incredibly nuanced, with an extraordinarily deep, Intelligent, yet still challenging story, that will play with your emotions at every turn.

What this game feels like, is as if you gave an expert team of developers an infinite budget, and no time constraints, and told them to make what they want. Further, the graphics that this game provides are some of the best looking, realistic graphics that I've ever seen come from a video game, and it manages to keep My PC cold while doing so.

This game has one of the most intense, and rich story's out there, good enough to rival the likes of RdR2, the entire persona series, the kingdom hearts games, and much more. And with doing all of this, the game is still able to make downright genius social commentary on many real world issues. but not so much that it hampers the story in any way.

To play this game for free, truly is a blessing, Anyone who is out for money knows they could make millions off of this tremendous piece of art. and while, maybe we cant pay for this modern Picasso we can support the creator in other ways

Hundreds of cool items & guns, that make up cool synergies and combos. So much cool stuff to do! The NPC's are fun and unique. Lots of puns and humor. Writing's good as well.

The game definitely has a deep learning curve. There is a lot of learning by the hard way, kinda like Dark Souls. Thats what this game is, 2D gun Dark Souls.

After many hours of playing, learning and knowing the Gungeon, it only gets better. Your character doesn't get better - you do. In the end, you can complete the Gungeon with every run - no matter your weapons or items. 

You will start to understand the levels, the rooms and enemies. You'll know when to dodge roll, and when not. You know how to handle your economy; your keys, bullet casings and items. 

And when the Gungeon feels too easy.... Try out the different challenges. You can always make things harder...

love this game, Its skill based but rewarding. unlike many other rogue likes, RNG isnt the major factor in winning a run. dont get me wrong, the absolute plethora of fun guns and pickups can make your runs easier and funner but, if you're good enough, you can make it to the final floor using only the started weapons and no pickups. its hard getting started but you'll soon get in the rhythm and soon you'll be mowing down bullet kin and dodge rolling like a pro.

Maybe I'm just a sucker for rogue likes and twin stick shooters...but honestly, this is one of the best games I've ever played.

Absolutely addicting and perfectly polished gameplay. The envrionments and characters are fun and it doesn't take itself too seriously. After all, its a game about bullets shootings guns that shoot guns that shoot bullets. The humor is not laugh in your face funny, but enough to keep the game entertaining and charming. There are many nods to other indie games you will notice.

The weapon types are extremly varied. I would go so far as to say more varied than just about any other game I've played. Make no mistake, this game is brutally difficult, and after almost 300 hours I still haven't fully completed it. 

If you're up for a grind and okay with permadeath and rogue like gameplay, this game is a must buy if it looks fun to you. Seriously one of the best pick up and play twin stick rogue likes I've ever played. 

Won't be stopping until I 100% this one.

Edit: It took me over 400 hours of playtime, but I finally 100% completed this game. Loved every minute. Cannot reccomend enough. There is enough challenge and variety here to keep you going for hundreds of hours.

Even after its final update, the game feels heavily unpolished and major challenges built into the game lack any creativity, like a specific hidden character requiring you to lap the game twice and defeat a ""Glitched"" version of the final boss that's literally just the same guy twice, but one's jammed! Additionally, I've never had to pull up a wiki as much as I have for this game, as gun descriptions and ammonomicon entries are only minimally helpful if at all. This game sacrifices context and articulating information on guns and items for the sake of trying to be funny.

All I can really say is that the soundtrack is good and the pixel art is pretty okay.

The game's premise revolves around a group of characters who have entered a mysterious dungeon in search of a powerful weapon known as the Gun That Can Kill The Past. The dungeon is filled with traps, puzzles, and waves of enemies that the player must navigate and defeat in order to progress through the levels.

One of the key features of Enter the Gungeon is its vast array of weapons and items. There are over 200 unique weapons in the game, ranging from standard guns to bizarre and fantastical weapons like a shotgun that shoots fish or a gun that shoots bees. The items in the game can also drastically change the way the player approaches combat, offering everything from temporary invincibility to the ability to slow down time.

The game's graphics and sound design are also top-notch. The pixel art style is charming and the enemy designs are creative and memorable. The soundtrack is upbeat and energetic, perfectly complementing the game's frantic action.

One potential downside to Enter the Gungeon is its difficulty level. The game can be punishingly difficult at times, which may turn off more casual players. However, the game's procedurally generated levels mean that each playthrough is unique, which can help to keep the game feeling fresh and engaging even after multiple attempts.

Overall, Enter the Gungeon is a must-play for fans of the bullet-hell shooter genre. Its unique weapons, items, and enemies, combined with its top-notch graphics and sound design, make it a standout title that is sure to provide hours of entertainment for anyone willing to brave its challenging dungeons.",1683174585,1683174585,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For example: lower case r can go from B U L L E T, to uppercase r which goes R O C K E T and shoots explosives. The combat is fast paced and room variety is pretty great. Characters are all unique and fun to play, i like the bullet which requires skill as if you get a single half a heart lost, your OP damage sword turns to a very bad damage dealer. My god the amount of little details and references this game has is mind blowing and don't even get me started on all the secrets and easter eggs where even after playing for hundreds of hours, you will not have seen it all! The music is insanely good and makes me turn up the volume on bossfights so Doseone did a fantastic job. The roguelite elements are well balanced so that every time you die its(mostly) always your fault for dying and not the RNG, and yes... this game requires immense skill to master, but the feeling of satisfaction when you beat a boss for the first time is great and very rewarding to always unlock new things. I would give 10/10 but if you dont enjoy roguelikes or roguelites, this might not be for you as when you die, you guessed it... back to the start.

Despite this being a roguelike, runs are EXTREMELY repetitive to the point(for me at least) where I only find fun when I get as far as I can. This game has lots of charm and lots of care put into it, but the repeating cycle of drop in, get items, and die makes it easy to get exhausted of restarting runs over again. I have to sit down and take a break from it before I want to play again, it's not like other roguelikes I've played where each run is different from the last, progression in this game is molasses slow.

I really would love to see what this game has to offer in terms of guns, but every run just feels like it has little to offer, and that might be because of the brutal RNG(Which of course has been a little more gracious thanks to the new update). Due to the low amount of items that you can get(I only ever get like 2-3 chests on floor 1) I feel like chests can make or break your run as well as items.

Sure, there are good and bad items in every roguelike, but in games like the Binding of Isaac, even if I do get bad items I still manage to find some fun in it. Repeated attempts don't burn me out in other games as much as Gungeon does.

I will say the new Advanced Gungeons and Draguns update did make the RNG a little more merciful and added some neat quality of life changes though, maybe I just haven't played it enough.

You will die in this game A LOT. I die in this game A LOT. Practice makes perfect.
Though I do wish there was an area where you could practice fighting against bosses in the hub, that would be nice.
Or make an arena where you can add enemies and equip weapons and items, similar to what Crypt of the NecroDancer has in its lobby.

I have a massive love-hate relationship with this game, sometimes more hate, sometimes more love. The number of reasons why for both are pretty neck and neck, and I can't deny this game's vision. Though the game burns me out quickly and shuts me off from ever seeing more content that I probably won't see until my umpteenth run, the items and guns and all this game has to offer are truly unique. The artstyle is great, the quirkiness is great, its sense of humor is wonderful(I still can't get over how the main enemies are bullets firing guns, it always amuses me!), and the difficulty is equivalent to listening to Nickelback, which is already hard enough as it is.

But hey, that's just my opinion on this game. It has a lot of flaws, but it has a lot of things it does right.
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna brb and turn these 40 hours of gameplay into 400 hours of gameplay, ta ta for now!",1483515406,1681873661,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But after playing it for a bit I was shocked by how dull I found the experience. I feel like I was basically handed a victory with the ridiculous amount of powerful weapons, ammo refills, and health/keys I was given. I stumbled across a few 'synergies' which weren't bad but felt totally arbitrary and not intuitive, rather like a random upgrade I stumbled upon. I went to the bonus challenge final world and the main thought on my mind was how dull it felt. I didn't even feel the need to use any blanks, which are the game's limited use panic button.

The final nail in the coffin was when I went to play another run on the game's ""fast mode,"" only to find out I was already playing on it. If I was this bored already, I cannot imagine playing the same game but slower. [b]Just play Nuclear Throne or The Binding of Isaac or Hades instead.[/b] If you've already played those and are looking for something else, keep looking. Those games have a much more compelling gameplay loop and a lot more run customization than Gungeon does.

Only thing you should be asking yourself is if the difficulty will affect your satisfaction when playing. Trust me, most people hate it when they die or get shot after getting stuck in a corner or dodge roll on the wrong direction. Otherwise, it offers a fast-paced experience, even faster if you like turbo-mode like me. Each run is unique and will give you different ways and puzzles on how to approach something.

However, as I am here, and Steam requests that I offer up my opinion, I'll explain my experience with the game nonetheless. 

For the tl;dr, 
while the game has several things going for it, and even I could give some positive words, I'm afraid my experience with it as a whole was nothing more than a solid ""meh"". A strong ""meh"", to be sure, but a still a ""meh"". 

And if you would like a little more detail, then read on. 

The music is decent, the art style is fun and very much enjoyable, and even the controls are tight and feel good. Marry all of that to ""mostly alright"" level design, amusing attack patterns from enemies, and hilarious weapons, you'd think you'd have the recipe for success. Or at least awfully close.

I played the game both in its original state when it was much, much harder, as well as after a big update that loosened up the difficulty a fair bit. As I played, I found myself starting out having a good time, but the farther along I got, the more I disliked the game. 

I'm no stranger to dying and losing in video games. As someone who has played games since the original NES days, I'm a strong believer that seeing the game over screen is very much part of the process. Sometimes you win, sometimes you don't. 

So why, then, was Enter the Gungeon such an unfulfilling experience when it came to the increasing difficulty the farther I went? 

I decided to be a dirty little cheater one day and gave myself infinite ammo. Whatever new gun I picked up I could use as freely as I wanted. As I ran through the levels spraying an assortment of lasers, bullets, ducks, hammers, eggs, and maybe even the occasional rainbow, I realized something. 

A large portion of the weapons in this game, while amusing, aren't very good at performing their primary function, which is to kill the enemy. Instead, it would seem they focus more on bringing humor to the situation while simultaneously poking your nostalgia bone. Several guns are spoofs from other games or movies, or even treats from the real world itself such as the NES Light Gun.

The more I played this way, the more I realized the problem. The balance. It's off. 

And while balance is a very subjective thing, another issue I find with the game is a bit more concrete. 

It offers little to nothing more than what many other games on the market already offer. It has some traditional rogue-lite issues, such as explaining very little, expecting you to run through the same thing over and over to progress something an inch at a time, and of course, some RNG dependency. 

The market might have been a bit lighter in this genre back in 2016 (though doubtful), but Lord knows it's beyond overly flooded at this point. 

After completing the 5th floor, I was basically informed that there was more to do in the game, which I will assume means finding more random NPCs along the way to progress something that hopes to be at least a shred of story and perhaps more levels, all RNG dependent. 

I don't know if this is actually the case or not, as I have zero desire to play through again. 

CLOSING THOUGHTS: 
While Enter the Gungeon's initial impression is something unique and potentially great, it ends up wearing out its welcome relatively quickly, and brings very little to the table that can't be found elsewhere. If you find this game on sale for a few dollars, then I'd say it'd be worth the time and money. Anything more than that though, I can't say I recommend.

PLUS, THE WEAPONS ARE SO COOL. YOU CAN GET GUNS THAT SHOOT BUBBLES OR EXPLODING BANANAS OR WHATEVER. IT'S SO AWESOME.

AND THE MUSIC IS REALLY GOOD, TOO. LIKE, IT REALLY ADDS TO THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE.

BUT IT'S NOT TOO EASY, EITHER. YOU'LL DIE A BUNCH OF TIMES BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY BEAT IT. BUT THAT JUST MAKES IT MORE SATISFYING WHEN YOU FINALLY DO.

[hr][/hr]

Let me just start this review by saying I have NO IDEA why it took me 1070 in-game hours and literally unlocking every item and achievement in the game to finally write a review on this absolute masterpiece, but whatever, better late than never, right?

[hr][/hr]

[b]PROS:[/b]

-Tight controls that are easy to pick up but hard to master. 
-Fantastic, addictive rogue-lite elements. 
-Engaging, memorable characters and storyline. 
-Tons of references from everyone's childhood (I can guarantee you'll find at least one familiar, beloved weapon from one of your favorite childhood shooters.) 
-Nearly endless replayability with thousands of unlockable items, synergies, secrets on top of secrets on top of secrets, unlockable characters, differing game modes, and much, much more. 
-Goofy, endlessly charming art style that flawlessly combines grittiness and cartooniness. 
-One of the hardest, most rewarding slogs you'll ever face in your life. 
-[b]GUNS. LOTS OF GUNS.[/b]


[hr][/hr]

[b]CONS:[/b]

-Steep learning curve, which can honestly be considered a bad or a good thing based on your perspective. 
-There is a [i]small[/i] amount of jankiness, and not the good kind (I can't tell you how many times I've tried to dodge roll over a bullet only to dodge into a table and take the hit while sliding over it.)
-May cause rage-induced controller destruction. 

[hr][/hr]

[b]Summary:[/b]

Enter the Gungeon, for me, was one of those fresh new ideas that just seemed too good to pass up when it was first released. If only I'd known how deep down this particular rabbit hole I would end up diving...
Enter the Gungeon will chew you up and spit you out if you aren't used to games in this genre, at least at first. But personally speaking, the feeling I got when I realized I was good enough that I could reliably clear the game every attempt was one of the greatest, most rewarding feelings I've ever had. 
This game reminded me how much fun it is to completely absorb yourself into a seemingly (at the time) impossible game until you finally see yourself overcoming those odds that seemed so unreachable, all that time ago.

However, I really struggle to recommend this game. 
I have about 50 hours in this game over the course of a few years, and I really really tried to get into it. I even got all the pieces for the bullet and got to multiple characters pasts (I didn't beat any but honestly at that point I was so frustrated that I didn't care) 
This game is so close to being fun, but in reality I think the RNG mechanic of this rouge like is dragging it down. 
I feel like the game is far too dependent on getting a good gun in the first 2-3 stages of the game or else you're fucked. I feel either like I'm a total god walking among mortals, or a nobody that dies instantly. it doesn't feel fun to flit in between these two modes. The game play loop is simple enough, but without the right guns it doesn't feel very rewarding to be plinking away at enemies with your starting gun, or the Winchester or whatever you happen to get out of the 3000th blue chest this run. That's the other issue with the RNG, the amount of blue chests I have seen that have given loot that is not even remotely exciting is an issue. So many of the cool rare items completely change the way you play the game in unique and interesting ways (Ala the bloody scarf or the super hot watch), and you just don't see enough of those in your run. 
I can see why so many people like this game, but I simply can't put any more time into it when more fun rouge likes exist like risk of rain 2 and hades.",1680069405,1680069405,False,1,3,0.474025964736938477,0,True,False,False

Like, I actually hate this game even though it is fun and I appreciate it for what it is, and the overall art. I enjoy the challenge of getting a good run and I'm still busy grinding out all the secret bonuses.
Pros: Most creative game ever made, best character and enemy design, ridiculous replay value compared to other games in the genre, fun weapons, gun reference, compelling NPC quests and objectives, entertaining dialogue, fantastic art, lots of endings, story line?
Cons: 
Game play: I feel there are a lot of elements that are disrespectful to the player in many ways. Two examples are: some guns shoot faster if you click your mouse faster. I call this out for disrespecting equipment because it is shortening the life span of my mouse severly. Another example is disrespecting gamer's time and effort, there is an enemy that is hiding in a wall and it gives you an item so if you want to get more good items you have to walk along every wall and most of the time you'll never find it. There are some technical problems too. This game makes my computer fans sound like I'm playing ELDEN RING, it's like its mining bitcoin or something which makes no sense to me based on how simple of a game it should be to run. Before I moved it to my SSD from HDD every time I killed an enemy there was a frame loss during its death animation and there is still frame loss if you dodge very close to a bullet. Clicking the teleport pads on the map and selecting items in my inventory to see their desctiption is not synced to where my mouse actually is so I have to spam click around until it registers the mouse over or drag the part of the map I want to teleport closer to the center. There's even an item in the game that literally gives you infinite ammo and lets you shoot as many bullets as you want in like 1 second of game time and its not like I had to get this item several times to find this bug (I think its helix bullets in combination with the stopwatch), found it within a minute of having the item the first time. The game designers decided to add no player sounds to the game so when you are accumulating poison, on fire or being cursed there is just a small indicator above your head that fills up in about a second then hits you out of nowhere. Although I put the variety of items as a pro leading to replay value its also a huge problem; some runs you will get 13 mediocre guns and 1 or 2 passives (this happens to me frequently!) other runs you will only find one weapon in a level other runs you will get 3 god guns and 5 defensive items making it not even a challenge to win. A lot of the activatable items are trash while only a few are sought. Another super annoying problem is actually the enemy models and hit boxes, sometimes bullets can fly through your head (because of the fake 3D aspect) and other times they graze a semi pixel of your toe and hit you. I get hit mid dodge roll frequently.  Just because dark souls does it doesn't make it a good mechanic. The movement speed is so high on keyboard that often you can go to dodge a bullet and walk so far that you hit the next bullet. Games are supposed to be fun to play and reward skill, not inconsistent and unreasonably punishing, the hit-box should be more generous and then you can make the game more thrilling by adding more bullets. Also there's a mechanic where you can roll into enemies to hurt them but this just puts you right at their feet and then they almost always walk into you causing damage, I'm not a fan of damage on non-attack contact, this is a gun game not a platformer, on that note I hate when enemies spawn right under you if you aren't looking around rapidly all the time you get hit by a fading in enemy. The way enemies hold their weapon can vary but sometimes its 100-150 pixels away from the enemies body and the bullets just appear instantly moving from the edge of their weapon so you have to stay WAY farther away than you would intuitively, and the screen is so small that this makes fighting certain enemies a horrible game play experience, also their bullets will often go around corners and hit you behind walls even though it looks like you are on a very safe angle, like its way more than you'd think if you just read that sentence and hadn't played it yourself. There are all these curses and shrines and I have no idea what half of them do because I haven't looked up a wiki yet and I don't think players of ANY game should EVER have to look up a wiki, even after getting the buff several times and still not knowing what it does, unless you want extremely technical details or player guides. There is a mode that changes your guns randomly and they were too lazy to program channel weapons like lasers differently than charge up shot weapons, so you get 0.2 seconds of laser fire and then your weapon switches.  Its SO stupid.
Control/Movement: I play on mouse and keyboard so my movement and dodge rolls are limited to 8 directions which can easily be mistimed to cause wrong direction and although it seems like they put a tiny bit of effort to account for this I'm sure its a massive handicap and barrier to enjoyment. What makes it even worse is that so many enemy attacks space the bullets apart perfectly so if you dodge one bullet you land on the next bullet making dodging a 50/50 death wish. There is an option to move faster out of combat (who wouldn't turn this on?) and the problem with it is that it activates the second you kill the last enemy, the jolting shift in movement speed can easily make you run into traps or bullets that are still flying around the map. WHY NOT ACTIVATE IT WHEN THE BULLETS ARE ALL GONE? THAT IS CALLED BEING IN COMBAT!!! This also causes issues when you walk into a room because the room is black and lights up but its very easy to walk so far in that you walk into an enemy or trap or a hole before the room has lit up because of the crazy fast movement speed. Something about the controls bothers me too. I don't usually struggle to press the right buttons in games but due to the nature of this game you want to NOT use blanks and activatable items as much as possible, meaning it takes dozens of hours of play to develop the neurological training to press the correct buttons without thinking or wasting your blanks or actives. I'm good at it now but it took a while and I still forget to use actives sometimes. Often I use my blank and the bullet still hits me. I changed all the controls to space-dodge, alt-use, middlemouse-active, mb4-blank, mb2-reload.
Screen layout/Graphic: The screen shape and enemy models are designed in a way that makes fighting horizontally optimal, but using W-S halves your dodge reaction time compared to using A-D since its only your middle finger pressing WSWS vs pointer/index's ADAD so that sucks a lot. On top of that jerky mouse movements can cause the screen to shuffle around rapidly making it very difficult to track the actual direction bullets are travelling.I really do hate how limiting the screen vision is, most boss fights you don't even see the boss half the time. But I appreciate the concept that if you are looking far to one side of the screen you cant see whats behind you. Its jarring that there are bosses where the screen zooms out and becomes stationary, actually I just wish the whole game was like that like other bullet hell games. Another jarring thing is the vorpal gun. It fires a random bullet that is so powerful it pauses the game randomly and its awful.A lot of these complaints are combinations of control/screen/game play issues but I think this sums up everything I don't like about it.  In closing, the achievement rates of this game are abysmal. Seems like not many people have the patience to endure all the downsides.",1679379650,1680013773,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game will find a way to make every run feel unique and truly amazing. 10/10 would recommend.

To start with, probably the worst flaw of this game is scalability. After completing 2-3 floors you gonna end up in one of two scenarios: 1) You are gonna run out of bullets for all of your weapons or 2) You start to feel like doing damage is not enough. This is because there is a lack of scalability - enemies are getting stronger and you are only getting guns with limited ammo and primary. This could be fixed by adding selective upgrade for primary weapon at the end of the boss level so you could use your resources accordingly.
Secondly, the coin system is off, usually you'll end up having enough money to buy yourself one heart or one key, which is nothing considering one floor requirement.
Third and the last point, movement prediction. This game aims for realistic player predicament meanwhile ruining the game experience. You usually end up wondering why bullets are flying in all directions instead of firing towards your initial spot.
Of course I wanna mention missing features for auto-reload and no practical use for game's interior (interactables). I do appreciate the work put into this game's development and the vision that was put for realistic western shooting game, but it just does not cut it.
Overall, if you find yourself enjoying the game as a whole, but struggling with game flow, I suggest installing mods, which help out balance most features of the game. I found myself helpful auto-reload, item description and enemy health scalability reduction.",1679157571,1679157571,False,1,4,0.420382171869277954,0,True,False,False

Funny Review:
This game has such high potential, the weapons really represent the true meaning of friendship, my main reason for such observational expectations is because not everyone is too be the same person. The game has great inspiration it it can give those with mighty humor levels a good chuckling.

Turns out its one of the most busted items.

If you're set on beating the game, then I can definitely recommend playing it once (or more) every day. It will help you to learn enemies' attacks, movement patterns and when to roll or dodge by moving around.

I played the game sporadically here and there and could barely get past the second / third levels. With consistent practice however, I managed to beat the game in about 2 weeks (by playing a few days during the day).

It's tough and sometimes you're at the mercy of the guns and power-ups you get. I do recommend unlocking as many items / guns you can to succeed on your runs. And definitely, try to beat the first few bosses without taking a hit to get better rewards and more health! At first, I thought that it would be insane but after a bit of practice, I managed to beat quite a few bosses without taking any damage. The only solution here is ""get good"".

Dodge and roll to avoid bullets, take covers whenever you can and do not rush your runs. Practise a bit every day and you'll have a lot of fun.

I've had a great experience and can definitely recommend Enter the Gungeon to those who love a good challenge.

Sometimes I’ll have a blast and other times I’ll direct a number of mean spirited comments at the developers. The level of challenge is complete bullshit and can lead to the game feeling both punitive and incredibly tedious at times, but for the majority of my playtime I’ve really enjoyed Gungeon. The level of variety, the feel of the game, the tangible sense of improvement, and all the little references makes for an experience that begs to be played again, and again, and again. I’m glad I gave Gungeon a shot because it is one of the most fun games I’ve played all year.

Deaths don't feel unforgiving, when you die it actually feels like its your fault for having the biggest skill issue known to mankind instead of the game being like ""L + Ratio"" (Unless its challenge mode which the game likes to throw plenty of ""L + Ratio"" deaths at you because challenge mode is genuinely really stupid if you get the unfair modifiers that make you have to play extra cautious). So many wacky guns and items to collect, so many synergies to discover, so much enemy variety, plenty of challenging bosses to fight, tons of secrets to discover, and overall a lot of content to play. I highly recommend ETG because what other games have a bullet that shoots guns, allows you to kill a living explosive using explosives,  a gun that shoots cheese, a shotgun shell that shoots shotguns, a gun that is a literal key, a balloon gun that shoots tornado's and gives you flight, a gun riding a skateboard, and so many references to various different games and movies.

There are games that are so good that they become the benchmark by which you compare all other games in the same genre: Enter the Gungeon is one such game.

[h1]The Good[/h1]

[h2]The Guns[/h2]
Half of the game involves pointing your gun in the direction of the enemy and firing, and the star of the show (as should be expected) are the wide variety of guns available to use; each of which feels fresh and unique, which is quite an achievement for the game. The functional differences of each gun, along with the ammunition system are good ways to force the player to use a variety of guns within a run - some guns are powerful but have low ammunition and are best reserved for bosses; some guns are good in clearing rooms; and some of the rarer ones are so powerful that they trivialize the game. While some guns are better than others, it’s fun either way; getting a good gun feels like winning the lottery in a run, whilst getting a bad gun feels like a challenge to overcome. 

[h2]The Enemies[/h2]
The other half of the game involves dodging the bullet hell coming your way, and if any aspect of the game could outshine the guns, it’s the wide variety of enemies, each with a distinctive attack pattern to dodge against. While a single non-boss enemy is usually not threatening, it becomes more fun and frenetic when several are shooting at you at a time, keeping you on your toes and constantly strategizing on which target to prioritize. 

The bosses are also well designed and a good challenge, each with their own gimmick and multiple attack patterns to look out for. From floors 1 to 4, the bosses are randomized from a pool of 3 to keep things fresh. Each playable characters also have a unique true-ending boss, and along with sub-bosses and secret level bosses, the dungeon feels fresh and varied upon revisiting.

[h2]The World[/h2]
The game is light on story, which is fine since it’s not a story-driven game. You play as one of several characters who have regrets and are searching for a gun that can kill the past within the gungeon. Enter the Gungeon has a lighthearted atmosphere infused with pop-culture references, where everything in the dungeon is gun-themed. Through repeated runs, you progressively unlock more guns, items, NPCs, and playable characters, which mostly mean you get more toys the more you play (and there are a lot of them).

There are a multitude synergies obtained through having a certain combination of items and/or guns in the inventory, most of which are pop-culture themed. The non-gun items are also interesting, though like guns, some are more useful than others. 

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
This is one of those games you need to keep the wiki open, as the in-game codex isn’t as informative, or as navigable as pressing ctrl+f on gun/item wiki pages; which you may need to understand synergies, or to see what guns/items in shops do.

The punch-out fight with the rat is another reason you need to keep a web-page open; it’s very memory-based and you may rarely even get to it. Frankly it’s not fun to stop the core gameplay, rewatch a youtube video on how the punch-out fight works, before resuming the boss fight.",1673302019,1673302146,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

311690,130251239,76561198281282901,0,2,7513,47,7443,1708578049,"Enter the Gungeon is normally in the top charts for being one of the best roguelikes to buy on steam at the moment. That is a very tall order considering there are many, many great roguelikes that exist and vary in depth and quality. However, I do not think this is one of them. I don't even think it should be considered a ""great"" game either, I would dare say it is a pretty average to mediocre roguelike, allow me to elaborate on why.

To start off with, we can begin with what I believe is good about the game, the pixel art. It's very high quality and very detailed at times and I have lots of respect to the animators and artist who worked on this, as I do with anything art related. My real issues lies within the mechanics of the game, and how it all blends together.

Firstly, the Co-op is laughably bad in this game. That is not to say that other roguelikes had not struggled with this before, but for whatever reason in this game your ally is forced to play as a random character that has NO personality, or relevance to the gungeon. It feels as if this character was slapped into the game to serve no other purpose other than to be ""Player 2"" which is the worst offense than not having a co-op mode at all. Personally, if there was no co-op to begin with I would have been more appreciative of that instead of what we had gotten. Was it too difficult for the developers to make it so the 2nd player can play one of the other characters that the 1st player can? It really does not make any sense as to why this is. 

Next, the concept. This game was heavily inspired by ""The Binding of Isaac"" and how chaotic that game can get with your luck with items, and the developers went on record to say that wanted to emulate that. From last I had played, there is so little item synergies it makes you question where a majority of them went, if at all. There are some items, but it feels they are so few and far between that honestly I can't what they were going with the idea if they weren't gonna go all out with it. They went half way which again, I feel is much worse than if they stuck to it, or didn't do it at all.

 The Binding of Isaac is what I like to call a methotical roguelike, in which you play the cards you are dealt. You have to play it slow, and consider all of your options. With this approach you'll be able to win every single run and even turn a bad run into a good one. However, in this game it is all luck to the cards with no wiggle room for change. Am I saying there is no skill involved in this roguelike? Absolutely not, at its most fundamental level the idea is not to get hit, and if you can manage to do that you are rewarded with a max Hp upgrade, which is all nice and dandy, but that's not what im referring to. Im referring to is item drops. Your guns have ammo and need to be replenished frequently, and ammo is NOT a common thing at all. A point can be made with Isaac as well, since bombs and keys are also luck. The difference between that and this game is that bomb and keys are optional, and you can win a run with minimal key/bomb luck, but in this game if you have no ammo, you pretty much have no weapon besides the dingy starter weapon. Which again, you can argue that you can win with only the starter weapon, but the game revolves around the wacky guns you find, and if you cannot even use those a majority of the time since you have to refill 15+ weapons, it is a poor idea in concept.

The next thing I'd like to comment on is the actual combat of this game. Well, it doesn't feel terrible (in some places) but it is pitifully slow, and its clear that this game not trying to be. Isaac runs can be long, upwards of an hour, but like I had mentioned, its a methotical roguelike which makes sense. Nuclear Throne (a game this was also inspired by and much better) is fast paced action and has the same general concepts and fits the mold of what it wants to be much better. This game feels like everything, your bullets, your enemies bullets, your CHARACTER moves like its stuck in tar. It is so sluggish that an enemy could shoot a bullet at me, and I could get up, get a cup of water, run a 10-mile jog from my home and back, return back home, and the bullet would still be flying at me at ""mach speed."" Why is the game so slow? I will  never truly understand, and because of this a run could take upwards of an hour to complete. 

Rolling in this game also feels like complete shit, and this is a core mechanic of this game. It feels very mechanical, and the reason why this is, is because you're locked into one direction upon starting your roll. This is very similar to Dark Souls 1's roll which is nearly identical to it even down the the invicibility frames. The issue with taking inspiration from Dark Souls 1's roll is that, that iteration of the roll was not perfected and was the first of its kind, and for whatever reason, the developers of this game used that roll as the ""basis"" for their game. If they wished for the roll to be invincible throughout they could have easily used a different iteration of the roll, like Dark Souls 3 and kept the I-frames, but chose not to for whatever reason. Because of this mechanical feeling roll, platforming feels awful in this game, and I loathe when I have to get to a room where I must dodge bullets instead of fighting enemies. Which this leads into my next point funnily enough.

Platformer rooms, where you must dodge bullets in order to progress. Normally, these can be fun in other games, Isaac has several puzzle like rooms, and dodging rooms and for the first time they can be a challenge. However, in this game, what they consider a challenge is bullet spam. There are several rooms in the game where there are quite literally just walls full of bullets spewing them out constantly, and you must be hampered down by a small platform moving really slowly and you're expected to dodge them all as you move along. Its generally not fun, and is challenging just for the sake of being challenging, which is always not fun.

So far, we've established that this game has poor multiplayer function, general lack of understanding of the type of roguelike it wishes to be, sluggish combat, and unintuitive rolling, among other nitpicks. If none of these things bother you, then go ahead and get this game. However, if you wish to play much better roguelikes with better understanding of the genre, play Nuclear Throne, or The Binding of Isaac. I would like to reiterate im not some hater of the game or anything, I just wish the game had done better in these departments that I had mentioned. I have spent well over 100+ hours on the game and unlocked everything in the base game, so I have a good amount of knowledge of the game and its mechanics. This game is not the worst thing on steam or anything, but this certainly is one of the most disappointing games Devolver had released. It had a lot of potential and the bag was fumbled royally.",1672990994,1672990994,False,4,0,0.430429369211196899,0,True,False,False

Just a truly fantastic game all around, it's all there for a Rougelike. Solid gameplay, distinct artistic style, addicting RNG, clear progression, and a challenge.

I was also impressed by the fact that my last play-through of the game to unlock my last achievement coincided with my final attempt to unlock the Gunslinger Gungeoneer.

It is quite possible for a player to clock well over 100 hours into this game and barely see all it has to offer. It’s “one of those games” in which it would be largely beneficial to the player to have the wiki open at all times, and as such, offers amazing replayability. 

I had always known about ETG and had known it as “that game where everything is related to guns and it’s really hard,” which would end up being pretty accurate in the end. But it wasn’t until it became free for a limited time on the Epic games store that I actually first downloaded the game and played it for the first time. I logged about 10 to 15 hours on Epic, in which at first, I found the game to be really frustrating. It became clear very quickly that there was a very large skill ceiling that had to be reached in order for a player to make progress. The only time where I would make it past the fourth, maybe even third floor consistently would be if I had powerful weapons and/or synergies. Yet, I enjoyed the challenge, and continued playing, finding my enjoyment and striving to improve only to continue to grow as I continued playing. I had one run in which I made it all the way to the high dragun, the farthest I had ever gone in a run, but died during the fight. That was the point when I decided to move over to steam. Somehow, my progress carried over from my Epic games save to my Steam save, and I began my process of trying to beat ETG. 

As of writing this review, I’ve clocked in around 235 hours, the most time I’ve ever spent playing a steam game; the addiction I developed to this game was something I only ever experienced when I was younger, a time when I had all day to sit around and play video games. I’ve 100%’ed the game, and have unlocked the finished gun, but alas, I have not fully completed the ammonomicon, something that will probably elude me for the foreseeable future. I actually completed all the achievements at around 200-ish hours, but ended up spending an extra thirty to unlock the finished gun. Through my time playing this game, I’ve seen basically all it has to offer, secret bosses, rare drops and rooms, and some crazy events that percentagely should not be possible; I fully acknowledge that I’ve had a LOT of luck with some of the drops I’ve gotten (5 glitched chests…). 

Firstly, I want to talk about how the game manages difficulty and how it relates to the player’s progression in skill. As I mentioned, it becomes very clear early on that there is a very large skill ceiling that a player can reach, but as the player gets more hours under their belt and begins to better understand the ins and outs of how a run plays out, that skill ceiling can become reachable, which is what I think caused me to clock so many hours.  I think ETG has done an amazing job at scaling the difficulty of the floors and bosses. Each floor is a step up in difficulty, enough to thoroughly challenge the player in multiple areas, whether it is their dodging, bullet accuracy, or resource management, each floor is a new challenge the player must tackle. The bosses fights are difficult and rewarding; beating the high dragun for the first time is an awesome feeling, and the glitched lych is a worthy “final boss.”

In regards to it’s “genres,” it’s pulls each one of them off masterfully. The most important part of the game is dodging, and some very clever, creative, and most importantly difficult bullet patterns are thrown at the player. Enemies are great, I really enjoyed the challenge that some enemies presented. Along with room layouts, as I started noticing and remembering the placements of enemies, it was clear that a lot of thought went into enemies placement in each respective room layout. The devs really handled this game with care, and the room layouts and enemies are designed wonderfully. 

Of course, I have to write about the guns. One of the best parts of playing throuhg this game is discovering the crazy ass guns that you can use, and on top of that, discovering the even wilder synergies. All of this makes the game so replayable, there’s so many different gun combos, synergy or not, that you can play around with. There are also a TON of reference to any and all sorts of media, it was really fun to see. 

The art design and pixel graphics are really well done, some areas and enemies are designed and colored beautifully. In particular, the high dragun never ceases to amaze me in how well it’s designed and “drawn.” 

I really enjoyed playing ETG, and I highly recommend it for any fans of the bullet hell and rougelike genre.",1672554281,1672554281,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Lots of diverse weapons
- Good humor & creativity
- Graphics
- Interesting plot
- Combat mechanics are good
- The developers put a lot of love into the game and clearly enjoyed making it

Cons:
- No permanent unlocks/abilities for your character, be prepared to play as the same starting character over-and-over
- Insanely grindy and not in the fun way (and I'm a veteran rogue-like player and enjoy them quite a bit)
- All weapon unlocks go straight to your RNG pool, no way to test them as you unlock them
- Boss battles are not very diverse, they are all basically just spraying bullet hell and dodging
- The camera sometimes takes weird perspectives on certain bosses which throws off my gameplay (examples #1 final dragon boss zooms WAY out #2 death wall boss feels like I'm playing Contra)
- There is no good reason starting weapons shouldn't be able to reveal wall cracks for hidden areas
- Shop costs should maybe be re-balanced, sometimes you can't earn enough to buy anything on the first floor which is silly. Or there aren't enough keys for the boxes on the first floor so you just have to destroy them for junk (hooray?!)
- Vendors do not consistently appear so your are at the mercy of RNG if you want to try something that requires a certain vendor (example, you might need the junk collector but it's possible he won't appear at all)
- Some gameplay mechanics exists that you are completely unaware about (i.e. coolness, curses, etc.)
- Weapon & item synergies exist but aren't really explained 

Overall, I see why people like the game because it is very polished and fun at first. However, honestly it's just not that fun after awhile (I put 25 hours in on PC and about 25 hours on Xbox). I find the replay-loop so tedious & grindy because there are no permanent unlocks and the other reasons I mentioned.  The only thing that changes each run is the floor layouts & vendors.  After awhile I started to just want to play something else where to feel I was making actual progress playing a game.

I would probably not recommend this game to someone because I can think of at least 5 other rogue-like games I enjoy more (better replay-loop, better unlocks, and more fun).  Do I think it's a bad game? Absolutely not. However, I wouldn't tell someone to play it even if I knew they enjoyed rogue-like games.  Just my opinion.  I bought it for $5 on a sale so I'm glad I tried it, but I won't be playing it again.

The gameplay is fast-paced and intense, with a wide variety of different weapons and items to choose from. The game's art style is also a standout feature, with a unique pixel art style that is both charming and visually striking.

One of the things I love most about Enter the Gungeon is the sheer absurdity of the game's premise. You play as a group of characters who are trying to reach the bottom of a giant, gun-filled dungeon in order to find the ultimate weapon. It's a ridiculous setup, but it works because the game is so over-the-top and doesn't take itself too seriously.

The game's music is also a standout feature. The upbeat, energetic soundtrack perfectly fits the frenetic gameplay and adds to the game's overall sense of chaos.

Overall, if you're in the mood for some good old-fashioned bullet hell action, Enter the Gungeon is the game for you. Just try not to take it too seriously – it's all in good fun.

For all the wonderful presentation it feels like only about 10 seconds were put into considering the actual balancing. The game effectively works on a cycle on die until you get lucky and get a gun that makes you invincible and trivialises the entire games; there is no skill in involved at any point in the loop it's purely up to chance if the game decides to let you win.
Despite having 4 playable characters unlocked at the start (with 4 more unlockable down the line) only one single character is viable for an actual run; all the others offer zero benefits and have much weaker starting gear. Hell, even the gimmick secret characters are held back by them being fundamentally useless without very specific weapon combos, which you are exceedingly unlikely to get.
There a million different weapons, yet somehow the majority of them are useless with only a few standout exceptions. The game is incredibly stingy with health meaning that if you don't get a free win weapon, it demands perfection from you at every turn, which is simply not fun. Not to mention that if you cannot leave a single resource behind for even one second, as it'll be magically stolen away from you, which completely removes any element of experimentation the game could offer. 
For a rougelike, I was expecting a ton of secrets, yet all the secrets of gungeon are just weak, pointless characters, or brutally difficult bonus floors which a). offer you very minimal reward for finishing and b). are usually impossible to access if you actually want a good run.
I can't really recommend this game to anyone, if you're new to rougelikes stay far far away from this and pick up something like Hades, Moonlighter or Risk of Rain 2 instead. If you're a veteran then... I'd still stay away from this game as all you find is a hollow shell under a lot of fancy presentation.

I had fun with this game, but I feel like it has obvious, easy-to-solve flaws.

The first thing that annoys me the most is the choice of weapons. The game has just waaaay too much choice, most of which sucks so bad that you often feel like just using your first gun anyways. This tends to make the early phases of each run slow and painful. I get that they want to make you feel like you are getting stronger slowly and progressively, but this is just stupid. I feel like taking on the challenges the game presents, but I am just put off by the prospect of crawling through the first floor of the game every time. I often feel punished for buying new guns, as it only adds trash to my roster of possible armaments and utilities. When you find the said trash in chests, you just feel punished for exploring the game and not just rushing directly to the boss chamber. It is incredibly frustrating. And why? Ideally the developer would carefully curate a set of tools for the player to have fun taking on the challenges, but this is just lazy. And why don't we even get an option of setting the game to our taste? Let me remove the fifteen reskins of shirt-throwers for god's sake.

Also, the coop in this game, let me tell you. Why force the second player into the crappy pink guy? Let the second player have some variation too, jesus. It feels like punishment to start with that nerf gun every run.

If the developer add some seriously minimal quality of life improvements to this game, I will gladly change my rating to positive, but there are just too many design choices that feel like an insult to the community.",1671370493,1671370561,False,0,1,0.436241626739501953,0,True,False,False

And yes, I am writing this review because I just died in this game for the twentieth time and I'm raging hard. That being said, my problem with Gungeon isn't that it is difficult and I die all the time. Nuclear Throne was difficult. I died hundreds of times in that game before I even reached the Throne. I'm fine with dying in a game, as long as its quick and fun.

My problem with Gungeon is that it is not quick or fun. Everything about Gungeon takes too long. Spawning takes too long. Opening the inventory takes too long. Dying takes too long. Walking takes too long. Killing enemies takes too long. Losing health takes too long. Everything you can do in Gungeon takes several minutes to do. Bullets move slowly, and so do you. Floors have so many rooms that you need a teleporter to move between them, which would be fine if the floors were fun, but they're just grindfests as you build up for the bossfight.

That's another problem I have with this game: its built almost entirely around bossfights. Most of your deaths will be against the bosses, not the mobs that you spend most of the game fighting. You spend most of the game preparing for the game, not actually playing it. Its all so tedious.

Everything has a stupid, pointless animation attached to it. When you die, there's a five second long animation of a scope zeroing in on the player character. When you open the inventory, there's a three second long animation of a book opening. Why? What's the point? Who asked for this?

When I die in Gungeon, I don't want to learn from my mistakes or try again. Why would I? Trying again would cost me another hour of my time. I just want to close the game and do something else.",1670287206,1670287206,False,2,2,0.47118377685546875,3,True,False,False

The first few levels are full of enjoyment and a very balanced power curve. But anything past the 3rd level is honestly some of the most un-enjoyable gameplay i have ever had the experience of playing. Throughout your ENTIRE run pickups will always be scarce, thats not a problem but on the last two levels you might aswell just pretend that pickups are turned off. The final two levels where you are fighting tooth and nail to keep your healthbar from hitting zero. I have had multiple runs where literally no pickups or health drops spawned on the last two levels. Theres a mechanic that basically forces you to memorize the games boss attack patterns because when you beat a boss without taking damage it gives you a guarenteed health up. This isnt a bad thing but the fact that the game borderline forces players to do this, to counter the low pickup rate in low levels, is very VERY annoying. Its gotten to the point where I just restart runs if i get hit at all during the first or maybe second stage bosses. It might just be a skill issue on my part but I can only imagine casual players absolutly slogging through this game in order to get anywhere at all. The way you go about unlocking some things in the game is very obscure. To beat the secret boss/ ""true boss"" of the gungeon you need to save up your money for at least two levels leaving you very vulnerable and many weapon and items short to face such a foe. Its a very fun game but after all these hours I see the flaws and cannot look past them anymore.

Afterthought: out of all my runs I have gotten only 4 that i can think of where all my items synergized to make a whole new unique playstyle. I feel like these moments are few and far inbetween and this game just makes me want to play binding of isaac instead.",1670085828,1670085958,False,10,0,0.480877965688705444,0,True,False,False

One of the greatest Rogue-like genre and popculture/gaming celebration games there is.

Great humor, great gameplay, replay value over the charts, the more you play the more you'll want to play. The game does not take itself serious. A ton of content, not a lot of levels but a lot you can do on those levels.

Only have two pet peeves with this game:

1º- To learn how to sell items you need to basically go online and search it out. There is no way most people figured it out on their own, that you would have to drop and item with a specific button/key on the green dude below the sewer grate. Not only that but the way you drop passive items is different from the rest, which requires you to open the map select the item and click on the top left corner of the screen where it says drop.

2º- Lack of Synergy page in the Ammonomicon. Makes no sense to go on a third party website to figure this out.
I kind of get why it's not in, due to how complex the menu would have to be, but still bothers me a little.

Regardless of those two issues I still think this game deserves a 9/10.

And yes I have put in quite a number of hours at this point.

It seems fun when you unlock things, but it also feels like you are never truly rewarded for your accomplishments, or given anything to offset the tedium of the earlygame. Everything you unlock aside from new characters just gets tossed into the RNG machine, which, at this point for me, is full of a huge number of very underwhelming items. The first bossfight more often than not will be a long and tedious fight with your starting weapon, because you need to save keys [spoiler]in order to access the secret level to increase your overall chances of success[/spoiler], and the game feels insanely stingy when it comes to actually giving you things you need, to the point of just leaving you feeling powerless, empty, and bored. This is the enduring feeling I have from playing this game, not a feeling of accomplishment, or excitement for the next run. I feel like unlockable alternate starting loadouts at least for each of the main 4 characters might have been a good way to offset some of these issues.

At this point I have unlocked all characters, killed all of their pasts, and unlocked every single purchasable item. I am currently wondering how I'm ever going to beat the [spoiler]Lich[/spoiler] with the starting characters, which is presumably how the alternate skins for the starting weapons are unlocked, but really I'm just guessing. Then I suppose there's beating the [spoiler]resourceful rat after finding him in his lair[/spoiler], which at this point I basically have no idea how to do. Unlocking the [spoiler]rat's lair[/spoiler] for the first time was an incredibly baffling and disappointing experience. All those runs, all those resources, for something like that? It didn't leave me feeling intrigued, it left me feeling frustrated and wayless, with a feeling of ""uhh... what now?"". I really don't like [i]having[/i] to go read somebody's guide. I want to be able to figure things out for myself. But what am I going to do, waste over 100 shells every run, running around aimlessly in that location? Doesn't sound appealing. I've heard hints about how to do it, but at this point it's just a big frustrating question mark.

Fun, special events or drops, like rainbow chests in normal runs, feel exceedingly rare. In over 250hrs of game time and nearly [i]four hundred[/i] runs, I have seen TWO rainbow chests. Secret rooms regularly feel like a total waste of the often huge amount of time [i]and[/i] ammo it can take to find them, and apparently sometimes they don't even spawn on a level, which feels like having the game spit in your face when 99% of the time, I am [i]desperate[/i] for resources, or for something interesting to happen.

I understand a bit of grind, but even with having so many things unlocked, it really feels like ""back to square one"" every single time. I put over 800 hours into the Isaac games and the grind never felt like this. I feel like this is a game you should only consider if you have extremely good, pro-gamer reflexes, or a huge amount of patience. Despite it all I will probably continue to play this game, but it does feel like there's wasted potential here, and that there's a more satisfying game buried somewhere inside.",1669851360,1669934034,False,32,4,0.605936765670776367,2,True,False,False

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

EtG это смесь рогалика и буллет хелла, геймплейная суть это:
1. Уворачивайся от пуль. Тут как в этих ваших дарксоулсах: либо учишь паттерны врагов, либо вывозишь на реакции.
2. Стреляй в ответ. Да, с попаданием иногда будут проблемы. Да и у некоторых пушек с прицельной стрельбой, кхм-кхм, не очень
3. Лутайся. Сотни разных пушек и предметов. Большая часть предметов - это какая-то отсылка или пасхалка
За счёт разных вариаций лута у тебя будет получаться каждый раз уникальный ран. Иногда будет попадаться всякое говно, с которым далеко не уйдёшь. А иногда будет дикая имба, с которой наконец-то продвинешься дальше.
Короче, советую.

This game is a well polished combination of dungeon crawling and bullet hell. It has tremendous charm and has great humor. The game references other titles like Metroid, Dark Souls, Mega Man, etc. and has heaps of other Easter eggs.

It's difficulty may be hard for those that are new to the genre but is decent enough for those that have played either dungeon crawlers or bullet hell games. The bosses can be grueling at first but once you've poured more hours, you'll get better, trust me. Enter the Gungeon offers tons and tons of guns and items that can synergize with each other paving the way for creative approaches.

P.S. Even if you're new to this type of genre, this is a great opener. You'll enjoy more than just its great gameplay, the humor and the interaction with NPC's will be there to give you entertainment. This game is a gem.

This is a pretty cruel game when you're starting out for the first time, those first 10 or so attempts where you've unlocked very little, you're still learning enemy and boss patterns, and I doubted that I'd ever get far in this game. This progression picks up slowly but surely over time, not just in the items and guns you find but in the learning curve for the game. It will take time, but this will click into place, and you will find yourself victorious soon enough.

It's not a perfect game by any means; it's sometimes buggy, some of the weapon info you're given is flat-out wrong, some weapons feel very similar to others (or just completely obselete), and there are some items and guns that turn the game into the win button. I'd also highly recommend playing this with the EtG wiki in the background, unless you're adamant that you want to find and memorise every item, gun, and synergy to learn which ones are worth the shell currency. 

Stick with this one; it's gonna be rough for a while, but after that first big hurdle, progression is going to be smooth, and hopefully you'll get as much fun out of it as I did.",1636469512,1668865270,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Anger and pain aside, Holy hell this game took me a long time to complete, and no joke, I have developed carpal tunnel and require special hardware to even come close to be efficient on a keyboard anymore, and fuck me if it didnt start developing with me 100% completing this game. 

If saying all that didn't ward you off of this product of joy and pain, then you will have a great time getting lost in the endless chambers of the Gungeon..
Go shoot some guns, dodge some bullets, kill your past. Enter the Gungeon is fully recommended to anyone that would love to delve into a rougue like, bullet-hell, twin stick, dungeon crawler with dodge rolls. I only recommend going for the 100% it if you are fully insane and have yet to rupture your thumb tendons.

Prep Time: 25 minutes
Cook Time: 35 minutes
Servings: 12 rolls
Ingredients
▢2 cups self-rising flour
▢1/2 cup shortening
▢1/2 cup cold water
▢1/2 cup unsalted butter, very soft
▢1/4 cup sugar
▢1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg (or cinnamon)
For the sauce:
▢2 cups milk
▢2/3 cup sugar
▢1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Instructions
▢
Preheat the oven to 350°F and lightly spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.
▢
In a large bowl, cut the shortening into the flour using a pastry blender or two forks. The goal is to get the shortening cut into tiny pea-size pieces.
▢
Add the water and stir until combined. Use your hands to gently knead the dough until it holds together.
▢
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll the dough into a thin rectangle that is about 10x16-inches. Spread the soft butter to cover the dough then sprinkle with the sugar and nutmeg (or cinnamon). Carefully and tightly roll the dough up jelly roll style and pinch to seal the long edge. Cut the dough into 12 even rolls and place them into the prepared dish.
Make the sauce:
▢
Combine the milk and sugar in a small pot over medium high heat. Stir until the milk just begins to bubble. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Pour the mixture over the rolls.
▢
Bake uncovered for 35 to 45 minutes or until the rolls are brown on the tops. Serve warm.

The difficulty is balanced, and the game will offer a challenge without being unfairly hard, which i appreciate.

-Lazy proceduraly generated dungeons means the levels are randomly generated by an algorithm rather than expertly handcrafted with interesting locations, memorable areas, and fun enemy placements by a designer. Instead, you get a hodge podge of nonsense thrown into a blender. This is like making a sandwich by wearing a blindfold and throwing whatever ingredient is in your fridge (bread, grape jelly, baking soda, expired tuna, half eaten sausage link, and frozen peas, whatever). Sure, its possible to get something good; but most of the time you get nonsense.

-If you die, then you have to replay the level or several levels over again (this can be +20 minutes). This is a huge waste of time if you are a gamer who values his/her time and does not like repetition. This is compounded even further by the procedurally generated dungeons which makes me even less interested in replaying after each death.

-You aren't given much of a story. Without some interesting hook to keep me invested, why should I replay these levels over and over again after each death? This genre is for players who enjoy feeling good about overcoming a challenge. For me at least, I don't care about feeling personal validation and sense of accomplishment over beating a gaming challenge. I just want to play something that is fun and not repetitive.

-Like your typical rogue-like, there is a huge luck component. You might get an easy dungeon, good guns, ""cooperative"" boss in one run. And then you get obliterated in the next. If you are a fan of rogue-likes (i.e. you enjoy dying a lot and repeating the same procedurally generated dungeons over and over again until you get the right combination of ""git gud"" and lucky RNG), then this game is up your alley. For me, i'd rather play a different game that I enjoy then keep hitting my head on this wall until I ""git gud"" and ""git lucky"".",1667741829,1667741829,False,1,2,0.400918394327163696,0,True,False,False

Enter the Gungeon (EtG) is a roguelite action shooter that has you dodge waves of bullets as you descend deeper within the gungeon. You have four characters at start with four more as unlockables. The game comes with an enormous arsenal of weapons at your disposal, but no weapon is an automatic win. Gungeon is a very skill-based game, where you want to even stand a prayer at later floors you’re going to need to learn the inside and out of every enemy and every boss for any situation. It’s not like Binding of Issac where a good item or two makes the run laughable, the game will keep you on your toes the entire time. The game doesn’t go into the madness of some true bullet hells, but the difficulty will please people.

After 150 hours, I can say the game is an excellent roguelite. If you’re a fan of roguelites and/or shooters, definitely give this game a shot.

Let me get one thing straight - I fucking love this game. I literally cannot stop playing it after 100%ing it, getting all Ammonomicon entries, beating it every which way in every variation you can think of (with the exception of cursed + turbo + blessed + double challenge in a full run). 

All I want to say is beware those that can't control themselves. The Gungeon will suck you in and suck you dry and suck your funds out (because everything you buy must be Gungeon themed) and suck the life out of you until you're nothing but a dry shell bullet-kin in the Keep of the Lead Lord and ... you hear a noise?

you cant leave ammo on the ground for later when you need, it disappears. if all your guns are full and you get an ammo drop, sucks to be you.

get an active item from a chest, but you already have one that you want to use for the rest of the floor before you take the new one? tough luck, any item you leave in a room will disappear if you leave said room.

want to save your money to splurge on a better shop later down the line instead of spending it immediately? too bad, you'd better buy what you want right now, because prices increase the further you go, you'll never have enough for more than one item.

oh, and don't forget the DPS cap for bosses, which makes sure that it doesn't matter how good your build is, you'll never feel powerful, and will always use a ton of ammo. glass cannons be damned.

all of this makes each run feel very linear, there's very little room for actually making your own plays and decisions. you just have to always move forward or not at all, which feels really strange for this genre.

It has tons of replayability and secrets to discover. and with every new character and NPC you unlock comes a different way to experience the game to somehow give it even more of a varied experience. Of course, as with all good things comes the bad. There definitely are way too many items in the game. A lot of the items are good and some to the extent where simply having that item turns the entire game into a cakewalk but more then half the items in the game are trash. If you're just playing the vanilla experience then most of your runs will be plagued by bad items and even your skill wont be enough to save you. I always play on rainbow mode which makes it so that you only get 1 item per floor but you basically get to choose what it is from a randomised selection. This is the only way to get more actual good runs then not; because once again, there is too much trash in this game.

Closing thoughts: Someone should create a mod that allows you to pick which items will appear in the game and which don't. Not so much for the purpose of every run being a total cheese, but more to even out the loot pool. I still love this game and will likely still play it every day.


Side note: I have checked out some of the mods for this game and they aren't low quality stuff either. The loot pool thing is still a problem but once you get the mod items, it's worth it. Shoutout to the Modders!",1665229876,1665229876,True,18,0,0.703618884086608887,0,True,False,False

I like old style, arcade difficult games, it's what I grew up playing. To me, this is the most replayable Rogue-like I've played. The challenge is significant, and each time you never know what you'll get to combat it. There's just a huge batch of really unique weapons and items that are well thought out and so fun to try out.

Even with an amazing weapon or items, your skill alone is what will get you past some of the really hard bosses and enemies, but the stuff you find can give you the edge you need to get through. It seems like you get better stuff the better you play too, idk how much the RNG is actually affected by how good you play, but it feels like it is at least somewhat. 

Now, if you're incredible at this game, you can get all the way through with pretty basic weapons, it's definitely possible, but it's very hard to get that good. I think a lot of people who have played it have never completed the whole gungeon even once, but it's very enjoyable even if you die over and over.

Plays like a Binding of Isaac clone that makes relatively few changes to gameplay. Which in itself would be welcome.
However, there is a lack of balance that emphasizes quirkiness in jokes and references at the expense of gameplay.

For this type of game, ideally you should feel like every hit you take is due to player error and avoidable. Does not seem ot be the case.
The camera is often one of the greatest enemies. Instead of always being able to see the entire room, you can only the direction you are aiming at, with the character often on the periphery of the screen. It is not unusual to get hit by enemies you don't even know exist.

The controls are another foe. One of the key mechanics are ""blanks"" which serve as bombs from bullet-hell games, clearing the screen. However, the control is hard-locked to pressing both analog sticks in at the same time, which is difficult at best when you are moving the sticks at all times. 

There is a wide range of weapons, but half of them seem to be useless jokes and there is no way to easily tell if a new weapon is actually any good, as they lack viewable stats or ranks. 

Instead of organically unlocking new items by playing the game, all of the new items are purchased with in-game currency. Which would be fine, but the currency can only be acquired by defeating bosses. Getting hit once by a boss drastically reduces the rewards and makes earning credits a tedious slough instead of a byproduct of enjoying the game.

It is kind of a shame, there is potential here, but it buried under a lot of weird decisions. When the game is fun, it is great; dodging bullet-hell style barrages and taking enemies out one by one. But it too often becomes a frustrating experience.",1664493378,1664493378,False,3,1,0.497641503810882568,0,True,False,False

TL;DR: Looks cute, very fun, lots to unlock and a bunch of secrets to uncover.
One of few games I bought all DLC, did all achievements, and got all trading cards for.

Long list of why it's good:
- EtG is a bullet hell that is easy to play but hard to master. Also has Witty humor and neat lore.
- Extremely replayable and has co-op (FYI it's 2 player, one plays on keyboard other on controller)
- I have about 200 hours in it, and still have not found / unlocked everything in the game (Tons of content)
- Amazing soundtrack to back the game up.
- The game looks cute and has fun mechanics. Also a ton of references to other medias.
- It makes you feel like a badass. 
- Tons of convoluted and fun secrets to find some of which will blow your mind! 
- Was made because the devs had to sit in a parking lot for 6 hours.
- The devs (seemingly) made this game with the idea of more bang for you buck because it really shows.


BTW The game doesn't exactly tell you exactly how to find some secrets or where to find something so you'll feel like either a genius or a retard depending if you looked up a guide or not.
If you play co-op your experience will be more difficult so don't think your homie is gonna help carry you.
The game -If you're new and still reading this- has tons of hidden content underneath the surface and definitely worth the money in my opinion!",1663908072,1663908072,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It checks a lot of the rogue-lite boxes: difficulty scaling, unlock tons of items, and a primary form of progression being through player understanding of the game rather than permanently improving your starting character.

That said, rogue-lites are my favorite genre and I have a number of nitpicks that prevent this from being one that I can really enjoy coming back to.
Pacing of the game is just slow, but not in a way that I could call methodical.  Gun firing speed is slow.  Bullets move slowly.  Reload is slow.  The rooms are very large compared to character walk speed which makes navigation slow.  Forget fighting through a floor with a wildly inaccurate gun, it takes to long just to walk to the end of a room.
Also.... more on the guns being inaccurate.  How are you going to make a skill-based shooter game and not have the bullets go where the player is directing them?  This is the most frustrating point for me.

Runs are also way more RNG dependent on good gun drops than most other rogues that depend on intra-run items.  This is largely due to the fact that the guns have limited supplies of ammo and the starter guns are trash (mostly due to their inaccuracy). If either the starter guns had complete accuracy, making them have a reasonable baseline value, or ammo was less restrictive, I would have an easier time forgiving this grievance.

As it stands, you need to get good guns to get very far (yes you can kill bosses with basic weapons but holy goddamn is it unbelievably and unbearably slow), and it's a grind to get to the good guns, particularly since the unlock order is pretty hard set in stone.

All of that said, the upside to this game is pretty significant if you can stomach the slow early game.  It's definitely a hardcore roguelite so it kind of breaks my heart that I can't look past its faults.",1663724654,1663724654,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Despite the fluidity of the moment-to-moment gameplay and the wonderful feel of everything, playing the game itself wore me down way too fast.

Come back a few years later and, would you look at that, they've fixed the drops! EtG is a blast now, with about a dozen different secret floors, bosses, and so-on added since last I played. The improved drop rates for keys and high-tier chests means I can activate synergies more easily, and challenge characters like the Gunslinger and Paradox turn the game into a hectic playground of weird and wonderful weapons.

My main problem with it is the early game is just too boring, the first floor simply has too little content, and I feel like the game is backwards in that sense, The last areas have the most content compared to the other floors in the game, as-well with the coolest content.
This might sound a bit goofy but hear me out. In ETG at the start of every run you are on the first floor, which makes sense, and you are only at the last floor every 15-20ish runs. So why does the last floor have so much content compared to every other floor, if the player is there only a fraction amount of time? Most rogue-like games have this problem, and I feel like it disincentives new runs, as you will need to go though the same easy first floor again and again at the start of it. There should be variants to the first areas, spice it up a bit if players will be there for the majority of their time with your game. Don't make the content 'cool' necessarily, as then the start would be more fun than the end, just make it not be the same every time. Hades did this a bit (contradicting a bit with what I said at the very start), and I feel like it made it a better game! 

(Also I feel like the pacing is bad (partially because of  the reason stated above))

This game if fun, but I can't see myself getting the true TRUE ending, so I'm sorry ETG, but you're a 6.8/10 for me.
