I understand that they had to release a DLC in order to gather more funds to continue development, etc, but if that was the case then how are they having the resource to work on a new game on the side while not finishing this one? Another thing somewhat unrelated to the Steam platform, but I think it pertains to my overall criticism, which is previously I bought this game on another platform, but they removed their game from it (allegedly due to some identity politic disagreement) and have since stopped updating their game there completely. These type of delays and uncertainties feel like a trend and make me skeptical of buying future games from this dev.

Gameplay wise I actually love this game if you note my played hours, but it has so much unexplored potential. There are lots of ingame limitation that makes no sense except to retain a certain way the dev forces you to play. It just make the game feel very inflexible. Things such as you can't craft your own sleeping bag and cannot sleep anywhere except for existing beds and cars. Doesn't make sense that there couldn't be a mechanic to at least make your own makeshift bed from leaves and twigs. There are many other details like that which make you question the design choices.

One note about this game is that it's quite taxing on my nVidia laptop GPU and getting it to overheat quickly. Could be something to do with their poor optimization with the Unity engine, but I am even able to play newer games with better graphic and my GPU does not get as hot.",1686607223,1708857293,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Thank you for teaching me that the wanton destruction of wildlife is acceptable and necessary in real world survival scenarios – as this game is clearly intended to be a survival training simulation. Wolves are very dangerous animals that actively seek out and attack humans in packs. Therefore, they are to be hunted down and destroyed by humans whenever possible. 

My new weekend hobby, thanks to this game by-the-way, is to put myself into dangerous situations and personal risk by going deep into the wilderness alone and under-equipped (I don’t tell anyone where I’m going just to make it extra risky and to put some meaning into my actions). 

I set traps for rabbits even when I’m not hungry. I chop down trees even when I don’t plan on making a fire (because…you know…modern sleeping bags are pretty darn warm these days especially when paired with a proper tent). ALSO…did I mention…I kill wolves…cause I learned they are too dangerous to be kept alive. I know they will attack me later when I least expect it.  

I carry 80 lbs. of gear and run around in the snow like its no big deal. I set up a rope scramble on a vertical climb down a sheer cliff so I can go grab some Old Mans Beard Lichen. I inject myself with a steroid adrenaline shot before climbing down (with my 80 lb. bag by-the-way).  I need the Beard Lichen to heal the festering infected wounds on my arm after knife fighting with a grizzly bear from earlier that morning. Stupid bear attacked me for no reason! 

I do all this without the need to jump, vault, or go prone...cause, you know, those actions are never necessary in a survival situation. Instead of vaulting over a 2-foot-high log or rock, I definitely prefer to walk 200 meters out of the way. I prefer to stand up when firing my rifle at animals (for the LULs). Why would I want to make it easier on myself by stabilizing the gun on the ground? That wouldn’t be realistic at all. 

This game has taught me all this and more. But, for some reason, the aurora borealis never seems to charge my flashlight. I need to figure this out one day. 

Thanks!

Edit: I still love this game and could play it all day. I hate that a lot of people feel super mixed now about it. I bought this game when it was still in alpha on my brother's steam account back in the day. I remember when you only had 2 maps you could pick from and they gave Stacyplays her name on the grape soda because she was someone who brought a lot of new players to the game, that included me. This game grew because it was shared by videos and communities. It got a bit bigger, but people still forget it IS STILL an indie game. The resources it takes to make a story and continue to grow the game cost money. They got that money, made a great story, and released a COMPLETELY OPTIONAL DLC. Yes, I think they released it a bit early, but development teams make mistakes, and people make mistakes. They added more content, and continue to do so. They still give us free updates and improvements, and people call them greedy. They don't hide everything behind a paywall like EA or Blizzard does, They are a small developer company that has one game, which means they have a smaller team. They released a DLC so they could get money to have more resources to finish the story and give the survival more updates and bring more content and possibly more DLCs. I love hinterland, they aren't an evil like most, though I won't say they are on our side. The person who made it just wanted an EXPLORATION game because they liked that part of fallout 3, and this game was the result of it. I know they are trying to do the best for their players and take criticism and look at us for feedback and continue to improve. I think they are doing a great job and I've been following them for a long time, and the game just keeps getting better for me. Yeah I still got my gripes.

There are many things to say about this game. So i made a list of all my positves and negatives after about 150 hours of gameplay. Keep in mind this is only my opinion ;)

Positives +

+ five different difficulties Pilgrim (easy), Voyager (medium), stalker (hard), interloper (very hard) and custom game give you enough possibilities the play the game as a beginner or as a advanced player

+ beautiful drawing style. The landscapes, the sky, and all the items you can find look great

+ a big world to explore with regions that are all different from each other in terms of wildlife, weather and points of interest

+ weather not instantly changes but has a transition 

+ realistic survival in terms of clothing and how much warmth and windproof you get from it (having windproof clothing in the outer layers/condition of the clothes)

+ realistic survival in terms of debuffs (food poisoning, infections, blood loss, etc.)

+ leveling skills like cooking, fire starting. carcass harvesting, etc. give you benefits that help you survive

+ hunting rabbits, deer, wolves, bear and moose is fun 

+ crafting all kinds of different stuff makes collecting materials worth in the early/mid game

+ fitting background music and your character talks to you how he/she is feeling or thinking

+ game devs care for their player base in terms of bug fixing, regular updates that improve existing content or adding new content to the base game and the DLC's 

Negatives -

- exploring and traveling needs much patience because if you're overweight (weight based inventory), tired or walking against the wind your speed gets reduced 

- there are not so many crafting recipes. crafting things is worth it but for some materials there's only one or two crafting recipes so you will have more materials than you need in the mid/late game 

- you are not able to get any kind of mount which help you traveling the world even there would be legit possibilities like skis or a sledge to go downhill

Of course every shelter has its own proprieties (how much it shelters from the outside world). 
Another great idea would be to add new modes of transportation (ice skates, sleds, skis, dog or domesticated wolf pulled sleds).
Of course, adding new food sources (rice, honey, bones for making soup, pasta, cheese, snow sheep milk, ...), clothes, tools (binocular glass, slingshot, spear, lot of traps for any animal, candles, blankets, shovel for igloos) and animals (beaver, snow sheep, seal, wolverine, owl, bison, boar, brown bear) would be fantastic. 
Adding new crafting options (blankets, whip to chase away little-medium predators, craft bones and horns and teeth for different necessities.
Until now I haven't really understood the utility of the battery, it would be nice to be able to increase the battery usage versatility (source of light or heat).

The Long Dark on the other hand ratchets up the difficulty by making you face a more hostile environment, and giving you fewer resources to deal with it. So you need to get creative. 

This game really shines when you play in Interloper difficulty. Intelligent game design is so rare these days and Hinterland absolutely nailed it.

Heat teas by the fire and use them to stay warm while travelling. Carrying a load of stinky guts and meat and want to avoid predators? Wait for a blizzard and use it as cover. Use a torch to scare off wolves if you don't have any weapons...but be careful the wind doesn't blow out your fire.

Hinterland is not without faults but to claim they're selling DLC for a unfinished game isn't fair. I enjoy the base game and the TFTFT DLC but wintermute wasn't really for me.

* A long sequence of un-skippable splash screens (with entirely unnecessary, woke, preachy messages) when starting. 
* A slow/buggy UI that makes inventory management needlessly difficult.
* Intermittent auto save only: The game doesn't even save when you exit, meaning that if real life forces you to suddenly exit the game, everything since the last auto save is lost, which can be upwards of 30 minutes or more of play time. 
* The core survival aspects aren't very realistic. Hatchets wear down extremely fast, even if you're only using them to break twigs thin enough to snap with your bare hands. 
* Unable to jump or even step over ankle-high obstacles, making it easy to get stuck on the terrain, leading to unavoidable death. (Just barely managed to get over a fence so low to the ground that a toddler could have easily stepped over it, only to discover that it wasn't possible to step back over it from the other side... death.)
* Unable to fully set language to English on a non-English system. (I use a Japanese system because some other programs on my PC require it. That doesn't mean I want to play my non-Japanese games in poorly-translated Japanese, but even when I set this game's language to English, bits of the UI still appear in Japanese, which is grating.)

I can appreciate slower-paced games, but 70% of my gameplay is just walking from point A to point B. Something about the walk-speed and map design feels like you're constantly trudging forward at sloooow moootiooon. Apparently, some article online claimed that the Long Dark map was larger than Skyrim. I'm not sure if that's actually true; however, it is true that the map FEELS huge due to how long it takes it get anywhere. Your character is very cold, weighed down by clothing/materials, and trudging through the snow... and the game forces you to feel that speed.
It's also usually dark and hard to see, especially inside. Another realistically understandable thing; lights are not working and constant snowing is gonna make things tough to see indoors. 
I owned this game for years and was stuck at Episode 2: Walking Nightmare for the longest time, not because it was difficult (though the game certainly offers easy and hard difficulties to choose from), but because it simply took forever to walk anywhere. Apparently episode 2 is notorious for this... (trudging through the backwoods and near hilly mountains to get back to the town feels like the worst kind of fetch quest)
Sometimes you'll get hills you're required to climb. Other times you have to find an obscure way AROUND other hills that look identical to the former, yet attempting to travel them will result in easy injury/disorientation. Part of the skill in this game (notably for harder difficulties) is to memorize and understand each inch of the map.

I usually love survival games. I don't know why this one keeps making me angry. I feel that it does not respect my time whatsoever, and hides it's boring design choices under the excuse of ""realism."" 

The DLC coming out before the main story is finished also kinda pissed me off, I won't lie hahaha... I'm old school though; I don't like DLC at all to begin with. Knowing it's becoming accepted in the industry to not only release unfinished games, but also release DLC for those unfinished games is just maddening personally.

This review is a bit too harsh. The game has a lot of awesome stuff to offer. The survival aspect is near perfect, inventory management is kinda fun, the story is enjoyable if you just let yourself enjoy it... If you love the atmosphere in the trailers, you'll probably have no issues with traveling in this game. Truthfully, I do actually like the game, yet also despise it...
Once the full story is complete, then I will be revising my review to be more understanding and give this game the positive review it deserves. But as it stands; this game pissed me off, wasted my time, and left me on a cliffhanger for literal years.
 
For what it's worth; there IS enough gameplay and story to justify the price, especially at a discount. Do you enjoy survival games? Are you able to be patient? Yes? Then this game is for you!
I just desperately wish that someone would mod/hack the game to speed up the walking speed, just a teensy bit more...

As someone who despises real-life snow with the fiery passion of a thousand suns (seriously, I have a snow shovel buried in my backyard... I'm not kidding), it's nothing short of ironic that I find myself utterly enchanted by The Long Dark.

Let me tell you, folks, this game is like the snowy apocalypse of my dreams. It's got everything I hate about snow – the bone-chilling cold, the blinding blizzards, and let's not forget the ever-present threat of hypothermia – all wrapped up in a neat little survival package.

But here's the kicker: I can't get enough of it. There's something oddly satisfying about braving the elements from the comfort of my toasty warm living room, knowing that I'm not actually in danger of freezing to death. Plus, there's a sick sense of satisfaction in outsmarting Mother Nature and her relentless snowstorms.

And let's not forget about the wildlife. Sure, real-life wolves may send me running for the hills (or, more accurately, the nearest indoor shelter), but in The Long Dark, they're just another obstacle to overcome. I've lost count of how many times I've screamed obscenities at my screen as a pack of wolves descended upon me, only to emerge victorious (or at least alive) on the other side.

In all seriousness, though, The Long Dark is a masterpiece of survival gaming. The atmosphere is hauntingly beautiful, the gameplay is challenging yet rewarding, and the sense of immersion is second to none. So if you're like me – someone who hates snow but secretly loves the idea of surviving in it – do yourself a favor and give The Long Dark a try. Just be sure to bundle up and watch out for wolves. They're sneaky little buggers.",1708173760,1708173760,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

50 hours: Very peaceful and encompassing survival simulator game. The Canadian-ness of it is quaint. I love the music, the variety of equipment, and the realism.

Suggestions: It is true that movement speed is ridiculously slow and your character does have shockingly poor stamina, which makes the game somewhat tedious/tiresome. You move incredibly slow when walking. The game forces you to ration your stamina and find things to do each time you need to rest to quickly pass the time, but sometimes there is nothing to do, you just need to get somewhere, and it is just a little too fastidious to move at .5 km/hour. I mean, I'm pretty sure I can run longer and farther than my character can, even with 35 kilos of weight on my back... something doesn't add up. I wish the devs would increase the walk speed just a little bit. It wouldn't break the game and it would just save us players time in real life that we could use to enjoy the game more or do other things. I end up getting bored of walking so slow in the game that I have to quit and take lots of breaks to stay interested again. 

Also, they should incorporate better story notes into the survival game. The notes are just poems. Why not have interesting notes of survivor stories to find in-game? Something a survivor wrote in the last moments of their life? That would make the corpses you find frozen all across the landscape more personal and meaningful.

Quick review:

Not I don't have alot of hours on this game but with the hours I do have I can safetly say... this game is HARD. it is one of the hardest survival games I have ever played. I mean like 50 percent of players don't even get past the first day. that should say alot. Anyways if your ready to die over and over again and rage so hard you break your desk then this game is for you. My longest run was 4 days and 18 hours. died to the cold. would have been a 10/10 but it could have alot more stuff in it.",1707724687,1707724834,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Often you will find yourself walking from one objective to the next with nothing happening in between for very long stretches of time. This is egregiously obvious during the second chapter where you must walk across a frozen lake three times, and the lake is god damn huge. Ironically I have the most fun with this game when I'm sitting at a campfire, repairing my gear, and keeping my food up with other resources. It's simple, but effective. But everything outside of that is just pressing forward and walking in long, out of the way paths because going up a hill directly will result in injury most of the time. 

Not every game needs you to be doing *something* at any given time, but with how large the different maps are, and how there isn't really anything going on, you sure do feel like you're just walking alone across a frozen landscape with absolutely nothing to do. There just isn't really anything fun about it, I feel like I'm being punished constantly without having a real challenge element. There isn't really a skill ceiling, or you don't really get ""better"" at the survival the more you play. You just get more stuff to carry and that in of itself makes the game harder. Maybe theres something I get later on that makes that better but I cannot be bothered to press walk forward for another two hours to find out.

The Long Dark is a survival game through and through. Managing your sleep, thirst, hunger, and temperature, are the deciding factors in your breakthroughs success. This does nitty gritty survival like few games rarely do. Want to go explore a part of the map? You better wear enough layers, bring enough water, a snack or two, enough material to start a fire, and tools you may need while exploring to search of fend off wildlife. Also, keep your eye on the weather because if a sudden snow storm come sup you are in a heap of trouble. Only in the later game when you have crafted enough warm clothes out of animal skins, collected enough ammo and weapons, and supplied yourself with weeks of food and water, can you afford to venture out in to the countryside with some ease. That doesn't mean you are invincible though, keep an eye out for bears or packs of wolves that are looking hungry. 

Think about what it would be like if you were alone with hundreds of miles of wilderness between you and civilization. How truly isolated you would feel. Knowing that no one will hear your cries for help, your rumbling stomach, no one will know or care when you take your last breath.  THAT is what this game does exceptionally well. The music, aesthetic, the sound effects, and the design of the game lends to this feeling 24/7. 

Are there better survival games then this? Probably. However, no one does winter survival quite like this.

It is incredibely refreshing to play a survival game that doesn't need obscure lore because you can manage to sustain yourself and, fuck it, a town of 500 other people within the first 2 days of hardcore crafting.

The long dark isn't about a man who finds a way to live under the circumstances he's been put into, it's about a man who takes as long as he can to inevitably die.

You are not a master craftsman, you wont beat a wolf in hand-to-paw combat and you definitely don't have enough energy to chop down a whole forest to turn into the mansion you've always dreamed of.

You will sit in a dark room, no way of making light to effectively use your time, but also not tired enough to sleep, watching yourself starve because the innards of that deer you shot and took 15 minutes to find in the woods, only to take hours to carry it back to your current shelter, haven't dried fast enough to craft the pouch you needed to harvest this or the article of clothing you needed to get from here to there or whatever you needed to not have your run end just there.

This game has alot of potential.  Not sure if I want to purchase the DLC expansion.  The classic game is more challenging!  The DLC kinda makes interloper too easy, though you can play custom versions.  The problem with that is you cant get achievements, though after 1000hrs, I dont really care about them anymore.

I also kinda have a problem with the price.  I paid 40$ for my copy of basic TLD.  To pay another 25$ for the DLC seems a bit steep for this game. Wish I had got it for free during the pandemic.  But I wont cry too much about that.  Most people dont have that as an issue.

Alot of the bugs and glitches from the early days are gone.  The saves problem is long gone.  I havent noticed any significant bugs or issues.  There are still a few things that bother me.

(1) the deer spawning on the cliffs in the ravine
(2) the lack of base building/ base customization
(3) the constant search for fuel (and the sort of inability to harvest large trees etc)

but my number one complaint is WIND MECHANICS.  I think the wind is too unpredicatble, and the movement loss is too high.  Its a real buzzkill imo.  

But on a good note. The campy graphics actually grow on you after a while.  The game runs really smoothly.  Its definitely worth the price, I certainly got my money out of it.  But in general I am opposed to the idea of companies selling DLC.  I think if you buy the game, you own it, and get ALL the updates, forever.  This is fair imo, because when you buy a game in its infancy, you are kind of ""investing"" in the company, and your payout is the updates.  they can keep raising the price for the new players, if they want, but they shouldnt keep trying to fleece the people who supported them at the beggining.  

That being said, its still worth it at this point.  Its a good game, that keeps getting better, and hinterland has come a long way with it.",1671678393,1707343783,True,0,0,0.526417434215545654,0,True,False,False

The setting of the game is post apocalyptic Canadian wilderness where aurora borealis constantly happens and frying up all electrical system while... energizing wild animals. Or at least, that's the explanation for wolves constantly attacking you. 

The game is fun as it has nice balance between challenge and exploration. The scenery of some region can be gorgeous. The game can be very boring for some because of the deep snow and extreme cold forces you to be a slow walker. You also account for the heavy gears and clothing that let you only carry few items at a times forces you to back track many miles. If you can plan to have multiple base in multiple region, it's not too bad. The food and tools degrades over time which forces you to be out of comfort zone.

Story mode, or WINTERMUTE on the other hand doesn't blend too well for this. After some narratives, it becomes a slow walking simulator as it uses exact same map but instead it points you to where you need to go to progress the story. That ""pointing"" also causes a loads of back tracking. Like going back to same spot for 3-4 times, while consuming 1 hour walking time on each trip. I played for 6 hours of session so far and 70% was just walking instead of actually having a story.

Despite having good voice actors, it often gets ruined by some of bad writings in the game. For example, the story start out by a protagonist Will Mackenzie takes his ""friend"" Astrid Greenwood for a plane ride for her job which gets hit by aurora that shorts out all electrical system which eventually crashes down to a Canadian wilderness. Astrid goes missing, and Will states obvious thing ""Astrid hasn't come looking for me, which means she can't come looking for me... becasue she's hurt... or worse""

I hate to say but just buy the survival edition, and have your own story. So far, the story mode in the game is just a glorified tutorial. The game was more exciting when it was mystery to everything and have to figure it out yourself.",1707264652,1707264652,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The 4 story episodes are brilliant even though we have been waiting forever for the firth and final episode which will be part and parcel of your purchase. The game requires that you learn how to survive and that you get to know the maps so you can find your way to shelter even in a blizzard at night. I hate the wolves, sneaky, opportunistic annoying wolves. The survival mode comes in 4 difficulty levels. The 1st 3 difficulty levels are playable and the Interloper most difficult mode used to be playable, more-or-less but the developers have gone over the top and just made it so difficult, murdering your survivor blatantly, that it is hardly worth playing any more (surviving is random and no longer has much to do with your actions). All the rest is great. 8/10 and would have received a 9.5/10 if they did not mess up Interloper level. Get it if this is your type of game.

The Feb 2023 updates have spoiled a good game and introduced some commercially questionable behaviour. The special guns and special lantern has been removed and are now only part of the paid DLC, so they have taken content away from the existing players who have paid for it and made it part of a new pay expansion. The rifle spawns have been reduced and now it is a matter of pure luck if one can complete the Whiteout challenge as a rifle is required and one may not spawn within reasonable play range. I have now searched Coastal Highway everywhere, Desolation Point, Ravine, Misty Lake, Mountain Town and still no rifle to complete the challenge. Shame on you Hinterland you keep antagonising your players...

Update 5 Feb 2024:

I came back to this game after a year had passes and many updates had been made. It seems the criticism from players managed to get through. I have played a full game, all areas on Stalker and by 300 days had done everything and visited everywhere with adequate resources and enjoyable gameplay. I played Interloper and it also had been fixed, very challenging and unforgiving but playable. Even a single mistake could be the end of your run but that is fine for interloper. Once again, corrections made. I then played Whiteout and found all the required items to complete the challenge in CH as expected.

I have one remaining gripe with the long wait for the final episode of Wintermute but will be forgiving given that they have been responsive to players and will now go back to a 9.5 rating.

After several years, they're still making updates to the content.  Please don't let my complaints steer you away.  There are some flaws in this game, for sure, but the overall game is great in spite of these flaws.

Positive:  The game started off with several options to survive and has since added more and more options.  Cooking is still relatively simple, but it is slowly becoming something worth investing effort into.  The game is hard enough that no matter how good at the game you are, it's going to challenge you.  You can never take your safety for granted as no matter how tough you are, the right series of bad decisions (or moments of bad luck) can end your run abruptly!  It really feels like you're surviving!

Negatives:  I'll start with my biggest groan:  The art is terrible.  Like, it's REALLY bad, halfway between cartoony and realistic and it just makes for really weird, unrealistic characters.  One second you'll be really getting into it, seeing the way the trees sway in the breeze and the wolves and bears that look so real, then you'll look at the character portrait or the moon and wonder why they decided to make them so ugly with so much else that looks so great!
RNG!  Seriously.  I know that there's a degree of luck in some of these things, but I sincerely wish there was a way to ensure just a little more balance in the location of items.  I once started a map where I wasn't able to access an axe or a knife, two things you must always have to survive, anywhere in my starting zone.  It's so frustrating to get all sorts of other tools and resources but not be able to harvest animals or gather resources because there's no basic starting items in the easiest rated places.  Then there are the instances where you get 5 axes and 3 knives but almost nothing else.  I'm just saying, the opening areas should have a greater balance of necessary things to survive.
Finally, on the same line:  Don't start the character off in the middle of a blizzard with no way to get into shelter or stay warm and dry.  It's a very frustrating thing to die withing a few minutes of starting a new game because the player isn't given the  chance to even try to take precautions.",1707106804,1707106804,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Long Dark is a thoughtful, exploration-survival experience that challenges solo players to think for themselves as they explore an expansive frozen wilderness in the aftermath of a geomagnetic disaster. There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster.

        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]The Long Dark has a pretty unique art style. It’s more of a cartoonish style which can be a good or bad thing. It mainly depends on the person’s preference. Personally I really enjoyed the style. Granted the style isn’t visually impressive, but I do enjoy a unique take in graphics. Don’t expect a realistic style game here. The lighting and colors are really good. The sunset and objects have a pretty good vibrant color palette. Also the lighting is really impressive. The UI system is really good as well. It’s convenient with little to no issues.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]This is a pretty hardcore survival game. Now not hardcore as in enemies, but the pure ruthlessness of mother nature and the cold. You, as the player, have to keep into account body temperature, caloric intake, hunger/thirst, fatigue, wind-chill, wildlife, and a host of other environmental factors. It’s a cruel world in The Long Dark. Hunting for food alone can be a great challenge. Hunting plays a huge role, but be careful of some dangerous predators out there that will hunt and kill you. You can craft, find weapons and ammo (but really scarce), and build a shelter preferably inside a building. One cool quality of life they have here is the Journal. The Journal keeps track of your skills, stats, collections, notes, and even your daily log. Your daily log is a day by day checklist of how many calories you burnt, locations discovered, injuries sustained, and much more. Survival mode is fantastic, providing many cool locations that can add some ease, or some challenge depending on where you go. The survival mode has 4 different difficulties. You may also create your own difficulty if you want (huge plus here!). Another great touch is the ability to complete feats and challenges. The feats do grant some benefits into your playthrough which is a huge plus and can help your fight for survival feel a bit easier. The Long Dark also has some challenge modes. These will give you badges but can be really difficult to achieve. They may not grant much, but if you plan on getting all the achievements, then you have to do these.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]The story is actually pretty solid. There are some intense moments and the plot was overall quite decent. I’m not sure if I’d replay it, but for one time playthrough it’s really good. The story mode and sandbox locations are connected, so this can actually help you get familiar with some areas before playing on Sandbox mode. Sadly the story mode is not included with the base game so if you want to experience a story here, you will have to pay extra.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]You can add many hours into this game. The loot is random each time you play so you never know what you will get on another playthrough early on. You have many locations and with the addiction of challenge modes and even a custom sandbox difficulty, you will add tons of hours here.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The sound design is really impressive. Hearing the wind and blizzard from inside a dark cabin is actually pretty spooky. A cool attention to detail is when you had more items into your backpack, the heavier you sound. The music is really good too. I enjoyed many soundtracks in the game. I don’t really keep music on while playing these kinds of games, but the soundtrack really compliments the atmosphere. The voice acting is pretty good too (especially if you play the story mode). Even the sounds of animals in the distance are pretty good.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]There are some bugs that are noticeable. Sometimes I get stuck on some surfaces which can get annoying. Sometimes clothes won’t dry when standing next to a fire, and other odd bugs here and there. Now nothing really game breaking, but you may come across some bugs so do keep that in mind.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]Performance is really good. I played on Ultra settings and got a solid 60fps on my rig. I mean I would hope so since the graphics are not that demanding at all. I had no crashes or stutters either. The game was really smooth all across the board.[/td]

I was very stressed out by the voice actor always complaining about being hungry or thirsty or tired but once I realized there is no great danger in starving or being thirsty and that cold is the only real quick killer, I turned that voice off in the settings and since then it's been a pretty relaxing journey on voyager.

Like most games nowadays you need to google and visit the wiki often if you don't want a hard time learning how to do things but reading about the game and learning from other players has been almost as nice as playing so I don't mind. If you want a challenge the game has higher difficulties and custom games is also possible. Although you are fighting the elements and wildlife and not zombies there are still moments that can be very scary and add to the immersion. Such as going out at night and getting lost while hearing the growl of a bear somewhere close. Almost freezing to death being caught in a blizzard. Being chased by a pack of timberwolf with just a flare as your source of defence. 

You learn to savour the simple things in the long dark. A warm cup of virtual coffee by a lit fireplace safe from the elements. Having enough food to last for many days and being able to settle in somewhere and then venture out and ""colonize"" neighbouring regions from that location. Returning ""home"" with new loot from a treacherous adventure up a mountain etc. And It's easy on the wallet and easy on the computer. You rarely feel over powered even when you've gained some skills (yes there is a skill mechanic) as you can still mess up by being poorly prepared for an excursion or being surprised by a crazed moose without enough bullets etc. crawling back home in a desperate attempt to survive. ego broken along with your ribs and a worrying blood loss. Getting home alive and scrambling to that medicine cabinet trying to treat your injuries correctly to not waste materials.

That said, the game looks back to about 6 years (only counting time since steam release) of steady development and big updates introducing new maps, mechanics and reworks. 

Knowing that this game originated as a Kickstarter project however I cannot help but wonder how well the whole development has been planed and scheduled from the start. If you fail to understand my reasoning maybe try to ask yourself questions in the context of; as a upcoming game development team, if your way to fund the development of your own game involves using Kickstarter and going early access at an early development stage:
- Would you promise said story mode you know will take you over 6 years to complete?
- Would you be willing to split your attention on creating a Sandbox experience and a compelling story mode? 
- Would you expect everyone funding the project to be as patient to wait as long as it takes you to fullfill your many promises?
Also viewing the development from a financial angle:
- Could you ensure you will never run out of funds to finish the game even without a lot of early access sales?
- Would it even financially pay off to make due to your promises, if most of your potential players cannot be sold the game at fullprice at the end?

The game seemed to fund its own development largely by the quite substantial early access success. Now times got hard for most studios and everyone really, the game is still in an unfinished state with the suposedly largest chapter, which has to tie every loose end(there are a lot) missing and recent sales are probably too little to cover ongoing costs. Hinterlands solution was releasing a DLC they probably started working on quite a while ago, since they probably realized that paid DLCs would be necessary to fund their future projects. 

So how did realeasing a ealy access DLC for an ealy access game turn out for them you ask? Taking a look at the DLC page about 33% Negative Reviews kind of bad which by steam standarts is enough to turn total review evaluation to ""mixed"" keeping quite some players(mostly talking about myself there really) from buying it. The pretty botched release with bugged loot tables and corrupted saves(appearently) did not make it better.

Analyzing the way this game has been developed and especially financed will have you learn quite some pitfalls that come with ambitious projects, inexperienced teams, using trust as a currency to buy early access sales.

I cannot recommend this game right now, not because it is bad, but because I lost trust into the dev team to actually create the complete full release, which early access is suposed to produce. If they are yet capable to produce said full release, I might actually recommend the game to people who like sandbox/exploration games.

This game pulls me away from all that stress, and strands me in a vast virtual environment with only the wind, trees, and snow to keep me company. It is a beautiful reclusive dream that I lose myself in whenever I walk. This game should be called The Long Walk but that doesn't sound as cool. I am almost never am awake in the dark, due to running a lot and needing a lot of sleep. 

It is worthy of note that I do not play with aggressive animals. That being said, I have been mauled by a bear and moose, shooting them with an arrow apparently overwrites the passive nature, and they aren't scared by it like they would be by a gun (at least in my experience). TLDR, I play pilgrim.

I have been told that without the fear of the animals outside, it's just not the same. and you're right. But I was close to getting a heart attack just due to the stress of fear after one wolf attack and I stopped playing. I went back to the game on pilgrim and i haven't much looked back. It does feel a little like cheating, and running at the bear makes me laugh now, I love his scared noise. 

Also worthy of note is that I refer to the sandbox mode as that is 99.9% of my playtime. I don't have interest in the main storyline after a stressful attempt and re-attempt.

I don't play my games to get stressed out. I am stressed out and want to relax. The distinction between those two has always made me shake my head at how different my play experience probably does not resemble most players play this game and how the space and heady freedom I play with isn't something they even see.

Breathing.
I had so much fun. I felt free. Cold, but free. 
Walking, walking, so much walking. Breathe, walk, breathe, think about what you want to do/find, what your priorities are to survive and what your goals are to thrive. Love yourself by giving yourself the space to breathe, walk, and let the time pass over you. 

The depth of the game is in resource management, but you don't find many resources until you explore new places; finding a base and venturing only to and fro will gain you naught.  So you have to travel to find new things, and you can't bring them all with you because you are encumbered by weight. 

Unlocking weight capacity has been the thrill of the game for me. I sought the technical backpack, I made my own moosehide satchel, and now I've scoured the globe when I heard of a Rifle Holster. I feel like I've done everything there is to do, even make every meal in the new cooking update, but I still want to do more. Goals keep growing in my mind, like stocking the gas station in Coastal Highway. The Community hall in Pleasant Valley has an 880 lb storage container that I've nearly filled.

I wish I could say I didn't ever tank (over burdened & walking slowly) but I did. It is slow. But I never minded a longer walk, I had enough food in my pockets that I needed to eat. Just let the days pass if I need. (I'm at 330 days or will be soon)

The world is full of treasures, or at least places to look for them. They seem to appear randomly but as you get to know the game, you'll see some spawns are in relation to the container, place, or even the distance you traveled to get there (I found more in Mystery Lake Trappers Cabin when I started the game in Forlorn muskeg). 

I will admit I used the wiki and it sped up the finding of many items, and I feel a small shame. But I digress.

Animal death trigger: The killing of the animals is the hardest part for me, or was hard for me when I watched other people break rabbit's necks. I've never had to do that in my whole game. I fished, I used snares, I ate preserved food.
Tip (early game food) I found many a deer carcass in Mystery Lake to harvest guts. Once you cure these you can make the snares and fish lines you need. Find scrap metal and make several fishing hooks. Read books. Keep moving and keep finding the preserved food before it goes bad where it sits, eating rotten food before bed with antibiotics in your pocket.
Last tip: Be very, very careful to not accidentally click ""eat"" while hovering over the raw rabbit meat.

I used a controller for the game, not keyboard and mouse.

[h1]A strongly abbreviated version of the review: [/h1]
This game suffers from massive flaws in it's core design, because of this it does not know what it wants to be, it is spread between being a sandbox survival game, a challenging ""how long can you survive"" game, an immersive atmospheric game, and it ends up failing at all of them for different reasons.

The main problem comes from the very core of the design of this game, it doesn't know if it wants to be a more classical survival/sandbox game like minecraft or subnautica, or if it wants to be a ""how long can you survive?"" challenge, it haphazardly tries to do both and ends up failing catastrophically as a result.

First, how the game fails at being a more classical sandbox with survival elements:
Most of the popular games in the survival genre are in this category (minecraft, subnautica, fallout franchise) are part of this category, it's a formula where there is a lot of different [i] THINGS [/i] that the player can do, and where the survival elements take a backseat.
A good way I devised to see how big of a focus there is on survival elements is just counting the % of real time spent taking care of the various survival meters (food, water, heat, fatigue). In the popular games of this genre, it takes between maybe 5% and 10% of the playtime to feed yourself, in The Long Dark, it's more like 70%.
What makes it even worse is that TLD's mechanics are not very deep, the task of feeding yourself or any other task is always very simple, very straight forward, and VERY repetitive. To make things even worse, in all popular games, the longer you play in a savefile, the more you PROGRESS, which implies that you become more efficient, and need to [i]waste[/i] less time taking care of your various survival meters. But once again The Long Dark takes a completely unexplainable approach, the worst one possible, of making a player LESS efficient the longer he is in a world, because of the finite nature of tools and ressources, something that is a very questionable design decision, but that I don't have time to go into details about here.

In a normal survival game, you spend a little bit of time feeding yourself, and the rest of your time either making better tools that will allow you to spend even less time feeding yourself, or do whatever else you want in the sandbox environment.
In The Long Dark, you spend basically all your time feeding yourself, during which your tools slowly break down, at which point you will have to spend even MORE time feeding yourself (or obtaining water, heat or rest).

The other gaping flaw in TLD is that there is nothing to do. Just compare the game worlds of players who spent 10 thousand days in a minecraft survival world, with the save file of someone who spent 10 thousand days in the long dark.
Any old minecraft world will be filled with wonders, technically impressive automatic farms, beautiful architecture, inventive and fun projects.
An old TLD world will be empty, souless and dead, the only things a player can ""build"" are cursed looking storage depots, where all the items are on the floor, because The Long Dark is like Minecraft's ""Special"" little cousin, who still hasn't added a recipe to craft THE CHEST after 10 years.
There is nothing to do in the long dark, nothing to build, no progression to work towards beyond items that can be aquired fairly early like the bow and animal hide clothing. ""Surviving"" long periods of time is a matter of patience and how much of your time you are willing to waste killing the exact same bear or deer NPC over and over again thousands of times over.
As such The Long Dark just ends up being a busywork/timewasting simulator, the mechanics are shallow, and surviving is TEDIOUS and TIME CONSUMING, not difficult. And this is a massive problem.

For the other half of what this game sometimes try to be, a challenge, something like Tetris, where death is certain, and it's only a matter of how long you last, well The Long Dark fails once again.
Here it fails because death is not certain, surviving is not difficult, just tedious, it's as simple as doing the same repeated actions over and over again, the same 3 or 4 actions, thousands of times over.

So after that what remains to the game? Being an exploration game, or immersive atmospheric game?
Well it also fails at being those, the exploration aspect is strongly harmed by the maps being finite, once you've seen everything, well you've seen everything, and there isn't a lot to see. On top of that most of what you will see is the same assets copy and pasted in different locations, again not that interesting to explore. The only sort of thing that goes in the sense of exploration are the few unique handcrafted location, but the maps have been made as obstacle courses, and you need to spend so much time just gathering ressources to survive, that you travel at a snail's pace across the maps, almost completely killing the exploration aspect by itself.

As for being an immersive experience, a sort of walking simulator, it has great potential to do that, because of it's flawless artstyle, but once again it manages to fail at that, because of low quality graphics, namely for the most part low resolution textures, far too low resolution for the artstyle to compensate, that and other small graphical issue (terrible antialiasing technology, cloned identical trees next to each other, repeating textures on water, half loaded distant terrain) all instantly pull you out of the experience, and kill any immersion that could have existed.

[h1]Conclusion [/h1]
And it's a big shame, the game has a lot of potential, and it would be an enjoyable and succesful game if it only did a few things differently, but as it stands, it's a game that basically fails at everything, it almost fails at being a game, as soon as you manage to stabilize your situation, you realise you could survive forever, then you realise there is nothing to do except surviving, and then you see how shallow the game mechanics are, at which point the vast majority of players stop playing the game and never come back. They have a positive opinion when they leave, they remember it was pretty, or that it made them feel like a lone survivor in the frozen polar regions, but they still leave, and they still don't come back. Because there is nothing to do, and the only things the game offer is just mindless repetitive tedious work. The other category of players, the ""core fanbase"", ""hardcore players"", ""the TLD community"", are those who really want to love the game, but can't, because there is no gameplay to love about the game, so instead every veteran player has to scratch their heads to find artificial rules and challenges in a desperate plea to find some fun in the game. You can see that with custom challenges like ""NOGOA"" (no regeneration, hardest difficulty possible). Again this is because this game offers basically nothing except shallow mechanics, where survival is not difficult or skill based, merely tedious, time consuming and with a heavy luck/RNG component.

With proper guidance I am confident the game could be fixed, but considering how old the game is, and that the team behind it never discovered the issues holding the game back, or if they did, for whatever reason did not fix them, I have very high doubts that the game will ever overcome it's fundamental design issues without external interference.
And so the game is doomed to be fondly remembered yes, but also a game that no one plays and that all new players quickly abandon.

I cannot Support the current leadership at Hinterland Studio. After years of updates the company has said in the past they intend to release 5 ""episodes"" to finish the story mode. I have played many hours and have seen the quality of each episode go further and further downhill, while the time between these game chapters get's longer and longer. I had to reach out to the studio to be able to alter files to the game in order to play the fourth chapter. 

Now with they're recent community developer diary, they say that this DLC they wanted to release over the course of the year will be delayed. They cannot say when they will finish it, and they understand if people want refunds. They cannot guarantee a finished DLC, just like they haven't been able to say when they will finish the main story mode.

I am a huge fan of what the game could have been, and what the studio has done in the past, but after reading many of the recent updates on the state of the game, I cannot recommend anything Hinterland studio puts out for gaming media.

I would not be surprised if the DLC is not finished, and if it does get completed, then there will probably be subpar content laden with glitches and bugs.

Here's my old review, which still stands. 

Here's my original review, which still stands:


The thing that ultimately killed it for me is the crafting and maintenance of the basic tools/weapons you need to survive.

When it comes to things like crafting, in your typical survival/crafting game, you normally can craft your tools from natural resources, and all the things needed to produce the tool/weapon are also natural resources... and I emphasize NATURAL resources... but not quite so in The Long Dark... 

In this game, it is first of all literally impossible to make your own tools/weapons when you are starting out. You can't make your own tools and weapons because you will need SCRAP METAL, but you can't get scrap metal unless you just happen to find some (randomly placed and semi-rare, so you may or may not). But most scrap metal is acquired by breaking down small man-made metal items you find, which you can't do unless you first find those man-made metal items and also happen to have a hacksaw with you. How do you get a hacksaw? You guessed it... you must find where one has been randomly placed, and they are rare.

But suppose that you get lucky and you find a hacksaw right away? And then you find some man-made metal things and break them down for some scrap metal? Surely NOW you can make yourself a makeshift blade, right? 

Hahaha, don't be silly. No, no, no, you can't make a makeshift blade unless you find a hammer with which to pound the scrap metal into shape! Where is the hammer? Oh, it's ALSO hidden somewhere random that you must find like everything else.

Okay. Suppose I stumble upon a hacksaw, then stumble upon some small man-made metal object that I can cut down into scrap metal, and then I stumble onto a hammer. I got all three things. So NOW I can make myself a tool.... right?

Hahaha, don't be silly, because now you must find the FORGE. Where is it? HIDDEN! Go find it! 

Okay, fine, suppose that I somehow find the hacksaw, find the metal objects, make the scrap metal, find the hammer, then find the forge, all before I starve or freeze or die some other way. Surely now I can make one friggin' knife. Just a knife. ONE KNIFE.

Hahaha, no, because you can't make the flame in the forge hot enough unless you have coal with you. It takes a lot of coal, though, and coal is... well... it's randomly hidden out there somewhere. Just a bit here and a bit there. It would take you a while to collect enough. Unless you found the coal mine, wherever that is...?

Do you kinda sorta see what I mean? It just doesn't feel like living or ""surviving"" off the environment to me at the end of the day. It feels more like ""find all of the absolutely vital tools we have randomly hidden somewhere before time runs out"". That's not survival, that's an easter egg hunt. 

In other words, compared to a survival game like Don't Starve where you can basically make the tools you need once you locate the resources, in The Long Dark you often instead must simply FIND the tool (there is no other option), which is more like searching for a treasure before you die than it is like using the elements to survive. It gives the survival a different formula that is interesting but not really to my taste. I mean we're talking about a game where you can literally find a hatchet, and there is a rabbit right in front of you... but can you use the hatchet as a weapon on the rabbit? No. You must throw pebbles at the rabbit. This is ""true survival"", folks.

And people will call this ""difficulty"" and ""challenging"". I mean, maybe, if you want to be that generous. Driving a car that only has three wheels is ""difficult"" and ""challenging"" but that doesn't mean it's good.

I don't think this is true survival or using the elements at all. I think it's a very particular kind of fetish for people who have that fetish. And I'm not one of them.

My verdict:


7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is absolutely worth full price.
6) A solid good game that is worth the full price.
5) A pretty good game that may or may not be quite worth full price.
[h1]4) An alright game, but opinions are likely to strongly differ on the game's value.[/h1]
3) A bit rough, but with some interesting or redeeming qualities. Purchase with care!
2) Quite rough. You may find something to like, but brace yourself. Purchase with care!

It's great... Buy it. 


The Long (Dark) Version:

As raw and unforgiving as it gets. Simple yet  brilliant design is focused on just 
the right things. All it needs now is episode 4 and 5 and we have a classic done.

It's great for people who like to just... get away from daily grind, immerse themselves
and fall into a deep, melancholic state of bliss and familiarity... Just start a fire in a cave during a blizzard... and just sit there and listen... Incredible. So soothing. So comforting (to know that you're not really there)

It gives you a situation:
 Man/Woman vs. nature on a super huge island that's been split into 15 (so far) huge locations
 in a beautiful, Canadian wilderness during winter.

How long will you survive?


 Pros: 
- gameplay
- huge, beautiful world to discover
- amazing music, ambience, voices of protagonists and sounds
- lovely/scary weather effects
- that feeling of a real threat (Permadeath in Survival Mode)
- demanding and unforgiving (mistakes will cost you your life... game over, start over)
- glitches and bugs nearly non-existent 
- Story Mode... Cute addition (Survival Mode is the real game tho)


Cons:
(no cons really... but if I must...)

- bit dated animations (but who cares when the game is so immersive and rewarding)
- no multiplayer but that's actually a good thing (experience wouldn't be the same anymore)
- not enough wild life, natural food types, ways of starting a fire, craftable items and skills
 (because there's just never enough)

Overall 10/10 for me

Random comment from YT:

""In my almost 30 years of gaming, my most memorable moment was when I spent the last week before my 500 day achievement which I wanted to spend at the summit of Timberwolf mountain since that is where my run began, I spent the last week gathering some supplies and meat, the weather took a turn for the worse during the last few days as I was heading to the summit, freezing and a little nervous that this could end badly I was attacked by two wolves, I took refuge in a cave near the summit. I recouped over night and headed to the summit on day 498. I set up my bearskin bedroll on top of the tail section of the plane and made a fire, I cooked up some wolf meat and made some coffee and then a storm rolled in. I thought, great I guess this is how my 500th day is gonna end. It stormed all through day 499 and just as I was gonna sleep and get my achievement the storm passed and the skyes opened to a awesome aurora which went all through the night. So I rolled into my 500th day on top of the plane overlooking Timberwolf mtn enjoying the beautiful sights and sounds of this unbelievable game.

Turning off threaded optimization, turning on vsync, turning off 2 dozen services, uninstalling old games, tweaking settings in nVidia control panel do nothing. Running with a 4080ti with 16gb of ram and the gpu never gets past 20% so this is NOT a hardware issue in the least. I even popped my pc open, dusted the case and all the 4 case fans and the cpu cooling system, removed that applied new thermal gel and it didn't do a thing. You can watch in a performance monitor as the cpu usage goes from 24% down to 3% and the temp spikes instantly when that happens.

Snow is knee deep. And the wind is unforgiving. I am roaming like this for almost an hour. The cold is piercing me. My fingers got numb.

I got lucky. Found some church ruins to cover myself from the wind. Found a matchbox. Fortunately, matches are not wet. Managed to gather some wood and start a fire. Damn, that feels good. There's nothing to eat, though, but I saw some berries out there. I just hope they are not poisonous. Better pick them up fast, looks like the blizzard is coming.

Day 2. Managed to survive the night. But I have to move on. Is it a lighthouse over there? I got there but damn that is cold. Thank God the door isn't locked. It's nice to finally have a roof. Unfortunately, there's almost nothing inside. Some junk food and a baseball cap. Well, better than nothing.

Day 4. Found an old warehouse. A big place. Took me a day to explore it. Found some tools and decent clothes. At least, now I won't freeze instantly. I believe this place can become my base camp. There are wolves around, though, I have to be careful. Barely managed to escape them once.

Day 6. I am getting a hang of it! Made a few runs around the base, found a mine to explore, got me a pistol and 14 bullets. I am a God d★mn survivor! Best of the best!

Day 8.Went to church ruins again but got lost on my way home. It's getting dark. And this damned fog is so thick I can barely see anything! Oh wait, there's the road. What a relief. Almost home.

I thought I heard some kind of mooing from the left. Can't see what it is. Damn! A big shadow appeared out of nowhere and hit me like a bus. A moose! And a big one! But I will teach this bully a lesson. I am the one with the gun after all!

Shot him four times before he hit me again. F★ck, I've never thought these animals are so tough. But I will get him. Another round of shots and another hit from the moose. My leg hurts like hell. I think I am bleeding.

Moron. Thought the gun makes me a big shot. But it looks like that damn thing doesn't do any damage to that giant! Now he is just pissed.

The big shadow is running towards me, again. Shots do not do any difference, again. I got hit and lying on the ground, again. This is the end of me. Another hit, and I am done. There are only two bullets left in my pistol, but they won't make a difference. The damn thing didn't care for the twelve others! Still I am desperately aiming at the fog, saying goodbyes to my friends and family, praying. My hands are shaking. I hear the hooves. There he is! I pull the trigger twice...

And that f★cking moose is suddenly falling down right in front of me. My heart is racing. I look at my right leg. It is bleeding. Shocked, I am tearing my t-shirt to dress the wound. I am dizzy. Can't run, too. But I am alive, God d★mn it! And think of all the meat I can use! I need to get at least something. There's no food home.

I spent an hour but it was worth it. And the fog has disappeared. Now let's go to the warehouse, slowly. The night is almost here. But I am almost home. There's the car at the entrance. Now just a few more steps...

A damned wolf is here! Probably smelled the blood — God knows, there's almost nothing left in me. I have to reach the door before he attacks. I won't survive it. I am slowly backing away. 'Good doggy'. He's crawling after me. His eyes are glowing. And he is getting closer. He will attack any second! I have to run to the door, it's round the corner, I can make it! Almost there...

Another wolf was waiting for me at the door. 'Welcome home, boy', he said silently. 'I see you brought us meat'.",1705265667,1706442396,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I suppose I shall give a background on the person I am so you can understand my point of view and how my bias will affect the said review, at the end of the day everything in life is subjective to every individual person, 
to me, the long dark is my ""cabin in the woods"" It is a lifestyle I'm sure many men have thought about and wanted for a long time, for one i am someone who has never committed to this ""aspiration"" of mine, yet the long dark allows me to face the hardship this lifestyle would actually involve, given the fact you wouldn't be hunted religiously by the indigenous wildlife in the area, 
as I have grown up playing this game since it first came out i have seen its progress and in that time so to have i progressed, i was 17, only developing my mental state and figuring things out, about what life is and my own moral qualms, the long dark to me then was an escape, and that escape was what i needed when i was young, it allowed me to face a certain hardship i would never actually be put through in the comfort of my parents home, it also allowed me to understand the wilderness, that heck it is actually beautiful, that sometimes stepping outside and looking at nature was something i needed in my life instead of sitting at home in my little hobbit cave playing counter strike and rust for days on end, it was a reminder that humans and people needed to touch grass and feel nature, maybe in a spiritual sense its calmed by soul? who knows at this point im probably rambling .
Now that I'm 23, The Long Dark has dropped its far territories DLC and I'm about to hop into it again, this time I'm going in with the mentality to survive but still enjoy, explore, and ponder the many questions I have about my somewhat lingering youth and quite possibly my 1/4 life crisis, that maybe many of us can also feel and experience, just for me its all going to be done while surrounded by a beautiful snowy backdrop that doesn't physically make me cold to the bone.
all and all from a review perspective i haven't garnered the most impressive achievements in this game like some of the die-hard fans but the takeaway i have gotten from this game is far more than an achievement, its been a mental clarity, its helped me reconnect with nature, its also help me figure myself out, when you look at a sunset in the long dark its like looking at art, you know another day is progressing and you made it, another day you survived, in a world so chaotic both figuratively and metaphorically this game and its sandbox will bring you a level of peace few can give you  while also testing your will power, if you give this game a go, go in blind and try and experience it all by yourself and keep an open mind when you do, i can tell you, you wont regret this purchase",1706311501,1706311501,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall, a fantastic game that offers many hours of enjoyment that can be tuned to your play style. Highly recommend. Looking forward to Episode 5.

edit: Less enthusiastic since Wintermute Episode 5 release has been put off. It's a shame the devs have cornered themselves into paid DLC content while an unfinished, otherwise well-made Story Mode sits unfinished across all platforms.

For example, sometimes the player can't even go across small obstacles because he can't jump.

It is one thing that everything costs time to do and has to be chosen wisely. But disassembling a crate to create firewood from it takes one hour in-game-time. Because everything you do takes way too much time in the game, the time goes by too fast and suddenly you sit completely in the darkness just because you disassembled a few crates or boxes to gain some firewood.

The game is unflexible. If you go to sleep then you can easily starve to death or die of thirst during sleep instead of waking up or at least giving you some kind of warning before that happens.

Even if you are inside a building you can easily starve to death or die from Hyperthermia while checking what clothes you have or because you are evaluating your inventory for a little too long time. 

Just searching and looting a small building with a few small rooms takes a lot of in-game-time (consuming the user's life resources excessively) even though it was just a few minutes in reality (real out-of-game playing time)

Update
-------------

Made it to the end of chapter 3 in Wintermute
I am hooked! I absolutely adore the atmosphere in this game... 

I feel like a lot of single player survival games don't hook me quite like this one. I'm happy to say that I'm glad I took a chance and purchased this on a whim during the sale.

Without spoilers, I have thoroughly enjoyed my time spent doing all of the side quests and finding the tall tale mysteries throughout the 3rd chapter. I didn't quite get that same feeling in chapter 2... But I can see how some players might complain for the sheer amount of walking, it's not too bad for me... but I do wish there was a sled or something similar that could get you going down hills. (Please, do not put fast travel between checkpoints!)  I found a PERFECT spot to sled in chapter 3 between the legendary fishing spot and the community center.. It made me sad, but maybe I haven't found one yet? Not sure. I was bummed when I got to the top of the hill and couldn't slide down! A sled, at the cost of weight (~15 kg?), could be a very fun idea!


The game rewards you at a good pace and the writing is decent enough that I'm curious to know what happens next...  My girl really likes watching me play it and uncovering the various mysteries. We are at a point now where I cannot continue playing it alone x.x  She loves it too!

Other comments:

I am very sad to hear that chapter 5 of Wintermute is not out yet :S  But, also glad there is a slated release for late 2024. I am considering slowing my progress or just pushing through and trying out the different survival mode/tales from the far territories versions of the game while I wait. Tough choice.

Maybe some crunch is necessary if you actually care about your players, so people aren't waiting 10 years for you to complete your game. And maybe not banning everyone who disagrees with the game's glacial update pace would help with feigning you care about the playerbase.

Edit: The story still sucks in 2021, episode 3 has you play as a woman that isn't the same character you play in every other episode, and 4 doesn't let you shoot the only three convicts in the prison holding a guy hostage that don't have guns even though your character has no problem with killing as evidenced by the convict he killed in the first episode.

The story mode finally came out, and it's completely boring trash, the title of this game is what you can expect, long boring treks through the dark with nothing happening.
As soon as you get a coat on that keeps you from instantly dropping to -50 below zero the game's just a boring trek to harvest cat tails.

You take the role of a albino Fatts Mcgee, Enjoy the breathtaking experience of running out of energy and having to sleep 10 hours every three minutes, meanwhile, you go from fully fed to starving within 20 minutes.
Wolves and bears? Yeah, despite the love for ""Realism"" the devs made it so a lone wolf will charge a fully grown human and CONTINUE after getting a hatchet to the side of its neck. Bears? They will charge at you from across a football field if you look at them. Why? A insane ""reverse polarity"" plot device that would have no effect on animals whatsoever in real life either.

Part one of the storymode is the least boring of the two. The back tracking is less tedious because there's places to enter and scavenge for the daily 20,000 calories you need as a 600 pound obese man. Be careful not to walk down a slightly steep hill or your character might rocket off the geometry and break both his legs and arms at the same time from a three foot drop However, part two of the storymode is absolute forced trash, I couldn't get through it without falling asleep at the keyboard. You're first tasked with walking from one end of the map, to another, then back for a short cutscene.

Your next task is walking for a grueling 1 hour real time along railroad tracks with absolutely nothing intresting happening, to get something almost cool to happen and your first weapon of the game, a hunting rifle. Your character, no matter his status, seems to have a severe case of parkinsons, and can not hold the rifle steady, instead deciding to swing it wildly as if it were a rattle. 

Now here is where my boredom became unbearable... Once you make the arduous journey back across the railroad tracks, another boring backtracking sequence, you're tasked with learning how to survive. Your first survival learning experience is.... repairing clothing. Something you already know how to do, and the game gives you 5000 unneeded sewing kits, so you should already have max quality wool coats. How they thought this would be a mindblowing new technique, I don't know. 

At this point I realized I would need to complete at least three to four boring, long, fetch quest missions, and make the long, boring, journey back, while stopping to eat fifteen deer carcasses on the way, instead of just killing the bear with the rifle and perfectly good gear I had and continue the story, instead of drawing out the boring uneventful story in hopes of deceiving people that it was worth the years waiting, and I had a major brain anyuerism and went into a coma.

Combine this with the heavy censoring of negativity and reviews the devs did in the beta stage (that lasted for years) and the incredibly boring, backtrack fest of the incompleted story that took them 3 years to create, and the dialogue isn't even fully voice acted, and I will suggestyou stay far, far away from this trash.",1460079285,1705972317,False,6,2,0.393229395151138306,8,True,False,False

Every minute feels like it matters and the game often boils down to struggling with simple decisions. Can I go hunting? Is the weather good enough, or will I freeze? Maybe I should be stocking up on wood for the fire so I don't freeze indoors? But I need food... Maybe if I explore and hope to find homes I could maybe find warmer clothes? 

Each step you take, each match you light, each swig of water feels so important and precious. That feeling, a feeling of desperation, doubt but most importantly hope is what makes a survival game great. And this game is just an endless supply of it.

But the game is not flawless either. With being such a good survival game, it can often feel a bit like a drag. Be prepared for a lot of walking. Settlements can be far apart and you may need to walk long distances. But prepping for the journey and making sure you can survive it is part of the fun IMO. Still, it can be a turn off for some survival players who are more used to quicker progression. And progression in this game is very slow. 

Some of the better craft-able gear in this game requires you to prepare materials and the prep can take several in-game days and often it feels too long. Crafting a simple bow isn't even easy, it can take a few in-game days to do so even when you know what you're looking for.

But it's not a traditional survival game in the sense that you NEED a bow or a knife or a gun. You don't need these things, but they do improve the experience a lot. So not being able to get them right away isn't a bad thing. You just need to resort to other methods of finding food. Like throwing stones found on the ground at rabbits to knock them out and then grab them. Ammo for guns is rare and finding a gun is even rarer. 

Your main enemy, though, cannot be killed with a bow, a knife or a gun. For your main antagonist is the weather.. The cold is brutal and being outside for too long early on in the game is not going to work. You need shelter, and you need materials for fire. You need warm clothes, and then you start to worry about food and water.

The map is huge and there's plenty of exploration to be had in the later game too. Just, don't get lost.",1548173393,1705934092,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To this day, The Long Dark masterfully unites concepts of a lonely winterized survival atmosphere and somewhat post-apocalyptic premise with wondrous immersion and art direction, and reliable replay-ability with the survival mode and ever expanding map + expansions.

For pros, The Long Dark's entire identity is meticulously crafted with excellent storytelling in found every corner of the Great Bear Island regions, beautiful weather with the occasional auroras (which can make for pretty screenshots) cog-turning gameplay, (given there's elements of inventory management and strategy when you play on harder difficulties) map design, and music that add so much flavor to the immersion. On top of that, the survival mode is perma-death, giving the player a sense of risk (or perhaps reward) whenever you make a decision or trek somewhere new.

The story mode, also referred to as Wintermute, (while, not entirely complete as of January 2024) is beautifully done and is definitely a treat to sink a couple hours into. The main premise is the tale of a plane pilot and his ex-wife finding themselves stranded in the Canadian wilderness following a geomagnetic disaster. Despite the positives of the Wintermute, some segments of it can get rather stale as there's a couple fetch-quests that crop up every now and then.

As for cons, The Long Dark (nearing the late game in survival mode) can get rather boring if you're settled in one place, as you can plant yourself in a locale with re-spawning resources, such as an ice-fishing hut or deer spawn, and never go hungry or thirsty as your skills in hunting, fishing, mending, etc grow to expert levels with their insane benefits. However, these issues can usually be mitigated with the custom or Interloper modes, which will throw the harshness of the game at you at full force and leave you struggling if you so choose.
The game also includes a great deal of 'Walking Simulator', especially if you are encumbered with gear in the survival mode. However with the DLC, there are additions such as the travois that allow you to transport more gear faster, as well as base game content such as the hiking backpack and moose-hide satchel.

All in all, this game has a special place in my heart, and if you ever see it or its DLC on sale in the near future, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing it.

I spotted two deer past my field barns and I only had so many rifle shots left. I thought I lined up a kill shot and BANG! it runs away. DANG! Only bleeding out. I follow the blood trail with no avail. Slipping on a slope during my tracking injuring my ankle. It's a good thing I had some bandages.

I end up at the back of the church  re-orienting myself. I keep walking down the path and come across a frozen pond with a moose in the distance. I walk around ending up on the opposite side of the pond. Collecting sticks and trying my hand at getting some rabbit. Then that's when I look over and see it's glitched out. Hanging in the air not moving. 

So of course I go walking up to it thinking I'm safe and nope screw that. It decided to come out of its coma and charged me while I tried to run away and curb stomped me and broke my ribs. I black out for a minute and barely crawl away along the rock face. 

I was getting cold as the wind was picking up. Luckily for me the wind was on my back. 

 I found a crease in between the rock ledge at the end of the pond. I painstakingly built a fire with the little sticks I had. Taking some of my wet clothes off, taking pain meds and bandaged my Injuries.

Of course when I went on this trek I forgot a pot or a can as I came from my safe house. And all I wanted was a dear xD.

While I was looking through my pack the weather turned out for the worst! A friggin blizzard! This is what I needed right?

 I can't see anything outside of the little crack I huddled up in. In the moose attack my bed roll was destroyed and damaged so I couldn't use it and get a little rest to get some health back. 

So here I am huddled in this rock crack broken ribs, wet cloths and a friggin Blizzard. So I had to wait for my clothes to dry huddled up to this pathetic stick fire. 

The time was going down on the fire and I had to get some more wood or else I may not survive the weather. So I limp my broken ass out and find some wood and sticks. Trying not to go far as I couldn't see five feet behind me. 

I head back, mind you it's whiteout conditions. and of course the wind changed and blew out my fire when I got back. And I couldn't light a new one because of the wind and I didn't have any kindling or lighter fluid.

So I traverse the white out picking up sticks as I go so I can make another fire. I huddled up to another rock opposite of the wind and built another fire until the weather cleared up. 

At this time it's dark and just a light flurry. Almost surreal and peaceful. My sleep meter is going down pretty good at this point. My broken ribs can hardly carry the stuff in my backpack now. 

Luckily I brought a lantern with me. For a second I lost my bearings and went the wrong way but I saw a bent over tree I remember passing by coming this way.

I finally limped my ass back to a Seacan and luckily there were beds. but the weather turned on me again! Luckily there were some supplies in the sea can for me to use up. I made it back to my cabin with 120hrs of rest I needed to do.

It was the most intense experience I had trying to survive this long dark. But I did it even with my broken body and almost my spirit.

I also prefer a game without zombies or enemies, I just want a nice relaxing game. There are wolves and bears but you can adjust the settings so that  you never have to interact with them. I do believe there are some exciting opportunities for the game to be more engaging.

While Bear Island offers a challenging environment, it would be intersting to explore other climates, such as a desert or rainforest. This could add a new layer of complexity to the survival experience and provide players with fresh challenges.

Building a custom home base or cabin could be a fantastic feature. Allowing players to create their safe haven and decorate it according to their preferences.

Also, introducing in-game companions like dogs or horses. Dogs could help with tracking, hunting, and protection, while horses could provide faster travel, making exploration more efficient and enjoyable.

Snow is knee deep. And the wind is unforgiving. I am roaming like this for almost an hour. The cold is piercing me. My fingers got numb.

I got lucky. Found some church ruins to cover myself from the wind. Found a matchbox. Fortunately, matches are not wet. Managed to gather some wood and start a fire. Damn, that feels good. There's nothing to eat, though, but I saw some berries out there. I just hope they are not poisonous. Better pick them up fast, looks like the blizzard is coming.

Day 2. Managed to survive the night. But I have to move on. Is it a lighthouse over there? I got there but damn that is cold. Thank God the door isn't locked. It's nice to finally have a roof. Unfortunately, there's almost nothing inside. Some junk food and a baseball cap. Well, better than nothing.

Day 4. Found an old warehouse. A big place. Took me a day to explore it. Found some tools and decent clothes. At least, now I won't freeze instantly. I believe this place can become my base camp. There are wolves around, though, I have to be careful. Barely managed to escape them once.

Day 6. I am getting a hang of it! Made a few runs around the base, found a mine to explore, got me a pistol and 14 bullets. I am a God d★mn survivor! Best of the best!

Day 8.Went to church ruins again but got lost on my way home. It's getting dark. And this damned fog is so thick I can barely see anything! Oh wait, there's the road. What a relief. Almost home.

I thought I heard some kind of mooing from the left. Can't see what it is. Damn! A big shadow appeared out of nowhere and hit me like a bus. A moose! And a big one! But I will teach this bully a lesson. I am the one with the gun after all!

Shot him four times before he hit me again. F★ck, I've never thought these animals are so tough. But I will get him. Another round of shots and another hit from the moose. My leg hurts like hell. I think I am bleeding.

Moron. Thought the gun makes me a big shot. But it looks like that damn thing doesn't do any damage to that giant! Now he is just pissed.

The big shadow is running towards me, again. Shots do not do any difference, again. I got hit and lying on the ground, again. This is the end of me. Another hit, and I am done. There are only two bullets left in my pistol, but they won't make a difference. The damn thing didn't care for the twelve others! Still I am desperately aiming at the fog, saying goodbyes to my friends and family, praying. My hands are shaking. I hear the hooves. There he is! I pull the trigger twice...

And that f★cking moose is suddenly falling down right in front of me. My heart is racing. I look at my right leg. It is bleeding. Shocked, I am tearing my t-shirt to dress the wound. I am dizzy. Can't run, too. But I am alive, God d★mn it! And think of all the meat I can use! I need to get at least something. There's no food home.

I spent an hour but it was worth it. And the fog has disappeared. Now let's go to the warehouse, slowly. The night is almost here. But I am almost home. There's the car at the entrance. Now just a few more steps...

A damned wolf is here! Probably smelled the blood — God knows, there's almost nothing left in me. I have to reach the door before he attacks. I won't survive it. I am slowly backing away. 'Good doggy'. He's crawling after me. His eyes are glowing. And he is getting closer. He will attack any second! I have to run to the door, it's round the corner, I can make it! Almost there...

Another wolf was waiting for me at the door. 'Welcome home, boy', he said silently. 'I see you brought us meat'.",1703888445,1705349974,True,49,9,0.688465476036071777,4,True,False,False

This game can be very intense but also at times very intriguing and very captivating. This game makes you wonder what would happen if something like this happened to you. I always like to play this game in the winter.
 I feel like that’s the perfect time to play it.. captures the winter vibes. 

I always catch myself wanting to drink some hot chocolate Tea or coffee and Bundle up while playing this game also, you’re always finding grape soda makes me want grape soda. I’m just throwing that out there!!

The intensity of trying to keep moving without freezing to death is very intense, making sure that you don’t run into wolves, bears or moose that might try to kill you and trying to find resources To survival it’s a really compelling and interesting game. I Highly recommend if you’re looking for a survival game or a game at throws you in a different scenario For a long time this game was one of the main I had in the beginning of when I joined steam it has a special place to me.

I find trying to move to different towns, very difficult and very challenging.

It does something that very few games do well: emergent gameplay. It allows gripping stories to occur naturally, driven by competing pressures on the player of (in this case) weather, hunger, wild animals, and getting lost. 

In my first playthrough I almost died but miraculously survived several times in the first few days, then managed to find reasonable shelter. A week or so later, after finding a gun, I stalked some deer in freezing cold, and through hypothermia, hunger, and exhaustion I managed to bring one down with my first shot. I was so pumped I had to pause the game and walk away for a minute. I came back and then almost killed myself trying to process the carcass in the cold. In that playthrough I kept going for another 200 days before dying of overconfidence in my bearskin sleeping roll.

The game is absolutely beautiful. The art style is reminiscent of a Group of Seven painting (a group of well known Canadian landscape artists). Sunsets and aurora can be stunning, and the way the snow swirls in a blizzard is mesmerizing (and can cause you to get lost pretty quick). I play on a 3440x1440 curved monitor (with good true black) in a dark room, and it's completely immersive. Sound design is also excellent, with subtle cues that can give warning of weather changes, or signs of a nearby carcass. Pay attention to what the crows are telling you.

The devs put a lot of thought into balancing playability with realism, and I think they did a great job. They are also supportive. One update caused my survivor to load in underneath terrain. They took my savefile and fixed it for me.

The gameplay cycle (for me, at least) typically involves entering an area, finding a good central base shelter, and then exploring the region to bring all the gear and food to the central location. Taking down a bear or moose might become an objective at some point. Permadeath makes careful planning key. Gradually your gear and skills get better - but that encourages you to take more risks.

The world is lonely, desolate, dangerous, but peaceful. I live in Canada and have worked in the back country of British Columbia a lot, including in winter, and it's just like that: lonely, desolate, dangerous, yet unbelievably peaceful.

for the people who bought or are buying the ""DLC"" (wintermute), it's clearly not finished based on the overwhelming amount of simpletons complaining about it in the reviews and the constant dev updates it's been givin over the past 6-7 years... we still have one episode to come before the story (DLC) is at it's completion. i for one hate being left on cliffhangers, however..... the survival is very fleshed out, and even adjustable to your liking. the DLC provides a mountain of content that you wouldn't get if you didn't buy the DLC with it, like acorns (foragable coffee), armor, a flask, and now a new area (or more idk). the story is good tell the 3rd chapter, the 4th is pretty tough if you're inexperienced with the jail area (like i was) but even that one was alright. haven't played the 5th chapter yet (the 4th part that was just released not too long ago) so i'm not going to give input on it tell the 5th is out and i play through the story in it's entirety.

based off of this info i'll rate it as such so everyone can get a proper understanding of everything the game has to offer...
10/10 survival
from very challenging to a walk in the park, you make your own journey based on the location you start in, where you base up at, and how you changed the games difficulty settings when you made the playthrough. lots of very specific health and mental things you have to keep in mind like infections, frostbite, and cabin fever.
8/10 story (so far)
[spoilers btw, skip to the next rating if you don't want ACTUAL spoilers]
chapter one 
was very straight forward and if you know what you're ganna need to stockpile beforehand, it's a 2 in game day endever, a very easy and great to start in area with lots of resources (mainly man made food products like canned goods and toilet water) and lots of rabbits and few wolves, along with some great story telling.
chapter 2 was much more in depth. a bear attacks you and follows you around as you traverse about 4-6 maps worth of area to craft something to kill the bear in a one on one fashion which can be intense to do. then you have to go to the dam but get caught and brought to the jail (which is picked back up in chapter 4)
chapter 3 you play as the female character. this chapter tests your endurance and makes you feel pressed for time almost throughout the entirety of the chapter. your goal is to collect (i think 5) people and bring each one of them to the recovery camp and then treat them. by this point you need a LOT of food and water to reach each one and survive the journey each time which is quite challenging when each trips shortest way to go is lined with tough encounters (timberwolf packs and a bear). there are however, bunkers that give a crazy amount of supplies that makes it a lot easier.
chapter 4 was the jail and you switch back the guy again. you start with nothing in a seriously difficult area and you have to hide your loot every time you go back to the jail or the criminals will take everything from you. the area is FILLED with wolves and in my experience at least... mostly had blizzards every day which made my experience WAY harder than it should have been but i still had fun with the challenge.
in EACH AND EVERY CHAPTER there are side missions you can do. some give neat rewards but some are lore related. but all are challenging and interesting to do so i highly recommend doing some when you can.
6/10 combat
this one is hard to judge because you're mainly hoping for instakills, headshots, and being 100% certain you wont die from the encounter. bears are a great example of this... a headshot with a bow doesn't guarantee a 1 hit kill, but there is an (i think) in game 30 minute bleed out timer active instead. this makes you have to track down your kills at times which adds an element to the game most don't. but the bear might not run away if hit so you need to have a hit and run tactic so you can survive the encounter unscathed. the reason for the low(ish) rating is because there's low amounts of skill involved in hunting. most of the time the only skill you need is the first shot and that's about it. just feels a bit low effort but i do like the rest of it sooo.
8/10 challenges and traits
there is a roguelite/like (don't know which) element to the survival part of this game where you have to complete challenges/tasks to unlock useful passives for new characters. for instance... making 500 fires gives you a trait that allows you to start at level 3 firemaking (no longer need tender to start fires and fire wood and firestarters give higher chances at making a fire) or surviving 10 days in blizzards unlocks you the ability to (i think) walk faster in them, and drinking 500 coffees and teas will give you one that makes them last a bit longer. overall they are interesting but most of them are VERY grindy to get. the challenges are interesting but not needed because the challenges don't provide anything but are still fun to do, but some are VERY hard to do and require a LOT of map knowledge and loot knowledge that pretty much requires you to plan ahead of time and know where a lot of loot will spawn which makes them feel more like a chore rather than a challenge.
3/10 the wait
most of peoples complaints are pretty pathetic. the main complaint is that it's not finished and that's about it. listen... the devs are releasing some good content even if it's slow as all hell. even if it's a wait, the game is great overall and you can pump some hours into one character, scavenging the world and collecting everything as you do so. there isn't some stupid ass leveling tree or gear tree where you have to get all of a specific type of armor or weapon setup to advance, or a base building deal where you have to defend it and/or gather resources to upgrade it. you play to survive and that's the name of the game, FUCKING SURVIVAL. the devs made this game, not for the damned story but for the survival. they're adding more to survival WHILE making a story. if your main complaint is the wait, get over yourself because you need to realize that THAT is the only complaint you're giving here and that's the beautiful thing about this game. that's peoples main complaint. i get the frustration but look at it in this way and chill out because this has been the way they're wanting to make the game. the more they add to the game, the more they'll have to add to the REST of the game. like oak trees or the tea plant that removes food poisoning. they have to decide where each thing will spawn at and why because it has to make some sense so that the players can find patterns. adding more maps to the game takes longer than adding new stuff, but the more maps they add will make balancing it harder and make it take longer

ending this. i LOVE this game and it's very upfront nature towards survival. you can chose to opt out of guns and most man made equipment like knives and hatchets, which will force you to craft your own. you have to work for your food, weather that'd be from scavenging or from hunting, you have to work for it, it's not just given to you because you're a good boy. upgrading your gear is a challenge too because you have to craft most of it yourself which again... you have to work for each piece and dry them and make them into workable resources. down to the arrows, you have to work to make. wolf encounters are a bit janky but everything about this game is very well made and has a lot of thought put into it. i personally think this game is WELL worth the 40 dollars. just remember that this is still cheaper compared to a triple A game that has millions if not billions put into it with tens of thousands of hours put into making it, but has just as much if not more heart put into it compared. overall....... 10/10 game with a TON of replayability to boot",1705246743,1705246743,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I love to play this game all the time give me a good feeling, Oh and also the bear challenge scard the hell outa me.” Feb 16th 2017. I was much younger when I had reviewed this game originally. 

I think this game is truly one of a kind, the art style, game mechanics and logic to play this game is not like any other, you really need to learn how to properly play this game and it’s not like you can really transfer this knowledge over to other games or use other games knowledge. The developers are also very dedicated workers to their game. They treat this game like their child. I’m able to appreciate this game even more being that I’m Canadian and this takes place in Canada. I’m nowhere near as experienced as some of the other people that have over 1000 days survived etc.. but that doesn’t mean anything. I’ve owned this game on my pc for awhile but always primarily played on my Xbox, even on my switch and adding up the time I probably have about 150 hours maybe.. It’s a great game to have on all your consoles, a fun way to pass time. This game is pretty unforgiving, even on the easy modes, but don’t let that discourage you from playing, give it a chance. Watch videos and learn tricks on how to play. So yeah overall it’s a great game and I highly highly recommend it.

Don't come for me, neck-beards!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Different players like different things. If you want the story, it isn't done, and that's all anyone ever bitches about if they're bitching at all. IMO the story is boring and doesn't make any sense -- why are there a bunch of people on this island that's supposed to be empty after an apocalyptic geothermal disaster? Like?????????????

Survival is where it's at. Make your own damn story, it'll make more sense!!!

As for the Far Territory, I guess I am glad that it exists, as I love trying out new regions, though it seems like the more they add the more outlandish it is becoming. Surely Great Bear Island isn't THAT fucking big. Would have made more sense if it was a neighboring island you could see off in the distance, or something along those lines. I explored the first TFTFT region and was done with it; never even tried the tales radio thing, because I was too anxious to get on to the next region.

At the time, I'd played the game about 200 hours give or take.  I died because of a game mechanic I didn't agree with called CABIN FEVER.   When you encounter it for the first time you won't get it.  In fact, you'll think I'm just a big wuss.  I still think CABIN FEVER is dumb as nails as a game mechanic, but I accept it at this point.  It's part of the game.  What does matter is that this game sucked me in.  I'm literally writing this review because I had the luxury of playing a game for more than 200 hours.  Doing the math, and especially considering I bought this game early access, I paid 20 cents an hour.  How amazing is that for a form of entertainment.

I love this game.  I hate this game.  It's ridiculously hard because you can survive a hundred days and think you have gotten over the worst of it...and then a bear kicks your ass, and while you bandaging up, a wolf decides your ass is tasty.

Don't play this game on any difficulty exceeding""Pilgrim"" unless you are willing to conceive a child, nurture that child, watch it go out into the world, and then watch it die a horrible death.  The Long Dark is a game that tests your ability to forgive and let go.  Is it a fun journey?  You bet your ass it is.  

I think I'm done at this point, 200+ hours in.  I can't much endure another painful death.  If history tells me anything though is that I will circle back on this game a year or so from now.  My failure fatigue can only last so long.

You will have many memorable experiences in this game that may sound boring on paper but are quite exhilarating in the game (e.g. wandering through the woods at night during a blizzard with nothing to start a fire, nothing to eat, and no idea where you're going). You'll avoid hostile wildlife, spend plenty of time looting and crafting, build cozy bases, and venture outside in harsh conditions looking for resources to prolong your survival.

Expect many interesting regions to explore, fun achievements to hunt, in-game challenges to tackle, ""feats"" to unlock for permanent benefits, a story mode offering 100+ hours of playtime, and an excellent DLC that adds a lot of new content. Most importantly, this is all wrapped up in a gameplay loop that is easy to learn, hard to master, and incredibly addictive.

Three caveats:
- There is permadeath in the survival mode of this game, which might be a turn off for some (there is a way to cheese it, though).
- The story mode is currently incomplete, with 4 episodes out of 5 available.
- Modding is basically a sin in this game. The developers have a very clear vision of what they want this game to be, and outside of a custom sandbox mode that lets you tweak settings (at the cost of feat progress), don't expect a lot of wiggle room.

This game still enjoys semi-regular patches and new content ten years after launch. The developers have a wonderful culture of caring for their employees and communicating with the playerbase, even if they don't make perfect decisions all the time.

TLDR: Long Dark is an entirely unique, must-play game for fans of the survival genre. It is easily the best survival game I have played, and I expect I will be enjoying it on and off for literally decades to come.

Or being eaten by wolves, or dying of infection, or accidentally walking off a cliff during an unexpected blizzard, or falling through the ice. There's a lot of ways to die in The Long Dark, but it never feels unfair since you can learn from mistakes and avoid them in your next run. The difficulty is completely customizable if you don't care about achievements, so if you don't like how a game mechanic works you can probably change it. 

There's no base building or other ways to really make your character completely safe within the game world, so if you're primarily interested in that aspect you would want to steer clear. This is more of a slow, hardcore survival experience that rewards you for not staying put and exploring and interacting with the world as much as possible.

The fact on hardcore mode the food decays way too quickly. example a tin of beans in a shack would last years not to mention a few other items and real world scenarios. It's those attention to details that have put me off this masterpiece but I am nearly at 200 hours game play!

This game isn’t just a walking simulator like some people explain it... It’s a full on survive the minus temperatures, while keeping yourself warm, fed and watered and away from bears and wolves kinda simulator. 

This game has the ability to allow you to play in non hostile animal world, but what fun would that be? Seriously? 

None of that passive crap interests me in the slightest. I want full on hardcore mode experience, the type where if you die you’ll have to start right back at the beginning with absolutely nothing and try again…that’s why I love this game!

For me, when games give you the ability to play in this mode, it really gets my juices flowing. It brings on a bit of OCD like thinking properly, taking away your ability “I best save the game in case things don’t work out scenario” …. not with this game… mess up and its all over! 

You see, the save progress on this game is activated at the right times, example you sleep, or leave a cabin… or eat a can of beans… so you can be sure if you have to switch your computer off in the real world you’ll be OK. 

Another cool element, the weather system... It can be very very cruel, but beautiful! 
Example; if a snow blizzard happens right in front of you while you’re walking to the next place of interest, the best thing to do in this situation Is to dig a snow pit and rest until it passes.

But you didn’t take that much survival stuff with you on this trip because it was only a short walk… so digging a makeshift bed pit under the snow is not on your ability list… so you’ll want to carry on because you know it’s only a few minutes away… 

Now the temperature has dropped to -60 degrees in a matter of seconds and idiot you left your very warm but heavy home made jacket which I will add  took you a week to create using rare dead wolf pelts at your last temporary home you made..  those same wolf pelts that took about 4 days to cure in your log cabin….

So now your walking slowly because your fatigued with the wind power pushing against you, your temperature has dropped to nothing, your stamina has dropped off the scale, and your character is shivering and dying right in front of you…you can see everything bad happening, you know what to do but you cant do it… frustrating isn’t the word…

so you keep on walking, pushing on but you have to look at the floor and use things like rocks or plants as a reference point…you think you’re walking to the place you want to be at, and before you know it you see a similar group of rocks with your own footprints in front of them… It turns out you are miles away from where you should be….and you’ve just walked around in a big massive circle… 

your character is at deaths door.. The screen Is starting to go black even though its day time and your sub-woofer is alerting you to your fading slowing heart beat….
and before you know it, you hear a growl, you hear a wolf running towards you, but you can’t see or hear which direction its coming from…. 

“you fell into the long dark” ……. which I must add in 4K ultra-high detail in surround sound is frustrating yet bloody marvellous…

The atmosphere really brings on the immersion for me, to the point you think your cold in real life. I’m serious! It’s beautifully executed and the detail in this game is simply amazing.
There is lots of things I love about this game, the other one is in sandbox mode, where you can start from scratch on the hardest level of difficulty…

It’s insanely difficult to stay alive. And also, you’ll be put in a random area on the map, this could be anywhere on any of the maps… (There is lots of them) so the first half hour your trying to work out exactly where you are and how you can stay alive…there’s so many places to explore, so many worlds, so many decisions to make….

Will you make the right one?

There’s only so much you can carry in your rucksack, and one element I love about this game is if you’re lucky enough to find a gun or craft a bow and arrow you start to realise you can’t carry that much more stuff… so you end up having to make caches of stuff and stash them some place. But as you get tired your ability to carry lots of weight drops… but if you’re well feed that shouldn’t be an issue… 

I can’t shut up, I can't say anything negative about this game apart from the food decay element.

Like I said at the start, I have been playing this game since it was previously developed, back then story mode wasn’t an option, it wasn't available. The only game mode was sandbox mode and that's what I prefer playing...

I have played the missions that were later added to the game, (story mode) and its marvellous and beautiful and has a fantastic written story, with some attachable emotional NPCs.... 

If you like a challenge and beautiful graphics, looting buildings, corpses trying to keep alive, finding the right clothes, use at the right time, day turning to night, being hunted by bears and stuff..... you will love this game!!

+more will follow and add to this review with grammar / more updates on review on story mode.

Seriously, everyone should own this game if they like survival games!

I rate this game 4 out of 5 and would give 5 if the food decay was more accurate. Please DO NOT copy or paste any part of this review or post it on any website without getting permission from me first.",1558355774,1704545613,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really REALLY don't like the campaign, or ""story"" so i wont say anything more about it than imho it's a waste of time considering how the sandbox could be improved with the time and effort. I'm the wrong person to judge this however, since i hate linear games altogether, just not my cup of tea.

Sandbox is the way to go for me. The game creates pretty good atmosphere despite its graphics being what they are. I'm not saying they're bad, they're just a bit cartoonish. This is fine.
They've really succeeded in hiding houses and spots into treetops and dips on the ground so surviving on harder difficulties without prior knowledge is a challenge.

There are a few things that really grind my gears, these are more of a quality of life, rather than gameplay or game related. im not gonna go over all of them but for example:
Breaking furniture takes WAY too much time. Since im in a post apocalyptic world, i do not give a f**k if i break something, unless its a window in an otherwise warm house. Breaking a chair does NOT take 45minutes. Gonna slam that shit into thousand pieces in less than 5minutes. Some of these things could use an overhaul. 
I should be able to make a fire wherever the damn i please. If I'm on the verge of death, i WILL make it indoors, maybe i'll suffocate if i sleep or stay too long? Maybe i'll burn the whole house down? It makes no difference if I'm on the cusp of life and death, atleast I'll die warm.
Yeah I'm aware it's a game. Yeah I'm aware that there's many things I wouldn't be able to do that are doable in the game.
Tweaking aspects like these would make the sandbox an absolute joy.",1704544197,1704544197,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Cougars, there are both timber wolves, black bears, moose and grey wolves. Cougars would add a new element and a middle point between the bear/moose attack svene and the struggle scenario with wolves.

- Foxes, foxes would add a more fauna to the game and would give a balance in meat yeld between wolves and rabbits.

- Double slots on hands, There is the system of the both down vest and the sport vest can only be worn on the inner clothing slot, it should be possible to wear gloves on the inner slot and mittens on the outer slot, or mittens on the inner slot but then you will be unable to wear gloves on the outer slot, this is both practical in real life and will aid in protection against cold, and make a bigger difference between gloves and mittens.

- Canadian Mountie uniform, Given that the game takes place in Canada, being able to find a mountie uniform would be a nice addition to the game (like with the addition of the ""Hockey Sweater"" in Tales From The Far Territory), as well as an achievement in the game that says ""100% Candaian power"" which requires you to ""wear the mountie uniform while drinking maple syrup"" or ""Wear the Mackinaw Jacket while drinking Maple Syrup"".

- Binoculars, Binoculars would be a very useful item in order to scout out predators or map out a travel route, this item could be very rare and most commonly found in a firewatch tower.

- Insulated Flask change, make the insulated flask's weight gain with only the liquid, not the cup/can. The insulated flask has an inbuilt cup on the top of it, only the liquid of what you have prepared would increase the flask's weight. 
Example: you prepare a cup of tomato soup and you transfer the content to the insulated flask, you'd then get a recycled can and the total weight would be split; 0,15kg (0,33lbs) would go off to the recycled can and the remaining, 0,10kg (0,22lbs) would go into the flask.",1704274600,1704274600,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Survival in its truest form, its just you, the cold, and everything that wants to kill you in between. The game consists of a loop constantly looking for the next source of water, food, or supplies just to live another 5 minutes. Most actions pass in game time, think about what you're doing before it gets dark. Good luck...

I feel like this game would benefit significantly with multiplayer up to 4 players just to survive with your friends. Only downside is if you die, you're dead forever for that game. It'd make for some nice discord nights, but most folks would like a respawn feature which sort of is the opposite of the survival game.

On PC, this game was an amazing escape from reality, I loved the story so far ep 1-3 currently on ep 4. The Characters are great and actually have backgrounds you can explore. The game doesn't hold your hand or maybe it does and I am just stupid but I had to go to the control panel to find out how to place a fire after dying two times in the first section.

A few things you should know, 
Graphics 8.5/10
Game play 9/10
Story so far Ep 1-3 9/10
Survival elements  8.5/10

   there are bugs but they are not bad and they seem to be knocking them out left and right.

   The game isn't finished yet, they are still working on new eps. It will be free content for anyone who owns the game once they are done making it unlike some games *cough* *cough* (Ubisoft, Destiny, WOW, etc.)

 They are a small team but they are doing a great job, I can't wait for more content even if they wanted me to pay more for it.  
   
  Tips:   Don't let your character get to extreme low health because you will start swaying randomly at high speeds and it becomes really hard to go where you want to go. Learned that ^^^^ at the very beginning.

**I also have an additional review for the DLC, Tales From The Far Territory which will also be scored out of 10.**

Intro:
Man is this game phenomenal... I've been playing this game on and off since around 2017ish and watched videos of it all the way back o the early sandbox days in 2014. Coming from a person who is very picky when it comes to video games, pick this one. 

Gameplay:
If your favorite games are Rainbow Six Siege or Call of Duty, keep scrolling. This is not a fast-paced game whatsoever and is made to take a very long time. In order to explore the whole world, it can take over 200 days in game. The map is so large and beautifully crafted, and taken with so much care that everything has a purpose. Everything is also so perfectly balanced, all objects have a drawbacks, areas with a lot of loot are surrounded by wildlife, etc. As of writing this review, there are 12 maps in the base game and 3 maps in the DLC (we'll get to the DLC later). Each map is so different and unique from one another that it never feels like you're in the same place. The Blackrock region offers an expansive prison while Desolation Point is home to a now abandoned whaling industry and features a light house. Mystery Lake has a large hydro electric dam and Milton is a rural town tucked in the mountains. Anyways I think you get the idea... The different difficulties also create many different playing styles and allows anyone to be able to hop in and enjoy it. Something that also makes this game stand out from the rest is the amount of thinking required. You can't just go and explore, you need to take hunger and exhaustion into the equation and plan out your routes. It's just like if you were really stranded out in the northern Canadian wilderness, you actually need to use your brain. You won't get killed by zombies or mythical creatures, only the blistering cold temperatures, dehydration, starvation, exhaustion, or getting mauled by the many animals.
10/10

Developers:
I will admit, recently, the game has seen many bugs and the development team at Hinterland have switched to quantity or quality; however, they have an excellent support service and are constantly working to patch bugs. The reason why The Long Dark stands out from any other survival is the level of polish, and it's clear how passionate the developers are. Additionally, Hinterland is probably one of the most interactive teams and actually listen to feedback. It's also really nice and informative of the studio to post monthly dev updates, so you know what is planned for the future.
8/10

Graphics:
The graphics are stunning to say the least. They aren't the most realistic triple AAA graphics like GTA 6, but there's such a charm and nostalgic feeling that comes from this art style that makes you feel cozy and at home. The graphics are probably a large reason for my love of the game.
9/10

Community:
Overall the community for this game is fairly small, but at the same time are extremely passionate and just good people. It's a shame there isn't a bigger community, as this game is a diamond in the rough.
7/10

Overall Score: 
9.5/10

**DLC**

This section will be split up into 3 sections, intro, gameplay, if it's worth it, then the final score.

Intro: 
The DLC expands upon the original game, featuring 3 new regions (as of writing this) and many new mechanics.

Gameplay:
The gameplay is identical to the original game, but offers new mechanics to spice up your run. New enemies, weapons, clothing, entirely new regions, and more. It also introduces tales, which act as small stories that include underground bunkers that can hold precious items. A huge plus to this DLC, is that you can still keep your original saves and explore the new regions that are offered from the DLC. It isn't a separate game, rather an expansion to the original game.

Is It Worth It?:
Only if you are a fan of the original game and are yearning to see more of what the game has to offer. Because the gameplay is identical and is served as an expansion, it's only worth it if you've fully explored Great Bear Island and love the game already. By buying the DLC, you are also supporting an indie studio who is passionate about their game and love their fans. You're also guaranteed more regions and gameplay features in the future, as Hinterland has a road map (which you can check on their website) that is promised to be coming to you if you buy the DLC.

1: If you want a fairly well made survival game with light horror elements (or heavy horror elements if you're scared of bears) then TLD is probably the best of it's kind on the market. 


2: If you don't care about an adjoined story that explains- kind of- the setting of TLD, you can safely skip Wintermute.


3: If you like both the core survival game as well as the world building in Wintermute, then you may want to buy the Tales from the Far Territory DLC.


That withstanding, there's four big reasons to be wary of buying into this game:


1: The game is about a decade old. The game was initially seed funded by the Canadian government, then a successful kick starter with Early Access starting clear back in 2014. People who bought in early got the Wintermute DLC free, now you get to pay for it. The base game, sans sale, costs 35 USD. Each of the two DLC runs you 20 USD as well. The game isn't actually finished- the final chapter of Wintermute has been delayed to late 2024, which will mean the game has been in near-constant development for OVER a decade. Which in turn leads to the classic, ""Man, compared to the output of other studios, this is kinda lacking"" comparison. If that upsets you, you probably wont like TLD.


2: The game plus it's DLC is a full retail game's price. It's also, again, a decade old, or so. If you're on the fence, wait for sales. The developer isn't nickel and dime'ing you with frivolous micro-transactions but that's still a tall ask for a game that came out when Obama was still president. 


3: The actual plot in the Wintermute DLC is.... dumb. There's no gentle way of putting it. The frustrating thing is that it wouldn't be that difficult to ape the works of classics like Gary Paulsen and Jack London and Ernest Hemingway. Instead you get a plot that very clearly wanted to ape Tell Tale Games but also struggles to maintain a coherent plot. You get Mystery Box story telling that forget the box existed in the first place for two whole chapters. Whatever points it scores early on completely fart away by chapter three when it becomes clear the developer has no idea how to make you do anything that isn't 'go get the thing' and the game's insistence on rifling through characters means it struggles to keep story beats. And yeah, the game was made in Unity so when something a complete amateur could figure out in an hour- true / false conditions for ray cast lights to verify if an NPC can see the player- is completely absent from the game so stealth sections end of falling flat. 


4: They actually pushed the release of the final chapter back so they could work on an unrelated DLC- Far Territory. Kinda scummy. 


If you like a relatively realistic survival game that actually nails the atmospherics, this is a pretty good game. If you wanted a game that actually pairs that atmosphere off with a good story.... ah, just read Jack London.",1704011710,1704011710,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Hard to learn, hard to master, The Long Dark is an immersive survival experience with a vast environment and unique premise. While you can get by using food and equipment scavenged from the derelict buildings of Great Bear Island, such supplies are finite and you will soon find yourself hunting, fishing and foraging for what you need to endure the merciless, freezing wilderness.

The Long Dark is a game that has clearly had a lot of work, love and passion put into creating it and the developers of this title had a clear and concise vision of what this game should be and how it should be played. I would recommend that for anyone unfamiliar with survival games of this nature, there are several YouTube content creators that have videos going into detail about the mechanics extensively that I would recommend, Zaknafein, Survivor Mike and Foxy Fern are some of the main channels I would recommend looking at. 

The game has a very detailed survival system whereby you need to eat, drink, rest and care for your character so that you can continue surviving in the world. Your first few lives in the game will be short if you do not prepare correctly. One of the things I always tried to do was get charcoal. If you're new and unfamiliar with the layouts of the territories, you likely won't know where any of the loot typically exists or where to hunt or fish. Charcoal allows you to fill out the map as you explore. I would recommend seeing if you can grab a spray paint can or two as well, so that you can mark off places you've already been. It's worth using the spray cans to indicate landmarks. For example, if there's a large lighthouse in the territory that can be quite easily spotted from anywhere, approaching the lighthouse and leaving a spray paint mark to indicate where it is on the map in relevance to other points is something I'd recommend. It also helps to orientate yourself when you're exploring as you can use the lighthouse as a point of reference for how far you've gone vs how much you have remaining to explore.

Herbal tea and Coffee I find very useful in The Long Dark. Not only do they provide you with decent stat boosts after consumption, they also help fight off the cold. You'll need clean water in your inventory in order to make it at a campfire or stove. I'd also recommend grabbing a cooking pot from a house somewhere if you can find one. They have 2L capacity for water so you can easily boil and purify large quantities of water with ease. They also speed up the cooking time on any food items placed within, so they're quite handy.

One thing I'd recommend avoiding is carrying a lot of heavy stuff around with you. If you can, when you get onto a territory, find a relatively safe place to stash things to use as an outpost and try to set these up as you go along, leaving a few bits and pieces of food, water and other items. Try to store these items in containers if you can. 

All in all, I'd say give the game a try if you're into survival games. I could go on endlessly about the mechanics of the game but honestly, I think the fun is in the exploring and finding cool items around each territory. There's a special feeling you get when you find your first gun or bow. Give it a go and see what you think for yourself, I would personally recommend The Long Dark.",1703953161,1703953161,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is one of my favorite games to date, and even if I go a year or two without playing it, it keeps me coming back. 

The reason I keep coming back is the development team has poured their heart and soul into the game. They have made it from a small time survival game with 1 map that's about 1 square kilometres to over 15 regions with about 30 square kilometres. It is insane of the scopes of the map, and it is dense. This game has been my therapy if I want to get lost in the cold north winter, and I love the development team for what they have done.

I will say the learning curve is high. Knowing the maps and what can quickly go from a leisure stroll to a dense situation of hypothermia is a challenge. Even at 1400 hours, I have found myself in some situations where I am limping to my cabin with just enough energy to spare to not freeze to death or be eaten by wolves. If you are insane enough to play on Interloper difficulty settings, it is one of the hardest challenges to date. 

I highly recommend this game if you enjoy survival games. This is one of those games that just keeps getting better with the developers continuing to add more great content.

However, playing the storyline there are some hiccups that have annoyed me greatly.
- Episode 1, one of the first checkpoints/missions of the storyline broke, so I had to go back to a save file three hours older to fix the issue.
- Episode 3, I can no longer fast forward in interactions with NPCs, and there are a few sections with a lot of talk, which I would have preferred to just have in text to go through faster. Spent maybe 30 minutes in 40 minutes of gameplay listening to storytelling.
- Episode 3, my UI breaks (can no longer see what action I can make with an item) after certain autosave points, so I need to save the game and load the save to fix the UI.

Not gamebreaking stuff, it is just an annoyance. I like the rest of the game rather much, but would not recommend it until the above listed points are fixed.

EDIT - Finished episode 1-4. Episodes 1 and 4 were great, episode 2 and 3 felt too much like a grind with large distances to be travelled with little story progression (during episode 3 I considered whether it was worth it to finish the game).

That in and of itself doesn't make it bad, but when you die literally after 15 (in game) minutes and it takes 12 minutes to break down a cardboard box... sorry you're dead. In the ""tutorial"". 2.5 hours in and I still don't know how to rest outside of a bed of pine needles at the very beginning.

I like the art style and want to experience the story, but after 2.5 hours I literally don't know how to do anything and am not having even one ounce of fun. It tells you ""go look for food"", but even though it is the middle of the day and the houses have windows, you can't see anything. Don't worry, you have 1 flare that lasts 5 minutes.

Again, I get the desire to make it a hardcore survival game, but have a tutorial that actually shows you how to do things like cook food and craft items. Also, you can't pass time in increments less than an hour. So you want to melt snow and boil water? That takes about 30 minutes (in game time). So you sit around for like 5 real time minutes waiting to make water. It doesn't respect my time.

All in all, if you know you like this kind of game you might love it, but for a casual like me I regret the purchase. I thought it was going to be a chill story with some survival elements, not ""you're dead 10 minutes in"".",1703725339,1703725455,False,3,2,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

And now, I'm left disappointed as I lost several hours of my life playing today and losing all my progress to something incredibly benign.

I want to recommend this game, but I can't because of this one simple, stupid failing of the game: You can't step over a small ledge or up onto a log, even when you're already more than half way up onto it. That's it. That's the straw that breaks the camel's back on why I can't recommend this game.

Several hours into a survival run, I die because I made the dumb decision to walk off a fallen log over a ravine on the wrong side, resulting in me getting stuck on that side with no other way out of my situation than jumping down into the ravine. Why? Because I couldn't climb back up onto the log back to safety. I needed to lift a foot [i]maybe[/i] 5 centimetres more than a regular step to get back up. But because that's not possible, that killed the run, as I took the only other way out. Plunging down into the ravine, surviving the fall, but bleeding to death just a few in-game hours later from my injuries.

Those hours I put into that run were wasted. 
Usually, losing a survival run isn't a waste of time, as that is the point of the game. But I say wasted in this case as I got no sense that I lost because [i]I[/i] messed up, because [i]I[/i] failed to keep myself alive. I just lost time because of the lack of a game mechanic that should have been implemented years ago.
I'm not even saying the game needs to let you climb over something waist high, even if that would be nice. Just literally add the ability to step over something that's as tall as a regular step in a staircase.",1703718152,1703718152,False,7,0,0.56081080436706543,0,True,False,False

I appreciate that many people enjoy it and that the developers have worked hard to build a positive relationship with their customers. For most people, it probably will still be enjoyable. For me specifically, this game really didn't hit the mark. I wanted a bit more verisimilitude.

The event that triggered my decision has to do with the constraining movement mechanics. At the very beginning of the game I came upon a rope, wrapped around a boulder, descending into a valley. The ledge was icy, the boulder was icy, the rope was probably even icy. None the less, like some kind of gymnast, my character grabs the rope and can descend and ascend this icy mountain wall like it's nothing. No safety gear, no climbing shoes, no harness, no nothing, just his hands. So, I figure ok, this guy is in really good shape. I can deal with this, even though it's a bit of a stretch against realism.

Next, I work my way to the bottom and explore the valley a bit. After a while, I decide I want to go back up the rope and see what's up there. That's when things go South. You see, there's a slope under the bottom of the rope that I walked down to get into the valley. It presented no trouble, but I walked slow as I saw this orange slope icon in the bottom right hand corner. I presumed it meant I was on risky footing. I guess the slope might have been 45 degrees at it's sharpest.

My guy can't walk up it. He can't hop, he can't crawl, he can't shimmy. I keep trying and eventually slip backwards and sprain my wrist. So, that was pretty much the end for me. I wanted realism, but this massive disparity in physical capabilities just crushes the experience for me. These types of game mechanics always bother me, where players are constrained to either force them to play the game in a certain way or as a convenience for the developer. It's not hard to shimmy up a 45 degree, snow covered slope. Yes I've done it many times. What I haven't done, and wouldn't do, is climb that rope bare handed (certainly not with all that ice and while wearing tennis shoes). 

I went to the forums for help and got the same thing I usually get: ""bigger perspectives"", ""fan boy apologists"", """"coding is hard comments"", and a host of people trying to tell folks that they are wrong to want the game to be any different. I then took a quick look at the modding community and didn't see anything standing out. With twenty minutes to go on my refund window, I had to walk away.

In summary, the game isn't bad. It seems pretty good really. However, it's presented as a sort of ""realistic survival"" game, but it falls flat instantly for me on that count. For folks that don't mind possibly, unrealistic mechanical limitations, I suspect the game will still be quite fun.

But then Hinterland decided to bring out a DLC for it when the main storyline STILL isn't done.  This wouldn't be an issue aside from the fact that they deleted our save games because the version is incompatible with the DLC.  I spent a couple hundred hours on my run.  I had a storyline made up using my journal depicting my character descending into madness.  But that's all gone now because a certain developer quoted ""well we didn't expect the players to survive that long"".  

It's a survival game.  That's kind of the point, right?

So I deleted the game when that happened but I had been looking for something to mess around with on the steam deck.  It does work on the deck, but be wary of crashes happening when you are crafting or harvesting in your inventory.  But honestly, I haven't seen anything different other than some trees, female deer and notes in the sun visors within vehicles.  I lost all my progress for this?

Anyways, I'll say this much...it is a great survivor game for the new player who hasn't experienced it, just be advised that your progress can be deleted whenever Hinterland decides they want to make a buck and then they can laugh at you while you read the quote after starting the game that says some blah blahs about ""made by people who care about their players"".

The item spawns and drops vary greatly and sometimes you will find items you wished you had from the beginning, after you've died three times, and respawn in the Mountain Town(Beginners). To say less: items spawn randomly per each game. For instance: after a storm, branches will fall to collect for more firewood. Be WEARY of WOLVES...

Update 2024, It is winter seasons and i had again the urge to play the full campaign and plunge myself into the DLC.
The campaign is simply fantastic and very memorable even for the second playthrough. problem is that the last chapter will only come end of 2024....
The survival mode is amazing as a new player as you will discover all of the story maps to its full extend. For me however as i did almost 4x a 200 plus day run it started to become boring until the dlc came again (having done multiple difficulty lvls)
The DLC offers 2 new maps and some new weapons and special tools which are cool and challenging, also its delivering a great background story which you need to uncover during your survival run,
But as this was my 5th complete fresh run, i started to get irritated with the speed of the game and the animal behavior which is as far as i have read not realistic. especially on the higher difficulties the wolves keep coming every min and they dont let go... 
I added a few mods to change this and my other wishes as it really got on my nerves. 
I only wished that the company had released the full game including the DLC from the start, than i most likely would have stayed also until the 500 day run without any mods ...
To bad i will park the game once gain until end of 2024 to end the campaign.

Episode four has tiring cinematics that last nearly ten minutes before any game play without any way to skip (have to press spacebar repeatedly to get through cutscenes already viewed). It also does NOT run on updated macs. They have some command to add in steam launch properties but that drags down the frame rate to unplayable (seriously like 15 frames per second). It's fascinating how many bugs and glitches this game still has after a decade to develop such simple and limited content. Overall the game is saved by its design aesthetic and game play loop, but it's sometimes completely unplayable especially as operating systems have updated many times since its original launch which has not also been updated.

More seriously: This is one of the greatest pure survival games I've played. Game play loop revolves around maintaining your Body Temp, Fatigue, Thirst, and Hunger. While doing that you will explore a large island separated into many different zones (each with their own particular features: availability of shelter, outdoor temps, and wildlife).

The scenery is beautiful, the weather is fierce and unforgiving, and survival is not guaranteed. But is a very enjoyable experience the whole time.

This game also has multiple difficulty levels and allows you to customize that experience to your liking. This ranges from an exploration/casual mode with passive wildlife to an intense ""Interloper"" challenge level where you get an achievement for surviving a single day, and everything in between.

The game to play when the calendar says it should be winter, but there isn't even a spec of a snow on the ground and one needs some escapism from that. If there would be some Christmas themed items, the game would be perfect game to play during the holidays.
However I have many gripes. 
- Doing anything takes long. Gathering resources, walking from place to place, managing inventory. 
- The game also has permadeath, meaning that one small mistake could flush 50 hours of careful exploration down the drain. Almost gave a negative review for that. Luckily there are mods and cheats available to help get back on the horse.
- Story mode is not that great either. It takes a while until the game opens up. But I would suggest playing at least the first chapter and maybe half of the second chapter to learn the basics. Fighting the old bear just isn't worth the trouble.
- Story itself is quite bad. It should be man vs nature, like the gameplay is, but instead there are all kinds of baddies in it. Also the story is not finished, yet there is already another story being developed.
- Characters were uninteresting, except the trapper from chapter 2 and the priest from chapter 3.
- Also I find the fact that there is an option to go inside the church, grab the Big Book in the middle of it, and burn it in the fire, rather insulting.
- There are also some minor mistakes in the Finnish translation of the game. You light ""a shoot"" to keep you warm and to cook food with. And then you ""(camp)fire"" a gun to shoot with it. But at least the game has a Finnish translation (subtitles only, though)

Tunnelmallinen peli. En edes pidä selviytymispeleistä. Peli jota pelata, kun kalenterin mukaan pitäisi olla talvi, mutta maassa ei ole senttiäkään lunta, ja sitä kaipaa hieman pakoa kaamoksen keskeltä. Jos pelissä olisi edes muutamia jouluaiheisia esineitä, olisi tämä peli täydellinen joulupeli.
Muutamia hiertäviä asioita pelissä toki on.
- Kaiken tekeminen vie aikaa. Tarvikkeiden keräminen, paikasta toiseen käveleminen, tavaraluettelon järjestely.
- Kerrasta kuoleminen. Yksi virhe saattaa tehdä 50 tunnin työn tuloksen tyhjäksi. Melkein negatiivisen arvosanan arvoinen asia. Onneksi saatavilla on modeja ja konsolikomentoja, että pääsee takaisin kärryille.
- Tarina ei ole kummoinen. Vie aikansa ennen kuin peli kunnolla avautuu. Suosittelen kuitenkin pelaamaan ainakin puolitoista lukua. Kaksintaistelu vanhan karhun kanssa ei tosin ole sen arvoista.
- Hahmot eivät ole mielenkiintoisia. Poikkeuksena toisen luvun Ansastaja, ja kolmannen luvun pappi.
- Pelissä on mahdollisuus mennä kirkkoon, ottaa sen keskeltä iso kirja ja käyttää sitä sytytystarvikkeena, minkä minä koen loukkaavaksi.
- Suomen kielen käännöksessä on muutamia virheitä. Sytytetään ""ampua"" lämmikkeeksi, mutta ""tulitaan"" pyssyllä ampumiseksi. Mutta ainakin suomenkielinen käännös on tarjolla.",1611164716,1702883216,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What maybe looks like a relaxing game is in reality a pretty unforgiving experience, where the smallest mistake can lead to an abrupt and pretty unpleasent ending. Not careful where you walk? Get a sprained ankle. Not checking what is around the corner? Get attacked by wolves or get mauled by a grizzly. Not wearing enough clothes? Get into a blizzard and freeze to death. There is quite a lot that can go wrong, so always try to have a good plan on your hand or learn to improvise. 

The gameplay is quite fun and offers a lot of possibilities. Exploring the unknown world in front of you is a big part of it and some of the vast areas are more and some are less welcoming. You need to find a good shelter, find important ressources like food, clothing, medication, tools and when you are lucky, even a neat bolt action rifle or a revolver with a small amount of ammo. You can also craft a lot of different items like a bow and arrow, which you then can use for hunting a deer or rabbits. Not only can you use its meat to cook delicious food on your oven, you are also able to dry the deer skin and produce very warm clothes from it. Recycling is your friend! 

However, the best thing about the game is the dense atmosphere and its pretty charming art style. Roaming around in the middle of nowhere, while being desperate for every item you can find is a pretty daunting experience. It will make you realize that the character you are playing as is very vulnerable and the nature and its inhabitants are not on your side. But when you are able to make it back to your shelter, the backpack full of loot and you are still in one piece, you will breath through and learn to appreciate the safety that 4 walls will offer. When it then becomes dark and you make a fire in the chimney, while a blizzard violently rages outside your home, you just feel happy to be safe, warm and it generates a very cozy atmosphere, that you won't find in a lot of survival games. 

The Long Dark is a lovely made title that offers a big amount of variety for a rather small price. You can choose to play the story campaign or just roam around in the survival mode, so there should be something for everyone. Just get it, it's worth the experience.

Most of the Mixed review drama was people who bought super early who don't know to read and/or not understanding what early access dlc is.  You paying up front for access with a low cost increasing over time until dlc is fully finished which then will be at full price, originally within a year. (which means nobody needed to buy it early if they didn't want to as they should know its not finalized)

I do agree with certain events that occurred that was mishandled (from passing the baton of the game to the assistant who's team at one point released an update, which items were not going to be available in custom or interloper (and that caused an uproar on all interloper purist, this game has a lot of customization and very few if not no restrictions, which that was a bit out of character from Hinterland Studio.

Some complaints was about too many areas now and way too big and downvoting, ironically ... You don't need to travel to the new areas if you don't want to and still get most of the item contents of the game.  Is like most downvotes.  The only moment I believe that a downvote should be cast that really matters is when all is said and done and they do poor decisions in the end or if they abandon the project, and we know that is not happening.

Now to my actual review without the DRAMA and CHILDREN running around
___________________________________________________________________________

I waited until now to buy it (december 2023 / a year later from when it started) and have seen some videos and I have to say that in its current form, the addition of complicated cooking-broth / Travois (to move items around easier and fishing-lure, and an extra Illness which is vitamin C deficiency for the extra challnege, all this is worth the price.  Currently having new areas to travel is a plus.  Getting updates to animation for skinning and the clothing to be seen on the hands of the character on the base game are also great additions that its being added.  

The game has a mini story that is meant to be completed fully when dlc is released to its 1.0.  
Currently we are just waiting for the last region / the cat enemy and the main game conclusion in 2024. 

In the end I recommend anyone who really likes the Long Dark to get it if you want to add more mechanics to the game but arguing to make it free and that it should be with the base game is a brat and doesn't understand costs to make game.",1702747591,1702747591,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

45 hours IRL
65 days survived on Voyager difficulty setting Survival mode
Day 62 Bleak Inlet:
Big Moosie attacked out of the mist 10 feet from me. Stomped me three times but I had good clothes (wolf coat) so I lived and chased him and shot him 4 times. B
Big Moosie disappeared when Aurora started.
Day 65 Bleak Inlet
With broken ribs I went back to find Big Moosie. 
As soon as I found him, clear day, Wolf Pack spawns behind me and attacks.
I deal with them and survive and turn to Big Moosie
I get 3 rifle rounds into him, dropping him to one knee, he takes off, I chase after walking
I get 3 pistol rounds into him he takes off and I follow with only Flair Gun left with ammo
SUDDENLY out of nowhere... Cat 2 whiteout blizzard hits and I can see nothing
Big Moosie found spawned up on a rock waiting to jump me.
I raised Flair Gun and caught him in head.
Brig Moosie runs with flair stuck in his horns.
I follow him directly, he turns, charges, I line up last Flair Gun shot to take him out
SUDDENLY out of nowhere.... thin ice warning pops up and IMMEDIATELY I crash thru ice. 
Everything goes black and Big Moosie escapes into the White Out
I walk trying to find shelter in WHITE OUT Cat 2 when I find I have a STIM injector.
Take STIM injector, goes black for a second, some life restored to health bar...
SUDDENLY out of nowhere... Cat 2 WHITE OUT becomes CAT 10 HURRICANE WHITE OUT and I die instantly.
And I got the video to prove all of this.
Some serious bullshit to get me killed don't you think? 
If the devs think this kind of obvious stacking of the game elements against it's players make em want to keep playing, guess again. 
Congrats devs. your game rigging finally killed me. as it did my appreciation for your game. 
I was laughing and having fun when being stomped by Big Moosie and it was shaping up to be an exciting battle at the end. But then you had to rig it so you could keep proudly saying '100% of our players have died'
I said then... 'this is great. that's ok. spawn the moose right in front of me. that's a game. that's alright. just don't do some bullshit weather or rigging shit to kill me'
and that is exactly what you did 3 in game days late.

I would have paid for more stuff in the game, more maps, more equipment. Now I just don't care. You folks at Hinterlands have treated everyone like fools.

The Long Dark, (base survival mode game), is a unique, must-have for any survival game lover. Unlike many survival games which pit the player against hordes of enemies and incorporate extensive base building, TLD comes across as very puritanical, with most of your gameplay being based around sustaining your needs, (warmth, hunger, thirst, and rest), and nature itself being your enemy. That, however, is not a bad thing, as TLD has largely mastered resource distribution, (altered by RNG/difficulty), and you will find yourself constantly weighing your needs and desires vs. what is available in your environment. It is post-apocalyptic hunter/gather: the game, and once you get used to the way it plays, it stands to provide you with some of the greatest memories gaming can offer. That said, it's not perfect...

Pros:
-Excellently balanced resource, crafting, and needs system
-Integrated Skill system, (use something, get better at it)
-Wildlife provide some sense of combat/hunting
-Voice acting is limited, but good
-Excellent score that evokes numerous emotions, with some calls to other related media, (i.e., synth moments call back to John Carpenter's ""The Thing"")
-Difficulty-based RNG, map zone selection, or custom rules keep gameplay fresh
-A surprising amount of depth to surviving, especially in higher difficulties
-Mostly bug free
-Good SFX
-Highly immersive weather
-Surprisingly interesting exploration, in spite of all the snow
-Unique art style

Cons:
-Some of the graphics are showing their age
-Some bugs, (like rifle respawns; wind effecting your movement where it shouldn't, etc.)
-Some balance and immersion aspects have gone ages unaddressed, (dropping food in the snow won't draw scavengers, but will preserve it for a long time; bleeds never stop so a bear can be shot once and hid from and will die, etc.)
-Wildlife AI can be pretty bad and very irritating, (scared wolves can turn and attack you only after a few yards of travel; animals don't react to fire without your presence, don't always react to getting hit with stones, etc.)
-""Struggle"", (wrestling with animals), leaves a lot to be desired, at best, and is pure suffering, at worst, (as in, you don't stand a chance and are forced to watch and listen to your character get mauled)
-It's lonely, with human AI and lore material largely reserved for ""Wintermute"" DLC
-Reading skill books is about the least fun thing in a game, ever
-Gunshots sometimes kick up snow behind targets, making me wonder if there's a hit detection problem

While that does look like a lot of problems, most will only be appreciated after scores of hours of play. What you will experience, mostly, is the game you signed on for: Having to leave your safehouse at night, because blizzards have kept you in during the day; having to explore dangerous new lands, because you exhausted the resources of your old zone; having to camp in bear territory, because that can of peaches gave you food poisoning and you're too weak to move; unloading on a pack of wolves with your newly-found revolver, because they're jerks and deserve it.

In spite of its flaws, it's worth full price in my book. I can't say the same for Wintermute or the expansion pass, but the base game is darn near open-world survival perfection. Just be prepared to hate the wolves like you've hated no other NPC in history. And drink toilet water. But mostly hate wolves.",1492494399,1702440140,True,0,0,0,3,True,False,False

Update:
---------------------------------------------
Things seem to have improved. My forum account finally got approved (after almost 2 years and 3 attempts).
In the meantime I lost a 50 day run due to Hinterland's attempt to fix a niche bug, which introduced a couple more bugs that were infinitely worse - amongst them the infamous container bug that nuked everything that players would have stored in any type of container (I lost 2 bear coats, 2 Mackinaws, my bow, 10 arrows, all my teas, copious amounts of cloth and saplings, etc.) - but that's ""ok"", I moved on.

The recent update brought another map, fixed a duplication glitch and reintroduced 2 bearhides per coat (which I'm not a fan of, regarding the size of a bear hide). Everything's fine - for now... 

Impression right after TFTFT update:
---------------------------------------------
On the Linux-native support side, Hinterland dropped the ball and went home - especially since TFTFT. Don't bother to try to communicate via their bug reports platform, you won't get any answer except the automated ""Hey, why don't you join our forum while you wait for a response to your problem?"" - which doesn't work, because your account needs to be approved. Both the response to your bug reports and the account approval never go through. 

If you play on Windows or Wine/Proton (which introduces other problems), you're probably fine. If you plan to play the native version on Linux, don't. It's not worth even trying in its current state and I honestly doubt the situation will improve in the future.

If you switch from Linux native to Wine/Proton, be prepared to loose all your feats. You can transfer existing game saves over (with a little patience), but the game will only register the feats you chose in that existing run. Everything else will be reset.

The game itself it's alright, it approaches a unique survival touch of atmosphere and play style than most survival games of its genre. That been said, (Survival Mode) was what attracted most if not all of its fan base, including me. Since there was no story back then, Survival was the sweet spot and centre of attention, without it, The Long Dark would not been what it is today. Now, jumping to my second point. Here's my disappointment from Hinterland's approach to where it all began. When they first announced the new PAY DLC for Survival mode, I was thrown off the hook in an instant. I felt like they gave the middle finger to the whole fan base that supported their game from the very beginning. You may wonder why I'm saying this well, here it is for those that are new to the whole scene. Through the development of the Long Dark over the past years, there was little to no change in Survival Mode, there has never been a (major) update to it regarding new content/additions like the NEW PAY DLC portraits. The only additions to Survival before were very few with little to no changes: regions, a moose, some clothing, and a revolver, I might be forgetting some others.  The rest were just graphical, environmental, some mechanical changes and bug fixes, but never a game changer. Those changes were more beneficial with an interest at best, that now you have to pay EXTRA to unravel the whole picture of modern day scumming tactics just to get more money out something that should have been implemented and YOU PAID for as a part of the early alpha days development till now. And yes, I am aware Hinterland, that you did added a Story Mode that sucked BIG time and that's just basically a tutorial walk-through of the game's core mechanics for Survival Sandbox Mode. Because that's where the game's course of main attraction has and will always shine. Otherwise why would there be a NEW DLC behind a paywall? Anyhow, since the original developer move on,  the current team well, let's just say this game has gone downhill for me. I am sure for many others as well. So here's my final conclusion, I won't tolerate neither support companies that pulled this kind of BS especially to their loyal backers since their early days of development, and the worse, make it seem like it's alright. But it's all good, I had my doubts Hinterland, I'm glad my keen of sight never relied on your geomagnetic disaster BS.",1442553953,1702292094,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've played this game for damn near a decade now. It was my favorite for that entire duration. But it's no longer a quiet apocalypse. It's no longer non-violent. I no longer have a place to camp, or a survival game which is beautiful and peaceful but will kill you all the same. My retreat is gone, and I'm heartbroken. Even the music is now designed to provoke anxiety.

I hope Hinterland realizes what made their game special enough to have fanatic supporters for a ten year project, and that they've lost something infinitely rare. I hope they find it again, but I don't see that happening. I appreciated the initial concept and years of play before y'all went off the rails--thank you for that. You let a paralyzed woman go camping again. I'll never forget it.

Original review & edits
____
This game provides a buffer of solitude within the maelstrom of everyday life.

Immersion in the stark beauty of the landscape is inevitable.  Realistic choices and penalties force reliance upon preparation and real-life survival analysis of every moment of play.  Every triumph over the environment, every advance, feels earned by persistence and wit.

The Long Dark did not hold my hand.  Poor survival decisions are easy to make and often unrecoverable.  My first death was caused by harvesting a deer, a committment of an hour or two, without checking my calorie reserves.  In-game, the consequences of overcommitting resources, energy, and willpower--of relying on luck or hidden strength to carry you--are devastatingly real.

But the world isn't dark.  It is beautiful, and if exploration holds danger it also holds reward.  Nature is both enemy and ally.

The Long Dark carries deeply satisfying echoes; reminders of our evolution as a cunning beast--the basic struggle to survive, and the triumph of overcoming obstacles with a mixture of forethought, persistance, and inspiration.

For the individual who finds peace and affirmation in the struggle for balance, I truly cannot recommend a game more wholeheartedly.

Edit 1:  I genuinely cannot thank the game creators enough for the option to play as both a female protagonist, and a female protagonist who isn't wearing a fur bikini.

Edit 2:   The new challenge mode is amazing.  This may actually be the best game I've ever played, and it's not even finished.",1470985655,1702183891,False,1,0,0.519774019718170166,0,True,False,True

The best part of custom survival is that you can make it as punishing or as easy as you would like and you'll have fun either way.

It forces your to take stalk of the situation you find yourself in, slow down, and survive.

That atmosphere and old graphics were amazing, brilliant. But after upgraded textures that feeling died for me instantly, they lost that very important feeling of cozy, the reason why I enjoyed that game so much. 

They lost the old colors, the previous art-style of the game, the atmosphere became so different, like the best part of a soul died, that's how I felt at that moment, and was very frustrated, man.
 
I mean, I played after that for a decent hours, including interloper, but I even don't know why I did that. The survival mod became so boring,  maybe the first 10 days only is not, the story mod is weak, I even couldn't bring myself to complete a half of it. 

They lost these feelings like when you are going back to your Trapper's Homestead, and chilling, hearing how the blizzard howls mixing with crackling fire from the pot. The feeling like you are living in that place.

It died with new design and homes became a place to loot check and go further. Can't play it anymore, that lost feeling is one the biggest disappointment of my entire game history.

The Long Dark, is a difficult survival game, with many missions being slightly difficult, the story is immersive, and it can be thrilling at times, you have to worry about water and food like many other survival games, but you also have to worry about warmth in this game making in unique, and there is many dangers in this game that you will come across, it is a immersive experience.


[b]Downsides:[/b]

I stopped playing this for awhile because it makes you have to walk A LOT for most of the missions you have to do and it gets very annoying, you have to walk very far distances worrying about anything attacking you at anytime with no way of movement besides walking.

I also joined this game back after awhile of not playing it and it just wasn't how I remembered it, it's been awhile since I played last and I don't plan on playing it any longer due to the long walking missions.

The reason I am not recommending this game is due to the amount of walking you have to do, and how it just didn't feel like it used to, and like how I remembered before.

When companies representatives (that's what the studio's moderators ARE) deliver the message that the company doesn't care what players do or do not like, then it is time to call that developer out on it.

H O W E V E R, Wintermute is inconsistent. The first two episodes, you are free to skip lines of dialogue. In everything else, you have to wait and suffer because they talk so slowly. I believe episode three is also just a lot of fetch quests. (I recommenced finding a cheat engine and skipping it, or just watch it on youtube.) You should most definitely get the game when it is on sale.

Episodes 3+ aren't even fun. They could have done so much more. 
SPOILERS:
Instead of having a gameplay switch to play the woman, they should have left it a mystery. Now that we got to see her side, you feel less urgency to go 'help' the character; thinking they were in danger in the first place. It should have been so you stick to the mans perspective and story. Now, we gotta wait until GTA 7 to continue where the last episode left off. A cliffhanger. Of course. The devs have poor communication skills with their fanbase. They're focusing on everything BUT wintermute. 

Not to mention, Wintermute was free at first. Now, you gotta pay for something they don't even care about. Why do you think the reviews are mostly negative or mixed? It's because it's not good. You can like the gameplay and graphics. But this just ain't it chief. Just watch wintermute on youtube. Don't be a hero (lol)",1679155714,1701803704,False,2,0,0.496931314468383789,0,True,False,False

Obviously that depends on what you like in a game, mostly I like fast action shooters and stealth shooters. This game is different, but requires a lot of thinking and planning to stay ahead of death. Which often you realize began with a decision or mistake you made much earlier. I am looking forward to the Story mode, as well as additional challenges. Note that the challenges could be more replayable if the items were randomized on each iteration - I could be wrong, but I think pretty much the same items are always located in the same places. As such, I now know that If I'm doing the storm, I go get the rifle first so I can kill wolves, if the rifle were in a different place, I would be much more cautious with respect to where I go first.

I picked up some rocks and tried making a fire to recover my bodyheat but the game didn't give me any context clues or indication of what I was missing to make this happen.

Uncertain what to do at this point I started looking around and walked down a slight incline and took fall damage, spraining my legs and tearing my clothes. I did not jump. I walked down an embarkment. A slope. I ""fell"" barely an inch or two because of game geometry and tore my clothes and injured myself on snow.

Review from 04 / 05 / 2017) I stand by my above review over approximately a year later. It is still a solid game and the best game of it's genre. When it comes to the negative reviews regarding the developers (Hinterland) please take them with a pinch of salt as a lot of the community are currently a little disappointed with a countdown that was an announcement for the official date that the game was coming out of early access into a fully fledged game. A lot of the community expected story mode and/or a sandbox update.

Long story short if you're on the edge about buying the game read around a lot of reviews especially some of the older ones as current reviews are emotionally charged

Review from 28 / 11 / 2023) Six years on and I've just nominated this game for the Steam Awards 'Labor of Love' award as the devs haven't stopped providing updates after all this time and TLD truly encapsulates the very meaning of hard work and dedication from the devs",1476143887,1701164976,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's the reason why it sits in my top five games of all time. Don't just take my word for it, there's a lot of reasons why many others have put thousands of hours into this game.

It's just amazing.

The simplicity of this game is such a treat. Fixing clothes to stay warm. Curing pelts and crafting arrows. Forging crampons and arrowheads. Crouching through the snow to hunt deer. Starting a fire in a cave to outlast a blizzard. Cooking in the comfort of the Camp Office.

As a die-hard explorationist, I love the size of this game. Traversing the diverse regions of this game to find each and every nook and secret cranny for loot, or just the thrill of discovering the unknown.

Not only are the locations enticing, but the lore is great too. I'd give this game an A for environmental storytelling. Don't get me wrong, this game is tough. Don't expect to survive. The weather, the wildlife and even your own body will kill you if you don't manage your status bars. 

The Long Dark will suck you in and you won't realize how much real time has passed.
I love that mechanic.

The DLC, Tales From The Far Territories, is like the chef's kiss on top of an already great game. In all honesty, I haven't noticed any downsides while playing it.

Wintermute is another great point to make; If you don't like surviving for as long as possible, you can follow a narrative-driven story mode. It feels like a whole new game.

Some people have their understandable gripes about this game, but I'm not one to complain.

The graphics are in 'watercolour' style (such as the original Dishonored) yet the setting is still beautiful.  The history of Great Bear Island is considerable, and the various characters feel deep and complex.

Survival Mode, where you are the last one standing and simply survive until you don't, has the same addictiveness of games such as SimCity where you quickly lose whole hours to exploring, looting, hunting and managing equipment.

Downloadable Content drops are still being produced for this game.

It's almost a vacation destination for me, now.

Each trip is initially an effort to just survive.. then build stability.. then prepare for the next trip into new spaces to continue to gather the things you need to begin to thrive. Ultimately, you gain some level of mastery over the environment. The need for an item, tool, ingredients, will eventually drive you from your comfort to explore a new challenging area. 

If it wasn't challenging, you would have already gone there.

Each time you'll have to decide what you take. What do you need to get there? Can you find enough food on the way there and back to keep you going? What do you leave behind because you can carry as much as you need to bring back? 

Your choices are on you. 

Then you begin your walk. The scrunching of snow beneath your feet. Wind and trees reminding you of the forest around you. The sound of your equipment rattling as you go. Look it's snowing. The feeling of the cold breaks through the fourth wall and you put a blanket on your lap.

Pick your path well. Keep an eye for an opportunity of shelter. Maybe drop a log or pile of sticks there for the return trip. Or maybe 5 minutes later when a blizzard rolls in and you have to fall back to hunker down in a safe place. 

A lone wolf may not be enough to end you anymore, but there are threats that can. Every expedition is a risk. Running may not be enough. You may not be able to shoot fast enough, accurately enough to make it out. So be alert, aware of the sounds you hear. Don't just march forward blindly, look around for signs of predators.

Remember, the only thing worse than a pack of timber wolves is being caught in a blizzard with a pack of timber wolves. That could be then end of this year's story for me. Took too much risk and it ends quickly. 

I wonder what happens to all the stuff I piled up. Maybe some other survivor will find it. I should have left a note...",1701124625,1701124625,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have no particular love for games in the survival genre, they just don't click with me for the most part, but this game managed to charm me where most others haven't.

The main points of praise I have for this game are its gorgeous artstyle, well crafted atmosphere, and the pacing of the gameplay. The artstyle really speaks for itself; instead of going with a rote realistic style, Hinterland went with a more painterly style that gives the game a unique visual identity, and makes it frankly very easy to take some really nice screenshots. The atmosphere is absolutely top notch, from the groan of a house settling during a quiet morning, to the creaking of trees in the wind, to the dull roar of a blizzard outside of the cabin you've borrowed as your fireplace cricks and cracks. The gameplay consists of gathering and crafting, with the extent of basebuilding amounting to tidying up the larger junk littering a building you've taken a liking to. As the game is set in a forever winter, there's no farming or gardening, and there's pretty limited means to survive in one place indefinitely, meaning that most of your time is spent moving forward and exploring new areas, or preparing yourself for the next trek. The pacing of the exploration is tranquil with bouts of nervousness and intensity from the threat of wolves and bears, respectively depending on whether you spotted them first and managed to avoid them, or they got the drop on you. I found I really liked the lack of basebuilding, as in most games that feature it, I'd end up over-building a really good base, and then burning out on the game, whereas this game forces me to go out and explore its beautifully crafted world.

There is a storymode, but as of writing it's still incomplete, with that final episode a little overdue at this point, however unlike a lot of early access games from the era The Long Dark hails from, it's still being worked on. Even without the story being complete, I'd describe it as an indirect tutorial for the main mode of the game, which is its freeplay sandbox, which has already been very strong for years, and is still seeing updates alongside the storymode. The only thing I really consider it lacking is the option to enable quicksaves in custom sandboxes.",1606785869,1701043075,True,38,2,0.759354054927825928,0,True,False,False

The Long Dark is a magnificent survivalist story-line that truly has you work for goals and the people around you as you progress through the harsh Canadian winter. It's a breathtaking beauty that truly brings your survival skills to the peak of their strength. The exploration this game requires is not for the faint of heart as much of the world you are left to discover can be quite the challenge to navigate. 

I personally have been watching this game grow for years and my what a way it has come! Before playing this game I wouldn’t have even thought such a raw survivalist game could be fun. I remember checking the site almost daily to see when they were gonna release the next story episode and I’m so proud of the game developers and everyone behind the scene making The Long Dark for pushing through the hard times COVID brought.

I really like the graphics of the game, changing weather and the music and sound effects which perfectly complement the atmosphere. 

If you want to complete the achievements in survival mode, play the story part first, or at least turn the game on easy difficulty, because knowing the locations is necessary to survive on higher difficulties. I also recommend completing different challenges, as they require a shorter playing time and at the same time you will have the opportunity to explore different places. 

For inexperienced players, I don't recommend jumping straight into the hardest ""Interloper"" difficulty, unless you enjoy dying over and over for various reasons, where weather, temperature and hunger will be your biggest enemy. Trust me, it can be frustrating :) don't let yourself be put off though, this game is all about knowledge and experience, which you can only get by playing (and also by watching other players' videos about this game, which I recommend if you don't want to learn everything the hard way).

The Long Dark is definitely that game. It avoided a number of early survival genre pitfalls like unrealistic building or the basic action game with a reskin. It also didn't go for hyper-realism where you would need to know what direction a stick has to rub against another stick or you die in the first 15 minutes. 

It fell somewhere in the middle, requiring a reasonable amount of skill from the player and rewarding (through multiple playthroughs) an increased understanding of weather as your threat. It also tends to give you a push towards exploration as opposed to the kind of game where you spawn in and immediately bunker down. Early game is met with a lot of scavenging typically which gives you the energy cushion needed to create a stable base if you choose to. This allows a survival progression of sorts through the game, where an early player simply needs to avoid immediate death and find the next snickers bar. While the mid-late player can invest time and energy into crafting, hunting or more difficult expeditions.

Additionally, due to the chaotic nature of the weather and difficulty of animal combat, you never really feel safe exploring - even late game. This, I would say, is almost a necessity for any survival game - that perpetual reminder that you are still just as weak as you were when you started. And the unfortunate downfall that can kill off your best playthrough and leave you reviewing an otherwise solid strategy. The survival genre is at its best when it can remind a good player that their ego is still their enemy.

Like most great games, The Long Dark doesn't stop at good gameplay, both the audio and visuals are exceptional in their own ways. The graphics have a timeless, almost cartoony look that should age a bit better than the more realistic graphics tend to - it is functional and doesn't detract at all, and at times can lend itself nicely to some of the landscapes. I'm sure the graphics played a big role in the ability to create blinding blizzards and the like which are so incredibly important to the design that I'm not giving it enough credit. I also think this lends well to exploring abandoned homes dotting the landscape - it keeps them dark but also a step away from the horror genre if that makes sense, moderating the players expectations to almost a sombre emotion as you rifle through other folks drawers.

The audio however, is probably my most favorite piece of this game, there is something to be said with being trapped in a hollowed out tree, guaranteed to die, and still somehow enjoying the ambience of it all. Everything is so well done and accurate and you can tell a lot of effort was put into making sure the player can feel the wind and the cold. When I'm not in my basement playing games, I like to hike and ski. The White Mountains Museum has a simulation booth where they show you what the White Mountains, some of the fastest recorded winds in the world - at 231 MPH - sounds like. If you've played this game and been in the booth, you understand that the devs put a lot of work in simulating this experience into the game.

Finally, I love the fact that this game is still regularly updated, one of the best Early Access experiences I've ever had and if nothing else the devs should be rewarded for this alone. There are mountains of impressive ideas that came out of Early Access and went absolutely nowhere. This one succeeded.

This world you can experience it in two separate game modes -Survival & Wintermute- which make of The Long Dark, in fact, two games in one. 

Survival brings you a comprehensive survival experience, that, depending on what level you choose, may range from mild to murder. There's no narrative but survive. For die-hard fans of the genre (which I am not) it can be pretty challenging (& fun). There are not only several & customisable levels of difficulty, but some, diverse challenges to complete as well. For people who prefer to take it lighter & enjoy exploration or who look for more contemplative experience, The Long Dark may too prove to be quite enjoyable. A relaxing, spiritual trip of sorts.

As for Wintermute, it brings you a compelling & well paced adventure spiced up with the same survival mechanics as in  Survival mode, albeit, thankfully, not as challenging. The story is thrilling, its characters & dialogue good.

I enjoy the freedom to roam around and discover different areas within a location. The developers continue to refine the interface, add new locations and improve the gameplay. The game just keeps getting better with time. I believe I will be enjoying this game for some time to come.
Apparently it is time for my yearly update on The Long Dark. The game just keeps getting better. I played the story mode for a little bit, but will wait for the December update before diving back into it. I am playing sandbox with the new areas, updated mechanics and improved graphics. If I could only play one game, this probably be it. Oh, and yesterday I was trampled to death by a moose! Gotta love this game!!!
Well, here we are a year later and I am still loving this game. The developers continue to support the game through new content, map regions, equipment, and yearly special events. Still one of my favorite games of all time. Hope to play more this winter & explore more of the new regions.
Here we are four years after it's release, and this game just keeps getting better and better. The developers continue to improve on the entire game mechanics, while also progressing the story with this year's Chapter 4 release. Just an outstanding job by the developers, truly a Labor of Love!!!!

This game is one of the great examples of how developers evolved from an idea to a full fledged game.

The story mode is pretty good, but I'd say that the survival sandbox is where this game excels.

It has grown so much from there and the world has gotten more varied and beautiful and the artstyle is mesmerising.

The survival experiences is one of the best out there, if you're willing to put up with the cold and lonliness. Depending on the difficulty you choose, it can be a steep learning curve, but you also have the choice to ease into the world of TLD.
It's the survival sandbox with it's hopeless and lonely fight for survival and the ever colder growing world around you. The sound and music design is fantastic and together with the mechanics it makes for such an immersive experience. I could replay it over and over, even though I fail again and again at the Interloper difficulty.

I'd also recommend doing the challenges that surival mode offers, some of them can ease you into the gameplay, if you're not wanting to start or buy the Wintermute story-mode. The triumph I felt when I finally beat ""As the Dead Sleep"" is something I haven't quite felt with another game. 
I enjoy the story-mode and it's a great addition, albeit unfinished as of now, but for me it's not the main draw into the game and not what I'll continue to sink my hours into.

All in all, I personally recommend the Survival Mode over the Story Mode ""Wintermute"", as it's endlessly replayable, but the story has charming characters and a great way to introduce you to the world bit by bit, so getting both of them is a great option as well if you're intruiged by the story.",1700773929,1700773929,True,19,0,0.674052238464355469,0,True,False,False

Do I take a chance and risk getting lost in blizzard? Or do I wait out the storm with minimal supplies? Am I prepared to summit Timberwolf Mountain? Always thinking and planning ahead. With so many updates, the game has just gone to the next level over the past couple of years. New supplies new mechanics,new animals, new regions...and more... This is absolutely a labour of love. Can't put into words how much this game means to me. Just get it. Beware the wildlife!!

 You may like the story mode though - so try it. it also provides a non bossy tutorial as you progress.
 The Devs pay a lot of attention to play input and have, over time implemented a lot of player suggestions. (although I still want a good sled to drag things. ) The game continues to evolve and be worked on which is great as a player.
 Some things get harder, some things get easier.

As soon as I was able to persuade my parents to get it for myself, I was glued to its universe and still find it such a fascinating world even as an adult-- perhaps moreso, because I'm older now and can appreciate its production quality/timeline. It's also incredibly refreshing to be able to play a game that beautifully harnesses natural fear and tension instead of cheap jumpscares or loud noises for the sake of just startling; not only does this game cleverly harness my anxieties in a rather positive and cathartic way, but the psychological terror of fighting every step to survive in a vast open world of snowy regions long since abandoned by their former rulers is absolutely riveting.

And every time I hear the music or see the art style of this game, I am swept back up into the cool windy embrace of those howling lands: The somber yet hopeful cello, the taut apprehensive violin, the flowing ivories of the piano... All of the sound design and art of this game feels so unique and has been such an impact on me growing up, so much so that I'll probably never truly realize just how much its very existence has inspired me and my work/love of creating. 

The concept of surviving as long as you can in the quiet apocalypse is simple, yet expertly executed in my eyes. Everything from scavenging to exploring feels balanced, or like actually trying to survive in the wild, even in the later stages of the game-- my dying to a wolf just before reaching 100 Days is certainly proof of that (and I haven't even tried for 500 yet!). The first time I succumbed to the long dark is also memorable, though reflective of my earlier naivety when I accidentally over-corrected my balance and fell off of the train tracks traversing between Coastal Highway and Mystery Lake. But, as embarrassing as my fatal noob mistake was, I hopped right back into another save to begin anew! And that cycle has certainly continued, with the spirit of open-world survival being loyally and consistently kindled through the game's incredibly immersive atmosphere and passionate well-combined mechanics. It always perfectly scratches that itch I get whenever I need to disconnect my brain from reality and enjoy living in a virtual open world, navigating the copious yet unique regions and exploring what all they have to offer my hoarder side.

I've never had another game enrapture my mind in such an intensely beautiful way like The Long Dark does. Any time a friend even remotely reminds me of this game, I encourage them to get it for themselves if able, in the hopes that they experience even a sliver of the sheer wonder this game has faithfully provided me through the years. It is absolutely worth the purchase in my book, and I don't plan on stopping that hours-on-record count any time soon!

There is a story mode that offers an immersive story set shortly after the first aurora starring the pilot of a small private plane company.
The survival mode is simply that, you are alone in the same wilderness. See how long you can survive.

The gameplay really triggers my love of looting and scavenging, and then organising said loot, planning carefully, timing the use of resources, and basically wondering where 3 hours just went while I re-arranged my inventory. And then having all of that go up in smoke because I became a snack for a wolf :)

The good:
- a great sandbox experience, with large maps and freedom to find your own style of play
- you can really tailor-make your own experience, either by choosing from the multiple difficulties or creating a custom game with granular settings; this makes it good for more casual players as well as those wanting more of a challenge
- looks and sounds beautiful: the voice acting is good, visually the landscapes are stunning, the soundtrack is amazing, and the world audio (such as wind, ice-cracking etc.) not only sounds good but gives you vital information on what is happening around you
- immersive: you constantly feel the threat of your environment; even the HUD has a minimalist design where you just see your basic stats (hunger, thirst, fatigue, body temperature)
- devs are still active and working hard on the game

The not so good:
- the story mode wasn't to my taste and I abandoned it before finishing the first episode; my suggestion is give it a go to learn the gameplay mechanics but if you're not enjoying it, don't give up on the game; strike out on your own in survival, which is definitely the main star of The Long Dark
- no jump mechanics: might sound trivial but getting stuck on terrain because you can't climb a few centimetres can be annoying

Now I haven't played survival mode yet, but if it is anything like the campaign mode, then it must be one hell of a good time because I have been having so much fun playing just the campaign. You have to survive, you have to make sure you monitor your food, water, and sleep levels. You need to repair your clothing, and you are constantly searching for supplies that will help you survive. Overall, I give this game a solid 10/10 it's still in development for the campaign, but a few chapter are already out and the devs are still working on getting it completed, but for the price and the story so far it is a solid buy.

Update: I decided to replay the campaign this Summer and I will say that everything looks so much better now. The animals, the environment, the animations, it's all so very well done. There were even NPC's that weren't even in the game's campaign when I did my first play through. All in all, progress is slow on the updates, but the quality that the dev team keeps pumping out makes the wait worth it for each update.

Then you have the Wintermute story mode, Challenges, and Badges. Another thing I'd like to add is that Hinderland is putting efforts, in keeping this game fresh. It's a December routine for me to boot up this game and relax in Canadian  wilderness. Except that damn bear. (I hate him every time I encounter one, and man I shit my pants when I was attacked by an aurora bear for the first time).

UPDATE 2:

2023 - Tales From The Far Territory Expansion Pack made this Game more interesting. The developers are taking a sweet time, but the end result is always something I love. Still waiting for Chapter - 5 guys.",1560424785,1700641899,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's not non-stop action, but a long slow trek into the harsh reality of isolation and introspection. Depending on the Difficulty you play on, your experience can be leisurely, exciting, or excruciating. Forgetting you have raw meat on you can turn a quick nap into the end of the line. There are Challenge Modes, Survival Badges to unlock, and custom game settings to individualize your experience exactly how you want it. So much possibility in Survival.

And then there is Story Mode. It's a fairly well-crafted narrative, that in my case, adds depth and backstory to the various locales I've become so familiar with in Survival. It's not perfect, and it feels like the Difficulty setting is a step easier than the corresponding Difficulty in Survival Mode, so it's an altogether easier experience to survive. But that's likely a good thing. It would seem Story Mode is the expected Starting Point for new players, so having it easier with a built in Save/Respawn system might be a good introduction. It may also give new Survival players a false sense of security and get them swiftly killed in equivalently survivable situations in Story Mode. Pros and Cons I guess. I'm just rambling at this point.

GAME GOOD. 9/10 WOULD RECOMMEND.

EDIT: DLC Tales From the Far Territory

I have quite enjoyed the new content this first DLC offers, with more still to be released. It's releasing slower than initially promised but I don't mind. I'm in no rush. I've played over 1000 hours of TLD, so if they need to take their time to finish the DLC (or episode 5 for that matter) they've earned some leniency imo. 

The new cooking recipes and ingredients make me giddy (I'm a huge nerd for fancy cooking in games) and the new gear and weapons are quite nice. The Curator's Rifle paired with the rifle holster makes carrying around a heavy gun viable. As of this writing the 2nd of 3 new regions is about to release, and it seems very intriguing to me. When I first bought the DLC I figured I'd easily pay $7 each just for the new regions. Having more places to explore (and loot!) is what it's all about. I'd rate the DLC a solid 8/10, despite the bugs that got introduced (and mostly squashed) along the way.

The campaign is fairly well written but the amount of empty nothingness of back and forth walking is insane during the second act. Spend 10 minutes walking across rail lines to then walk all the way back to then walk all the way back again to collect the cell tower parts. I was enjoying the game a lot until this portion of the game. The game turned into waste time in empty open world for way longer than you should to get to the part of the game you want to play. I understand that it is supposed to be a barren wasteland scenario but my MAN this is not the way it should be done.

At the moment the story campaign is still unfinished (though growing steadily), and has evolved noticeably since its first chapter. Three major game modes exist: the story campaign, survival, and challenge mode (of which there's about half a dozen, added to very occasionally). In all of them, you have to survive the harsh, endless winter on Great Bear Island, somewhere in the Canadian arctic. Wildlife can be threatening, but the elements are the biggest obstacle to survival, particularly if you get lost in a blizzard (automapping only exists in campaign mode; in the others you have to find your way around by visual landmarks and manual mapping of terrain). A word about challenge mode: Only a very few of them are easily completed, but none are so challenging as to make one want to give up (though As the Dead Sleep comes close). The game has a distinctly Canadian flavor to it, unsurprisingly given the developer, but anyone used to harsh, lonely northern winters will find much to identify with in setting and tone. They call it the quiet apocalypse for a reason, after all.

To update this review, Hinterland is proving that sometimes extraordinarily long dev times are worth it. With the release of the first two episodes for the Tales from the Far Territory, there's even more of Great Bear to explore, new gear, animals, the works.

I bought this game for $20 in Early Access, and it has been worth every single cent I paid ten times over. The continued support and expansion by the Hinterland team is the sort of thing that most companies and players dream of, and the setting is immersive and visceral.

Story Mode has been criticised, especially by long term players, but I found the story engaging and the limitations placed by it to be a new challenge. Ep 5 is coming up, and I am so keen for it I can't keep still.

Criticism has also been placed on the Season Pass model via Tales from the Far Territory. I understand people's frustration that the promised timeline hasn't been adhered to, especially with Story Mode taking so long, however, the studio has continuously released content for the entirety of the game's lifespan, and hey, game devs still gotta eat. They also pride themselves on games without crunch, and that is clear in the care they take with each release, especially with their troubles in the real world (such as the Unity announcements and the Canadian wildfires earlier in the year)

I've nominated this game for the Steam Awards (2023), and I am disappointed I can't nominated it for multiple categories. It deserves so many awards I can't even express.

TLD takes place on a Northern Canadian island right after a geomagnetic disaster shuts down everything electronic for good. The phenomenon has also made wolves, bears, [strike]mooses[/strike] [strike]meese[/strike] moose and many other animals aggressive and brought an endless winter to the North. And you have to survive through all that...and then some.

I'll list the good and the mixed (there isn't anything outright bad in this game):

[b]The good:[/b]

+ The survival mechanics are remarkably well done, with great balance between being realistic and being fun. There's nothing redundant, nor do the four basic needs feel overbearing. You don't drop dead the second one of them reaches zero - instead, the slide towards death is often slow and dramatic. Of course, you CAN die a quick, messy death, but here's the thing: you most likely won't if you just pay attention.

There are very few ways to die instantly, and you can recover from near-death experiences. That's where the beauty of this game's survival aspect is: a single close call will [i]probably[/i] not result in your death, but inability to adapt, plan ahead and prepare for everything will.

+ The game has a great atmosphere, both indoors and outdoors. Survival Mode in particular really makes you feel like you're the last human on earth, and you'll likely find yourself looking at a beautiful sunset sooner or later. It's hard to put into words - I recommend you check out some screenshots of the game if you're curious.

+ The Survival mode is where this game truly shines: you have plenty to do and see, and you're pretty much free to do it at your own pace and style. There is no set goal, and death is the only ending (see the closing paragraph, though). While the game world itself varies only slightly between playthroughs, much of the rest is randomized: items, wildlife, weather, etc.

If you so prefer, you can also customize your survival experience when you start a new game. You can set numerous aspect (such as spawn rates for various items and wildlife, weather, etc.) to your liking, so if you want something different from the ""standard"" difficulty levels, you're completely free to make the game as lenient or merciless as you please.

+ Many other mechanics of the game are also very well thought out. If you get injured, you can't just use a medkit to fix everything. You'll have to tend to your wounds and sometimes medicate yourself to recover. You'll also have to think about your outfit: do you want to prioritize one particular aspect, such as warmth, wind-proofing or physical protection, or try to find some sort of balance? Can you cook a can of beans on a campfire without burning it? Your character is not a pro survivalist: they have to become one.

[b]The mixed:[/b]

* Wintermute (the story mode) episodes vary slightly in terms of quality, but in short: although the story, side quests and characters are generally interesting, fetch quest-iness tends to be a core mechanic in them. You'll do quite a bit of walking back and forth.

* The game tends to have rather lengthy periods between major updates, and doubly so between Wintermute episodes. When updates do come, however, they tend to be fairly large in terms of new content. There usually aren't too many bugs in them, although I've read about people having technical issues after each update. For what it's worth, I haven't had a single game-breaking bug over the years I've owned the game. As of November 21st, 2023, this issue seems to have worsened (particularly for the Tales from the Far Territory DLC, but that doesn't really fall within the scope of a base game review).


Despite my very positive personal experience, I still wouldn't recommend this game to everyone. The reason for this is simple: it can be slow-paced. Hell, it can be [i]relaxing[/i]. This isn't a flaw in the game, but a characteristic. If you want something action-filled with set goals, then you should probably try something else. But if you want a realistic winter survival experience with varying amounts of peaceful existence, then you'll probably love The Long Dark. Your playstyle [i]will[/i] define how much trouble you find yourself in.

If you enjoy realistic and atmospheric survival and making your own story, then this game is worth 9/10 points. If not, well, you should probably look at something else first.",1637841580,1700600875,True,3,0,0.557675600051879883,0,True,False,False

[b][u]Pros-[/u][/b]
[list][*]Challenging game, easy to learn but hard to master. [*] NO ZOMBIES OR INFECTEDS [*]Super Community, on Steam and online- one of the least toxic on Steam (though Trolls exist everwhere...) [*]Suspension of disbelief is relatively easy with this game. Some mechanics and content are not IRL realistic, but none are so unrealistic that you have to be muy loco to understand and work with them. [*]Dedicated development team and studio. They are very active on the Steam forums and their own online forums, very open and transparent, as much as they can be without spoiling Story Mode and other end game content. Don't let the recent shill-trolling attempts to discredit Hinterland fool you. A few trolls and their alts are doing a job trying to make the Devs look bad, much credit to Hinterland for not smashing them down, and handling it all very civilly. [*]Multiple Difficulty modes to choose from, from ""relatvely easy"" to ""Insanity mode"" - Pilgrim, Voyageur, Stalker and Interloper. Each has it's own challenges, and have you adjusting your playstyle to adapt and survive. [*]Permadeath. All Difficulty Modes.  Every choice you make may be the one that gets you killed, or saves your life. For another day, at least. [*]Immersive art style and music. Art is a watercolor painting, Unity style, that suits the game very well. Not overly complex, not overly simple. The somewhat stark feeling of the art fits the stark nature of the game well. The music is haunting, foreboding and set to locations and  events well also. It enhances the tension wihtout being overly loud and dramatic, like some survival games are. It's a personal and subjective thing. I love the art style and music, but your mileage may vary. Widely.  [/list]

[b][u]Cons-[/u][/b] [*] Game can feel a bit tedious after you have survived for a long time. Especially if you ""play it safe"" and hang out on only 1 map, in one base, and don't explore and take chances. However, the game is not finished yet, and new content and Story Mode (when it comes out) should help with this. And the Challenges- (more linear, timed, and set goal-oriented , appropriately-named games are a really nice change of pace if Sandbox Mode becomes too drawn out. [*]Updates have slowed recently, with new bugs that need fixing, as the game nears completion. Honestly, this is more a Con because of the recent plague of trolls on the forums trying to discredit the Devs. That is more troublesome and aggravating than the actual wait for new content, bug fixes and mechanics tweaking. For me, at least. The Trolls will say otherwise. And will downvote this review as soon as they see the ""Positive"" thumbs up icon. *SMH*

All in all, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a real challenge, and is looking for a more realistic survival situation than the many zombie and monster based survival games on the market. But... it is still in development, still unfinished. But the game is becoming much more than was originally envisioned by the Devs, promising a much richer, more immersive open-world Sandbox survival game, with a bigger and more packed Story Mode to come. But patience is key right now. Some of us have it, others do not. If you don't you may want to wait for v1.0 and Story Mode to hit full release before you buy.

For me it was worth paying full price for, definitely worth it if you can wait to get it on sale. Hundreds of hours played already, and I see myself playing hundreds more as new content is added, and after Story Mode is released. But your mileage may vary.

[h1][b]UPDATED REVIEW[/b][/h1]

Yep. I am still playing. Yep. The game is still my favorite game. 

After the game went gold, there were some bugs (still a few around), but the devs and tech guy do listen to all feedback, positive and negative, and have taken steps to adress the bugs as quickly as they can humanly do so, and to make changes t the game to make it better. An update (possibly a big one for Survival Mode) is in the works for Decemeber of 2017, with the Story Mode's remaining episodes pushed back into 2018 so Hinteland can make changes and make the Wintermute Story Mode more enjoyable. 

I was not thrilled with Wintermute when it first came out, myself.  And I will honestly say I felt disappointed. But... I had played Survival Mode for so long, that when a new game, similar to Survival, but different, that did not let me do my own thing, all of the time, came out... there was a shock reaction. 

I have recently started playing the Wintermute Episodes again, and have had enough time to digest that it is a completely diferent game, with mechanics I know and enjoy, and a more linear direction.  I still love Survival Mode, and play it often. And after starting Wintermute over, and playing it without expecting it to be Survival Mode with NPC's, I am quite enjoying it. Still a bit ""tutorially"" for a long time player, but for my husband and kids 9who play on the XBox One version), it was good to have the teaching. Not sure if Hinterland plans to make changes to Episodes 1 & 2, but I have a gut feeling that Episodes 3, 4 & 5 will be different. These devs DO listen t player feedback, both positive and negative. And they do make changes based on it, as long as it fits their vision for their game. 

I am thrilled with the game, still, and expect to remain so for many hundreds of hours yet to come. 

Of course, as always, Your Mileage May Vary. Widely.

Simply put, it is a stunning game with visuals straight out of a Emily Carr painting, a simplistic overlay, well thought out game-play mechanics and an evolving story line. It is by far, one of the best games I have EVER played. And I know what I'm talking about. I have been up and down the board in terms of survival games and I have never been so heavily involved in any other game. It has come a long way since it was first conceptualised and I am keen to see where it goes from here. 


Some Pros:
- No zombies. Just Mother Nature out to break you.
- A multitude of maps designed to challenge you in each and every way.
- Real-life effects and dynamics.
- Beautiful, serene and tense all at the same time.

Things and Milestones to look forward to:
- More Challenges, Maps, Items!
- Introduction of new animals, skills and other exciting things!
- Also looking forward to the Far Territory Expansion. Looks pretty cool!

Things that the Devs could look into:
- Greater food diversity, because eating pork+beans and peaches can get tiring after a while => more non-perishable food items. (Frontier Comforts update)
- While I know that the Devs have explicitly said that multiplayer is out of the question, I would like to see a Co-op player experience.

I only played the story mode so far. As of now, 4 episodes have been released (last one might be released next year), each offering about 30 hours of playtime.

Globally I find the survival gameplay fairly easy (but I dont remember if I selected a difficulty level before starting). Only the QTE are a bit annoying (I am just awfully bad at pressing buttons), but those are very rare, so it is fine I guess.

I find the story mode plot entertaining even if a bit weird (I am not sure yet where this is all really going).

I love the game simple art style and I really enjoy walking through the beautiful snowing desolated landscape. I just cant seem to stop taking screenshots (press F10 to take screenshots without UI).

Although it's a survival game, death is inevitable and, in my opinion, inspires the game's title. There is a story mode planned for release by the end of this year, but for anyone who buys the game right now the sole experience will be the sandbox mode.

Players find themselves randomly thrown into the wilderness with nothing but the clothes they wear, a few matches, a sleeping bag, and maybe a flare or accelerant if they're lucky. The time of day, location and weather conditions are random so it is even possible to start in the middle of the night during a blizzard. However, even starting in the middle of a sunny afternoon, it will still be cold and bleak, and the player will soon need to contend with freezing, starvation, dehydration and fatigue. All of this is represented in an intuitive status screen that players will refer to often. In order to manage these needs, players must seek shelter and find what remains of civilization, which has been devastated by a mysterious geomagnetic event. This event has also disturbed some of the natural wildlife, and wolves that roam the wilderness are unusually hostile and will attack if the player wanders too close.

Even if the player does find shelter and supplies, almost everything found will degrade over time. This includes food, clothing, a hatchet every time it is used to chop wood or butcher meat, a rifle whenever it is fired, or even a toolkit whenever it is used to try to maintain the hatchet and rifle. This degradation mechanic causes the player to value every decision and plan carefully to maximize resources while continuing the struggle to survive. Although the game is early access, this degradation mechanic has been in the game from the beginning and is considered a core mechanic, so this feature will almost certainly remain in the game all the way until its official launch.

Above all, the reason why I love this game is its atmosphere. Because everything degrades, I always feel a sense of urgency. Even if I kill a deer, harvest and cook the meat, and have a whole locker full of venison steaks in my base, I know that it won't be long before I need more. On top of that, if I use a knife or hatchet to help with harvesting the deer, or a rifle or bow and arrows to kill it, I also know that eventually those tools will wear out, so I also must be vigilant in my search to find replacements. Ultimately, the player will run out of tools and materials to keep those tools in good repair. Although a player may struggle on beyond this point, the odds of survival will decrease further and further until, eventually, the player must face death. Although to some this may sound frustrating, on the contrary that challenge of pushing the boundaries is a large part of the appeal. Because tools are limited, the player is encouraged to think of creative solutions on how to minimize the drain of resources.

Adding to the atmosphere are also the sound and graphic style. Especially since some of the recent updates, the Long Dark really is beautiful -- that is, when it isn't eerie or terrifying. Because the time of day and weather both change, there are lots of different possible settings. It could be a bright and clear afternoon, or it might be midnight with a blizzard that has reduced visibility to three feet. It could be a beautiful sunrise looking out across the landscape from a lookout tower or it might be evening, a thick fog, and the eerie sound of wolves howling somewhere beyond.

Now, I will end this review with a few points of criticism. Although another wonderful aspect of this game is the sense of exploration and discovery, that does diminish over time. The regions generally have very little that is randomized in terms of the locations themselves. The result of this is that the player eventually learns all of the locations, has very little chance of becoming lost, and no longer sees anything new when traveling the map to gather supplies. I would love it if the game's world could be procedurally generated in the future, but that may be too much to ask because ultimately The Long Dark is being developed with a story mode in mind. Despite this criticism, the world is detailed and fun to re-explore.

The other criticism concerns the wolves which, along with the weather, currently represent the primary antagonist to the player. To beginners, the wolves may seem insurmountable because the wolves roam the world in large numbers and are always hostile to the player except on the game's easiest difficulty setting (in which case they are never hostile and always run away). On the other hand, to experienced players wolves become easy to handle and a convenient source of food. I will address my own criticism by emphasizing that the game is still in early access and, unlike other early access titles, gets monthly, substantive updates. In sum, the wolves are generally a fun antagonist but still a work in progress that will continue to be improved.

Bottomline: If you like survival games, you should pick this up. I understand some people have doubts about early access. If that describes yourself, you might also consider checking out a let's play to get a better sense of what the game is like. But if you do, be sure to find one that isn't more than a month old (although watch one that's a year old if you want to see how far the game has come in that time). Also, avoid watching too much footage so that you can enjoy that sense of discovery I discussed earlier as much as possible. Lastly, watch the movie The Grey, which bears some striking similarities to The Long Dark in both its setting and theme.

With over 400 hours, there are still so many parts of the world that I haven't explored, and many that I keep going back to because I love the safety and coziness they provide. The vast, open world will give you this sense of adventure and desire to explore but will also leave you feeling lonely at times. It's just you and the wildlife in survival mode, there are no NPCs or anyone to communicate with, but that's kind of the beauty of it. It's a challenge, but something as simple as killing a rabbit or finding a box of matches can feel like a huge victory. 

Each decision you make must be planned in advance if you want to survive long term. Since survival mode is perma-death, one wrong decision can end your run whether you've survived 5 days or 500 days. Although survival mode is my favorite game mode, The Long Dark also offers a story mode and several challenges you can complete separate from survival mode. 

A lot of people complain that the developers make false promises and are way too slow at producing content, but for the most part, they have delivered everything they've said they would. They are a small studio and if you've owned the game for as long as I have (January 1st, 2016), then you know how much work has gone into it. It has been amazing to see how much the game has grown. I loved it from the start and so far it just continues to get better. 

I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys survival games on any level. The game has difficulty levels for people who want the most extreme challenge as well as those who just want to explore without any interference from dangerous wildlife.

PROS:
- It runs very smooth and looks atmospheric albeit a little bland.
- If you're into strategic exploration, then you'll have hundreds of hours of fun here.

CONS:
- Serial killer wildlife that breaks the realism and turns an otherwise fun exploration into a repetitive drill unless you play on the easiest difficulty (or custom, which is probably preferable).
- There isn't really anything beyond exploration - no building, hardly any crafting and certainly no progression in that way, and many crucial tools are technically speaking finite. (There is a way around it, but it ties your hands considerably, so you end up having to repeat the same actions over and over again. Surviving isn't difficult if you hole up in a shelter near a food source and just run around collecting sticks, fishing/hunting and boiling water, but this tamagotchi-style survival gets pretty old soon.)
- The controls are unintuitive. The mouse is needed for choices that could have also had keybinds and there is no way to select a specific weapon - the game selects one that it thinks is best and then you have to cycle through the rest - by which time the rabbit runs away. It's the same with light sources, etc.
- The female character's voice comments are unrealistic - women just don't talk that way. It sounds like something a man would say but read by a woman.

CONCLUSION:

Perma death is not an option. If you die your save is gone. Absolutely HATE this. Perma death should be an option.

A slight breeze will cut your walking speed in half.

If you take the time to draw out a decent map, you cant really use it. There is no marker to show your location on it and the drawings don't show enough detail to make navigating it possible.

You can't rest without a bedroll or bed. Example, I narrowly escaped hypothermia by reaching a house but it was dark and I spawned without matches and without a bedroll. I couldn't see anything in the dark house and had no bedroll to put on the ground so I stood there in the dark and died of exhaustion before the sun could rise so I could see and find the bed.

Starting a fire, in a house, in a wood stove, with a stack of dry papers, a box of matches, and tinder, fails just as often as starting one outside with a magnifying glass.

After 100 hours, these mechanics have really started to ruin the game for me. However, I'd still recommend it since I got over 100 hours of out it before it started to piss me off.",1612755556,1699814980,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is a challenging and fairly realistic survival game, with two built in game modes, Wintermute, the episodic story mode with challenges all of its own and Survival, where surviving is the only objective and death the only end. In both modes predators add to the challenge of surviving and death is an ever looming prospect.

For those looking for the challenge of survival mode and the structure of story mode, you can attempt one of several objective based challenges, where the full harshness of survival mode enhances the difficulty of completing these challenges. Manual saves are not possible so be prepared to invest serious time into the challenge, or you can depart and return later or another day, but only if you find a way to save your progress. Some of these challenges are time based enhancing the difficulty even further. I enjoyed the game so much I recently purchased it on Steam as well, allowing me to play on my laptop when traveling without the Xbox.

TLD allows players to immerse themselves in a survival style experience, from the safety and comfort of their own homes. Much of the survival information contained within the game is accurate but it is not a survival simulator or trainer. Wintermute allows players to learn the gameplay and survival skills without losing everything, should they die. Survival mode has 4 difficulties plus a custom option where you can adjust the game parameters, effectively creating your own experience however changing certain parameters can have unforeseen consequences, making the game even more challenging than you'd expect.

Overall a very enjoyable and well thought out game, with regular updates to improve it and to provide a better experience for players. If you are new to survival games, this is an excellent one to start with, I've not played others so don't know how it compares but it is enjoyable, has a high degree of realism and provides players with significant challenge and there is also a wealth of information online, with a vibrant community to aid gameplay.",1699265590,1699266124,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In a gaming sphere overflowing with futuristic sagas and action-packed storylines, ""The Long Dark"" brings us back to the harsh reality of survival. It's a breath of fresh, cold air in the survival genre, setting players in the aftermath of a geomagnetic disaster in the vast, frozen wilderness.

### Gameplay:
""The Long Dark"" is not your typical survival game. It's a contemplative, exploration-based survival challenge that pits the player against the ruthless cold, wildlife, and their own hunger and thirst. Every decision can lead to life or death, echoing the narrative of a quiet apocalypse where Mother Nature is the only real adversary. It's a brilliant rendition of the 'less is more' philosophy, where the silence of the cold wilderness gnaws at your nerves, making survival feel like a significant achievement.

### Graphics:
The game's aesthetic, with its somber palette, reflects the isolation and vastness of the wilderness impeccably. The stark contrast between the white snow and the dark nights adds a layer of reality to the virtual survival experience. 

### Soundtrack:
The subtle yet eerie soundtrack complements the desolate, cold environment, enhancing the feeling of loneliness and the constant threat of death lurking around.

### Replayability:
With over 4,000 hours recorded by one player, it's evident that ""The Long Dark"" possesses a magnetic allure that keeps players coming back. The ever-present challenge, driven by the game’s dynamic weather system and the vast explorable area, offers a new experience with each playthrough.

### Conclusion:
""The Long Dark"" is a game that doesn't just entertain, but also evokes a sense of respect for the relentless forces of nature. It's a meditative journey that tests one's ability to endure, adapt, and survive against all odds. The poetic solitude it offers, coupled with the harsh lessons of survival, makes it a masterpiece that stands out in a crowd of conventional survival games.

old reviews:

tl;dr: I don't recommend the game for 28-30€, wait for sale!! (15€ would be decent for game in its current state). Í will still put thumbs up since the survival is so damn fun

- I LIKE AND RECOMMEND the sandbox experience (try Interloper for a quick game :), but not for 30€ price!
- I cannot recommend the Story mode, see below:

******
The new Story Mode came out. The ""Story Mode"" is really a pipeline tutorial which for a 'seasoned' player is really frustrating. Really ""You have to gather wood to make a fire"", ""You have to EAT to survive"". Did it really take all this time for you to come up with this Hinterland? The sandbox so far has been a great experience and will continue to be so.

1. The entire Ep1 should be named ""Tutorial"", and there should be an option to SKIP this! Most of us already played the game for years so we know how to make fire etc!

2. The UI should have option to revert to the old one. The change after Faithful Cartographer (8.6.2017) bought some good things, but the UI is not one of them. So, have an option to switch to old one. For example an option to select is looting a ""click"" or ""click and hold"" <<-- ANNOYING

************
My older review about Sandbox features (after Faithful Cartographer 8.6.2017)
The sandbox can be really challenging and enjoyable!

You have to manage your resource from the first day, nothing should go to waste. After you get the hang of it you will get used to managing everything, food, cold, gear, water, wildlife, guns, harvesting and most of all WEIGHT, everything weighs too much always.. 

There is really no downtime in apocalypse. If you decide to just play cards and waste time, you will waste your precious calories/rest when you could be harvesting, gathering, mending, fixing, skinning, cooking, melting and boiling water, killing fish/deer/wolves etc, gathering wood, sticks coal and whatever. You should also be studying fishing, guns, survival. You should make yourself clothes from those animals you kill.. But don't do it too much inside or you will get cabin fever. Don't eat meat from predators too much (get parasites!).

Decide what to take with you when going somewhere, and then when you think you got everything you need, you get pinned down by 2 day blizzard with no shelter close by..

If all 6 were lined up on a table (not sure how I'd fit the last two on but hey) to choose one to aid my survival... I could simply not look past the (to me) now legendary Pinnacle Peaches!
Man I have perished soooo many times in this game since early access release.. Falling off cliffs, wolf attacks, bear mauls, burning oneself (Fire and Electric) to death! Frozen a million times beach-combing & running round with no clothes on... Bleed outs, parasites, full body frostbite sucks, man even Cabin Fever believe it or not... BUT I always ensure to have one tin of Pinnacle Peaches tucked away ready to go down fighting with that last gulp of Quality Peaches (Halved) to savour every individual last moment... starvation never has, and never will be a cause of death... now get out there long darkers, spread the word of Pinnacle Peaches to bring peace to the world (but not Halved) and get to the game to take down those weak as-bears and combat that super-deadly Ice,,, remember this super helpful tip.. Wolves don't like Hunting-Rifles ;)

Edit: One of the best Single Player games in the past decade. When this hit the alpha early access in September 2014 and purchased when there was this very expanded rough sandbox survival. It had so much promise. 9 years later. It remains unfinished with 5 episodes to be completed and won't be until 2024 (there'll be some form of media to try and 'celebrate' a 10th anniversary angle). There seems to at one point been this big shift from the main story to focusing on DLC and survival Content - which is also unfinished.. I have had this game uninstalled for the past 18month. 
I understand the trials and tribulations Indie studios have... yet Stardew Valley was a one person project and probs the most successful indie game of all time. So this i the benchmark in my opinion when folk use the 'small indie studio' fallacy. The studio have announced that episode 5 will be done at some point in 2024. However, by this point in time... I really don't trust them any longer. I won't be purchasing their next project.... even my beloved Pinnacle Peaches can't save this and my tears have been frozen for too long.

That's for the tl;dr folks out there ;)


[olist]
[*]Overall scenario:
Here you are, all alone in the harsh climate of a wintery northern Canada. Putting your wits against the brutal force of nature.
The game is about collecting resources like food, tools and wood (for a fire), plus finding or crafting clothes that are actually suitable for the environment (you start with jeans, a sweater and sneakers!).
In storyline mode, there is an event chain to follow, too.

[*]Immersive:
The Long Dark is one of the most beautiful survival games I have ever seen.
The scenery is very pretty to look at, environmental effects such as wind howl, blizzards, fog and lighting really leave the player with the impression to actually ""be there"".
When your toon is cold, you actually feel cold. (Due to the shivering sound effects)
When your toon is hurt, you can almost feel the pain. (Limping animation feels rather realistic).
These are just a few examples of how the game's effects create a sense of immersion.

[*]Every decision counts!
This game is for a mature audience.
Not in the way that content is profane or vulgar or anything.
But merely in the way that there is no whining and no do-overs:
*You* decide wether to attack that wolf.
*You* decide wether to go on a harvesting run during an upcoming blizzard.
And you have to face the consequences of every decision you make.

The developers have done an excellent job in making you think before you act, and plan your day for efficiency and safety.
Because, let it be known, [b] there is no do-overs in survival! [/b]
Yes, you can save the game and resume later.
But: Once resumed, the saved game is void - you can't just screw up and load the same game again to try something else.
If you screw up, you screwed up for good.
If you die, you're dead for good.
I like that.

[*]Not a shooter. Not an RPG. Not multiplayer.
This game is *not* about mindless slaughter of mobs.
This game is *not* about catching and taming wolves.
This game is *not* multiplayer.
And it never will be.
If that is what you are looking for - move on!
I'll put it this way:
All you hobbyist wolf-tamers and level-68-WoW-troll-owners - this game is about realism. In reality, in a one-on-one melee fight with a REAL wolf, the average human doesn't stand a chance. And the game conveys that pretty well.

[*]Developers and update cycle:
A truckload of content has been added since I first played The Long Dark, and there seems to be more to come.
The developers are nicely responsive in fixing bugs, and also they implement a lot of the community feedback.
(Not including repeated requests of the hobbyist wannabe wolf tamers lobby, mind you - Devs have repeatedly stated that tameable wildlife, particularly predators, is NOT going to happen.)

[*]Community:
Look at the community hub here to get an impression.
People are creating maps, guides, etc, and generally helping each other in a nice and constructive way.
Even a bit of fan fiction: https://steamcommunity.com/app/305620/discussions/9/1694914736001042410/
Just excellent.

305620,55353888,76561198006525169,0,139,1772,0,1772,1698118172,"I had originally reviewed the game in 2019, and all the complaints I had for it in that review, have been addressed, so I deleted it and started this review from scratch. I still do not recommend it, but, hopefully in the coming years will get addressed, like the stuff in my old review got addressed. 

These are the various reasons why I do not recommend it (played 17~ hours of Survival mode to base it off of):

1. You have no option for a melee weapon. You can use your Hunting Knife against wolves the struggle mechanic, but you can't equip it manually as a weapon and preemptively start swinging at them before you struggle. It might be nice to equip a spear and attack a wolf from range, or use it to do spear fishing. 

2. Ranged weapons are extremely limited. You can find a bow, but not craft it and can find a revolver or rifle. There are no javelins, crossbows, throwing axes, slingshots, or other guns (ie double barrel shotgun or blunderbuss). 

3. The revolver isn't useful for anything other than chasing off wolves or killing rabbits. And you find the majority of ammo for it, and it won't do much of anything against a bear, moose, or deer. So not entirely sure its purpose in the game, as its pretty hard to find a revolver in the first place. 

4. Ammo is quite rare, but at least there is ammo reloading kits. Unfortunately gunpowder is exceedingly rare, or you can scavenge super valuable flares for gunpowder, though they tend to be better for emergency lights or scaring off wild life. 

5. Without tools there isn't a lot you can do. You can't break up branches or limbs without an axe and most furniture in buildings requires the axe. You need the knife to do carcass cutting or for destroying cloth furniture (ie pillows). Then you need the prybar for opening locked containers (no lockpicks that I ever found) and hacksaw for disassembling everything else. However, tools are exceedingly rare and as far as I can tell, you can't craft them either. 

6. Crafting seems half-baked, even 4 years later (though can't remember if crafting was a thing back in 2019). There is an extreme scarcity of recipes available. And you are often at the mercy of the RNG for getting many other things. Like getting a fishing hook. Its not like we can mine ores in caves (which often have nothing in them, but I digress), and smelt the stuff down and then hammer out objects we might need. 

7. We can't grow our own food, but have to fish or hunt... which both requires specialized resources, specialized tools, and high skill levels to be successful without dying. And getting the knowledge to do that is both time consuming and extremely dangerous. Because the thing is, raw meat attracts wolves and bears, and they are faster than you and aggro from quite a distance away and unless you literally have the rifle with a round loaded, you are often screwed. And my 17 hours I never had the rifle. 

8. In terms of ""base building"" we have very little options. We can't craft our own containers and a ton of the objects in a structure can't be destroyed. We can't craft our own furniture or move existing furniture around. We can't setup candles or torches, to light up the area. 

9. Either my game is bugged, or I'm missing something, but I had all these items that claimed to be something I could brew tea with, but couldn't ever brew tea with them. Things like rose hips, old man lichen, and reichi mushrooms. No matter how many of them I had in my inventory. 

10. Finding upgrade clothing is a chore. Repairing them is even worse, as you never have enough cloth or cured leather. Also never could figure out how to cure leather; had all these hides, but no idea how to use them. Also clothing seems to be a miss-mash of styles, as I never could find an entire outfit that would match color wise. Honestly, I looked like a Christmas tree, with all the reds, whites, greens, etc...

11. The game now has modding support, unfortunately, it doesn't seem that easy to mod, as it uses ILLCPP, and requires a custom loader. Bepinex is usually the best for modding support, but it requires the assembly_csharp.dll type of data storage. Unfortunately all of my issues listed, can't be solved with mods. 

12. Loot scarcity is pretty bad. Like sure you'll find food and water and burnables often enough, but crafting resources, ammo, fuel for your lantern, or tools, is few and far between. 

13. The world map is improperly oriented. So if you use charcoal to map your location, and then compare your location to the world map, you'll find that you'd have to rotate the world map to the right, to have it correctly aligned. This totally screws up my sense of navigation and then I look at where the exit should be to an area on the world map and then look for it in the wrong spot in the local area map.

14. Found a lot of notes for mementos. I've visited the locations of several of them and never found anything. 

15. Perks feel under used and really wish there was a larger selection of them. Also they still take forever to earn. 

16. Skills feel under used and really wish there was more of them. Things like chopping skill for increasing wood yield / decreasing time needed to do it, first aid skill, for creating natural cures or such for dealing with wounds, etc...

I could go on, but I think you get the idea. If you want a harsh winter survival game this is for you, but after playing 15 ingame days, I'm just so fed up with mechanics that I've given up on it. It was a harsh survival, for the first 10 days, but now on day 15 I have enough food/water stockpiled to last for 30 days and I'm honestly not enjoying these issues.

I hadn't touched the game in 4 years (first time was 2019). Hopefully in a year or two, my issues will get addressed, as all of them in 2019 got addressed.",1569862670,1698119956,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's nothing to be confused about, Raphael van Lierop is an idjit who doesn't know the difference between a service that rents you access to games (like Game Pass) and a virtual machine provider (GeForce Now). One is a service that lets you play any game on it for a flat fee, the other is a computer you rent time on but provides you with 0 games. Timesharing for powerful computers is a concept that goes back to the very earliest days of mainframe computing in the 60's. That it was *ever* an issue that legal owners of this game could play it on any device of their choosing, including their own dedicated slice of a more power computer, is bonkers. If I could get a refund for this I would because such a garbage person doesn't deserve my money.

Edit: I was mistaken here, this particularly dev is only pushing the anti-consumer lie that GFN is a ""Platform"" in the vein of Stadia or Play Store or EGS. They want you to believe that nVidia is selling access to games illegally, which is not now nor has ever been true. Every game you or I play using the computer we are renting from nVidia has been legally purchased on the Steam platform.  The dev is either ignorant, an idiot, or trying to extort money from their ""protest"" about us gamers what legally tried to play our legally purchased games on the computer of our choosing. Next thing you know they'll demand Dell or HP get their approval before you're allowed to install your games on the computer you bought at Best Buy. Playing a game on GFN is *no* different from renting time on an Amazon cloud server with a GPU to play your games, only Nvidia has done the hard work of installing windows and getting everything working nicely for you. NO DIFFERENCE IN UNDERLYING TECH OR OPERATION FROM DOING IT YOURSELF.

Just remember, when the long dark dev says that GFN is a ""platform"" they are wrong, and they may be deliberately lying in order to confuse the issue and make you think you being able to play games using nVidia's computer rental service is the same thing as Sony giving it away on PSN. Do not fall for this false narrative.  If I had known how scummy this dev is I never would have bought this game, if I could get a refund I would.

Original:
The dev wants nVidia to pay them money for the privilege of you playing a game you purchased legitimately but on GeForce Now and not a computer in your home. No dev should be trying to double-dip on our purchases by telling us we have to pay extra to play on a specific computer. Remember Net Neutrality and not letting the ISP's charge us to watch Netflix and then try to also charge Netlfix to let us watch Netflix?

It's so breathtaking, and I'm not even good at this game! I'd say definitely give it a whirl.

Recently, I confess I don't quite understand the complaints I've been seeing about the new paid DLC, especially considering the dev team is also including free content for those who don't wish to purchase it. 

People are so funny. They want the game to be updated indefinitely but don't want to pay so the devs can keep bread on the table.
I'm not exactly sure how that's supposed to work?

Another possibly unpopular opinion: I like bugs. It's so amusing to see videos of long time vets of this game encountering funny things like bears lying in midair. Of course gamebreaking bugs are no fun, but little funny quirks like that really add something memorable and special.

So far the only Survival game that manages to pull off ""non-trivial difficulty past the establishment phase"". Note that I have only ever played the Sandbox ""Survival"" mode, and not the Story ""Wintermute"" mode; I'm only talking about Survival mode. 
There are some.... questionable design decisions (the aiming mechanics for the rifle, the worse-than-useless ingame maps, to name a few), but it is overall well thought out and competently executed. There are some other unusual mechanics (for instance, outside of a a handful of dangerous-to-collect raw materials, items do not respawn. What you get on world gen is all you will ever have, and eventually you will run out) that will rub plenty of people the wrong way, but these are necessary compromises to achieve their vision, and worth it in the end.
This game is not for everyone.
It is pure Survival on-the-rocks: no zombies, monsters, base building, farming, or even multiplayer. Just you, the wildlife, and a punishingly cold Canadian Winter.
Death is permanent, and the wilderness is unforgiving. A single mistake could cost you the entire run. However, it is in these situations, where a single careless mistake sets off a chain reaction that you're only barely able to keep from spiraling out of control, that this game really comes alive. It is similar to Dark Souls or XCOM: EU, in that it will happily kill you with something you could not have reasonably predicted, which combined with the permadeath is going to be frustrating. Especially on your first few runs, before you learn the major threats (for me: wolves, dehydration, unexpected blizzards, and thin ice), and the necessary precautions (
Wolves: run to the nearest car or building. Fires, torches, and flares will work most of the time, but I've learned not to completely trust these. If you can't get to shelter in time but you do have a ranged weapon, try to backpedal to a clear, open area with as few obstructions as possible, ideally on a hill. Decide right away if you're going to take your first shot as soon as possible to leave enough time for a second shot before the wolf gets to you, or hold your fire until it stops circling and beelines towards you, then fire once you can clearly see its face. Don't go for the 2 shot unless they're far enough away, and even then don't waste time carefully lining up the first shot. Just get it close, eyeball the lead, and hit ""send"". The worst situation is to be stuck reaching for another arrow or partway thru cycling the bolt when the wolf starts its charge. Finally, remember that sometimes it's better to tank the wolf attack than it is to sprint into the woods with no plan, supplies, or shelter.
Dehydration: never leave the house without a cooking pot to boil snow, matches to start a fire, and either firewood on-hand or a plan to get some ASAP. 
Blizzards: always travel between bases in either buildings or caves, and have some food, water, and firewood on-hand in case you need to sit tight for a while. Strong winds and snow will put out fires. 
Thin Ice: thin ice is actually quite rare, but don't let that make you careless. The game will alert you visually and audibly when you're at risk. Try to minimize the time you spend crossing ice, and always be aware of the shortest path back to dry land.)
The visuals are deliberately stylized to be low-res with few polygons, which turns some people off, but in my opinion is a perfectly acceptable approach to visual design that gives it a timeless charm, like Borderlands.
If (like me) you really enjoy Survival games, but find yourself repeatedly losing interest once you've established yourself, The Long Dark is for you. If you're a Canadian with a strong sense of national pride and an extra $26 (that's in Canadian dollars, or ~3.67 Big Macs in US currency), this is an unapologetically Canadian game in which you can proudly freeze to death or get your ribs caved in by a moose, like Sir John A. Macdonald would have wanted you to. If you have any interest in Survival games, like the idea of supporting smaller creators, or just want a unique experience, I highly recommend giving The Long Dark a shot.

Everyone who is interested in Survival Games found here anything it needs. But it isn't a Shooter, more a slow down Survival game with the Atmosphere of games like Life is Strange. Everyone who wants a massive Looter Shooter Experience like Scum or DayZ will not find it here.

The sandbox of survival mode and challenges are fun and new mechanics comes regurlarly in the game. I did not try the expansion....I do not know yet if I will. 

Now, I do wish the story was complete. The team works hard for it but it has been a very long time....between my purchase date and today, I have moved countries, got married, bought a house, adopted a dog... could probably have children by the time the story completes.

Overall I recommend it because it has a special place in my heart plus according to dev lpgs, the story is soon coming to an end so future players will be able to experience it in one go.

[b]The survival game:[/b]
  It's you against nature, who has decided to wipe out humanity. You might well be the last human alive, at least, that's what it feels like. This game needs no zombies or other ..bies to be challenging. The nights with an aurora, the blizzards, the fog, the howling of wolves, the heavy breathing of a bear nearby and the frigging cold are scary enough. Strangely, all this is also immensely beautiful. The look of the world is based on water color paintings, and the lighting is just superb. 
  You need to manage time and the resources you find in order to survive against all odds (more so with every level of difficulty). If you set your priorities wrong, the game will strike back. There is no map, unless you draw one piece by piece. It's easy to get lost, and death is permanent. New game. There is no base building, you make bases of the existing vacant buildings or even caves. Crafting and game mechanics are simple and easy to understand, but still convey a strong sense of being realistic. While weapon skills are important, this is no shooter game. Hunting is just one of the skills you need to master in order to survive.
  The replay possibilities are almost endless. There are many different regions you can visit with different challenges and rewards. The Far Territory-DLC adds to this. There are also several challenges you can play, they have certain goals you need to achieve with or without time limit. In addition, the community has come up with several interesting game settings and challenges, which can be quite hard. 
  There has been a major change in December 2022, which sadly introduced a number of bugs. But as of now, the game is very much playable and enjoyable. There are some glitches left (sliding or rocketing bears ..) which you either need to be aware of to avoid them, or work around. 

[b]The story game (Wintermute):[/b]
  The story (last chapter still to come) is set in the same environment and setting. 
  Strongest point: The music is very, very good. One of a kind. It adds a lot to the overall immersion of the story.
  I liked playing story mode and I'm still eagerly awaiting the unravelling of the mystery in the last chapter. Gameplay-wise I didn't care too much about some of the puzzles which you had to solve. Luckily, in story mode you have a map showing you where you are, you can save your game and death isn't permanent. Story mode is a good way to learn some of the survival maps.",1625862842,1695849962,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The goal is to survive as long as you can. To that end, Survival mode gives you four levels to chose from, plus a Custom mode where you set your own rules. All while battling starvation, the freezing environment and predators that may or may not hunt you down. Be prepared to die many times before you start to get the hang of it. You only get one chance. When you die that's it. You start again. But each time you die you learn something, right?

Once you have explored everywhere there is a DLC that is still in development. It adds new regions, quests and game content. Worth considering in my opinion but not necessary for the base game. But hey. You can't have too much of a good thing, can you?

Which I don't mind.) but really enjoyed that. 
The only hitch I remember from the story (it's been some time for me) was the fact that at one point, I had to collect a certain amount of fuel which was labeled as 'kerosene' in the mission description, and I swept the entire map for it (looked at pretty much every pixel on a plane wreck, which is where you might expect to find kerosene) without any luck, only to find out lantern fuel was what the game wanted from me all along.

Let's not kid ourselves though this game is full of bugs and every update that adds new content or is a supposed ""quality of life"" or ""bug fix"" adds new bugs.

I do not know if new ""talent"" is causing this or if it is incompetence or are faulty attempts to curb what allot of the community dubs  ""save scumming"". Whatever the case TLD is not worth your money and I would hold off on purchasing any other games from Hinterland unless or until they can get a handle on all of the games many. many problems.

Some of these bugs have persisted for months and are game stoppers ie. failed to load save reload from main menu (pops up when entering some trailers and cabins) that effectively deletes any progress that you made since the last ""save"" which could be hours.

Another bug that has persisted for over a year is when collecting buffer memories. Some places that have these memories will absolutely not give you all of them no matter how many real life hours or days you spend trying to get them.

A new bug that just appeared in the V 2.23 update erases all paint markers in a caves upon the first re-load of the cave.

I am not wasting any more time on TLD untill the developers get a handle on quality and start taking their work far more seriously than this.

you get lost in the atmosphere, sounds and gameplay, and it's so much fun exploring.

At the same time it's been exciting waiting for the next episode of the story part of the game. Like waiting for a new season of a tv-show. They are constantly developing the game which makes it fun to come back to, and try out the new features, but even without that I keep on coming back to survival mode. 

Getting really excited about them starting to release DLC's and can't wait for what new creative stuff they'll add. It truly feels like you're trying to survive in this desolated lonely place. And the map/maps. So many places to go, so many nooks and corners to find. And for some places you REALLY got to search for what your looking for! And I love that they've added a simple map to follow, and not a pointer which tells you just follow to get there. Got to think a little. But nice touch that ""your character marks the map"" on special locations you've found.

Simply because most survival games have too much and require too much time and dedication, I picked this game back up from when I originally played it as a beta on Xbox, and the game as stayed on the same path and as remained true to it's core. I don't have to monitor my base 24/7 in fear of losing everything by someone stalking my online status. It also doesn't have soft-locks on the game-play by acquiring 1 item to explore the next for better gear. Another thing I appreciate is that the weather matters in The Long Dark unlike most survival games where usually the weather elements are completely disregarded or are surprisingly easy to conquer. The game relies mostly on small bits of knowledge, patience, and judgement calls.

Glowing green eyes circle just beyond the light, snarling and snapping, drawn by the smell of rabbit meat searing on the stones. The flames keep the threat at bay for now, and warm your frostbitten limbs, but they are almost extinguished and you have nothing left to nourish them. You must make it back to the cabin or you will surely freeze to death, assuming the wolves don't get you first. But how? 

You are shaking too violently for marksmanship, but that doesn't make your revolver useless. The deafening blast sends the wolves scattering. You crack a flare and make for the cabin. Half way there an aurora lights up the sky. A chorus of unnatural, discordant, howls erupts from all directions. Your stalkers return, seemingly emboldened by the shimmering light. No bullets left, but the flare is holding steady, even though your arm isn't. 

You are closing in on the cabin. As if it knows this is its last chance, a single wolf breaks from the pack and charges. It leaps onto you, rips its way through your layered clothing, and sinks its teeth into the flesh of your left arm as you barely manage to grab and swing your hatchet with the right. Injured, the beast runs off into the night, leaving you a bloody mess in the snow. You barely manage to crawl yourself to the door. Inside now it's dark. Hastily you wrap your wounds with the tattered remains of clothing as you shamble towards the bed and collapse into it, fearful of succumbing to your wounds as you sleep.

It's all about trying to stay alive, and taking risks only when it's a good idea. You can't take a revolver, and go hunt down every wolf in the area immediately. It's a game of patience, that, if you are looking from a slow paced, chill game, then you will likely enjoy this a lot. The game is gorgeous, and while people complain about the lack of content, I question how much of the content they've actually seen. I've played over 120 hours now, and I've only explored a meager fraction of the maps.

On the topic of Wintermute, I personally haven't even touched it, despite buying it, so I can't really say whether it is amazing or not.

What I can vouch for, is the Tales from the Far Territory, which adds some pretty decent additions to the game, even if maaaaybe not worth $20 USD if you aren't just getting it to support the devs. The base version of the Long Dark is worth the price, but TftFT adds just a few additions that spice things up, as the devs move closer to getting everything set up.

TLDR Pros:

-A good, solid game, but designed with slow burn, careful players in mind. It is a very solid and realistic survival game.
-The devs have no intentions of slowing down.
-A ton of space to explore, while fighting off the elements.
-Absolute serotonin generator once you get comfortable with playing it.

TLDR Cons:
-Tales from the Far Territory may not be worth the price, but it did allow the devs an excuse to pull the game from $35 USD to $20 USD.
-Incredibly difficult at times, and players seeking instant thrills and fast-paced gameplay are ***NOT*** going to enjoy to pacing.",1561922725,1695237326,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ця гра поєднує в собі красивий візуальний стиль, захоплюючий геймплей та надзвичайно інтенсивну атмосферу, що допомагає вам відчути себе справжнім виживальником.

Один з основних аспектів, який робить The Long Dark настільки особливим, це його реалістична система виживання. Ви повинні боротися з голодом, жагою, холодом та втомою, шукати їжу, тепло та воду, використовуючи обмежені ресурси, які ви знаходите в природі. Ця гра змушує вас думати про кожен ваш крок і приймати важливі рішення, які впливають на вашу подальшу долю. Це допомагає створити неперевершений досвід виживання.

Гра також славиться своєю деталізацією і красивою графікою. Краєвиди в The Long Dark просто дивовижні, і вони додатково поглиблюють вас в атмосферу постапокаліптичного світу. Через ці деталі і атмосферу гри, ви почуваєте, що ви насправді перебуваєте в цьому світі.

Іншим видатним аспектом гри є її режими. У вас є можливість вибрати режим ""Сюжет"" і пройти захоплюючий сюжетний кампанію, або ви можете обрати режим ""Безкінечна виживання"" і випробувати свої навички виживання на великих картах з безмежними можливостями.

Навіть після багатьох годин гри, The Long Dark не втрачає свого чарівного привабливості. Ця гра завжди тримає вас в напрузі і захопленій, завдяки своїй великій варіативності і неймовірно запаморочливій атмосфері.

Загалом, The Long Dark - це шедевр в жанрі виживання, який обов'язково варто спробувати всім фанатам цього жанру. Ця гра надзвичайно глибока, відповідальна і дуже захоплююча.

I found it via a streamer and was captuered by it in an instant and buyed it. At this time the game was stil in early, early access and ""only"" had the sandbox modus, in which i spend round about 30 hours. After  few years and an hardware update, i played it again and collected in both the sandbox and the main story 70 additional hours and my oppinion stil hasnt changed.
It remains the best and most atmospheric survival game for me and propably several thousand others.
But, i do not understand why the dlc costs the same amount of money as the main game, when the main story isnt finished.
I do know that i bought it at a lower price(without any discount) and that the price was way higher in the past then it is now, which isnt the point i am trying to make.
From the looks of it is the dlc ""Tales from the Far Territory"" as good as ""Wintermute"", but i am afraid that it will stop as well, with no closed story. There even was a meme about how Hinterland Studios will produce a sequel before closing the first game and this is what the situation now feels like, which makes me anxious about the possible future of both versions of the current game.

Can i recommend ""The Long Dark: Wintermute""? Yes, yes i can and whoever from the users reads this should totally buy it 
Will i buy, the seemingly equal half of the whole construct? Yes, yes i will and i probably will be happy to have bought it and collect several hundred hours, constantly over the years. I will get the shivers again, in the brutal summerheat of 38 degree Celsius, because of how good it pulls me into it's world.
Just be aware that the way on what you buy is wierd and somewhat illogical to me.

TLDR: phenomenal survival game, mediocre story game. Not for everyone.

SURVIVAL MODE:
This game is unlike any other survival game out there. There is no base building, no quick fixes, and death is permanent and inevitable. You can't make a giant skyscraper or craft OP weapons, nor can you become completely unkillable, irregardless of how much time you have played a save or how much progress you've made. The only thing you can do is manage your necessities and make it to the next day. But despite the simple premise, this is one of the most enthralling survival experiences I've had the joy to play. Your plane crashes in the cold, Canadian wilderness and the game just says: ""go survive."" There is no hand-holding; this is the very definition of being thrown in the deep end. You have to manage your hunger, thirst, fatigue, and most importantly, temperature. You will craft weapons and forge tools, find guns and clothing, hunt animals and catch fish, make fires and boil water, and sleep under the stars... and freeze to death. The game is stunning, the sound design is captivating, the gameplay is complex and layered, and the atmosphere is haunting. The game boasts one of the largest playable areas at some 50+ square KMs and with enough time you will learn the lay of the land. Get the survival mode if you want a thoroughly complex and vast world to explore, while having to methodically plan out every expedition and consider your position carefully.

STORY MODE:
The story mode pales in comparison to the survival mode. I'll keep this one short as there isn't much to say, but the whole 4 chapters (the last one TBA as of this review) are one giant fetch-quest. 80% of what you have to do in the story mode is 'get X equipment for Y' or 'repair X amount if this'. The story is way too ambiguous with not enough character development to truly enjoy your time playing, and some quests are downright evil. I wont say anything here, but I will say the only two episodes worth your time as of this review are the first two (thank god for quicksaving). All of that said, I am intrigued to see where the story goes as there is much unsaid.

DLC:
There's no point sugarcoating it, 'Tales from the Far Territory' (TFTFT) is in a rough state. There are a myriad of bugs running rampant that even affect players who don't have the DLC, the devs have continued to set multiple deadlines and promises that they have fallen flat on almost every single time, and TFTFT is being finished before the story mode which has people riled up. However, the proffered game mechanics, three new regions (no, I don't count the tiny one) and new TALES that are being added over-time have me feeling satisfied with it. There is so much being added that I can't help but recommend it. If you are enjoying the survival mode and want more, the DLC is worth it imo.

I don't care for base building or crafting much, which is probably due to growing up on more action based boomer shooters and platformers growing up. Having to muck about in a menu often breaks immersion for me. While there is some of that present in TLD, it dials it down a notch compared to its peers and doesn't get overly complicated or needlessly abstract. For example, rabbit skin gloves are made out of pretty much exactly what you'd think they'd be made out of. It takes cloth to repair cloth. Sticks and wood make fire. Rocks are for throwing at things and making campfires. You get the idea. It's grounded in reality without being overly pedantic about realism. Even the art style shares this trait, with the emphasis on a realistic, believable, immersive experience, but with an almost impressionistic flair. I think this is one of the most striking features of TLD. It's realistic, but approachable, even for people that aren't survival-craft junkies like myself. There is plenty here for the hardcore crowd, but it also attempts to be everyone's cup of tea, and does so pretty successfully IMO. So what are the problems?

WINTERMUTE - A great name possibly with a nod to William Gibson. WM was the original reason I purchased the game. Wintermute is the story mode of TLD. I played part of it in either early access or GamePass and enjoyed it enough to eventually buy it on Steam. I can't remember but I think the version I played was limited in some way to where I could not play the story or I could only play one of two chapters. It may have even been a separate install from the Survival mode. 

The story is immediately gripping and it teaches you about the game, characters, and world all at the same time and in a pretty natural and cohesive way. The difficulty isn't cranked up here and it acts as a soft introduction to the survival mode. Some things are limited and you can't fully explore the map, which is great for new players as overwhelming them with too much at once could have been a major issue but thankfully isn't here. 

I basically played Wintermute as it released which means I'd pick the game up and play it really hard for a few days to play the story mode and then put it down for a year or so until the next episode was released. This has added up to essentially waiting for several years for what was originally planned to be the main game until Survival mode took over and became the main focus of both the players and devs. If you buy Wintermute today or bought it some time ago, you essentially purchased an unfinished product with a spotty development timeline. If you look at a timeline of TLD, the story mode has essentially had the worst of the delays given that it was originally planned to release in 2014 but got pushed back to 2016. There are 4 released chapters with a HIGHLY anticipated final chapter on the way and it cannot come soon enough. I applaud this company for being anti-crunch but entire genres have come and gone since the original planned release date of the story and almost ten years have passed, two for each chapter. 

Even though the quality is very high, it's obvious that the story got put on the back burner even though you have to pay a premium for it. If you were like me and you played episodes 3 and 4 right as they released, you were essentially beta testing the story mode for Hinterland and bug reporting for them. I experienced game breaking bugs that did eventually get fixed, my favorite being Mackenzie walking into a building and repeatedly saying ""sh!t..."" while stuck on a loading screen. Even though it was pretty funny, I had no choice but to report the bug and sit back for a week hoping the game would be patched and I could get back to being immersed in the story again. At present, I'm questioning if I'll experience the same thing in Episode 5 and if they'll be able to tie everything together after nearly ten years of writing. Can it possibly pay off after all this time? 

SURVIVAL - While everyone got tired of holding their breath waiting for Wintermute, the sandbox / survival mode really took off in a major way. I'm sure that for a large chunk of the fanbase, this is the entire game and they have saved themselves the frustration of waiting 7+ years for episodic releases of a story you started a lifetime ago. Usually this is where most of the bugs are created and where most are fixed, as Wintermute is running on a branch of this version of the game. 

The main issue I have with survival mode is that it falls victim to the same problem that Skyrim's survival mode has. The numbers seem to be based on real world values but the timescale of the world itself is greatly accelerated in comparison to our real word. For instance, instead of experiencing a 24 hour day 1:1 as you would in real life, it's sped up about 12 times. According to the wiki, an in game hour is about five minutes irl, or one hour irl is about 12 hours in game. It should also be noted that some activities ""skip time"" which causes an entire day to pass in seconds. 

Because of this, time management in this game f*cking sucks and it's 100% the worst part of it. Point blank. It totally ruins the immersion if you walk and experience the world as if it is moving in real time but counters are GREATLY accelerated. Meaning, you're not moving at 12 times the speed you would in real life, but your hunger meter sure as sh!t is. This means that you essentially become a rabid insatiable void spawn, hellbent on devouring everything in sight. You are to Great Bear Island what a swarm of locusts was to ancient Egypt. You, as Will Mackenzie, are the gaping maw at the center of our galaxy, endlessly consuming anything within your infinite grasp. You alone, in your pathetic and futile attempt at survival, will do more harm to Great Bear and its pantries than any ""mysterious geomagnetic storm"" ever could. ""Living to eat or eating to live"" will become your mantra and the only cessation of your digestive tract will be the few brief seconds that you are asleep in between meals. 

Now obviously I could customize the difficulty to tune it to my liking and adjust numbers that way, but you still have the same issue. Maybe, like with Skyrim's botched survival mode, I can find other mods that fix this, either by altering the timescale (which I have done myself in my own mod for Skyrim) or by changing the values. Either way, I shouldn't have to seek alternate sources because the devs couldn't get the game feel right on this one. It's one thing to have the game be realistic and immersive, but if I have to eat a 2000 cal diet everyday to survive in TLD, that's essentially ALL I'm doing in any given day. It sucks. It's not fun. And it's the worst part of every survival game mode IMO. 

TALES - slapped haphazardly onto Survival mode, presumably to give people that had already decided against paying for Wintermute something else they might be inclined to pay for, Tales from the Far Territory is an optional DLC that adds story into the base survival mode. Some of it's free. Most of it isn't. This seems to be where all the dev time is going. I don't really know what to think or feel about Tales yet, given that I've barely interacted with any of it. I'd like to do the tale, ""Signal Void"" but haven't come across a handheld radio yet, just several transmitters that were in disrepair. A lot of it seems superfluous and I'm considering disabling it after completing the Tale and seeing the new locations. The new cooking and item variants just add more complexity to the game and gives me more junk in my inventory that I don't want to haul around. 

CHALLENGES - Pretty fun and interesting standalone experiences. Escape the Darkwalker could be it's own survival horror game.

Regardless if you have or haven't, forget everything you know about survival games. This one doesnt have a tutorial. Its an infinite winter with no power and short days.

Its incredibly hard but its rewarding. Once you dont die on the first week you then start to get some real progress. You know how to avoid wolves, get some fish, and loot places and know what to take and leave. You gather some materials, and let animal skins and gut dry out to craft some coats, pants, gloves, mocassins, and whatever you scavenged from abandoned cities. Gathered some things that seem useless? You can now craft ammunition! You just first need to find a workbench specifically for that, of course. Which is in blackrock. Also just happens to be one of the most unforgiving places in the game. Make a trek outside of you're comfort mystery lake to other places. Oh, and dont forget that frostbite also just decides that you have less maximum health. For the rest of your game. If you die too, its all over. No respawns.

No music, no voice acting, just a bare bones experience. And even then I loved it! Watching this game grow into the masterpiece it is today has been beautiful and I have loved every minute and update of it.

The game today is now a wonderful experience filled with amazing voice acting and one of the most killer sound tracks I have ever heard. Nothing beats walking through a beautiful white forest and watching the sunrise when all of a sudden a somber tune starts to play, reminding you of the death and danger that awaits and that even in the harsh landscape of the game, there is still beauty to be had.

All in all, I cannot recommend this game enough, you can tell the developers love it and they have put so much into it with even the most minute details you probably would never think of. 5/5, easily one of my top 5 games right now, and quite possibly even ever. If you are hesitant I promise you you won't regret this game and you will be supporting an awesome team of developers.

UPDATE: As of time of writing this review (9/12/23) The Devs have been quiet for about 3 months now after previously having been active almost weekly but at least once a month usually. The last major update to the main game was almost 2 years ago where they release Part 4 of the story and teased part 5, the final part and ending. I have been waiting patiently for 2 long (and dark) years. Last year the devs branched off and started a DLC portion of the game called Tales from the Far Territories. This added a few new locations and some equipment but was optional. They claimed money was running a bit short and they needed a little injection. But the one DLC release became 3 whole updates focused only on the DLC and no word at all about the main game and the part 5 story finale. The survival mode of this game is still great, so if you want a good survival experience buy the reasonably priced Survival version of the game. I wouldn't waste any money on the story or DLC though. That is my 2 cents, all in all a very promising game that was sadly ruined by DLC and stagnation.",1622736055,1694531169,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And this game, like no other, always leaves you fearing you’re just one ill-planned decision or encounter away from death. Because, well… you are! Yet in between that struggle, you get these moments of calm just enjoying and exploring the cold wilderness, caves, and abandoned buildings. Just enough time to soak in little bits of lore to hint at the grand mystery behind everything. That’s what makes The Long Dark so special for those patient enough to experience it.

It's definitely still worth playing if you're into punishing survival games, but the slow pace of development and recent studio direction has taken its toll in my opinion. Instead of keeping this a simple survival game, the developers keep adding mechanics that make the game less of a challenge. For example, you can now find ingredients to cook recipes which probably increases available food in the world about 20%. While this makes the world more immersive, it diminishes the harsh conditions for survival that make the game what it is. 

These additions would be less of an issue if it wasn't being done at the expense of finishing the damn story mode.

What exactly is ""The Long Dark""? The Long Dark is a survival  game where you take the role of a crash landed pilot just off the coast of Canada. No one else is coming around to save you, you don't even know where you are, and you don't even know how to survive. Welcome to The Long Dark. 

The only goal of the game is to survive for as long as you possibly can with the only ending being death. You will start off in ""Survival Mode"" by choosing a difficulty level which goes from easiest to hardest. Pilgrim (easy), Voyager (normal/medium), Stalker (Hard), Interloper (Insane), and then there's Custom (pretty self explanatory). Afterwards you can select any of the game's regions (unless you choose Interloper difficulty which picks a random region for you) which include, but aren't limited to: Mountain Town, Mystery Lake, Coastal Highway, Pleasant Valley, and more. Some regions are more difficult then others. 


After picking your region of choice, you will spawn somewhere randomly within that zone. You will have nothing except for some basic clothing on your back and, if you're lucky, some basic meager supplies, depending on your difficulty. There is no tutorial, and the game will not tell you how to survive. That is up to you. Every choice in The Long Dark matters, because only one wrong choice, even the smallest one, can lead to death. The Long Dark is permadeath, meaning that if you die, then your save is completely wiped from your hard drive, with no way to recover it.  It can be over in the blink of an eye. You are never 100% safe in ""The Long Dark"". All it takes is one second. Just one second, and it's over. No matter how clear and calm an area looks, no matter how many supplies you have or how confident you feel or what you think. It only takes one second, and you're done. Never let your guard down, ever. There are a number of ways the game can take you down, from starvation and freezing, to dysentery, and even animal attacks. In the world of ""The Long Dark"", the majority of the items you find in the game, such as canned and prepackaged foods, and man-made medicine, such as antibiotics, will not re-spawn, forcing you to make careful decisions. However, you are not confined to one map, and may freely travel between regions and come and go as you wish. 


As you walk around and explore the game, you will find many resources and tools around the world that will help you on your survival journey such as food, clothing, tools, and even firearms. However, make no mistake, ""The Long Dark"" is not a shooter. Firearms in the game are meant to be used more as ""tools"" in a way rather than actual weapons. A hunting rifle, which as the name obviously states, can be used to hunt animals such as deer, and moose. A revolver also appears in the game, which can be used as a self-defense firearm to protect yourself from hostile wildlife. Both types of ammunition are limited within the world, so use these tools wisely. But how you choose to survive is up to you. Will you find a permanent place to hole up in and survive off of scavenged resources? Will you go out into the dangers of the cold to hunt for your next meal? Will you stay on the move and go from place to place in your struggle to survive, scavenging along the way while looking for your next place to call home? How far will you go to survive, ""The Long Dark""?

Pros:
Easy enough to stop and start; transitions to interior or exterior locations is enough for an autosave. 
Gameplay mechanics are simple, yet require attention and planning.
This game is excellent at consistently punishing complacency. You will die because you are confident in your situation.

Cons:
The timescale of the 24-hour day takes time to adjust to, when not hampered by the weather.
Degradation time of some items and food, based on environment, is noticeably unrealistic.
There is no smell notification in the game. Smell is a large part of survival, not only for food. The animals can smell you. Bears stink. If one were downwind of a bear, it would be remarkable.
You have to reach a max level in revolver skill in order to have the thought ""I could shoot this wolf in the head as it attacks me, instead of pistol-whipping it to death.""

I won't focus on the good things too much as I generally agree with what other reviewers liked about this game. I'll just explain what I didn't like.

The world is vast, but unfortunately it's mostly empty which means you're going to be walking around a lot without anything interesting to do or to look at while you are wandering. Maybe this is what the devs intended - a large empty world to give you the sense that you're alone and small. It definitely creates an interesting vibe but that vibe fades and you're left with a map where 99% of it is not interactive which makes for some dull gameplay.

Then there are a couple of serious issues of gameplay quality. Since you do need to walk/run around a lot due to the large map, the walk/sprint system should be perfect. Unfortunately it has a very annoying quality; the sprint/energy meter displays only while you sprint, but not when it recharges. This makes it impossible to efficiently manage your movement because you don't know when it's full and you can start sprinting again. This is unacceptable for a game that emphasizes movement across large areas so I'm very confused by that UI decision. At least put an option in to toggle it to stay on and let the user decide.

Another serious quality issue is that most actions don't have a keybind option at all. Granted that many probably don't need it, but there is one action that really does: ""pass time"". This is an incredibly useful action that would make this game much more playable if you didn't have to open the wheel menu every time. If there was a keybind for passing time and the sprint meter stayed on the screen I might have still recommended this game, but these two issues make it very difficult to enjoy given how critical energy and time management are to survival in this game.

The last issue I have with this game is that it doesn't inspire creativity or novelty. You can't build anything and what you can craft is so limited that the gameplay loop is consists mostly of crossing long distances looking for new POIs just to plunder the resources and move onto the next one. A survival game without building or crafting can still be really fun, but it has to give you some compelling tasks or strategies. Ultimately the reason why I don't recommend it is because there are so many better games in this genre. For those of us with a limited time budget for gaming, I would rather spend my time playing something else.",1693544931,1693544931,False,13,1,0.505842745304107666,0,True,False,False

However, as I've followed the progress of the development, it clearly has taken many wrong turns over the years and there seems to be no clear end in sight. 
I may have the right to say a few words about this particular trainwreck after playing it over 300 hours and following its dev cycle over the decade.

First times on this game I remember the simplicity it had on many gameplay elements, which made it very enjoyable while being challenging enough. Over the years, they kept adding new details to gameplay mechanics and making it more and more complicated to the point that in some parts of the game became not so fun anymore. I also remember the massive technical problems they had on launch of the Story Mode in 2017, the game was an utter broken mess, and it took so long time for them to fix all of the hiccups. Even the VA wasn't finished on launch, and they only had like what, two episodes available on launch out of five (if this even ends with five episodes...). 

And now, 6 years later, the game is still unfinished.

The fact that they started making DLC for the game recently and splitting it to different versions is a clear sign on financial and management issues, and to split the story into episodes was the first mistake they did. And all these updates are just not adding to the game the stuff what matters the most: finishing the story mode development. 
It just doesn't look promising at all and for newcomers coming to this game, it makes the approach unnecessarily complicated and messy. Kind of like what happened with recent HITMAN-games until they decided to put all games under one game, which made it so much better. 



Looking at TLD now, it kind of makes you think that Early Access-rules should be changed so that if dev cannot fully finish the game in like 10 years and release it to the public, it will be pulled out of the store. Sounds harsh, but this kind of milking is just wrong, unethical, waste of everyone's time and dev's resources. Someone has to stop the madness.


So for anyone reading this and pondering whether to buy this or not: Do not buy this until it's fully finished.",1693164467,1693164467,False,22,0,0.541391372680664063,0,True,False,False

This review is being written prior to playing the story mode. I have only play Sandbox and I have significantly more hours logged than Steam has tracked, as many of them were when I was without internet. 

This game is a prime example of a pure survival game. No outside interferences from zombies or other players, no weird occurences that can cause sudden death. This game is all about fighting the elements and natural wildlife. Managing your food and water is important, but from the time I've spent in game, the cold and exhaustion are far more dangerous. I've never had an issue with wolves, or the bears. Your character can take quite a bit of abuse before finally giving in. This is fairly realistic considering real-life scenarios where people have survived bitter extremes. Although it doesn't seem to have too harsh of a lasting effect, these attacks do drop your abilites a decent amount.

One follows the most absurd adventure possible meanwhile other goes to realism route and gives you the experience that you never had before with the necessity you need. For me, Long Dark is possibly the most realistic survival game out there. You will fight the cold, hunger, thirst, predators and when you are doing that you also had to take care of your fatigue. You will feel the survivor experience to chills of your marrow in most authentic way possible. So, you will have a tough experience with survival expect; what else?

For a person who played lots of survival games that's realistic or most absurd thing ever; I gotta say game also has some problems at least for my taste. Long Dark is a game where you need to be really passive, I don't mean playing just safe; what you can do is very limited. Jumping? Nope. Meleeing something? You can't, but you can do other things to manage your problem. Is this a problem? Definitely not, I am just saying this because of my taste and experience from other survival games.

My big problem was the announcement of Hinterland offering paid content alongside some additional free content. I fully supported the offer, paid my additional money and settled back to receive value for money. I am still waiting, and still no end in sight. The latest announcement and apology does help, but fell short of what I wanted to hear, and whilst I acknowledge the need to find security for an independent company, that is pretty much all I took away.....sorry but WE come first, have a refund if you like, but PLEASE don't because it will make us less secure.

As a seasoned survivor who has immersed myself in the harsh landscapes of The Long Dark for well over a thousand hours across various accounts, I can confidently say that this game is a true masterpiece of survival gaming. With its uncompromising realism, deep mechanics, and recently added DLC content, The Long Dark continues to captivate my attention and challenge my survival instincts like no other.

The Long Dark excels in its portrayal of a post-apocalyptic world where Mother Nature is the ultimate adversary. The attention to detail in its environments, weather effects, and wildlife behavior is second to none. Every step through the desolate landscapes feels deliberate, as the game presents a beautiful yet unforgiving playground where every decision matters.

My journey through The Long Dark has been a gradual evolution from a struggling survivor to a master of the elements. From learning to build a fire during a snowstorm to expertly hunting elusive prey, the game's mechanics are a testament to its dedication to realism. Resource management, navigation, and prioritizing survival needs create a constant tension that keeps the adrenaline pumping.

But it's not just the mechanics that keep me hooked; it's the emotional investment. The Long Dark's quiet moments, where you're huddled in a snow-covered cabin listening to the wind howl, or the heart-pounding encounters with wolves, paint a vivid picture of isolation and vulnerability. It's a testament to the game's storytelling that these moments linger long after you've put down the controller.

The recent DLC content further expands the already rich experience. The addition of new regions, challenges, and narratives is a welcome surprise for a player who thought they had seen it all. The infusion of fresh content injects new life into the game, providing both new players and veterans like myself with even more reason to explore, survive, and adapt.

Having spent so many hours within The Long Dark's unforgiving embrace, I can say with certainty that it's a game that keeps on giving. Its combination of survival mechanics, atmospheric storytelling, and sheer depth make it an absolute must-play for anyone seeking an immersive survival experience. With the new DLC content enhancing an already outstanding game, The Long Dark continues to be a benchmark for the survival genre, and my journey within its frozen world is far from over.",1692789992,1692789992,True,0,0,0.496602177619934082,0,True,False,False

The story line is interesting, and at times the survival part is difficult, balancing the carry weight with the necessities. 
I find that mostly food, fire materials and torches (or flares) is all that is really needed.
They give you lots other things to carry that as a default in survival your first instinct is to grab and horde.
That is a mistake, You move from area to area and don't go back so no need to horde, just think of the future down the road, what it wakes to get there. Don't over think it.  food. fire. good to go.
It is nice not worrying about zombie hordes etc... just wolves and bears.  
The weather is a nice mechanic, wind too much to use a torch and it blows out,  Can't start a fire, look for a rock face or something to hide behind. Rarely do you have enough wood to last an entire night, usually start a fire, warm up and try to move on to the next building or cave you can find to sleep without hypothermia setting in.
Any way, 33 hours in at this point and enjoying it. A little boring walking, yes, but when walking or mending/sleeping/.eating just play a video on the 2nd monitor.",1692680500,1692680500,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've played since early access and have jumped back in over the years to try out different survival play through's and see how the story has developed.
I'm currently playing through the story and have just completed Chapter 2 starting Chapter 3.
I played through Chapter 1 and 2 back when they were still in development and they've changed so much for the good and bad. 
I miss the relationship system you had with the NPC's in the story, where you would give them items and you earned rep that would unlock different story dialogue or crafting recipes, this was a cool system that gave me reason to play the story mode for longer. 
As it is, the story is pretty focused, there are side quests to complete but they can be completed, for the most part, on the way to the current objective or quest.
They actual story itself is a little frustrating. I don't understand why every character we meet is so cryptic and can't give us straight answers to our questions.
I'm a Canadian and I get it, sometimes the stuff we say does always sound like it makes sense but half of what the NPC characters say is nonsensical cryptic rabble. I get that there was supposed to have been some collapse or something but still, its not decades after, people shouldn't be this weird yet IMO. 
Game play is pretty solid, its a beautiful watercolour painted world created using low res poly textures and objects. Its a survival game in a frozen wasteland, it has typically mechanics with no base building or object crafting, only item crafting.
Most of the time you will be surviving trying to fend of the freezing cold, as well as ravenous and dangerous wild life.

The visual presentation of the game is striking, with its depiction of the Northern Canadian wilderness. The subdued art style captures the stark beauty of the environment, making every step through the snow-covered landscape a visually pleasing experience.

The survival mechanics are a notable highlight. The need to manage resources, search for essential supplies, and make thoughtful decisions adds a layer of realism to the gameplay. The dynamic weather and the presence of wildlife keep things interesting and somewhat unpredictable.

The attention to detail in crafting and item degradation adds a level of immersion that I appreciate. The game encourages learning and adapting to the environment, which can be both challenging and rewarding.

""The Long Dark"" does an effective job of creating a sense of isolation and vulnerability. The struggle to survive in this harsh world feels authentic, and the moments of accomplishment, like successfully handling encounters with wildlife or enduring a blizzard, provide a satisfying sense of progress.

While it's too early to make a final judgement, I can already see the potential for ""The Long Dark"" to be a memorable experience. Its unique blend of survival elements and atmospheric storytelling has me curious to explore more of this unforgiving world. If you enjoy this genre, it's worth considering a journey into ""The Long Dark.""",1691941617,1691941617,True,2,0,0.533333301544189453,0,True,False,False

I bought this game when it was released, which as of this month makes it 6 years. The final episode of Wintermute (the story mode) is slated to be released ""late 2023"". I was originally hyped after finishing the first 2 episodes, then waited TWO YEARS for just episode 3, then TWO MORE YEARS for episode 4. I have to play the entire story again every 2 years because I don't even remember what the hell I was doing previously. The episodes really aren't bursting full of content either, it's mainly just survival mode with narrative to give you direction.

So you've got a survival mode, and an unfinished story mode. What does Hinterland decide to do? Release DLC in an episodic form, similar to the way they developed story mode, and everyone hated it, and they responded with a confusing community update attempting to dignify their weird development cycle. I've seen the community slowly turn against the developers via reviews on both the original game and especially the DLC page over the past few years.

I understand developers need cash flow but seeing an amazing game like this treated the way it is now is just abysmal. Maybe next time just release a finished product and move on to the next one, or maybe push back the development of DLC until you can get your team to release story episodes maybe every 6 months instead of every 2 years.

This is and will always be my favorite game, but because of what it used to be, and certainly not because of what the game is right now. 

The project is, simply put, a mess. The story mode is boring as ****, all the episodes after episode 2 are just a rushed boring mess. The game changed from being a carefully made amazing experience with a good story to being just a very meh product. They are extremely late on the releases of the content so they are just rushing things, and this is not even my biggest problem, because I gave up on the story mode years ago. They have managed to introduce bugs in the game, and not just some little minor things. Dead animals that you have a very hard time hunting (I play Interloper), disappear in your face and you just die. Fires are randomly impossible to start even on flat surfaces, so you freeze and die. In a game that takes extremely painful and slow progress, dying to bugs makes it just unplayable. I won't even comment on the performance issues that the game has, they have literally broken down the menus (you have to run 2 different programs for the story mode and the sandbox, mm'okey). They really are just destroying the game with poor design and development.

And then, finally, there is the extremely stupid stuff. You will get landlocked and die because you cannot burn/cut with a hacksaw a tiny shrub bush. For real?

The Long Dark is a great, but also inherently flawed experience. I won't be commenting on WINTERMUTE seeing as I do not wish to experience it until the final episode is actually released. I also won't be commenting on the outside developer drama regarding released, unkept content promises, etc.

TLD takes place in a fictional part of a Canada after a solar event wipes out all electronics in the region. On top of this, you are stuck in the middle of one of the worst winters ever, meaning you must find a way to survive as the last man or woman alive with no power to save you.

Visually, TLD is a very pretty game. It fits a unique aesthetic mix between realism and a stylised appearance. It isn't overly hard to run either and I was able to run it on max settings at a firm 165 fps for my entire time playing with no stutters.

The sound design combined with the visuals leads to TLD being an incredibly immersive experience also. The sound is of a very high quality and the soundtrack fits the game to a tea.

The game-play is ultimately where the mixed nature of TLD comes to a head. Depending on your difficulty, you can either choose your location or you receive it at random. Once spawned, you must survive for as long as you can.

Progression is separated into three major sections, the early, mid and then late game. The early game is by far the best, as this is when you are doing the most back to back exploration. The mid game still features tons of exploration, but it is often dispersed with massive amounts of meaningless travel and downtime at settlements. The end game happens when you've basically explored everything and you've got no purpose other than fighting against the constant ticking clock that is your own resources.

When you are actively engaging with all the games systems at once, TLD is an awesome game that I enjoy quite a lot. However when things start slowing down, it can feel incredibly laborious. Your only way of getting around is walking, and the map of TLD is not small by any stretch. This means you will spend massive amounts of time as the game goes just walking from A to B with bugger all in between. You'd think the developers would attempt to mitigate this by adding in more travel possibilities as you progress in order to make this travel less tedious, but they don't. You are just as slow and sluggish at the end as you were at the beginning. Truly the best way to play this game is as a nomad, always moving and never settling down, because if you do stay in one place, you will be punished by long and boring repeated trips of going back and forth between locations just to transport to the metric ton of loot you will find on all except the hardest difficulty.

Aside from the buttload of walking that you will be doing, I don't have a ton of complaints. There is some audio clipping that happens under certain conditions that's pretty annoying. My game crashed a few times in my most recent world, but that was over 60 hours so it wasn't too intrusive.

Overall, I do love The Long Dark, but it is not a title I would recommend for everyone, and that's primarily because of the walking alone. There is enough of it that calling this game a walking simulator would not be an unfair assessment in my eyes.

My problem is that there are supposed to be two episodes to the story left and there has been little to no talk on the development of them, instead we were given the DLC which doesn't even come close to substituting for winter mute and is a lazy excuse to try and buy more time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The Long Dark has been in development since 2013. The alpha version of Survival mode arrived on Steam's Early Access in 2014. Initially, a story mode (known as ""Wintermute"") was scheduled for release later that same year, but it kept getting pushed back. 

Wintermute is planned to have five episodes. The first two released in 2017 (when the game left early access). However, due to their poor reception, these first two episodes were revamped and re-released in 2018 with changes made to the gameplay, presentation, and structure. The third episode was released in 2019, and the fourth in 2021. The fifth and final episode is planned for 2023.

In 2022, Tales from the Far Territory, an expansion pass for Survival mode, was released.

I recommend the Survival Edition, which features Survival mode as a stand-alone product. I would not recommend Wintermute or any other DLC.

[h1]The Long Dark[/h1]
The Long Dark begins with a massive geomagnetic anomaly that affects all electronic equipment. Cars, radios, computers and most other modern technology has been rendered useless. The world is quiet now, and, with no lights, the nights are long and dark. A front seat to the end of the world. Immersive first-person exploration game-play featuring a stunning, original art style. Navigate the savage beauty of the Northern wilderness whilst facing the hazards of the new post-digital frontier. Survive by your wits alone. Be on the lookout for potential supply caches, all the whilst ameliorating and improving your survival skills to overcome the dangers of harsh weather, aggressive wildlife, lack of food and water, and the mysterious aurora that adds more uncertainty to an already uncertain survival situation. Survival of the fittest. Deep survival simulation game-play whence every decision matters. Explore a large, open world in search of resources whilst balancing unpredictable conditions against the needs of your daily and, hopefully, long-term survival.

[h1] Story Mode [/h1]
The premise of Wintermute centres around the relationship between Dr. Astrid Greenwood and a bush pilot named Will Mackenzie, whom she hires to fly her and her mysterious hardcase to a remote location in the Canadian wilderness of Great Bear Island. After a mysterious geomagnetic disaster causes their plane to crash land, Astrid and Will become separated. Now the two must survive this cold and unforgiving landscape they find themselves stranded in while doing whatever it takes to reunite safely. Experience the story from their perspectives, and face the struggle to survive head on.

[h1]Survival Mode[/h1]
During Survival Mode, the player may travel freely between all Regions of Great Bear Island, with the narrative created by their own actions and ability to survive. Survival Mode is a permadeath experience; once the player dies the save cannot be reloaded.

The graphics, world-building, and punishing experience make it such a thrill to play.  Every move you make can change the course of the game drastically, and small mistakes can easily result in dire outcomes.  There are several difficulty levels you can choose to play, so my review/experience might sound dramatic (I play on Stalker, the second-hardest mode in the base game), but I really think this game nails the survival FEELING.  I've seen people complaining about the DLC not being released on time; I just want to say that everything that has been accomplished by Hinterland--frequent base game updates with new mechanics, new maps, the story mode ""Wintermute"" and paid DLC ""Tales from the Far Territory""--comes from a relatively small team who very obviously care about their community and pour their hearts into this game.  So when the initial deadline for the DLC wasn't met, I don't think the game or the devs should have been dragged for taking more time to make sure the extra content made the base game more enjoyable and added to ""The Long Dark"" survival experience.
TLDR: Buy this game!  The community is lovely, the devs care a lot about their players, and the game itself is just thrilling.",1690389039,1690389039,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The writing in the story mode is excellent! It has genuinely touching moments. Moments that make your heart race. Moments where your just have to sit back and take it all in. The voice acting and sound design throughout the game is lovely.
Many of the core game play mechanics are well thought out and contribute well to a game that is fun to play even when it is difficult. I feel the trade off of realism and fun is well done.

Episode 1: A beautiful experience with an ending sequence that had me on the verge of tears 

Episode 2: Absolutely fucking horrendous, stress-inducing, tedious, 6-hour slog. 

Episode 3: A blend of episode 1 & 2, with the good of 1 and the bad of 2. A common trend I'm seeing is that they just don't know when to fucking end the episode.

Episode 4: Solid work. Voice acting and animation was incredible, and the overarching story was solid. I also think the implementing of puzzles was a lot smarter than making the game a stealth-horror like Episode 2. Overall a solid addition.

If not, the next thing you are going to notice is that every two steps you take, your character is going to yawn because you need to sleep 18 hours a day if you don't want to die from the lack of sleep. If you start to walk around, you'll get lost and the next thing you'll see is a bear charging at you 140 kmph
If you want to start a fire so you won't die from hypothermia, you'd better have an accelerant because you'll fail countless times before actually ignite it. However, if you somehow succeed, the fire will only list about 15 minutes ingame and if you go out looking for firewood and sticks, you'll get attacked by something -  a wolf, a bear or even a moose.
Wolves are everywhere and they'll hunt you down eventually and even you survive it, your clothes will be thorn and the wolf bite will cause an infection.
Also, if you don't eat 50.000 calories a day, you'll die. If you don't drink 40 gallons of water a day, you'll die. Wanna climb a mountain? Well good luck because 9 out of 10 times you'll be too encumbered and need to drop valuable items that could save your life. Wanna cross a frozen lake? Rookie mistake. You'll suddenly weigh as an elephant and the ice will break under you, thus giving you hypothermia and full wet or even frozen clothes.
If you ever find a weapon, you might as well drop it because you won't really find any bullets. The rock throwing mechanics are also awful, you won't be hitting the animal you aim 9 out of 10 times. 
Basically you'll trying your hardest to survive while waiting for your inevitable death - at least you have plenty of options to choose as a death cause

When you die, you'll want to start over with the new insights you have learned to survive.
The environments are great, and are quite varied (apart from snow everywhere). However, I felt like there wasn't enough interesting things to explore. It's great when you stumble upon a house out of nowhere, but the excitement is for shelter and resources. There is no lore to really speak of in survival mode. Just a few random notes here and there. 
Personally, I'd love more reward for exploration. As it is, if you wander too far (which is actually not that far in the game), you can quickly enter very dangerous territory. I played on the second lowest difficulty, and even that felt pretty brutal. Though I did persist with that level, so... I guess it's not all bad.

The original game had the perfect formula for an open world survival game. Many games came out around the same time that followed the same formula (The Forest, as an example), but none hit the mark quite like this one. Then, they introduced an episodic campaign which was the icing on the cake. A great storyline, great adventure and kept the charm the original survival only mode in it too. What more could you ask for? Honestly I would have put this up there as one of the greatest games ever made if the developers didn't, pardon my French, shit the bed with it.

After episode three came what I like to call The Long Wait.. as in a nearly two year wait for episode four. Two years for the fourth episode? Seriously? And of course no sign of episode five, the final one, as of yet. In the meantime however the developers have released massive updates for the original survival mode and even gone as far to release a paid expansion to the game. A paid expansion to a game they haven't even finished yet?! Seriously what on earth is going on with this studio.. greenlighting PAID DLC for a game that isn't finished. Making a mockery of the people who bought the game (like me) in early access half a decade ago. Geniunely believe Steam should allow for refunds on games that you purchase in early access that never get finished because I would really like my money back after all this. Every month the developers come out with another ""we're sorry for the problems"" post while they keep raking in all the cash. Oh and to top it all off.. when they did finally release episode four, they gave you an incredible one minute ""previously on.."" snippet to explain what's happening at the start of episode four.. which of course didn't explain shit. It's been two years.. I'm playing a game where you're on the hunt for a friend in effectively the wilderness and suddenly you wake up in jail? What?!

I have followed this game for over 5 years in hopes that the devs can fulfill what they set out to do. As much as I really enjoyed this game in 2016 when I found it, I can no longer recommend it to anyone who hasn't already invested their hope for this game's success (like myself). The internal development struggles and change in management this game has been through haven't been kind to the game or its players, unfortunately. I sincerely hope this game isn't abandoned; however, I would still consider it to be in the beta phase... The 3 biggest problems plaguing my current play- through that led me to write this review include: poor dead- zone detection for controllers (on PC) that cause the cross-hair to quickly drift upward randomly and insistently & calorie bonus on foods (most often cooked meat) not applying correctly, and wildlife behavior glitching between passive/ aggressive actions + sounds in rapid succession (ie. Wolves switching between stopping to howl and moving to stalk the player 1-2 times per second) Devs, if you're reading this, the concept of the game is brilliant. The artwork, the atmosphere, the immersion, all great. The multitude of bugs is currently a deal breaker for me recommending this game... 
I'm unsure if you'd be open to help from the community, or if you've asked for assistance from the community already, but people want to see this game succeed. Please stay optimistic and keep working on it. I'm not sure what internal difficulties Hinterland may be facing, but I know there have been setbacks and ""failures"". Many in the community have made mods to fix or alter the game already. Resources like game- testers & passionate coders are available and affordable (sometimes free) if one knows where to look.

Unlike most survival games which after a certain point just become repetitive and there is no risk of dying, the long dark makes it so that no matter how far you have progressed there is still a good chance that you could die. Whether it be because you ran out of food, water etc or you encounter the wildlife. This keeps the game fresh and interesting.

In addition the long dark gets rid of the normal base building aspect of most games. Instead of building your own base you have to use what there already is to survive and adapt to the environment, more like what you would do in a real survival situation. This might seem boring but because of the way loot and resources are found, you can't just stay in one spot and you have to keep moving from one shelter to another. This brings me to my biggest point, the map.

The long dark has one of the biggest and most detailed maps I have found in any game to date. Every area in the map is filled with detail and there isn't anywhere that you would look at and think, man the devs really took some shortcuts here. Every area has different challenges in it from wolf packs you have to stay away from to huge cliffs you have to be careful not to fall down or get stuck in. In addition to the detail in the map, the devs made a rich storyline that follows the map that you can find tibbits of throughout the entire map.

And lastly the variety of gamemodes. At first when it was released it only came with the classic survival mode, but the devs have worked hard and made a large variety of gamemodes from the storyline to the main survival mode to different challenges you can do which mean that there is no end to the game and you can continue playing as long as you want.

The whole downside is that the devs are absolutely incapable of delivering their promises, or execute on the premise properly. The game is littered with new bugs every update, even the bug fixing ones. The guarantee of ""not crunching"" their workers felt more like an excuse or a shield now to deflect some of the criticism away from their snail pace of updates and bug fixes (even when they have almost never done so explicitly), than a selling point at this point. 

The habits of overpromise is potentially gone now, but the speed to which they update and fix the game is still not sufficient for me to recommend this game. I can't really say I recommend a game which will probably only be properly playable and enjoyable in another 5 years.

As of writing the review, the game has been nearly ruined once again by the newly introduced bugs, and this bug-caused unplayability is not the first and likely not the last. It is nice that the studio cares about its people (cuz I really dread to think what Japanese devs are living like in the 21st century), but the constant disappointment in the game despite a brilliant framework of gameplay tells me that they don't really care about the customer enough, which in the end is what us customers care about, and should judge the game with.",1689551331,1689560688,False,22,5,0.560354113578796387,6,True,False,False

Trust me, it's an experience that will leave you breathless. You've got two ways to play: Wintermute, which takes you on a captivating story journey, and Sandbox, where you can forge your own path. Let me tell you, Sandbox is where this game truly shines. The freedom to explore vast regions and make your own choices is pure bliss.

Now, picture this: you're on the verge of starvation, with just one bullet left in your rifle, and a skittish deer in your sights. The tension is nervewracking. Now imagine you're huddled in a cave at night, the campfire flickering, listening to the haunting howls of wolves outside, it's a moment you won't soon forget The sound design is amazing! The Long Dark has a way of creating these organic, heart-pounding moments that just stick with you.

Sure, dealing with wildlife can be a real pain. Those wolves, oh boy, they're a menace. But trust me, the true challenge lies in battling the elements themselves. The weather is constantly changing, and it adds a whole new level of intensity. One moment you're basking in a crisp, sunny day, the next you're caught in a raging blizzard. 

Managing your resources is key. Hunger, thirst, exhaustion - they're always on the brink. But don't worry, the game's elegant design keeps you immersed without drowning you in complex menus. My only wish is that I could see my character interact more directly with the world. Nevertheless, the feeling of struggling against the Grim Reaper, fighting to survive another day, is unbelievably rewarding.

Believe me when I say there aren't many survival games out there like The Long Dark. It's a rare gem. The hand-painted art style captures the beauty and brutality of the wilderness in a way that's simply breathtaking. So, if you're looking for a game that's both challenging and soul-stirring, give The Long Dark a go.",1689556735,1689556735,True,83,4,0.857060015201568604,0,True,False,False
305620,124149529,76561198038527736,0,5,12072,0,11689,1688058849,"In the gaming wilderness, ""The Long Dark"" stands as a chilling reminder of unmet promises. Despite years of waiting, the core game remains incomplete, yet a paid expansion is out. This critique is about a saga of unfulfilled expectations and promises. It questions the priorities of profit over player satisfaction and attitude to customers that put their trust into Hinterland studios

In our current landscape of gaming, it is essential that developers maintain a strong line of communication and consistency with their player base, as well as live up to the promises they make during the game's development process. Unfortunately, it appears that Hinterland, the team behind ""The Long Dark,"" has strayed from these essential principles.

The original vision of ""The Long Dark"" was presented as a survival game that eschews typical power fantasy tropes for a more grounded, realistic experience. Players were promised a game not centered around overpowering weaponry or infinite resources, but one where survival was a carefully calculated struggle, making every decision important. Firearms were scarce, creating a pressing need for strategic thinking before every pull of the trigger.

Contradicting the original concept, the current state of ""The Long Dark"" presents an overabundance of weaponry, including multiple types of revolvers, and an almost limitless supply of ammunition available from the get-go. This shift essentially negates the purpose of the meticulously crafted bow, turning what was once a vital survival tool into a mere novelty. It seems that the original ethos of the game, as quoted, to be a game ""Not trying to make you feel like an ultimate hero that can overcome all odds,"" has been unfortunately forgotten.

On the topic of new features, the recently introduced cooking recipes offer some novel elements and objectives. However, they also reduce the tension of survival by oversimplifying resource management, allowing players to bake bread with ease and disregard the dangers of their trek to the mountain peaks.

There are still, however, points of commendation for Hinterland's efforts. The improvements made to the fishing mechanics, for instance, have been well received by the community. The removal of specific ice fishing spots has added a much-needed degree of flexibility to this survival activity.

Yet, despite these pockets of positive change, the overall direction of the game seems to have strayed far from its original promise. Adding to the disarray, Hinterland included a message about their ""Developed without crunch"" policy in each unskippable game startup. While maintaining a healthy work environment is of utmost importance, this feels more like a hollow attempt at virtue signalling rather than any meaningful commitment, especially in light of the unfinished state of the main game and announcement of a paid expansion.

In conclusion, the course ""The Long Dark"" has taken appears to be a departure from its initial design ethos, marked by broken promises and a shifting game philosophy. It's hard to recommend a game that not only remains incomplete, but also seems to be diverging from the original vision that many players were sold on. Developers should remember their responsibility to their players, their vision, and the standards they initially set.

With how the game is now, and how the developers treat it. I cannot endorse this product or game to anyone. Unfortunately it is but a husk of what was promised and being sold",1666340918,1689555560,False,27,2,0.543674290180206299,0,True,False,False

The game has matured a lot, is far more stable, and Survival mode offers a lot of custom options - just what I wanted, really, and addresses the issue that killed my previous playthrough.

The game deserves praise for its atmosphere and careful, handmade feel. There are still some wonky things like animal pathing breaking even without trying to 'cheese' it using fires or stone caches, and even playing on a Stalker-ish difficulty, I feel like defeating the cold is too easy sometimes - and that's coming from someone who quit the game because he froze to death in three hours. But this is nitpicking. The game is fun, fairly challenging, and most importantly, customizable to fit the player's taste. A lot of people don't like super-granular custom game modes, but I do.

I wish that some of the story mode stuff was in Survival mode. The feeling of being the last person on Earth is certainly a vibe, but it would be interesting if there were other people in certain locations, even if only temporarily. But, I understand this grew from a very indie game base, so I'm really just wishcasting what the devs could do next.

Good game, recommended.

This game has gone into an unbelievable downward spiral over the last year and a half or so. It used to be the best open world survival game of all time. Now it's so buggy that many MAJOR basic features don't work, every update makes the game worse, etc.

This is what survival games are about. The atmosphere is unique in my lifetime of gaming since the mid 1980s. This may be my favorite game of all time, it's hard to say for sure since I like a lot of different kinds of games. My 800+ hours on steam are about half of my actual hours in this game, which is a bit alarming to me, but then again I'm having fun so I'm ok with the amount of time I've played it.

It's not a realistic survival simulator, but afaik, there are no realistic survival games. On the other hand, this game is FAR closer to the real world than most survival games that focus on zombies, FPS, or base building. In this game, YOU adapt to the world and conditions around you. In most other survival games, you adapt the world around you to what you want. 

There are no zombies, just animals. The weather, food, water, shelter, etc. are the main ""enemies"" you have to battle. Exploration and walking are a huge part of the game. Also worth noting is that this is the type of game where permadeath is a good thing. Get ready to die countless times to get good at the game. If you go into this game with a min/maxing attitude or a perfectionist approach where losing a game to a stupid mistake bothers you a lot, you will experience unending pain. If you go in with an open mind, attempt to understand the mechanics, and learn from every death, you will get a lot of fun out of this game. 

This game has a very slow, meditative pace interspersed with many tense moments sneaking around dangerous wildlife (or being attacked by them), trying to find your way in a blizzard that showed up halfway through your trip, etc. Deaths are often a surprise and definitely feel like something has been lost. That said, much of the fun of this game comes from the risk of losing it all at any moment. I can't even guess how many times I died from a simple mistake like sleeping somewhere and forgetting to make sure it was warm enough not to die in my sleep, etc. This game can be punishing or easy and light depending on which mode you play. Since I play only the hardest mode, I think of it as a pretty harsh game, but if you play the easiest it's more like a lighthearted romp through a winter wonderland with tons of supplies etc. You can also set up custom games if that's your kind of thing. 

All of the above refers to the survival sandbox mode. Quite frankly, I never cared about a story mode in this game, but Hinterland promised one and they delivered. Then the rebuilt the entire story mode again to improve it significantly and delivered yet again. I played through the first story part and it was good for what it is, but what I love about this game is how alone you are, and as soon as I run into other people, 80% of my joy is gone. That's just me though, the story is good and it runs new players through many of the basics of the game, so it's good for getting started. But as someone who was playing for years before story mode came out, it just felt like more of an intro to the game, which I don't really need. So if you're new to the game, try the story mode if you want. But I think that most of the hardcore players of this game play just the survival sandbox and that's it.

The maps in this game are absolutely stunning, well-designed, and fun to play in. Even my least favorite map, hushed river valley, is very good. It's just not a very friendly place to stay. That said, one of my favorite maps is Forlorn Muskeg, and a lot of players really hate that map, so I guess what I'm saying is that there's something for everyone. If you like the game, you'll probably enjoy 80% of the maps, and not like a couple. All maps are optional though, so you don't have to go anywhere you don't want to (in sandbox mode, in the story mode you have to go where the story takes you). 

I can't really put into words how much fun I've had exploring the various maps and learning the terrain, finding the best loot spots and survival shelters, learning where to avoid wolves, bears, or moose or where to find rabbits or deer to hunt. There are multiple firearms in the game, but on the hardest difficulty level there is only a bow and arrow which must be crafted. I haven't used a firearm in this game in at least 2 years, if not longer. But they exist, if you want them. Using firearms or the bow are truly skill-based in this game. You actually have to get good at hunting, or throwing rocks at rabbits to stun them and scoop them up for a bit of meat. You have to tan hides to make clothing items, collect guts to make fishing lines or a bow, make traps for snaring rabbits, repair clothing, melt snow for water, learn to cook, go ice fishing...there are many things to keep you busy in this game.

Aurora Borealis AKA Northern Lights are  beautiful in this game, as are the landscapes. Even the most jaded players end up grabbing many screen caps as they explore the world of The Long Dark because the beauty is just impossible to ignore. The sound design is perfect as well, giving just enough information (you can hear a storm coming with just enough time to prepare for it, for example) to be helpful without making it easy. You have to truly be alert and keep constant situational awareness in this game, which means that when you are playing, you are really IN it. 

My favorite part of this game is starting a new survival run (I only play Interloper mode, which is the hardest difficulty level) and scrambling to get set up with good supplies and build up my skills. Like all survival games, the better you get and the better equipped you are, the easier and more boring the game becomes. That said, most players will take a LONG time to get good at the higher difficulties in this game and frankly what you put in is what you get out. Boredom is optional because there are always cool things to do in this game.

Try it out, but be patient. This game rewards a humble approach of making mistakes and learning from them. Every time you die, you'll get better at not dying next time. It is possible to get good enough to essentially never die, so if you're worried that it might be one of those pointless ""you WILL die eventually"" games, it's not. I only die in this game now when I choose to (so I can start a new game) or if I get caught by surprise (which is very rare) by a unique set of bad luck events all at once. So if you put time into this game, there is reward. You can master it and get good enough to essentially never die. That said, there's always enough risk to keep you immersed. You can play on the easier modes and work your way up the most hardcore modes, so the progression of your skills and knowledge makes sense. If you attempt the harder difficulty levels as a beginner though--you will die very quickly and not learn very much. So please for your own sake, start off with an easier mode to learn the game and maps a bit before you try to go hardcore.

The Long Dark is a truly once-in-a-lifetime game and gets the highest marks from me. It's gone through many changes over the years and I definitely didn't like some of the changes at certain points in the development process (you get far too many sprains walking on uneven ground, for example). That said, in the current version of this game, 95% of my complaints from previous versions have been fixed or rectified in one way or another, so I can give this game the highest possible recommendation if you enjoy survival/exploration games. 

I'd say that this game has been worth hundreds of dollars in enjoyment for me over the years, and there are really only a small handful of games I've ever played (and I've literally played over 2000 games) that I could describe that way.",1462389538,1689212276,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game begins by forcing the player to watch a cutscene featuring random characters that are not properly introduced. While the cutscene plays, the developers’ names appear on the screen, giving the impression that the player is watching the end credits rather than the opening of the game. This feels misplaced and does little to draw the player into the story or world. A better opening cutscene would establish key characters and plot points to hook the player’s interest.

The story itself seems poorly written, at least in the early stages of the game that I experienced. After an initial cutscene, control is taken away from the player again for another cutscene. I found myself wanting to actually play the game rather than watch cutscenes with subpar writing. When gameplay finally begins, the tutorial is set in a hangar with supplies readily available rather than an actual wilderness setting where resource gathering and survival skills would need to be learned. The tasks in this tutorial section felt unexciting and failed to demonstrate the key gameplay mechanics in an immersive way.

At one point, after waking from a nap, the player answers a phone call from an angry, unintroduced character. The purpose of this call is unclear and does little to advance the story or gameplay in a meaningful way. The excessive use of cutscenes and characters that lack proper introduction or development made the overall experience feel disjointed. The stylized art style is appealing but wasted on what feels like a poorly written and paced experience.

In summary, while I wanted to enjoy this game, the slow story, excessive cutscenes, lack of character development and improper pacing made it difficult to become fully immersed or invested. The art style is stylish but unable to overcome the other shortcomings. I would recommend significant improvements to the story, character development, pacing, and cutscene implementation before I could recommend this game.",1689171799,1689171799,False,4,0,0.482840448617935181,0,True,False,False

The Long Dark ticked all my real world interests when I first stumbled upon it. And I thought it had the most honest and unique approach to Early Access; They wanted to make a sandbox to test mechanics for a story driven game. Basically you weren't going to be spoiling anything about the story if you bought in early but could experience the rules of the universe being built. I thought that was novel and I bit. At the time a ""survival sandbox"" isn't something that was on my radar as something I wanted to play, but it turned out I could get plenty of enjoyment out of it. Still, it was the idea of a storymode with some structure to these mechanics that I was after. And so the long wait for what I wanted of The Long Dark began. I kept tabs on the progress but didn't over indulge. The grass was surely greener on the other side of that storymode hill right? And there were other games to play in the meantime anyway. I was happily patient and enjoyed poking my head in when real world blizzards kept me indoors.

Months turned to years with a capital 's'. Announcements turned into announcements of announcements. Early Access turned into xBox Insider and GOG InDev (and then not). Cash flowed and creator's dreams perhaps got more grandiose and seemingly endlessly re-imagined. The perils of success! A fawning cult following, myself included, sang its praises along the way helping it get a QUITE overstated legend status in the gaming world. User-interfaces turned into radial menus and into UIs anew. Many a thesaurus were worn to their bindings making titles for minor updates. But we got there. Storymode released and once again The Long Dark bounded up the charts and onto harddrives the world over. I had made it to the promised land...

An uninspired uninteresting cinematic introduction gets you to the beginning of your struggle. Tedium and extremely linear days greet you early in storymode gameplay. There is only one way to do things despite supposedly being a ""sandbox"" at the core. Immersion breaking oversights like one and half plane's worth of wreckage or non-campfire flames providing no heat are immediate. Soon to follow is magical floating text telling you that you don't need something yet. The simple idea of a battered and injured beginning just isn't presented in a cohesive manner at all. The game slowly tries to blossom open to give you some semblance of the control and freedom of its foundation... But you are consistently bombarded with artificial hindrances to get there. From fetch quests to conveniently placed wolves. Which lets be honest about the wolves finally; they are just zombie placeholders despite the common descriptor of ""survival without the zombies"". Hell, I even made a GOG review touting this very idea that it was ""survival without zombies!"". They were always were avoidable in sandbox, but now? As artificial barriers in storymode it cannot be denied; the wolves are indeed just zombies. Toss in sorely lacking dialogue (maybe all the creativity got used up in the naming updates?) presented in text conversation akin to something with a much deeper story. Oh and a ""trust"" system that just seems like a way to pad gameplay time. A lot of it really feels like padding time early on. (Maybe to even get to the coveted 2hr threshold?? Just sayin'...) Other things too, like an extra step in making tea that ironically takes even more 'Tweets' to explain to the wide audience. All in all that jump in quality from the desolate 'hardcore' solo survival to NPCs, broad appeal play, and abysmal story dialogue writing gets quite stark. I can't quite put my finger on all the specifics but the best way I can sum it up is that the all encompassing atmosphere the game became known for in Early Access just isn't there at all in storymode. Absolute dud on arrival. Weird transitions in the story too. Basically, if it were a movie you'd see it on Mystery Science Theater rather than in a theaters. I just don't know. Doesn't work. Comes of as a fan fiction take on a Tell Tale game pasted on top of  a sandbox. 

I have accepted (my) reality that this is a survival sandbox though. And I'm content with that. But in the coming weeks articles will be written praising artistic this or brutal survival story adventure that or 10/10 something or another. And people will come snooping around based on the storymode just as I did years ago when it was presented as a much simpler idea. So on that selling point of the storymode I would weigh all the caution in this cold world. Especially at the new price points. Take a step back and consider what kind of experience you are actually after. I look forward to enjoying this as a singleplayer survival sandbox down the road someday. Being able to play it without waiting for a mythical storymode coming ""someday"". Just to be able to play it as a sandbox and nothing else. Its probably best to rip that bandage off quickly too! Because if I had felt like storymode delivered anything worthwhile Id still be in for months (years?) worth of more waiting as the episodic delivery is STILL only two parts of five at the moment... Just silly at this point. Something that is being way way too overlooked or understated in reviews/articles/comments about the release. Storymode is not even halfway home! 2 of 5 (though I'd wager the house and the kitchen sink it ends up wrapped up in 4).

So the short of it; I heavily caution and warn a closer look if you're here for solely for very lacking and  very incomplete storymode. Satisfying survival sandbox meandering (low on action, high on survival) is there to be had outside of storymode though! It's great too. But, with the price it's well worth a wait for a steep drop and bundles if the elitist allows it.

PS: Like others have said in reviews, I do wish to add a congratulations to Hinterland for whatever that's worth. Was/is a long wild ride to get to ""full"" release.

Edit 11/2018; Not surprised to see news that they're reinventing/reenvisioning their wheel yet again. It's nice to finally see a truly far enough step back to notice things wrong with the initial storymode. But also some deja vu going on too. There is no reason to revisit until completion though. it should be clear my storymode review reflects the condition of the initial release of the firs two episodes.

Edit 03/2020; Breaking news! Still not done.

Edit 08/2021; At this point I'm just plain impressed the dude has stretched the money this far. Pandemic and all.

Edit 06/2022; Shocked it is going to actually be 5 full episodes in the end. Not at all shocked that ""2023"" is tentatively the date for it lol. Beyond bizarre the path it took (and is still taking). Seems the reins are being released to an extent at least, but that needed to happen at least three years ago. The forking of the unintended good part of the game and the disaster of a storymode is an even more overdue decision. Talking at least five years on that one. Better late than never? Oh well. I'll always wonder what could have been with this one..

Edit 12/2022; I saw this being advertised on the front page and thought FINALLY. After all this time they finished it. Good for them. Come to find out the story, which still isn't finished, is now a DLC?? Also doesn't seem the reins got handed off in any meaningful manner. Which would account for the circles still being run in. Another round of having to explain things in length. But as always; Impressive milking and stretching. Astounding.

Edit 07/2023; Checking in during the Summer Sale because Steam showed me it has a new story DLC. Figured this must mean the original story mode (that became a DLC for no reason) was finally finished. Of course it wasn't. Astonishing this game isn't dragged more. We're at a decade since the Kickstarter come October. Bonkers.",1493960463,1689106726,False,3,0,0.525114178657531738,1,True,False,False

It feels like every mechanic is there to frustrate the player and get in the way of seeing the very well made scenery.

You wake up in the middle of the frozen Canadian wilderness, hungry and on the verge of hypothermia. Your first instinct is to find a shelter and turn it into your little base camp; the place you slowly gather resources into so you can get better gear to explore further from the base, finding new and better resources to start the cycle over again. 
WRONG, if you try to settle down you quickly find out you can only leave your base once every 3-4 days because of horrible weather and wolf attacks, so all the resources you gather the 1 day you can step foot outside are spent surviving the next 3 until you can go outside and gather just enough to survive to your next gathering day. There's simply not enough time to gather stuff, haul it back to your base, prep it for a trip into the unknown, then actually go out before the next blizzard hits.

So you're forced to be a nomad, only owning what you can carry with you and never staying in one place for longer than absolutely necessary. Except now you're constantly hungry, thirsty and generally near death because you have no idea where to go to find anything worth using. You end up brute force, trial-and-error-ing your way to knowing where everything relevant is on the map you choose. The ""survival"" part really means ""survive just long enough to fill in a new section of the in-game map then screenshot it and piece together the whole region map"" and finally get to play the map after you've had 15+ characters die on suicide surveying missions.

Or you can avoid all that bullshit and either look up the maps online or go in blind with the survival elements essentially turned off so you can enjoy discovering the map yourself without having to spend 99% of your time filling up meters. Thankfully the devs do let you use custom difficulties where you can turn rate of resource drain so low you can ignore it for the most part.

The world really is beautiful, getting up to the top of a big hill and looking out over the forest on a nice clear afternoon is spectacular. Or sitting outside watching the auroras flow across the night sky when they appear. Or the small traces of human activity slowly crumbling back into the wilderness. But its marred by the punishing for the sake of being punishing survival elements that demand your attention before you can do the exploration.

The land you explore has intrigue and lore that makes you wonder about the who, what, and why of the scenes laid out before you.
Threats are more grounded as you face them as a normal person in the wilderness and decision making becomes balancing act of risk vs. reward.
Gear and equipment isn't a hodgepodge of colors and effects as much as it's practicality in a harsh environment.
The mechanics of feeding, protecting, and crafting are ones that make sense without needing a fifty page forum to explain how, confront rare or dangerous challenges better suited for after 100 hours of grinding, or scavenging for every last bit of in-game currency for one crumb of material.

It's beautiful, serene, and deadly. Set in a stunningly majestic post-apocalyptic Northern Canadian wilderness, this game will give you frostbite just by looking at the icy lakes and snow-blanketed forests. The aurora borealis has never looked so stunning or so brutally fatal. Just when you think you've mastered the art of not freezing to death, the game introduces your new buddy: starvation. The majestic deer and fluffy rabbits might seem like your lifeline, but first, you've got to catch them. Easier said then done when you're freezing, shaking, malnourished and throwing rocks at rabbits.  Staying hydrated? Great, now you learn how to survive dysentery as a bonus! Don't forget the ubiquitous wolves - you'll get to RP as a walking canapé. Have you ever played torch tag with a pack of slavering ravenous Timberwolves? Ever found yourself squatting in a tree-hole, struggling to start a fire with a couple of wet sticks in a screaming blizzard? Ever been savagely mauled by a bear and left for dead, blood freezing on the ice? No?

I do enjoy the game and have countless hours in the survival mode, I play offline which is why there is only 2 hours listed here.  I'm currently 30 days into a new run, hunkered down in Timberwolf Mountain. 

I, like many, have waited patiently for the story mode to be completed.  I played the first chapter when I bought the game a couple years ago, then stopped because I wanted to play it from start to finish.

Even after a couple years, Hinterland is now saying chapter 5 won't be finished until 2024, and at this point who knows if it even will be finished.

I purchased the DLC because of my love for the game and I also wanted to support the studio, they have done a good job with the game.

The latest update added some more cooking options, fishing options and I think some new random loot items.  Nothing of any real value, and it took them a while to add this update.  

Now, I am no longer to play in offline mode.  I submitted a ticket to Hinterland a few days ago and have heard nothing back from them.  There are also numerous posts in the discussions talking about bugs, saves not loading, etc. due to the latest update.  They've portrayed themselves as taking the time to do proper updates and finishing chapters because they don't want to release something with bugs.  This isn't the case, and if they ever do finish the story mode I'm sure it will take another few months after the release to work out the bugs.

For a pretty simplistic game it has taken way too long for Hinterland to complete the story mode, and it is also taking them way to long to release the updates to the DLC which haven't added much to the game.

Edit: Its 7/3 and I sent in a ticket on 6/26 regarding the offline mode and still have no response.  Also, I read that Hinterland supports BLM.",1687908250,1688407046,False,18,2,0.561013877391815186,0,True,False,False

I won't spoil anything but the newer character models as of episode 4 and their animations are such an awesome progression of the art style they were going for in the beginning of the game.  I do kinda wish they would rework the older scenes and change the player models in the menus a bit to match the current style as it looks a bit out of place now.  and the gameplay is great although I wish the height of ledges you could step over was a bit higher since you can't jump.  i also wish food gave more calories in general or the rate of calorie burn was a bit slower. also the player noises are annoying but they can be turned off so it's a moot point.  the isolated atmosphere of survival mode is unmatched in the gaming space and i love it (this is subject to change if they follow through with the trader concept they have for the dlc roadmap which i really don't think is a good idea).  i love the hunting aside from some of the aiming mechanics (rock throwing is really janky in my opinion).  the game is very unforgiving on anything above voyager difficulty which is good for those who like a challenge and the lower difficulties are great for anyone looking for a casual experience.

Cons: [b]#1.[/b] No tutorial whatsoever. When I say ""NO tutorial"" I literally mean the game has NO TUTORIAL.
[b]#2.[/b] The game isn't very realistic, since you can't scoop snow into a cooking pot or empty tin cans to melt it. Ontop of that, the game doesn't allow you to eat snow, which in real life you can EASILY get enough water from to survive on just by eating snow.
[b]#3.[/b] Can't set frame rate at all
[b]#4.[/b] Time in the game is displayed in minutes/hours and yet in reality it's only seconds/minutes, and this is never explained... so in the game it shows that a fire will burn for 30minutes, and yet it only burns for barely a few minutes in real time. This is highly misleading to the player at first, and throughout your entire playthrough actually too, since you have to do these maths equations just to work out how long something in the game is ACTUALLY going to last, since the time claimed in the game isn't anywhere close to the truth.
[b]#5.[/b] Game has no 'run in background' toggle, so the game literally freezes when you alt+tab and there's nothing you can do about it
[b]#6.[/b] You cannot change many of the keybindings, like you can't change any of the keys from F5 to F10, which as someone who streams and controls OBS with the F-keys (and listens music using them too), is unacceptable.
[b]#7.[/b] The female character makes male sounds (so I guess they were like 'Well let's just copy+paste the sounds from the male over)
[b]#8.[/b] You can't unlock 'feats' when playing with custom game settings... so even if you make the game harder than what it would be on the 'vanilla settings', you still can't earn 'feats' which makes zero sense.
[b]#9.[/b] No borderless fullscreen display option, and the 'fullscreen' option isn't even a real fullscreen display
[b]#10.[/b] Your character can only carry 30kg, which is freakin nothing. So instead of using a logical system based on reality, where you could maybe carry like 45kg by default and then it can go up to 60kg with slowed-down movement speed, or something like that, they instead just opted to use a completely made-up 30kg maximum.

Rating: ★★★★★

Ever wanted to experience the beauty of a Canadian postcard while simultaneously fearing for your virtual life? Well, The Long Dark has you covered! 780 hours into this game and I'm not sure if I'm suffering from hypothermia or if the goosebumps are just from the sheer beauty of the Northern Lights...

The Long Dark makes living in the frozen wilderness look like a walk in the park... if that park was in the Arctic Circle and packed with more wolves than a Twilight convention. It's a bit like Groundhog Day, but instead of waking up to Sonny & Cher, you're waking up to the howling wind and the nagging question of whether you'll be a human popsicle by nightfall.

The graphics are pure art. It's like stepping into a watercolor painting. The beautiful landscapes would make Bob Ross shed a tear of joy... right before a bear mauls him. And let's not forget the night sky, which is so beautifully rendered, you'll almost forget about the deathly chill and the ever-present specter of starvation.

And the peacefulness? It's tranquillity personified... until it's not. One moment you're picking berries, humming a merry tune, the next you're falling down a cliffside or finding out the hard way that wolves aren't just big, cuddly dogs.

And let me tell you about the survival mechanics. It's like the game developers took a look at Maslow's hierarchy of needs and thought, ""Let's put the player at the very bottom... and then dig a hole.""

You've got to worry about everything from body temperature to calorie intake. Who knew that living in the wilderness would make counting calories so crucial? One minute you're feasting on a can of peaches, the next you're eyeing up a suspicious looking mushroom or considering if bark is part of the keto diet.

But despite all the hardship, there's something strangely addictive about it. It's as if the game is daring you to survive one more day, explore one more location, or cook one more can of questionably sourced meat.

So, if you enjoy games where the environment is as much an enemy as the wildlife, where the survival is brutal but the victories are sweet, then The Long Dark is for you. Just remember to pack your virtual long johns and bring your A-game because Mother Nature is not playing around in this one!",1688144980,1688144980,True,19,5,0.725308358669281006,0,True,False,False

In order to progress in the story mode Wintermude, you need to find a prybar to open the gas station, however, I searched *everywhere* in Milton and couldn't find a single prybar. I looked in the shed behind Grey Mother's house, which actually took me so long searching around the items respawned there but still no prybar. Looked inside every house. The bank, the post office. Every car, 90% of them had the trunk locked, the ones open didn't have a prybar. I even went as far as exploring the secret cache, and two caves, found military grade rations, found thermal equipment, flares, medication. Yet not a single prybar. As far as I understand from reading online, the spawn is ""random"" and so you can be dealt a hand that makes your game broken, it simply never spawns anywhere. And I refuse to start over.

Recently i downloaded this game again and started a new survival world to see new content.

Honestly my impression was VERY negative. For couple reasons.

1. Game is very unbalanced ans several mechanics leave a lot to be desired.
- Fire starting skill leveling makes whole category of items useless (really, they lose their only intended use)
- Cooking skill throws food preservation out of the window
- Cabin Fever interrupting normal gameplay but not fulfilling its intended purpose
And many more. I understand some of these are intended by developers and devs' ""vision"" will be defended, but there is a line between artistic vision and bad game design.

2. Game still feels clunky and lacking both in gameplay and QOL
- Despite all the additions, crafting is still deserted and lacks content 
- Some basic functionality like splitting stacks in ways different than clicking +1 item 50 times
- Still no way to construct or arrange indoor storage (you need to drop items on the floor like a monkey, my favourite thing to do)
- If a long action (like a repair) gets interrupted, the progress is lost, even though the mechanic ""crafting time remaining"" is implemented in the game in other places
- Can't customize radial menu to your liking. (I love NOT having bear bedroll in radial menu but empty slot instead)
- You need to select which sickness will your antibiotic pills work on. If you take pills and you select blood loss, while having infection too, your treatment ""won't do anything"". But if you select infection, it will work on infection. 1000/10 game design right there.

All this is still forgivable. This game is, sorry, WOULD BE playable, it doesn't need to be a well polished product for a player to enjoy it, BUT.

3. The Long Dark survival mode is so buggy it is almost unplayable in the current form. 
During 30-40 hours I spent with survival after coming back I encountered this number of bugs, some of those crippling or breaking the game balance-wise:

- Dead bears and rabbits being bugged and generating noise, constantly flickering between alive and dead stances, sometimes crashing the game when being harvested
- Text on UI overlapping with other text making both unreadable (I use english version)
- Sometimes wolves just get stuck and seem to not care about you or are unable to chase you
- Some locations just GET CORRUPTED during normal play and you can't enter them anymore, happened to multiple buildings over the time I played. This is gamebreaking, because if your main base happens to get corrupted it may end or interrupt your run greatly.
- New beachcombing feature (after a rework that has couple months now) is absolutely broken. You can find flying items or items that can be picked up 4 times in a row. You can find 6 hatchests in one trip to the beach in Coastal Highway on Voyageur. It's absolutely bonkers this made it through to live build. 

And all that becomes even sadder when you know devs are focusing on DLC content instead of fixing BARELY functioning main game. I am disappointed.",1688037534,1688038369,False,4,0,0.50455087423324585,0,True,False,False

It's a granted slightly bleak adventure, staring into a snowy sky, listening to the clank of your backpack and the crunch of snow underboot, musing on the gradual entropy of your situation. Plants won't regrow, even if you wait a year, nobody will make new tools or repair kits. The game achieves a certain immersion that is rare. Little will be explained unless you read item descriptions, you won't be led by the hand but most information is there if you look for it. The game will be harsh, you'll just get unlucky, but it's full of interesting choices on how to prepare, what your priorities are.

These moments of survival are fond memories. It's simply calm, engaging, and very atmospheric. Good, but subtle use of sound. It's surprising how much the little sounds of your movement in the silent snowy landscape can be. I lasted over five hundred days before I quit, and explored every region in the base game, and it's honestly an experience I'll always remember. And while it does not take that long to explore everywhere, and the last couple hundred days were boring achievement grind in essence, I look forward to coming back one day, and revisiting my old haunts, collapsing into a house after barely finding my way back in a blizzard, and contentedly filling my character's gauges while mulling over my supplies.
I've gushed, so what's the bad? The wildlife mainly. Wolves and bears are more annoying than anything, their purpose seems to mostly justify more tools to deal with them, and the medical system. So as a mechanic I see their role, but they're still annoying. Oddly I started liking the timberwolf areas more, because dealing with wolves in that area was a breif affair, since you had to handle it all at once. And the only time I got tryly angry was with bears. They are strikingly silent, and react immediately if you walk round a tree and meet one. Three times I managed to get ambushed by a bear before I even knew it was there, and the bear attack animation gets very old after the first time. It lasts too long, there's nothing you can do to speed it along, and you're not allowed to fight back, meaning all you can do it stare at a bear mauling you and wait till the game kindly gives you back control over your outcomes. Toning down the animals a bit, and perhaps working in some more disease maladies to give the antibiotics more function would have been good.
Although on the topic of maladies, only one seemed, questionable. The effect called cabin fever. Should your character spend a long weekend not being stalked by wolves and trudging through snow barely surviving the cold, they will begin to go mad until they simply cannot sleep inside anymore. This, isn't framed as a natural amount of claustrophobia for the character, and your audience is gamers, who are additionally less inclined to find such an aversion to staying inside believable. Honestly, the mechanic doesn't seem to serve any purpose. It drives players outside, sure, but a player cannot survive forever, or even that long without doing so. It's forcing the player to take actions that may be objectively bad for them, and seems poorly thought out. If the player wants to stay inside, prioritise reading a book, making some new gear, and avoid a blizzard, why penalise them for that, when the mechanics of food and fuel for boiling water will drive them out anyway? In a game where there is so much freedom, it's a strange place to draw a hard line, because the player can make no choices around it. Take intestinal paracites. The player can risk it, or not. They can decide it's worth it because they have medicine, or not. They can try methods to get around the risk, toy with the risk, or avoid it entirely. Cabin fever serves only to, restrict the amount of time the player can perform activities indoors, for no perceivable reason.

The Long Dark is a [b]resources management game[/b] with a steep learning curve. Everything has a chance of failure as a part of the challenge. You either get better or die. You can never be prepared for everything. It is random... I mean [i]nature[/i]. At first glance, the game's mechanics align with the narrative but it is as cartoonish as the game's graphics:
- [b]Exaggerated degradation[/b]: better being naked during a blizzard or a fight with animals to preserve your clothing
- [b]Immersion-breaking mechanics[/b]: sleep in a cave or a snow shelter rather than a cosy bed to avoid [i]cabin fever[/i]
- [b]Zombies[/b]: bloodlust respawning killing machines, fighting them is a button-mashing [i]Quick Time Event[/i]. The lead designer is a ""[i]proud Canadian[/i]"" so they reskinned them as wolves.
- [b]Very limited environment interaction[/b]: you can't use a metal pole instead of a crowbar to open a locker or use a hatchet to fight [i]zombie-wolves[/i]...

The game's progress is not measured by your character being better but by your knowledge to deal with excessive mechanics.

[code]Sorry to those who are disappointed you can no longer play #thelongdark on GeForce Now. Nvidia didn't ask for our permission to put the game on the platform so we asked them to remove it. Please take your complaints to them, not us. Devs should control where their games exist.
They offered us a free graphics card as an apology, so maybe they'll offer you the same thing.[/code]

[h3]GeForce Now[/h3]
[url=en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_Now]GeForce Now[/url] is not a [i]platform[/i]. It is a [i]cloud streaming service[/i]. In principle: they provide powerful hardware as a service to run the software for which you have a valid licence. This expands the range of potential customers for that software and thus bringing more money to developers.
In contrast to e.g. [i]Google Stadia[/i] which is both a streaming service and a platform so you need to buy the games there, [i]GeForce Now[/i] is luckily [b]only[/b] a [i]streaming service[/i]. It adds the option to play your games on below-specification hardware (even on a phone) and avoids the whole ""[i]OMG, they want me to buy my games again[/i]"" issue.

3) After the start of backlash [i]Lierop[/i] added:
[code]There's really nothing newsworthy or shocking about our decision here. The shocking part is people's reactions to it. Nvidia admitted they made a mistake releasing without our permission, apologized, asked us if we'd like to stay on the platform, and we said ""not at the moment"".[/code]
[i]nVidia[/i] apology is their own [b]business decision[/b]. The most [i]shocking[/i] is [i]Lierop's[/i] exposed opinion of consumers' lack of freedom to play the game on any hardware.

4) [i]Lierop's[/i] afterward comment is simply hilarious:
[code]Today's world is getting complex for devs, with lots of platform changes and shifts to streaming, so devs have to be able to plan a strategy for how their games will appear and where, as a means of running a business. All the platforms acknowledge this.[/code]
What? How [i]exactly[/i] does [b]streaming[/b] prevent to ""[i]plan a strategy as a means of running a business[/i]""?
Let me add some logic to [i]Lierop's[/i] babbling: ""[i]Today's world is getting complex for players, with lots of platform changes and shifts to play-as-service, forced online-play only, user-tracking, loot-boxes, pay2win, pre-order exclusive bonuses... Players have to be able to plan their purchases with the knowledge game developers will not artificially restrict some hardware usage whenever they desire.[/i]""

[i]nVidia[/i] has valuable advertisement from this incident. The only victims in this situation are customers. [i]The Long Dark[/i] is a great financial success with [url=en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Dark#Commercial_reception]over 3.3 million sold copies (September 2019).[/url] It is [b]hypocritic[/b] to say: ""[i]main issue is not being asked, and the assumption we don't need to be asked[/i]"" and at the same time do not ask players who already paid for the game.

[b]Raphael van Lierop[/b] describes himself [url=twitter.com/RaphLife?p=s]at twitter as:[/url] ""[i]Proud Canadian.

Updated review at 250+ hours.  
Sandbox:
The current price point might be worth it if you enjoy sandbox survival games.  I still believe this to one of the best I've played. It certainly qualifies as the one I've invested the most time in.
 
Story mode: Reserving my judgement for a later date. It's too new and still getting hotfixed daily. I have not completed story mode yet and that's due to a bug which prevents me from completing a quest and moving forward. I'll update this section once I can complete Episode 2. 

Pre-release:
If you're looking for a solo survival game, this just might be exactly what you wanted. It is for me. At 18 hours in, I feel like I've had a great time playing and it already was well worth the cost.  This has so much potential, but even at it's current state in Alpha it's an enjoyable game.  I'm really looking forward to seeing their story mode. 

The mechanics have impressed me and it's obvious many details have been carefully considered by the Devs.  I'm a sucker for a more realistic world and realistic survival challenges.  I have enjoyed some of the other survial games as well, but they lost me when I encountered perma-death for arbitrary reasons that could not be forseen or avoided by the player.  Here you'll find a lot of calculated risks in the name of rewards.  So far, my near death experiences have been due to my own foolish mistakes.",1441348661,1687711330,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

By far nothing beats this game, not by a mile. It's a slow and steady wins the race type of feeling, no one holds your hand and it is always up to you how you will survive. I've been a long time supporter of Hinterland and this game, way back in the day with kickstarter when I had my eyes on it. I was broke at the time so I couldn't support it then, but this game means something to me, and a lot of other folk. There have been ups, and there have been downs, but in 'the long run' it definitely has more ups than it ever will have downs, and that's a fact.
      Bar none nothing beats the style, art, and ultimately the gameplay of The Long Dark. If you are new to the game and are interested, I recommend you give it a chance. To those who have been around for a long time, or even those who do not know about the work ethic of Hinterland, this is what I'll say, They always deliver. It may not be on your time, or even theirs, but you will get what is promised. It may seem abstract in the modern climate of game development, but a full and finished product is always better than a rushed, sloppy buggy mess. Just trust them.


OG Review: Of all things glorious, The Long Dark takes the cake. I love this game and everything about it, the concept is incredible and the design style. I have never seen a more creative game than The Long Dark, it is an ever changing game!

Well, ehrmm....Let's revisit, shall we?

""The content updates are there, even though the timing is a bit slow. While this can become frustrating, the game itself is such a little gem of a survival sandbox, I'm happy to keep waiting for story mode."" Keep waiting....in 2016....7 years later.....Still. Not. Done. 

""- Longer than anticipated development time."" Slap my a** and call me Sally, did I call that one or what.

"" At best, it'll suck you in and when it's done, there will be a pretty great story mode to boot. And when the platform for story mode is wrapped up, I personally am excited about any narrative based content sent our way."" Right. 

I know a lot of you folks are going ""story mode isn't the point man""...well, maybe to you its not. And I acknowledge, the sandbox is fun. What you may have missed though, is that this was advertised AS A STORY GAME - the survival was the bonus, not the other way around. So it's a bit of a bait and switch in terms of content style, even if the systems and game itself grew and stayed in a consistent direction. 

That's why we're mad. Is it still a good game? Yes. Do I still recommend it? Yes, cause it's a good game but only if you can get over the fact / don't care about that the devs kinda chucked the story mode out the window. So be happy with what's there, and don't hold your breath for story mode. Get this if you're after sandbox. If you're in it for the narrative experience, pass on this. 


Original: 2016 (below)

You know what I'm really tired of? Zombies. I get it. I really do - there are lots of them. So you can shoot them. There are even hordes of them, so that you can run away like a little b*tch. But honestly? It takes away from games these days rather than add to them, because they're everywhere. Don't get me wrong - shooting zombies is great fun. But when they are used as a trope in any kind of survival style game, it means that the game boils down into the same recycled mechanic. Build wall to keep zombies out. Oh no! The zombies have learned how to climb. Build a better wall. Oh no! The zombies have learned how to dig. Build the best wall, and trust me - it is the best. I know walls, and I am pretty great. Nah. I am best, and I will build the best wall. And the zombies will pay for it. 

Anywho...

So, my foray into the Long Dark began at the Steam Store, sometime around 3:00 AM in the morning. Now, normally after such an evening, I wake up with a lot of pain after I realize that I once again failed to heed the warnings my father relayed to me about saving payment methods in e-merchant stores. Nothing responsible happens after 2:00 AM. Nothing. And so, before I knew it, I owned this game. Simply because it promised me there were no zombies. And I loved it. And in lieu of yet another paragraph, I have made a list. Lists are good. 

- The Good - 

- The game has a very unique graphic style which sucks you in without spit-roasting your graphics card. This is good. (Although, not really a concern due to another post 2:00 AM purchasing decision I had made, this time in Newegg. Yikes.)
- The game does a good job of balancing exploration and surivival. I've gone for walks in the forest and contemplated things. It was almost meditative, and for me a great experience as here is a game that motivated you to think and reflect rather than hurling one action packed encounter after another at you. It was a nice change of page.
- Then, the game saw fit to crap on everything. Living in Canada, I am no stranger to the emotions that can best be summed up with ""holy hockey pucks, it's colder than a polar bear's nutsack here"". What I didn't expect was going from my meditative rambling about to praying for a fishing shack, or any form of shelter, frantically stumbling about in a blizzard and hoping my avatar wasn't going to freeze to death in the middle of this frozen lake. And there is that balance.
- The game has a pretty high quality of production. This is no 16 year old trying to pull ye olde Steam Early Access Cash Grab(tm). 
- The systems are pretty intuitive, and you have a real opportunity to figure them out as you play. This fosters a fun sense of discovery, and coming to terms with being stuck out here in this environmentally murderous landscape. 

- The Bad -

As with any game, there are detractions. Especially Early Access games. 

- Longer than anticipated development time.
- Very flexible development timeline, in that the developers seem to veer into the trap of ""oooh! We can make this better!"" Well guys, I appreciate and completely understand the dedication, but sometimes, you gotta sit down and eat. You can keep tweaking and slow-cooking those ribs for that fall of the bone thing, but eventually people will get up and just go to McDonald's so they don't starve to death. 
-/+ Can get repetitive, though this really is up to you as a player. You have to inject yourself into the game, and in a sense try to slip into the mindset of your avatar. And in that sense, the world can become your own little prison after you've walked around enough, and you just end up staring at the store page, hoping for an announcement of a content update.

- The Verdict - 

Well, do I recommend? Wholeheartedly so, especially if on a sale. The content updates are there, even though the timing is a bit slow. While this can become frustrating, the game itself is such a little gem of a survival sandbox, I'm happy to keep waiting for story mode. While I am somewhat vary of whether the developers will end up running around in circles polishing until there is no player base left because they've moved on, I look at the content that they mean to add and enter into a conflict: jeez, that wound make this really neat! versus. DAMMIT I WANT MY GAME ALREADY. Usually with Early Access, it's just the latter, and so I'm willing to wait it out because the direction it is taken has: a) stayed true to the game that was advertised, and b) seems to be heading towards a better finished product. Not to mention, the polish does keep the sandbox experience fresh and pleasant to visit. 

So take a long walk in the snow. Give it a chance. At worst, you'll get a dozen hours of decent entertainment. At best, it'll suck you in and when it's done, there will be a pretty great story mode to boot. And when the platform for story mode is wrapped up, I personally am excited about any narrative based content sent our way. Should be a great time.

1. There are better survival games out there. Green Hell, in particular, is much better.
2. There's no improvement of your situation. You are just clinging to life step by step, just trying not to die. There's no happy ending here.
3. The game is very tedious. You will do the same thing, day after day, and none of it is fun.
4. I thought I was buying a full campaign, but it turns out I have to pay for the later episodes.

I liked the campaign - what I got to play, but otherwise I just didn't have fun. There's a difference between a challenging game and a depressing simulation of of tedium.

Updated November 2017: So it's been a while since I wrote this review. A lot changed in the game. When I picked it back up earlier this year, I kind of had to relearn how to play with new challenges in warmth, hunger, thirst, weight management, and illness. The major thing that changed was to the UI where Hinterland went with the 'wheel' selection method you see in a lot of games these days. It works here like pretty much everywhere. I still love the game, and it still is fun. I've not dove into the story mode yet, but I've heard it was crap and now has improved immensely. It's nice to finally see it done, but this is a success story for early access, unlike so many others. If you like survival games, this is one that focuses on survival and not crafting or fighting off some sort of enemy horde. The weather is your enemy, the random resources are your only hope for survival. Use them wisely, or suffer the fate of permadeath. I recommend this game, but it may not be for everyone so so watch some footage of it on YT or something to get a feel of it before buying.

Original review:
Oh, you want to know why I recommended The Long Dark?
It's so brutal and I'm addicted to getting killed by wolves, freezing, and starving to death.
I love survival games, and this one is the best I've ever played for the partial realism.
Yes, there isn't a story as of yet, and hopefully the Devs will get the time to finish it because another objective, other than straight partial realistic survival, would be a nice addition to a beautifully crafted game.
Speaking of graphics, they aren't ultra-realistic, but they are nice and they do add to the immersion a bit.
There's a few things I would like to see happen in the game eventually, such as the ability to chop wood or bust up the numerous things that could be used for a fire, and fishing. There's plenty of ice fishing shacks that could be utilized for this. However, if and when the story mode is completed, there is probably a reason why these things are not implemented, but in sandbox mode, it'd be far out.
So other than it being boring simply trying to survive the brutality of this vast mostly empty landscape, it's a great game and I recommend anyone get it and play it at some point, whether that be now[at the time of review] or when it is finished.",1434894625,1687064725,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On the one hand they get the elements of survival right. Food, water, heat, and sleep management are all there and feel well balanced, contributing to game mechanics in ways that demand your attention and reward your focus. Inventory management and supply gathering are well thought out, crafting is not lacking but feels less robust. This may be intentional as the game pushes you towards scavenging instead of resource mining; its gameplay loop being geared more towards exploration as there are no craftable structures or base building elements. At times the game shines as you push through with only what you need, and making it to a new location to searching for supplies and materials makes finding a new tool, weapon or item truly impactful.

But as you come to master your surroundings you'll find the developers have played to their strengths in only the areas that pertain to survival. Graphics are far from impressive but live up to that task of immersing you in the world you are exploring. What falls embarrassingly short is the characters, both in their design and especially in the writing, which tries and fails to make you care about these characters. Downright bad voice acting exacerbates the problem of poorly written dialogue, and as a result interacting with any character feeling inorganic, melodramatic and worst, boring.

Thankfully the game leans into its survival elements and doles out progress and challenges at a steady rate to keep you feeling the pressure of survival, while unfortunately stumbling into cringe inducing territory with badly executed story beats.

There is an episodic story mode, and a simple survival mode. They have only released the first 2 episodes out of 5. The game runs smoothly, but it crashed 2 or 3 times in my 25 hour playthrough.

I learned I wouldn't survive if I kept messing around. Surviving becomes difficult because every action you take requires time. Chopping wood to warm yourself up at a campfire will make you hungry and thirsty. Sprinting around looking for supplies makes you tired faster. It's a delicate balance.

Review:

The Long Dark is one of the most captivating games I've ever played, offering a unique and unforgiving survival experience. With its atmospheric and challenging environment, realistic mechanics, and minimalist narrative, the game stands out as a remarkable example in the survival genre. Here are the key elements that make The Long Dark an extraordinary game:

Environment and Atmosphere:
The environment in The Long Dark is stunning and immersive, with frigid and vast landscapes that evoke a sense of loneliness and isolation. The graphics are beautiful and realistic, conveying the feeling of being lost amidst an unforgiving nature. The minimalist soundtrack and subtle sound effects further enhance the immersion, creating a tense and engaging atmosphere.

Realistic Survival:
One of the standout features of The Long Dark is its realistic approach to survival. The game presents a set of basic needs such as hunger, thirst, cold, and fatigue, which require constant attention from the player. Managing resources like food, water, fuel, and appropriate clothing plays a crucial role in survival. The realism of these elements creates an authentic and rewarding challenge.

Challenging Gameplay:
The Long Dark is known for its challenging gameplay. From the very beginning, the game puts the player in a hostile and merciless environment, where every decision can be a matter of life or death. Careful exploration, hunting animals, scavenging for supplies, and time management are key to survival. The constant sense of vulnerability adds tension and excitement to the experience.

Minimalist Narrative:
The narrative in The Long Dark is subtle and minimalist, mainly revealed through notes and clues found in the environment. The game allows players to interpret the story for themselves, creating a personal connection and emotional involvement with the protagonist and their desolate surroundings. The lack of traditional linear narrative allows each player to construct their own survival story.

Replayability and Game Modes:
The Long Dark offers great replayability, with various game modes to explore. The main story mode, Wintermute, provides a more structured narrative experience, while the Survival mode challenges players to face the elements and survive for as long as possible. Additionally, the addition of seasonal events and special challenges keeps the game fresh and interesting even after many hours of play.

In summary, The Long Dark is one of the best games I've ever played, providing an engaging and challenging survival experience. With its immersive atmosphere, realistic mechanics, minimalist narrative, and high replayability, the game stands out as a remarkable example in the survival genre. If you're looking for an intense and rewarding experience, The Long Dark is definitely a game worth exploring.",1686874013,1686874013,True,1,0,0.511278212070465088,0,True,False,False

Every since all these stupid campaign addons the game is broken. In the past the breaks would finally get fixed but then it would be broken again. This time around is an error -7 or -9 ""Game will not start"" error with a non-functional ""contact the Developer"" button. I've seen Windows and Linux users reporting it. Hinterland just ""answers"" all those posts with a link to a page that says they know it's broken, but they patched it, the patch doesn't fix it so they are leaving it up as a known issue. So the answer is they know and for you to no longer play the game because they can't seem to fix it. I've got several support tickets open, all just get an auto response then months of radio silence. Seems every week or two there is a new build that does nothing to address this issue. So now for close to a year the game has been nothing but a waste of hard drive space. I keep uninstalling then re-installing when I see updates hoping they finally fixed the GD game but every reinstall it's still broken.

I was nervous about a alpha (i.e. paying for unfinished (possibly never finished) work) but after watching a few weeks of SplatterCat play this I almost couldn't resist as it scratches my cold isolation itch. I used to wander off where ever I could on nights when it was -64 Celsius and revel in the feeling the world had died.

I've not even been able to make it 2 days yet but love wandering around. There is something interesting about exploring and managing time and condition that doesn't seem to screw things up. I'm sure this is a tricky balance that could make play very discouraging if done wrong.

I know at present I wish they would add a ""free play"" mode where in you can set the time of day and weather and ""freeze"" it. This means hours of wandering under the beautiful night sky, sitting in the forest look out during a beautiful blizzard, trekking through a morning fog...

I suppose I should update this given they have added some of my wishes and a hell of a lot more. Frankly I'm so jaded with gaming these days I don't know why I bother...but Hinterland is a massive exception to that. I started playing The Long Dark when it was super basic compared to now. They keep adding, tweaking, improving. Honestly unless you hate the genre you're nuts if you don't have this in your collection. The Long Dark is easily one of the best games in a long long time. Hinterland as a studio are brutally competent not only in their game design but in their code. Art and audio design are top notch. When you are trying not to die it's like walking through a living piece of art. The sunrises, the storms...It's a watercolor winterland hell and it's freaking gorgeous!

(edit)
I decided with far territory coming out I'd give it a shot again, since things like the moose were still new mechanics back when I stopped playing, I have to give them credit for what they've done, some of the wonkyness that drove me away is gone, the only two negative feelings I have remaining are 1, Wintermute has been in the works for almost TEN YEARS now, frankly I've lost interest, and 2, its still a bug filled mess in quite a few ways, accidentally slide across a box you're opening? well you better find it or you'll be hearing that rustle until you load, step in the wrong place? you can end runs ending up soft locked in tiny ditches up against log fences. Had a recent interloper run end because I slept in the truck on my way into coastal highway to save and quit and when I came back I was soft locked above it where I couldn't reach the door to get out.

It took a team of 100 at Bethesda, 5 years after releasing Oblivion, to create ALL THAT IS Skyrim.  Hinterland has 88 employees according to their LinkedIn page, and it has taken them nearly a Decade, to create 1/10,000th of what Skyrim is.  The Long Dark is A Long Waste of Time.  This game will never be finished.

I was just recently banned from the entire Hub for speaking my truth, and they don't want people to voice their thoughts and opinions, as many before me have, and many after me will.  They can't silence free speech, and oppress people under tyranny.

This game doesn't boast HDR graphics, or 4K textures, and complex geometry or insane physics.  This game is something a high school kid could put together, and it hasn't even been completed in almost a Decade.  This is like waiting for Guns 'N Roses to finally release their new album.  Save your time, and energy, and money.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

Buy Skyrim Anniversary Addition, and get the Survival Mod, so you can play a Real Survival Game, across all the lands of Skyrim, with better graphics, plenty of animals to hunt, and plenty of adventuring.

It has been almost 10 years since this game came out on early access, and it is still not finished.  They are instead electing to create DLC to keep generating income because no one else is buying this unfinished game.

[i] The Good [/i] - Top tier take on the survival genre where the environment is the antagonist.  

[i] The Bad [/i] - The story protagonist is a 50 IQ brainlet. Only real reason to play this game is Survival mode, but it lacks defined goals and objectives. It also lacks a kind of power scaling in the world, so once you kill a bear you will feel like you are done with the game. What SHOULD be a key driving force for continuing to play is exploration of a well crafted world, HOWEVER, the in game systems fight you at every turn so you inevitably end up on the wiki. Once you see the wiki and its maps, it demystifies the game and you lack any reason to play. 

[i] The Ugly [/i] - Was in EA back in 2014, now its 2023 and its paid DLC is literally in early access. Full circle to EA. 
Most people only care about survival mode, but the devs actively hate that part of the community and throw very few bones our way. Also how out of touch do you need to be to have ""made by devs who care who don't crunch"", when you take years to provide simple updates.

I was in the farmstead, and just sat there listening to the sounds the house made from what was happening outside, whether blizzard, wind, etc. However, I do have a suggestion. For surival mode, you basically find food and gear, but then what? I feel that it lacks gameplay options or intensity at most, besides the bears and wolfs. I feel that there should be ai in the world, that don't go along with a story like the story dlc, but have a backstory. The ai could be neutral or enemies that you could interact with.

With that in mind, at first, I was pretty frustrated for the first 15 in-game days. But, now? I totally get it. This is, by far, the best survival simulation on the market (all quirks aside). Of all the quirks, here are a few the average player will find frustrating at first:

1. You can't jump. IDK why the devs did this, but it kinda sucks. If you're like me at all, you have your jump and crouch keys mapped out before starting every new game. But, your toon can't jump at all. So, in cases where you would normally jump, you might have to find a different way to your destination. 
2. Depending on the weather, you will spend a lot of time in front of the same fire, in the same shelter, for days of in-game play and hours irl. That's just part of the experience; waiting till you can see (and navigate) in decent-enough weather. 
3. Hunting is really challenging. I'm pretty sure the hillsides are covered with the bodies of my attempted targets, because if you don't kill your target with the first shot, it will run off, even if it's a bear, and it will keep on going, seeming indefinitely. On several occasions, the day after shooting it, I've found a deer, wolf and even a bear that died when it was circling back to the location it was shot. No problem, no loss and still totally harvestable. 
4. You won't find what you want/need when you want it. I didn't find a rifle or hacksaw until after 30 in-game days. And, since then, I haven't needed the hacksaw, and I've only killed one bear with the rifle. 
5. Instead of boundaries, the devs made it so you will probably die if you try to go there. For example, in one region, I tried going around a roadblock by crossing the ice near the coast. But, every time I tried, I fell in the water and nearly died. After three tries, I realized ""The devs must not want me to go this way."" Lesson learned. 
6. If you don't bring your bedroll with you, and you can't find it again, you risk dying of fatigue, loss of condition, fainting and thus hypothermia.
7. Remember your big cooking pot. I say this only because for the last 15 in-game days, I've been heating food up and boiling water in soup cans only because I left both my big cooking pots someplace 3 or 4 zones back and haven't found a replacement. It's a minor inconvenience, but those minor inconveniences add up fast. 

So far, I'm still on my first toon (surprisingly) and haven't died yet. The wolves I've encountered easily scare away with either a shot from the revolver or the popping of a flare. Most of them run away just because of your scent. Same for bears, except they're not afraid of your scent. 

All in all, TLD is, by far, one of my all-time favorite games, and I'm going to cry when this toon eventually dies. It will happen, but I will stave it off as long as possible. Have fun!",1685170292,1685511638,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- It is very satisfying slowly exploring an area, building up various bases, stockpiling equipment, food, water and fuel.

- The weather is done very well and has a major impact on your day to day activities.

- Many of the landscapes in the game are very beautiful and if I am at a high point I often find myself just staring and enjoying the view.  It is especially lovely at night when an aurora is happening.  I love that it is set in Canada as that is a country I have always wanted to visit.  

- There are a lot of long term goals you can set yourself - new regions to travel to, things to craft, items to find and repair.   

- The game creates many dramatic survival moments where your choices matter and how prepared or unprepared you are shows.  Things can snowball relatively quickly from one or two bad decisions, especially on the back of some bad luck from hostile wildlife or weather.  

- Surprisingly, the game is also very relaxing and therapeutic.  It naturally moves between these quieter moments and the above life or death points.  

- The music on the whole is great and contributes positively to the atmosphere.  

- There are four difficulty settings which adds to replayability since you can add additional challenge to the game as needed.  



Things that could be improved or that I don't like:

- Where are all the birds? Only crows, seriously? Apart from a few ambient sounds which occasionally hint at other birds, their absence is glaring.  No seagulls along the coast even.  Come on.  

- Similarly there are only five land animals.  More variety would be so much better and more realistic.  

- I think it's a bit of a stretch that in survival mode you are literally the only human survivor.  Surely it wouldn't be that hard to implement in the game a very rare fellow human passing through, leaving some fresh evidence of their passing at the same time.  Maybe you don't even see them but you find signs in an area you already explored that someone passed through since you were last there.  The memento cache concept could have been built up into a proper network of survivors leaving notes and supplies for each other, something you could also participate in.  Instead all human evidence is from some point in the past before they all died.     

- Sometimes the rules of the game world are very frustrating.  You can't jump at all.  You can't erect barriers with logs or rocks.  You can't move furniture around the houses.  You can't sit down anywhere.  In some of the houses you move into and make your home, there's bits of rubbish lying around which you can't interact with and so it's always there annoying me even after everything else is organised.  

- When you bring up the screen of your character with their clothing on they look so stupid and not even like a normal person, more like a clown.  Given the whole game is about keeping your character alive, a little bit of TLC on the character development would have gone a long way.  Some choices of how they look at the start.   


Final thoughts:

This game is truly amazing.  I am glad to see they are still adding to the game with fresh updates and the new DLC.  I found this game many years after it's release but so glad I did.",1685441340,1685484526,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game presents a bit of a challenge in navigation, since you don't where you are just by looking on your map. You have to rely on your memory a lot, and I really like that it didn't gave for the same map gimick like in other games. One thing which is a bit annoying is that you can somehow sprain your ankle/wrist from a tiny fall, but you get used to it.

The wolves and bears also add a lot to the gameplay, so that you aren't just running around, thinking nothing can hurt except the cold. The wolves graze you a little bit, they're annoying if you encounter them once in a while, dangerous if you get mauled by them. But at least you can defend yourself against them if they have you pinned down. Bears on the other hand, you can do literally nothing if they have you pinned down. Only way to defend yourself effectively is by having a rifle.

The soundtrack is amazing! It plays every so often, its super ambient, and I like that. Story OST is really cool as well, although I'm sad that they removed the Timberwolf encounter music in Episode 3. But that's my only little nitpick.


Overall, it is a great game to play and you should try it. Trust me, it will be worth your time.",1598738467,1685478353,True,3,0,0.555787920951843262,0,True,False,False

[u]One huge complaint others have is how long they've been waiting for the final chapter of the story line. (see below)[/u]

 This is one of the best games I've ever played and I've been playing games for 40 years.
You'll probably like this game if you like video games with a combination of these things: open world, adventure, mystery, eerie suspense, amazing story, wilderness survival, arctic environment, crafting, fishing, hunting, camping, top notch graphics.

The game lives up to the hype and then some... >IF< you discovered it without hearing about the hype, >OR< you're not too cool to like a game when others already know how good it is.

One huge complaint others have is how long they've been waiting for the final chapter of the story line.  It doesn't bother me personally... 
I figure it's for one of two reasons: 
1. When the beginning of the story is this amazing it will be from hard to next to impossible to live up to expectations, so why ruin a good thing. 
2. They would rather make the end of this game last as long as possible as they work on a sequel so that interest won't wane and they'll be able to release a sequel a lot sooner than later.

If it's for some other reason, who cares? Just go play a different game until it's released, jabronis.  Or get a life and do something besides playing video games, losers.  If your $10 or whatever wasn't worth 40 hours of gameplay, you just need to be shot anyway, freeloader.  That's what really irritates me, chinsers who have 100 hours playing a $12 game and then complain that they didn't get what they paid for.  If you can spend 100 hours playing stuff you didn't pay for you deserve to be robbed and you don't deserve nuthin' else.

I have the DLC on Playstation and I'm enjoying where that is going.

I have played video games my whole life and never have I felt compelled to leave a review like I do for this game. The survival apocalypse genre has always been a favourite of mine and my steam library is filled with them. 

HOWEVER! This is the game I always come back to. When I first saw the game I thought that I would be put off by the art style as it wasn't something I was used to, but it's so beautiful. The depth of the world and realism and challenge this game presents is beyond. When I first bought this game I died so many times and because you have to learn how to survive and what to prioritise. Every time I died however, I was straight back in with a new save file that was different every time and using what I had learned from my previous failed attempts. Even when you think you have mastered the game and can survive for months, something can happen because you lost focus or felt too comfortable or just made a bad decision and you die again. You don't get frustrated at the game, but just at yourself and you are driven to start all over again as your new journey will be different again. It is so unbelievably captivating.

The developers really care about the experience they are giving to the players and you can see it in the game and the updates. Games are going on the market at £60 for just the base game, not including any dlcs or charging even more to get a few skins for a gun or your character as a deluxe package of the game. This game however is truly worth the money they charge (for wintermute and far territory) compared to other games, if not more. Buy this game and you won't regret it.

It's cheap, it's fun but also scary, the mechanics are amazing and still manages to have a better plot than many new games. If you play survival mode, there's so much to do & if you like hunting for achievements, you should really try it out too.


Even though right now the developers are struggling from a snowball effect started by 2020, I've rarely seen a team be as open and honest with their community as Hinterland; who are just a small studio that depend on game sales and in my opinion, deserve respect. The devs and the crew deserve fair treatment just like any other human and gamers are usually blind to that.

Unfortunately somone there decided to ruin my experience by making my effort incompatible with current form of the game. The current form of the game prioritizes new DLC, making the story mode (which still lacks the last episode) and survival mode (which was, and de facto is, the main mode of this game) marginalized.

I'm sorry Hinterland Games but at this point you lost a good fan. It's impossible for me to return to this game because you made my over 100 hour long experience unsupported. It had downs and ups and several bugs (including 2 that almost broke my game), but I still liked it and wanted to finish it. Now I won't, because I don't feel good about playing unsupported build. I'm also disheartened by not getting in return anything even halfway close to what I lost. Maybe if Wintermute was completed, I would comfort myself with it. What is there now is not enough, becasue I know this game well enough to get burned out too quick by playing in the same environement and rebuilding the same plan, which took a lot of time. 

In normal circumstances I would recommend getting Survival Edition, but current policy around this game is forcing me to warn anyone. Don't be naive like me, don't invest so much of your time in survival mode, because they might do the same thing again.

WAIT until they finish the game as there is a real possibility they cannot do it.  The paid DLC is likely an effort to produce some profit before abandoning the development of the game.

And don't purchase the game if you want to interact with the Community on Steam.  There is a small group of sycophants which act as gatekeepers and they do so with the approval of the Moderators.  All these individuals need to do is to drag you into an argument over YOUR OPINION of the game and then report your post and the Moderators act swiftly to delete posts, lock threads and ban anyone with less than a stellar opinion of the game or its development.  To give you an example of the Moderators lack of integrity.  They ban any discussion of mods for the game and blame STEAM by claiming discussing mods violates STEAM'S prohibition on ""cheats and exploits.""  Let that sink in while you recount the number of other games with dedicated Steam forums for their mods.

And the game is far from perfect.  There are countless issues with the game which were never addressed by the developer and now that the seem to be abandoning the game it is unlikely they will ever fix.  A lot of them are small issues but there are a lot of them and they impact gameplay greatly.  One example is the whetstone.  Used to sharpen a knife or hatchet blade the whetstone wears out after just a handful of uses.  I have whetstone that I have had since I was a kid.  Those things never wear out.  Also, there isn't actually a sharpness mechanism.  You sharpen your blade to add duration to it.  In essence you refill the knife's hp bar by ""consuming"" the whetstone.  This might be a small thing but there are dozens of similar issues like the inability to fill up a larger container with smaller ones.  Instead you must carry around multiple small containers with a couple of ounces of fluid in them rather than simply poor all of them into one.

If you suggest the developers change these things they find a spurious excuse to ban you from their forums.

But the best reason to NOT purchase this game is it is unfinished.  Yet the company is producing DLC content to milk their existing customers.  And this is likely before they abandon the game and move on to another.

This isn't really a sandbox, it's mostly just survival game but it just feels really tedious, pointless and downright boring.

You can't do so little crafting without beings forced to hunt, wait, go to specific places that have crafting benches ( you can't build any yourself ). You get way too thirsty, tired, cold and hungry constantly, so most of you time is just spending on just the tedium of survival.

Even once you get enough clothes to generally not be cold in normal weather, you're still constantly just fighting that same tedium.

It feels certainly feels like an unfinished game. I got through the first chapter of the story, which seemed fine, then jumped into survival mode because I didn't want to be forced into locked down in narratives and story that I could not skip through.

I have an ultrawide HDR monitor ( 5120x1440 ) and it didn't looks as good as it really should, it also wouldn't let me really choose a resolution that I wanted. I usually play games in windowed ( 2560x1440 ), but that wasn't even an option. With a lot of strange resolution options, I'm guessing to force a specific aspect ratio. Just let me choose a resolution that I want and is actually normal.

Even when I finally got so bored I decided to cheat and use a few mods, the tedium of even just recharging thirst, hunger and fatigue was obnoxious while trying to simply explore. I really tried to find something to like in this game, but in the end I finally got too bored.

I'm sure there's people that love this type of gameplay, but given what this is, it really should have been something I would have liked to a reasonable degree. It just leaves me wondering how it has such good reviews.

I saw some people complaining that they should be finishing the main game, before releasing DLC. I completely agree. There just needs to be more that you can do.",1684011300,1684011300,False,11,0,0.54180610179901123,0,True,False,False

Every survival game has that problem where after x amount of time, players gather enough resources to survive almost indefinitely. Most survival games solve this issue by giving the players a goal that will put them in danger (labs in Grounded or bosses in Don't Starve) or by coming up with new dangers to face (seasons in Don't Starve).

The Long Dark wants survival to be the only goal which makes it so, at some point, the player will have a huge stockpile of supplies and no reason to go out for in-game days on end (they can't carry them either since they are too heavy). This could be solved by making the wildlife interfere with survival or giving the player a reason to go out and here are the game's 2 biggest issues.

Wildlife is too sparse and their AI makes them trivial to deal with. Whenever a wolf or a bear appears, the player only needs to walk away to avoid them, maybe start a fire to scare them away, that's all it takes.

Story mode strips away all the mechanics that make survival mode work in the first place. Getting lost? Here is a complete map with quest markers. No weapons? Don't worry, we'll hand them to you. No food? Here is a huge stockpile just sitting there, you even have enough to give away enough for this old lady to survive the entire winter.

It's a shame, because story mode had every chance to be great but they just threw it all away for no good reason. The story itself is not good either and isn't finished after 6 years, despite paid DLC being released and the game not being in early access anymore.",1683988702,1683988702,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

They are lazy and incredibly slow for reasons that I can only guess at. When you point this out to them, they delete your comments and ban you. The steam forums are festering with a baying mob of sycophants that blindly cheer on Hinterland's every move for inexplicable reasons. Trying to point out the shortcomings of this game and Hinterland to these people will get you responses akin to a lobotomy in text form accompanied with the utmost snobbishness. 

You will see that I have a high play time as I started playing this game in 2016, that is only because I was expecting them to add more content and make the game more interesting eventually, something I was led to believe by their original road map and pre-release goals (most of which they just swept under the rug and gaslight you for even talking about, such as hostile human encounters in the sandbox). The paid DLC they have released so far consists of re-skinned items and a map that essentially has nothing to it whatsoever.

The real kicker is that for some reason, Hinterland WILL NOT allow mods for their game and will not even tolerate discussions of mods on their forums. I hope you're beginning to understand the kind of developers Hinterland are...

After 10 years of development there is basically nothing to do in this game's sandbox once you've reached a certain point other than keep shooting animals and merely surviving and gathering material so you can... keep surviving. There's no goal or substantial sense of progression to the sandbox. After all this time the game systems and graphics are extremely basic, you'd think this game is in early beta test NOT the culmination of 10 years work by what is now an entire team of people. One example of this game's lacking features are the clothes you are wearing not even show up on your arms, so you'll always be running around in -20 or lower temperatures without gloves on which is totally immersion breaking. ANY other competent developer would have addressed this BEFORE launch, But not Hinterland! 

When you start the game, you get a message that says ""Made by a studio without crunch"" This is merely an disguised excuse for how slow they are. There is a game being developed by 1 man called ""Road To Vostok"" that has already massively surpassed this game on a technical level before its release in every way in less than 2 years.

I put the lack of actual content/features down to the fact that Hinterland have decided to sink a large part of their effort into a story mode that is laughably bad; A story mode that has the writing level of an amateur teenage writer that violently slaps his penis on his keyboard to write the story. The time between each episodes release in unbelievable; Episode 5 wont even release until 2024! THIS GAME CAME OUT IN 2017!! 

I think this is because of the fact that they see that almost NOBODY even bothers to finish the story mode they have wasted so much time on. At the time of writing this, the entire player-base's completion for each episodes is:

Completion for EP.1: 22.8
Completion for EP.2: 10.4%
Completion for EP.3: 6.8%
Completion for EP.4: 3.8%

Regardless of what Hinterland's desperate sycophants say, The raw hard numbers do not lie.

Imagine a film where 96.2% of the audience walk out before the film finishes! Part 4 is the by far the best part and even it cannot compel people to stick around to the end. This game's all time peak player count was 14,500 on release day before rapidly declining to where it is now, yet somehow it has 88000 reviews? I don’t know who all these people are who have left positive reviews for this game given how poor the retention is for each episode and the fact that the average player count almost never gets above 2500. Even the original Forest and Subnautica have player counts that are 3-4 times that on most days. Really makes you wonder ""who"" is writing all these positive reviews...

Hinterland are some of the biggest piss takers I have ever seen in the gaming industry. I got banned from the forums for simply voicing my frustration after all this time waiting YEARS for this game to do something interesting and deliver on its original vision (that you can still go and see on Hinterlands Youtube channel). I've seen  many others on the forums get banned out of nowhere for dissenting against this game over time. This is due to the fact the devs spend more time on twitter and policing their forums than actually making the game. The lead dev in particular is a especially petty and disrespectful man as evidenced by his behaviour on twitter upon receiving criticism of him and his team's woefully inadequate conduct as developers.

Don't EVER buy this joke of a game or give Hinterland a penny of your money.",1679850586,1683892790,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

No matter how comfortable you get dwindling resources will continue to push you further and further out of your comfort zone. This is not a game where you simply survive. You will meet your end in the Long Dark. The magic is in what you did, where you went and how it came to be which will never be the same. You will weave your own story (and demise) with every decision you make and there is a strange, maddening addictive element to this circle.

READ THE LOAD SCREEN TIPS if your computer let's them stay up for more than a flash -- really important stuff in there. 

NO SPOILER GAME MECHANIC TIPS

- You can sleep in cars
- Your character automatically gathers snow to melt when you select to make water
- Aiming at a predator when you're near fire causes the predator to flee
- You can warm teas by setting them near the fire
- There's an option to harvest a big carcass into quarters instead of cuts (I didn't notice that for a while)
- Keep meat outside
- Putting ruined, unharvestable items into a container will despawn them -- great for garbage disposal
- You can pull 30-40%-spent torches out of a fire, extinguish them, and save them for later (as many as you can get; be careful as each one reduces the fire duration so you might under cook something). This so you don't have to gather the sticks, cloth, and oil to make full torches.
- You can chain torches by throwing a near-spent one and lighting the next torch with it. You can harvest spent torches.
- You can start a campfire in any weather if the spot is blocked from the wind (wind - shield icon)
- You'll never use more than one match to light a campfire if you first use the match to light a torch and then use the torh to start the campfire (you must select it in the campfire options screen)

- IF I THINK OF MORE TIPS I'll put them below:

Episode 1+2 came out in 2017, then EP 3 was delayed so they could redo 1+2 and 1+2 re-released in 2018 - then EP3 finally released nearly a year later. Episode 4 was another TWO years (pandemic...ok I guess) - now we're 18 months out from EP4 and nothing except a vague 2023 release for EP5

I understand limited resources and pandemic (though we're out of the latter) - but it's clear resources are being put into things other than story mode, and since I'm here for story mode....gotta give a thumbs down. Survival is fine, but Hinterland sold this game with different modes, and they appear to be neglecting one of them.

This is a love it or hate it game. Its one of the most abrasive games to play. But, if you can get into it, its a wonderfully immersive survival game. With a number of problems that may turn you off. It has a small cult following of loyal fans and it definitely won't be for everyone.

This game first launch in 2014. I never heard of it until I searched for game recommendations for survival games. I think that was in 2019 or 2020? I can't remember. That's a long time to go for a game to be so obscure and unheard of. This suggests it has limited niche appeal. After playing it, that does seem to be the case.

I think the best way to describe the game is to imagine you have boomer parents that constantly say things like, ""My way of the highway!"" or ""If you don't like it you can leave, there's the door!"" and other holier than thou boomer quotes. Then they got boring programmer jobs and hated it. Making games seems much more fun to make... lets do that instead! And they made 'The Long Dark'.

Because I can't think of a better way to describe it, there are boomer dev choices littered through out the game. Nonsensical anti-player decisions that are plainly stupid. Things like shifting development to a horrible 'story mode' and putting the games only strength on the back burner for 4 years. Allowing players to save whenever they want in the first episode of the story but disabling it for the 2nd episode which is awful in every way and simply a test of player patience. Level design to force players to abandon progress. Not implementing a solution to moving large amounts of weight at all for nearly 10 years. Limited variety (again after 10 years) and mechanics in the game. Disabling badge and feat progression in Custom Game mode. Abandoning the TLD subreddit because they couldn't moderate it themselves and censor all criticism. 

And the recent one, making Survival Mode DLC. 

But that's a good thing! I hear you saying. Yes. Its what they should have been doing instead of wasting time on the story mode. But, why are they doing it? Why are they staggering out in tiny parts for a year? To attempt to maintain game sales. This is their only game. They planned to move onto a new project after finishing the story and instead made Survival Mode DLC. I think this DLC is their make it or break it last ditch attempt to keep the studio going long enough to start a new project.

What should they have done instead to ensure steady game sales for decades to come? Officially embrace a modding community. The game is low res low poly. It begs to be played how players want to play it. But one thing or the other gets in the way. If you don't play the dev's difficulty settings, you can't progress feats. You are disallowed from progression in a video game. People have been pointing out for years how dumb this is and they (the devs) refuse to cave. My way or the highway. I know there are unofficial hacked mods for the game and the most downloaded one is a movement speed increasing mod (Sonic Mode go figure /s). Why isn't there official supported modding support? Why do you think? They want their game played how they want it to be their way. Don't like interiors being pitch black during the day? Too bad! They fail to realize it is the players that are playing TLD and they constantly get in the way of players having fun with the game. Too many anti-player decisions. Too much fear and worry that modders will 'ruin' the game by putting Tomas the Steam Engine or Randy Savage into the game. You know what that does? Gets people buying the game. 

You can't control saving even on the most easy setting. Considering you can invest 100-200+ hours into 1 survival mode run, having that deleted immediately is a very souring experience. That alone I'm sure turns off many players. In Rimworld, you can pick how the game saves. You control saves or the game does. Same for Mount and Blade. Keep the hardcore rogue like crap for Stalker and Interloper players but give the baby mode players the option to not have their time wasted. It shouldn't be that difficult. The system already exists for Story mode...

Oh, and the game is a glorified walking simulator with a special 'auto-walk' key literally. Huge maps. No way to travel quickly. Constantly contending with the meager and pathetic carry weight limitations (often your clothing takes up 90% of your carry weight). If its windy, you are slowed further.

All of these things are reasons this game never really took off in a big way despite being one of if not the top true survival game on Steam. Its like trying to play 7Days2Die and never using vehicles and hauling bear meat from 1 corner of the 15,000km to the other side 3 times. Its a lot of wasted player's time. Probably more than any game I've played (*cough* Valheim). Its like 'game problems' -> less players 'more poor choices' -> less players -> obvious disdain for players -> less players ->Glorified time wasting walking sim -> even less players.

Usually, you want players playing your game, not the opposite.


Anydarnways... there is no way to know you'll enjoy the game unless you try it yourself. If you're like me, you might find a temporary balance of frustration and enjoyment with the game and manage a few survival mode play through. I abandoned Story mode on chp 3 and will never touch that mode ever again. If I was anyone with authority at this company, the person responsible for WIntermute would have cleaned out their desk and be seeking alternative employment. Hopefully not in game development.

I realize this doesn't sound like a glowing endorsement lol. Try it and see. Then re-read the review and maybe you'll nod along to mostly every point. An artist is their worst critic and these developers are their biggest enemy.",1633309888,1683465809,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love this game but I definitely don't recommend it. Game production company HINTERLAND hasn't been able to complete the story mode since 2017.

I bought this game when it was Beta in 2018. When it first playing, Wintermute 1-2 was so fluid and beautiful that the hours passed so quickly.

I also played the Survival mode, but after playing for 10 hours, it feels boring because it gets repetitive.

THE COMPANY KNOWS VERY WELL ""IF WE COMPLETE THE STORY MODE, NO ONE WILL PLAY THIS GAME AGAIN"". 
If you can't complete the game in 8 years, please stop releasing DLC for political and money making purposes.

First the only survival modes available always included perma-death. I am not opposed to perma-death but I would like to be able to turn that on or off in survival. They do have a setting that does not include perma-death but it does not include any of the survival elements either. Additionally,  the map does not show you where your at. It uses a novel approach of requiring charcoal to create the map which is nice but it never shows you location. Unless you are at a unique landmark you will need to play that area multiple times before you get a sense of where you are, especially the areas that have a lot of mountains with multiple rope climbs.

Kinda the point - Until you get mauled by bear & freeze to death in open wilderness. Exciting stuff! In case you are not adherent vanilla purist, I recommend to play around with mods as well to spice things up & make it even more fun - Especially with gear decay modifiers. Turning global item decay down to minimum means you don't have to rush through 7 maps only to discover that all of the loot-able items on rest of the 9 maps are already ruined. In my opinion this is major weak point in this game. Logically thinking almost nothing spoils in extreme cold weather conditions anyways, especially food. Seems to be no problem for seasoned veterans but definitely makes quality of life better for beginners & to those who like to take things slower.

Ok for the pros, this game is simple, fun, and  challenging even on easier difficulties. I like that it is a very realistic survival game, there are no monsters or aliens or any of the common tropes in survival and horror games, you're just a man or woman vs wild. Only you're plopped into a massive open world space divided into various sections. I absolutely love that about this game. This is what I wish metro exodus and high on life had done. One world with multiple sections as opposed to many worlds that are all open worlds in their own right. I love the exploration and survival mechanics too and how you have to take things into account, that is realism done right instead of games like ready or not where 1 hit of damage will kill. 

Now for the cons, the graphics are abysmal some of the worst modern graphics I have ever seen. The graphics look like some mutated abomination of victoria 3, humankind, and telltale. While the mechanics are realistic, the textures make it look like you're in a toddler's painting also why is the player in creepy clown face makeup?

It started as just a survival game and now they've added a story mode free of charge as well as the yearly events they put out like the most recent Darkstalker, though personally I feel those end up lacking a bit of content with some events simply being to survive 20 days and collect something and eat them or, survive as long as possible between areas that have a 30 minute time limit.  I'd say it's worth 30 dollars with the amount of time you can get out of it but, it usually goes to 15 on sale.

Edit:  Still love this game all this time later.

That said, ADVICE - do some reading first on settings, modes, and game-play. Don't just pick it up and quick-start.

The variable chance with events and item spawns keeps the regions fresh and makes repeated runs feel like different experiences.  This game also has a grand satire feel to it, because:
-  I've frozen to death in sight of a cabin (safety/warmth)
- I moved my base and items to a seemingly safe place, only to get electrocuted after 2hrs of sorting suplies and settling in (""dam"" it seemed like a fine idea at the time...)
- I've ran across thin ice in time to avoid falling into the water, only to get mauled by a bear
- I've gotten stuck in a mine because the power went out
- Being loot crazy, I got stuck deep in a mine with no bedroll. Spoiler, I didn't have any torches, enough matches to get out or a flashlight...

Originally i was slightly saddened by the lack of multiplayer, but it didn't take me very long to see why they may have skipped it, you really do feel alone in this game and nothing feels missed not having multiplayer any longer, it is infact a plus. Not without its minor flaws, it is otherwise a perfect survival experience, and anything i would have to say about it which is not along those lines are confidentally overlookable as they are not game-breaking, and though the producer of this game has made some mistakes (Most noteable being the condition their latest DLC was released in causing a load of upset) The title text that comes up when you launch the game is indeed true: Evidentally they do care about their community, and this game, i see them in the forums all the time, they are patching out bugs and adding features the community want, and you can even email them with your recommendations and thoughts. I haven't tried this, but i like everything i see on that front.

A good game, and a good developer go hand in hand. The future of this game to me feels bright. The story is a stand-in tutorial at times but also riveting and is certainly not all the game has to offer. I am currently playing through survival and am loving it. If you like survival games, and a challenge, i fail to see what box this game won't tick for you.

Definitely worth full price. The best survival game imo. Story is alright it was like a tutorial in a way. But survival mode is the real deal. Try it out if you're into survival games.

With that out of the way let me continue if you're still reading. I'm gonna start by saying this game is VERY different than your average goofy looking other survival games where manage to craft yourself a whole arsenal of weapons seemingly out of thin air and you fight against savages or zombies.

This game is very poetic. The soundtracks and nature sounds are extremely immersive. You're alone. Completely alone. It's man vs nature. Sure there are wildlife you can encounter but your biggest enemy is the cold. The freezing, unforgiving cold. Especially at night. It's almost pitch black if there's no full moon. It fills you with dread and makes you uneasy. You do NOT want to be outside after dark.

But there's also a sense of peace and calm. It's relaxing. At the end of each night, a sense of accomplishment. Surviving one more night. Seeing the sun come up. If you let yourself really get immersed into it, this game will make you feel... well it's hard to describe. A sort of a zen state.

Item variety and crafting are pretty nice and balanced. Only weapons are revolver, rifle and bow. And I'm glad it is that way. We don't need bazookas. It's not a shooter game. Though it is a lot of fun to hunt game regardless. There's also a few unique item spawns which will help you a lot but beware, they're in harsh environments.

When it comes to realism this game has almost everything pretty accurate. At least it seems to me. I'm no survival expert but I can understand a grown man will definitely need 3000 calories daily to survive and keep his strenght up in this bitter cold environment. Biggest unrealistic part is that a single wolf charging at you. Wolves are usually scared of humans and will run away when they see one. But even devs know this and they even explain it in the first screen when you boot up the game. I guess they had to bend reality a bit to make the game more engaging. Perfectly understandable.

I'd recommend you start on pilgrim(easy) or voyageur(normal) mode to get the feeling of the game see if you like it, if so then you get yourself familiar with everything and if you play enough you will eventually memorize the map. It is a huge map though.

Map knowledge will be what keeps you alive in harder modes later when you want to step up your game. If you don't know your way around and jump straight in the hard mode you will get lost and since you won't know where the nearest shelter is, you're gonna fade into the long dark.

If those difficulties don't suit you and you wanna change something up, fear not because there's also custom mode where you get to choose, in detail, whatever you want in your playthrough. You can make the weather a bit more forgiving or 9th circle of hell. You can make loot abundant if you like hoarding supplies at your base camp, or make it really hard to get them. You can make the wolves completely passive or make them killing machines where they will most likely eat you alive at your first encounter. And so on, it's great. Only downside is the achievements and feats do not count in custom so keep that in mind.

Thanks for reading. I'd also like to recommend turning off your lights when you play. Makes it a lot more immersive. Enjoy!",1681455684,1681455684,True,106,1,0.892503976821899414,1,True,False,False

The Long Dark is, in an expression, one of the best survival games ever made.  That much is apparent, however, you should adjust your expectations prior to buying.  The Survival Mode is, and pretty much always was, a great experience.  The default difficulty settings leave much to be desired in some ways, as the hardest of the four is much harder than number three.  There's no ""smooth"" transition difficulty to prepare you for the next one, you just need to have good map knowledge, understanding of game play mechanics, and know how to set yourself up for success in order to survive.  Hinterland, from what I've seen, is a responsive and diligent developer.  They seem to be working quite hard on the game, and making sure to preserve the core experience of the game as they add things to complete their vision for it.  However, I will say the story mode (Wintermute) leaves much to be desired at the present moment.  I sometimes use the expression ""so much to see, yet, not much to find"".  (SPOILERS.  Duh)  One of the main characters of the story is quite poorly written, and is quite ""forgettable"", in a way.  If she wasn't introduced at all, I don't think anyone would bat an eye about it.  This would be somewhat permissible for side characters, in the grand scheme of things, but, for a main character, this is completely unacceptable.  No less, it's unclear why the main protagonist even picked her out in the first place.  Story elements dedicated to her, intended to show some character development, hardly do that.  Not revealing that much about her, nor do they give any attempt to humanize her or create something appealing for the audience to care about.  It takes a lot away from the story, really.  To the point that I could say it would be more interesting for her to of been an unknown character and had the MP speak about her little by little to reveal just enough about her to peek the interest of the audience.  No less, the story seems somewhat disjointed, having some general notes and story pieces to communicate A story, but, a quite shallow one.  Little detail is used in these notes, alongside no illustration of those notes (such as being able to view someone's handwriting, small other details on the note itself, etc.) in order to make the world feel more vivid.  Very little of the notes found contribute to the overarching story, or the players in it (especially in the endgame).  The Episodes rely a bit too much on simple fetch quests in order to drag out play time, which, can be a downside for some.  Overall, the difficulty isn't too harsh, since, it needs to be easy enough for the average player to have enough resources to travel and get to places to complete quests. 

That being said, Wintermute is a nice distraction, with some objectives to be accomplished at your own pace with some difficulty modifiers for each episode.  It just, is so lacking in story that it really makes me hope Hinterland blows it out of the water with their final set piece (of the free version, anyway) to Wintermute, Episode 5.

Challenges, at this present moment, are nice if that's what your into, however, they don't offer too much challenge once you've mastered survival mode.  One of them really is hard, comparatively speaking, the others are just a test of patience since they take longer to complete, and some are more mundane than others.  

The game world is large and beautiful, with plenty of variety of regions to explore and survive in.  You can set things are hard as you wish in Custom, which is a nice touch.  Interloper, the hardest preset difficulty, is quite rewarding to play since it requires you to plan ahead, have good map knowledge, and really work to set your character up for success as you survive.  Its a nice reward for those who have invested the time to get good enough at the game to do so.  

Survival is mostly based on your knowledge of the map and mechanics, knowing what you need to do in order to provide for your character's main needs, food, water, warmth, and rest.  Which, you have many means of accomplishing said goals, but, its up to you as to how well prepared your character will be for the long winter.  As summer never returns in The Long Dark.  Exploration is a plenty, especially on easier difficulties, so there's plenty to see.  There's a total of fifteen regions to explore, including some transition regions, and not including the DLC regions.  Weapons and tools in the game are geared towards specific tasks in the survival sandbox, and the only ""base building"" option is to build an improvised snow shelter.  

All in all, its worth the money to invest and play, especially as Hinterland adds new DLC to the game.  The DLC looks promising so far, and I like the direction the new creative director is going.  Survival mode is really where the game shines, the other parts have varying degrees of success and detail.  There's also a relatively large community on DC and Hinterland's own forum website for the game for you to check out as well.

Hinterland deserves credit for what they've achieved, job well done!",1681245634,1681245634,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- survival mechanics are good and even though there is a lot of menuing it feels engaging and fun
- atmospherics and weather is well done and blends well into gameplay
- Music and sounds are very good
- Cool art style
- Game is well optimized and can play on many different PCs

negative points
- Story mode is pretty boring due to its relentless fetch quests (which, given the great survival mechanics, should be fun but it just doesnt feel the same)
- Still story mode, the camera work and writing is really bad. Dialogues are filled with cliches and so many moments will make you roll your eyes.
- Overall storyline is not very interesting, filled with plot holes and doesn't keep yourself engaged sadly
- the snow. For a game that relies so heavily on this element there should have been some kind of displacement map type of snow mechanic where it would actually hamper your progression, cover tracks, prevent some buildings to be entered (like hatches etc)

ok points
- visually the game is hit and miss, sometimes the overall look of the game delivers fantastic moments (day and night cycle has a lot to do with it) but some parts feel really empty

You might play the game for 100 hours even though you don't touch the story mode. Completely worth the money

The game is a masterclass in survival, which is something I can truly appreciate as a Decepticon who has survived many battles against the Autobots. The game's bleak and unforgiving world, where you must brave the harsh elements and scavenge for resources, is reminiscent of our struggle to survive on Cybertron during the Great War. The feeling of desperation when you run low on food and water is similar to the feeling when we run low on energon, which is crucial for our existence.

[h2]Immersive and Atmospheric[/h2]
The Long Dark's immersive and atmospheric gameplay is truly remarkable. The graphics and sound design transport you to the frozen wilderness, where you must use your wits and skills to survive. The game's day and night cycle adds to the immersive experience, and the aurora borealis that lights up the sky is a beautiful sight to behold.

[h2]Challenging and Rewarding[/h2]
The game's challenging gameplay is what makes it truly rewarding. The game doesn't hold your hand, and it's up to you to figure out how to survive in the harsh environment. The sense of accomplishment when you finally start to thrive is similar to the feeling of victory when we defeat the Autobots in battle.

In conclusion, ""The Long Dark"" is a true masterpiece of survival gameplay. It's immersive, atmospheric, challenging, and rewarding. As a Decepticon who understands the importance of survival and resourcefulness, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good challenge.

I've been waiting for a full campaign/story since 2014 (!) and bought the game for that reason only. I've maybe tried the sandbox mode once in all these years - that kind of gameplay just doesn't interest me. Don't get me wrong, sandbox mode may be cool and everything, but for all people that bought the game for the story mode, this is a huge letdown.

And to top it all off, the devs now pumping resources into a f*cking paid DLC that [b]also[/b] has an episodic-like format, instead of finally finishing their actual product. How could this game even get an official release and leave Early Access anyway? Its de facto not feature complete yet.

Well, I can understand the reasoning behind this decision. After all, releasing a paid DLC for survival mode lets you farm more $$$, whereas the story mode probably brings in very little money. And so it sinks to the bottom of the priority list and remains there as this annoying little thing that you have to cobble together sooner or (in this case) later because you stupidly told people at some point that you'd do it. That doesn't make it any better, though. 

I mean, come on - this title sold more than 3,3 million times (sic!) as of 2019 and I bet we're at way over 4 million sold copies by now and you still didn't manage to finish the story mode with all this cash after more than 8 god damn years?

For me, the game has been the reason to be very careful with Early Access titles in the future and I think twice now about whether I buy an Early Access game or not.

Seriously, by the time the game is finished, I'll be a grandfather - if it ever gets finished.",1671850145,1680553971,False,22,1,0.542096257209777832,0,True,False,False

The campaign that they promised 10 years ago is still not delivered, and they have the gall to say ""made without crunch by a studio who respect their players""... nauseating self-righteousness that flies in the face of facts.

Add to that the greedy and ignorant initial reaction they had to GeForceNow, and those people have lost any respect I could have for them.

I've played up to Episode 4 and I'm waiting for 5 to be released. This review is based on playing on the casual mode, so if you play on harder modes, my review may not apply in terms of things like resources. Also this is just my opinion, so what I like/dislike might be different from what y'all like/dislike. 


I will say that, if you don't like walking simulators, then you won't like The Long Dark. There is a LOT of walking. 


**PROS (Wintermute)**
Mackenzie and Astrid are fairly good characters, despite being a little underdeveloped (so far). Astrid being voiced by Jennifer Hale was a bonus (""Hi, I'm Commander Shepard, and this is my favorite Timberwolf on the Citadel.""). There is one moment where you can sort of decide what kind of person Mackenzie can be *SPOILER* (whether or not you let the escaped convict Hobbs die) *END SPOILER* , but for the most part, it's a nice refreshing break from a lot of games that make male protagonists gruff and mean for no reason other than to show how Tough(tm) they are. 

The NPCs Methuselah and Molly were interesting aspects of the game. I love seeing those types of characters that add a sort of mystic element to a more realistic setting. 

The premise of the story is good. Using the aurora borealis (the Northern Lights) as a cataclysm for an apocalypse was really unique. Having them show up not only during key moments in the story, but also at random during regular gameplay was a nice touch, too. It made me want to pay more attention to my surroundings, even though nothing was going to happen to change the plot (also the animals kinda glow when they show up, that was cool).

**PROS (Survival)**
The different light sources you could use were varied enough that you always had some way of seeing in the dark. Obviously the storm lantern was choice lighting, since you could even get oil from catching and cooking fish, but building a fire could get you a torch no matter what, and since I ended each episode with about a jillion matches, I always had light.

Resources in general were pretty great. Being able to rest in cars if you accidentally left your sleeping bag behind was useful (seriously, remember to pick up your sleeping bag lol). You lost some food doing it, but you could still eat canned food without a can opener, so you weren't forced to leave valuable food behind due to lacking a tool.


**CONS (Wintermute)**
The main plot had a great premise but combined with the amount of walking and the more engaging ""to continue you must do this first"" quests, it feels like a small payoff. 

There were some definite bugs. During Astrid's episodes, I had to save and reload to get my cursor to show up (I don't mean in the very beginning, when you didn't have one). Sometimes you have to close the game and restart it to get cutscenes to start. Ending Episode 4 and getting the final cutscene to start required me to restart my laptop and start from the most recent checkpoint to get it to show up after nothing happened the first time. 

Crafting during the story mode is kind of hard to do, unless you can really stretch the time spent completely the episode. I'll cover more crafting cons below.

The side characters get just enough characterization to become really interesting... at the end of the episode. *SPOILER* It looks like Jace will be involved in the next Mackenzie-centric episode, at least. *END SPOILER*

**CONS (Survival)**
The crafting aspect is time-consuming. Curing hides and guts takes several in-game days in an indoors location, and getting the only 4 forges you can find up to the proper temperature is more than just lighting the fire (you have to light the fire, let it burn for 30 in-game minutes, then add 4 Coal to get it hotter). Only Desolation Point, Forlorn Muskeg, and Broken Railroad have one forge each (the DLC has one too, in the Forsaken Airfield).

The limited inventory space is a nightmare. And I know that this kind of thing can be an enjoyable challenge for some people, but its honestly just a huge pain IMHO. The only way to increase your inventory space is with the one tactical backpack in the Gold Mine in Ash Canyon or a moose hide satchel which can't be crafted in Wintermute for some reason, and requires a moose, one of the rarest animals in the game.

Project Zomboid with the Cryogenic winter mod certainly was a nice fit for the Long dark type survival i've been craving, and has a hell of a lot more playtime to it. Plus you know.. The developers actually update their game at a reasonable pace and try to keep their word. You know, as a developer should.) 

Now. Let me be clear that I believe this game has the potential to be something great. There is a certain charm, and appeal to its artstyle, music score, and more importantly setting that breeds a sort of interest in me that allowed me to put hundreds of hours into this game. I want this game to succeed desperately, but at the current moment I don't see a bright future in that regard. Atmosphere and style alone isn't enough to make a game. It's merely the start to constructing the game. Without anything to add onto said style and atmosphere, you'll eventually grow tired of it. 

I tend to believe I stand in this crowd as of now. This game has been in the works for 7 or so years. I got into it around the mid point with this game being one of the very few games I could actually run on my former skeleton of a rig. So it holds a special place in my heart, and it's why I sank so many hours into perfecting my strategy and waited with bated breath for more. But there in lies the problem. I waited. And waited. And waited a bit more. Years and years went by and work seemed slow at best, a snails pace at worst. In the game's current state, we stand with 3 chapters of the Wintermute story which in of themselves have.. Issues..

Wintermute is passable when it comes to trying to integrate a story into a survival game. I applaud that they were able to manage it frankly. But what's there now is a very linear, walking simulator with dialogue sprinkled in and the frequent meeting with Methusula the Meth head. I still to this day don't understand his position in the story. It just seems like he's there to be a mysterious, dialogue spouting, but vague character that seems out of place to a setting like this. It's never elaborated on why he knows so much or more importantly if he's even real to begin with. We only get few passing regards before we move on. I was, frankly optimistic around the revamp of Episode 1 and 2 that Hinterland would flesh out Methusula a bit, perhaps add hints to who he was or if he was at all real or a figment of our possibly damaged mind. No luck. Mixing this fact with the long walks from map to map, with very little emphasis on actual survival and prep.. You tend to find yourself just looking around at the sights and forgetting about any dialogue or story writing which after the first 10 times.. Gets stale. Fast. There is nothing that drives you forward to continue, that's if you wish to ride along the rollercoaster of twists and turns the story takes.. As if it was written by a headless chicken.

Survival mode falls to the same issues in some regard in losing it's interest around halfway through once you've established yourself. Despite playing through 'As the dead sleep' which is touted to be Interloper on speed, it always seemed to come down to the same loss of interest once you've established yourself. Once you've got a strong footing.. Found a weapon, tools to cut meat and enough sticks to light the entirety of Canada on fire.. We again return to the walking simulator. Maybe 1 or 2 predators along the way but usually you can go around them with a wide berth, or outright just shoot them dead with a well placed bow draw or crack of a rifle. There in lies the problem. The initial hump of the game is the only challenge that you have to overcome. Once you step beyond it, the rest of the game is a breeze. By that point, you just use it to grind out achievements or badges. There is no supplement anywhere or incentive to move around the world when supplies run low. Usually once you find a nice place to sleep in, that's your base, with only a few times when the arbitrary 'Cabin Fever' debuff comes in and you have to go sleep outside in that snow-hut you build for a day. Even with dwindling numbers of food sources you won't tend to find yourself coming close to death unless you really screw up somewhere. Which, if you know the game like the back of your hand.. It's far too easy to avoid it. 

Even something as simple as finding randomly generated notes to stashes or following the blood trail of a wounded survivor to his resting place. An end goal to escaping Great bear through means of flare gun signaling or using wood and metal to create a boat to float to mainland Canada.. Just anything. I don't care, add god damn air drops for all I care. But something. SOMETHING has to be there to make moving a more profitable venture, rather then a drain on resources. A mix of risk reward where, you'll be rewarded with bounties of more equipment but have to first make it to the locations of these stashes, drops, or loot crates through thick and thin. Because otherwise, the best lifestyle to live is not nomadic. It's sedentary. Staying in one safe spot, living off the land around you and spending 50% of the time in loading screens as you wait through 8 hours of nothing. And there is no fun in that.


Accounting for all this, this isn't where my gripes end. I direct this more towards Hinterland and their past practices and actions that have made me raise a brow to their thinking. Like many before me have stated, Hinterland has stood firm on many hills that, frankly aren't worth dying on. Modding for instance, is one where Hinterland should have seen the ability modders have to make a game grow in longevity. No such luck. There was of course the fiasco with GeForce Now when Hinterland ruled that they alone were the ones who could decide if you could use your computer or a Virtual machine, and that the consumer must first be bequeathed the blessing of 'GeForce Now Permission' from Hinterland. Where money could have been used on a game which has had a slow development, instead was used on other ventures that Hinterland as a company wanted to do. Not what the consumer wanted. The consumer of course, would want the money to go to finishing and developing the game. Leave the charity and donations to non-profits for AFTER your game is finished. Not during. It makes a company look bad. Mr. Ralph on twitter has been very brash to people who wish to criticize his game, even if it's attempting to be constructive and genuinely help the game grow. I know it sucks to be told you're wrong, but as a game developer you need to understand that by selling this game to people in early access you have to listen to your worst critics. Because usually, the worst critics are the ones who want the game to succeed. Including myself.

I genuinely will by all means give this game a shake if things change for the better but, in the current course it flows.. The Long Dark has remained unopened even after the addition of a new map. Because I know that I will only get about 20 minutes of exploring time to enjoy it, before we return to that same mediocre loop. Please, from a genuine rooting fan of the game.. Listen to your community. Try and push to develop and finish the game. People have waited 7 years expecting results and we have only gotten around the halfway mark to completion in those 7 years. 

Just give us more, because each year we crave to have more to this game and people's patience thins...We  crave to find more substance in this cold, quiet apocalypse... But lest, we never find it.",1614577677,1680389001,False,288,18,0.753707528114318848,41,True,False,False

At first I thought it had a pretty awesome premise, a survival game set against the darkness of the Northern Tundras in what is effectively a desolate wasteland. Eventually I realised I was just playing a really complicated walking simulator. 

I have to agree with earlier reviewer John Lambert who was with the US Marines, when he says that the survival mechanics are totally out of sync with reality. It takes forever to do certain tasks like breaking down wood pieces, yet anyone who has ever done a basic one week water fast knows that you won't die from hunger in a week unless you are already a stick on legs lol The lack of animations for basic tasks like boiling water, and the use of menus to indicate actions takes you out of the immersion pretty quickly and it really feels like you're just playing a game, instead of giving you an authentic feel of surviving in the tundra. Hinterland could really learn quite a bit about immersion from checking out most of the other games in the genre that have done a good job of not turning their games into a D&D style narrative with dice roll sound effects hahaha 

The developers made a lot of promises over the past two years, but after watching this game grow into what it is now (which is to say not very much), I have to say that you would probably get a better bang for your buck playing ""Green Hell"" or ""The Forest"". The graphics are better and there's a lot more going on with those games, with substantial updates and a more engaged community which is focused on making a better gameplay experience. 

Also, those devs do take pains to listen to their community and don't use gimmicky tactics like releasing #blacklivesmatter posts from time to time in order to get attention. It's funny because Hinterland are from Canada, yet they seem to be more interested in playing US politics than in improving their game so that it's on par with the better titles in the genre. A shame, since it was so promising at the beginning but failed to deliver on such an amazing premise.",1679916379,1679916379,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Finally, an apocalypse that is fairly realistic. I had lost hope in the survival genre before i found this game. its always cannibals or zombies or raiders, but The Long Dark is different. Nature is your only enemy. The threats are realistic and terrifying. starving slowly in a cave, trapped by a blizzard, bleeding out from a wolf attack, or falling through the ice one too many times, this game wont take it easy on you unless you play smart and plan. the story mode is yet to be completed as of this review, but the four episodes that are out relate a real human story with great voice acting and tangible suspense. the graphics are good, with the world looking like a watercolor painting and the 3d models being fairly realistic, if a bit blocky.
it is the closest thing to gaming perfection I have ever encountered.

But now the devs have just kinda... forked in another direction. they released DLC that isnt that good, and is very clearly just remixed content as a sort of cash grab. its of similar quality as base survival, but they've lost focus on the now 7 years and counting unfinished story mode to pop out 2 fast paced expansions with little news on when the original project will actually be finished, and it seems scummy to build so much suspense and then cash out on the fans who are waiting for SOMETHING to happen.

If its not sitting through the unskippable intro to each chapter, its the 10 minute unskippable cutscene that immediately follows. I would like to actually play the game rather than watch a movie, isn't that what I paid for? When I eventually do get to play, the extremely short sprint timer leaves you walking ever so slowly through a very boring barren land. I gave this game over 14 hours with hopes it would surely get better as I got used to the mechanics and pacing. Nope, 14 hours in and that's basically how long it takes to walk across the map. 

With all the survival games out now, this game does no favours to itself having bare minimum survival aspects between breaking your ankle from a gentle incline to freezing to death because there was a small twig in your path you could not jump over to get into shelter in time (you read that right, there is no jump button). 

The story aspect of this game was a second addition, I will admit. However if anything, it brings the game further down in it's already low score. If you want action packed, fast paced encounters with wild life look... anywhere else but here. The only thing fast is the time it takes for them to kill you.

The Long Dark is an immersive, and lonely survival game. You can nearly the feel the frosty air through your screen, or maybe that's just from the current weather many people are in. 

At times the game feels too harsh, fires run out too fast, food isn't filling enough, or maybe the blustery wind won't allow you to melt any snow. But I find it fun, and challenging.... but that's an aspect a lot of people don't like. I explained the plot and mechanics to a friend just earlier today and his reaction was ''doesn't sound like I game I would enjoy.'' naturally, I was a little pissed a first.... but now that I think about it, his reaction was completely fair. This game takes lots of patience (and good podcast to listen to), at times it feels like a walking simulator, others it feels too unforgiving.


Pros: A challenging survival sandbox, and storymode. Various mechanics such as hunting, fishing and exploring. Great voice actors, neat graphics.

Cons: Survival mode quickly gets repetitive. New players may get turned off by some aspects (because easy mode is never fun). Exploring feels impossible at times, since it's safer to hunker down in a shelter. No multiplayer :(

Overall, I'd recommend this game to someone looking for an immersive survival game. But would NOT recommend it to someone looking for an action-filled do or die type game. 

I'd say a solid 19 of my 30 hours in this game are from survival mode, I'm a bit stuck in the 2nd chapter so my opinions may change later on.",1679540014,1679540056,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you are or have been a wilderness camper or spent time in the northern boreal forests you will definitely appreciate this game and how realistic or close to reality it is, then add in a dose of mysticism, the unknown - doubt and paranoia sets in, as things are not as they seem. Game play at times seems almost leisurely, things tend to turn bad fast and there are some very difficult obstacles in your way to survive and continue with the Wintermute story line. The story line mode with Wintermute is what I am running first, survival mode could be a tad bit faster paced. It is an impressive game in it's own rights, there are few contenders to compete in this genre with a solo game - it's very unique. The Forest for me seems a bit similar, quite frankly I have liked this The Long Dark better then the Forest, though I can see others might see differently.

I loved long dark back in the days when there was no alternative. I had great hopes for this game and its future but more time passed, I started to lose hope.

Too many people come to play this as ultimate survival simulator this will meet expectations, but you'll find more action inside with animals acting unnaturally aggressive.

The campaign involves alot of walking especially during episode 3. You'll learn the things you need to carry, but more importantly you'll learn to drop many things.

 On many people's first play through they (Including myself) end up carrying every can of dog food they can get their hands on, and stay over encumbered through out their play through. This will extend half hour walking sessions to 4 hour walking sessions. PLEASE do not play this way!

Surprisingly there is a profanity censor in the options for the campaign that doesn't take away from the quality content in the slightest.

The movement in the game is slow paced. Stamina is about as realistic as it gets. You can't jump at all ever.

The only things you can build in this game is a snow cave and a camp fire. There is no build your Taj Mahal aspects of this game. Sorry survival fantasists.

You wont need the wiki on another screen to play this game, but it is useful if you want to get really good.

Overall: 10/10 for how cold it is, 9/10 for realism, 7/10 for fun, 9/10 for narrative, 10/10 for immersiveness, and 10/10 for music.  91/100 for the whole review. Get the game with wintermute and on sale for 20$ or below couldn't hurt either.",1679275452,1679275452,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am forced to download a 3 gig update for DLC that I have no intention of buying because nothing was ever finished enough to warrant a lasting/fun game. Initially the concept was fantastic and promises were enticing, but nothing ever materialized that amounted to anything.

Survival Mode - Stuck in areas where you have all the conveniences you need, but in order to make the challenge difficult you cannot utilize most things because of lack of content.

Dozens of homes in Canadian north, but I cannot find binoculars, I cannot get a rifle with a scope. I can only find hatchets and knives that degrade in under two weeks, I cannot find a single windup watch to let me keep track of time, I can kill animals to craft clothing,,,,but only very specific clothing, i.e. only a coat or a hat or a pair of gloves depending on the type of animal. I can't even have my character sit in a chair in front of a cozy fire at the end of the day. It wasn't worth adding to the game I guess. The uniqueness of the game and lack of any of the potential meaningful content caused the fun to wear off long ago.

The developers are now stuck with an unfinished game between a rock and a hard place. An unfinished survival game and an unfinished story game ( which was so bad I quit trying to even get into it )

I would have gladly purchased some meaningful DLC content, but a couple of animals and a couple of tools over 5 or 6 years doesn't cut it.

I'm giving it a down vote for what it is, but I will say it is probably worth playing if purchased on sale for awhile. Biggest difference is new players will never have the hope for what may come as I did.",1679120900,1679120900,False,15,1,0.565692007541656494,0,True,False,False

I have watched an equal number of hours of your YouTube videos of all you dealing with your abject failure as well.

I froze to death, starved to death, fell to my death, bleed to death and was eaten by wolves, bear and stomped to death by a moose. I had some funny times also, like when in a heavy fog I rappelled down a rope and landed on a bear (not even kidding) …

My problem is not the game itself, it is watching all of you raise your torch, and wiggle a stone and the wolves run away, my wolfs give me that look of disdain, and proceed to eat me, almost every time. I think you ‘all make it look a lot easier than it is.

It's also annoying how the player breaks his legs and arms by stepping off a very low rock that a baby could survive without an injury, basically the fall damage is really bad.

There are many problems with this game that I don't feel like mentioning since the devs are crunching to fix them the best they can and some may have already been fixed.

The only good things I liked was story mode (Wintermute) and DarkWalker challenge and that's pretty much it, that's the only fun I had and that was great stuff.

You break into cars pretending its not a crime so you can steal energy bars and you break into peoples log cabins so you can go inside and mess up the place. 

You die easily because you hate yourself and if you are a smart player you play on max difficulty so you are pretty much surrounded by wolves and bears everywhere.

[b]1st Advice - Wait for the complete game to be finished and read again recent reviews before you buy it. Might be on end of 2023 or 2024 or never[/b]

[b]2nd Advice - Go to YouTube, see constructive critical videos about the game and decide for yourself. 
There are many TLD fans in YT that try to hide or ignore the system failures, glitches, game problems, only show the positive of the game so be aware of that and look for both good and bad reviews so you know the good and the bad ;) Also read positive and negative reviews in Steam, even if flagged as out of topic  [/b]

[b]3rd and most important advise:- This is an old game with a 2014 game system environment/design/development. 
It was updated and improved many times over the years in extra objects, animals, plants, including extending the space, many maps, uses Unity, but still the same concept from 2014. 
There are many other survival games published after and in present 2023 that feel technically more advanced, are more realistic and flexible and way more modern.
Don't expect too much or you will be disappointed. 
The allure or attraction from ""The Long Dark""is that it feels like a rustic piece of art, a painting turned into a game but the mechanics of the game have not evolved that much. [/b]

This developer has broken many promises and dead-lines and because of the lack of consumer protection in Steam any developer can sell an unfinished product, charge you money and never deliver the final (promised) product. 
Communication between development team and the community has degraded over time, specialty when people ask when is episode 5 coming out, because there are people waiting to finish the game since 2014. 
I can tell you that this game made me think twice before supporting other developers that sell their game as an Early Access. 
And i learned that they can take it out of Early Access even if the game is not finished.
It is a risk you take but at least when indie games are on early access they are very cheap. 
This game is sold now 2023 at 29,99€ (Survival+Wintermute), or 19,50€ x 3 (Survival+Wintermute+new DLC) and Wintermute + new DLC are still incomplete.

Also, whenever you say something negative, critical feedback, about this game in the forums a wave of fans attack you and call you toxic or a cry baby. That is why this review has disabled comments.

[b] Pros: [/b]

- Good concept
- Unique
- Nice visuals 
- Good mechanic/graphics system (when they work and have few bugs) minus the animals
- Nice story on the 1st 2 episodes
- Many animals, resources, plenty of things to do and play for hours. 
- Weather changes making the survival feeling more real
-Several difficulty modes.
-You can go back to a previous update on the Steam game settings, in case an update made problems with your computer. 
-Wonderful music soundtrack. Mostly in Wintermute because of the story!!

[b] Cons:  [/b]

-Too expensive for an Indie game from 2014, specially for an incomplete game.
- Animals system/graphic look poor quality coding. They glitch, freeze, walk weird, could be done better but seams not worth the effort for the developer.
  Defending yourself from them or shooting them is difficult and unreal.
- Wintermute is incomplete 
- Wintermute 3rd and 4th episodes were not so good. (Not the same writer?)
- Many bugs, constant updates with some breaking the game for days/weeks. Some bugs took years to be resolved and others are still there. Their explanation is they are a small team.
- Wintermute had many bugs that would prevent you from going forward in the story but they promised with last update 2023 they were resolved. Still need to confirm if that is a real fact.
- You have no interaction with ""alive"" NPC (boots) because everyone is dead, frozen. 
- Even in the story Wintermute the characters do not interact with you as a boot. 
- You go from an interactive game system into a click and play game or video scene when you have to talk to some story character. But that is only in Wintermute. 


[b]A bit of its history/imp info[/b]

Game was Early Access in 2014 and left Early Access in 2017 before the game was complete. 
-It was a kick starter campaign with more then 9000 supporters plus monetary help from a Canadian government fund in 2013, before coming to Steam. 
-Many normal people from all over the world helped them with free subtitles translations in many languages- I still remember that.
-When it started it had horrible code, mechanics and it was practically empty but slowly it was improved, updated, enlarged, extended, more animals, more objects, more plants, more maps,    etc.
-Each episode took over 2 years each to be developed and published.
-Wintermute episode 5 is still to be published, announced for end of 2023 but no promises.
-They meanwhile published a paid DLC also unfinished to be complected during 2023 in phases. 

[b]Very weird thing - Only one spokesperson that i know of -Raphael van Lierop- He is the Hinterland Studio Inc Owner/CEO/Director/Designer/Writer/Developer/Publisher and we only hear his voice in all the announcement videos. Weird when you have a team of more then 30 people but only one person talks? For 10 years? It just feels he is The Firm and the rest are invisible non important pieces, unable to speak or have a name/face. Sad. [b]",1663185799,1679002597,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

(My first achievement was Nov 19th, 2015... wow... so long ago)   Played only a little and died quite a lot.  Back then, the game was unrelenting and harsh.  Death came easily.   My last time in the game showed as Feb 2018.  Probably just to check on some update or something.... it'd probably been a year or more before that when I last actually played.

I recently rage-quit Bethesda games after learning about an unpatched glitch that (unbeknownst to me) had affected all my game plays from day one.  If Todd Howard can't give us a game that isn't broken, I'll be surprised.  Went looking for something to fill the void and returned to this game.  Things have changed.  Quite a lot it would seem.

Only once had I explored beyond the dam, so I was well familiar with Mystery Lake and all it's areas.  Though I must admit, I seem to remember more doored fishing shacks.  Nevertheless, I started anew and wow.  It's become a much better experience.  I no longer run in terror when I see a wolf!!! The first day I sat down to play..... I go so engrossed by the game that 4 hours had passed before I thought to check the time.  Quite a challenging experience.

I've now survived 14 days.  That's a milestone for me.  I haven't crafted spit yet... haven't found a rifle to go deer hunting... haven't gone beyond stockpiling & Fishing.... but..... I have a good bit of supplies at the cabin and my preferred fishing shack.  I think I'm ready to push past Day 25.... at which point I will run out of matches and freeze to death.

If you find my frozen corpse among the snowdrifts around or outside of mystery lake.... (more than likely I'll freeze to death fishing in my favorite shack)....  please take note of the smile on my face.   I died happy.

Edit 3/14/2023: I decided to give The Long Dark another shot a few years later. I'm really enjoying it. They've added a lot of crafting and hunting mechanics that make survival way more enjoyable. You can craft different animal skin clothing to last longer in the cold. You can also make ammunition, but I haven't found the correct workbench yet. I've been enjoying exploring the different zones, and I think I've only scratched the surface. The Devs seem to be very active to this day. They are consistently updating the game. They've added a story campaign to play, if you want something with a clear ending rather than an open ended survival playthrough.

In my experience, there's never a quiet moment where you can really sit back and enjoy being in a good place, it's a constant challenge forcing you to adapt and think on your toes as you hunt for supplies, shelter, and safety. With that comes perhaps a bit of annoyance if you aren't prepared to be constantly stressed and tested. In which case i would recommend you build a custom difficulty, which is insanely in depth, to allow yourself some breathing room.

you will freeze, starve, be mauled by wolves, dehydrate, be mauled by bears, slip and break both your legs, be mauled by wolves, get food poisoning, and then likely get mauled by wolves again.

But when I really consider if I would recommend this to someone else, I can't help but come up with a ""No"", and this review reflects that.

[b]Firstly what i like about it:[/b]

Free form survival which involves short and long term decisions and planning, 
Vast world to explore and live in.
Atmospheric and immersive most of the time.
Visually beautiful
Fantastic music that also adds to to the atmosphere.
Sound design is very good except for a few gripes.

[b]TLDR Negative:[/b]

*Suffers from poor and obnoxious mechanics.
*UI is very basic, uncomfortable, and has never seen improvement
*General polish is also almost nonexistant
*Has a long history of bugs/issues and many of them still exist, plus new ones
*Released a DLC before fulfilling their story mode promise to backers and before fixing existing problems.

[b]For the negative I will start with what I feel is the weakest part - the mechanics:[/b]

  Ever since I started playing years ago I've always felt that TLD suffered from too simple or just plain bad mechanics. Much of surviving successfully comes down to learning a very particular and often nonsensical set of rules to deal with said mechanics. 

My typical interactions with wolves can be boiled down to just two things - bait to my shelter and shoot in face or drop torch then aim rock, and then do it again several more times after they run 20 feet then forget what happened like the goldfish that they are. Bears are just as simple - avoid them or make a campfire if you intend to kill. For moose you just go somewhere where they can't path to. Or you can cheese everything by using a car. There is no in between, there is no fluidity, you deal with things in the one or two ways that it is even possible to do or you will probably die. You do this habitually as you survive, for as long as you decide to. I think a good way to describe it is that it feels like wearing a strait jacket, and if you don't follow this strict methodology then you will be punished severely.

 Let your anxiety build as you make sure you reset your sprain grace period all the time or the instant it wears off a mild incline is going to instantly crack you with a very unnecessary, very inconvenient debuff which doesn't at all stop players from going where they are not supposed go; which is the only purpose I can conceive for it besides masochism.

  So many things are also just left to pure randomness which feels like a placeholder instead of having an actual system. For example fire starting is just low chance of success at low skill levels and then never fail again once it is leveled up, which is annoyingly slow to do and also causes a very nasty bug that will freeze your game if you start too many fires without entering a loading screen to reset it. (This bug has also been around for years.) Sewing is another system that is left up to pure RNG, and failure results in wasted time, damaged tools, and destroyed materials. There is no partial progress, it doesn't matter if you fail eight times in a row, you are at the mercy of a dice roll and once you have dealt with this sufficiently the system recedes to something that you no longer have to think about.

Other mechanical problems:

*Getting into a struggle or mauled because the predator couldn't 'see' your fire. This very finicky line of sight check is the only thing keeping you from potentially dying. Combine this will the player needing to put their fires in wind blocked spots to protect them from being blown out.

*I am convinced that the wind actively tries to blow your fire out. I've had the wind rotate and stop on the one small arc that my fire wasn't protected happen way too many times.

*Wounded animals can simply despawn if you go indoors to warm up; leaving your arrows on the ground somewhere. Wildlife in direct interaction with the player should NEVER despawn.

[b]User interface:[/b]

  The interface is simple and unrefined; some parts of it are acceptable but inconvenient and other parts of it are just bad. An example of the latter is the cooking menu if you don't have a cooking pot. You have to scroll left to right through every cookable item you have. It is simply easier to forego that menu altogether and drop the items on the ground through your main inventory, and drag the item onto the fire. The cooking pot menu doesn't organize anything by any sort of logic, I have to sort by weight for it to put raw meat at the top, and by condition if I'm making small cuts. Starting a fire will always put mag lens and firestrikers on top by default if you have them, and EVERY single fire you make you will have to manually scroll to your LIT torch instead. Some menus allows WASD to function like a D-pad for selection and others just don't for no reason. There is also a bug as old as the game is that locks into some kind of D-pad controller mode after you move full stacks of items, requiring you to close and reopen the inventory to regain mouse control.

[b]Bugs:[/b]

  I don't know if this is a bug, a huge oversight, or actually intended but if you shoot wildlife with an arrow, and a shift change or anything else that causes a despawn occurs before they bleed out then your arrow will drop on the ground where the animal in question instantly disappeared from existence. Needless to say, this is as bad as it sounds and has wasted untold hours of my time trying to find my lost arrow, and a kill that should be out there somewhere but doesn't actually exist. Simply put, wildlife that are bleeding out from player interaction should never simply disappear. One might think that the physical continuity of the world holds some importance in a game like this. Having to search all the way to the other side of the region for a kill is one thing, but having the player look for something that doesn't exist is just cruel.

  A few other bugs worth mentioning but skipping the detail:
*Scrolling through your clothes on the equipment screen randomly doesn't work
*Items on the ground like sticks giving dozens or even a hundred duplicates at a time
*Wildlife spawning stuck
*Tornado bears
*Looking at a buffer memory extinguishes your torch
*Various sound glitches where some things are deafening and other things are silenced
*Erroneous loot tables
Various inventory bugs
*Others that I forgot and more that I simply don't have room here to list

This is becoming too long so I'm going to wrap this up by mentioning how I feel about The Far Territory and another thing or two. I didn't watch the roadmap video, but I did read about it, and I accepted that I would get the advertised piece now and the rest later, which was fine and I decided to support Hinterland now. However I was under the impression that the piece I was getting now would be a functional part of the world but in reality it is not. It is very empty, unfinished feeling, and it is so far apart from the rest of the world that it doesn't mesh with normal gameplay at all. So I wasted my time to play and build up a character to take there, which is no small time investment, only to be disappointed by what I found. 

In conclusion I'll say that I think the community deserves better. Far territory was squeezed out at the end of the year and players like me were left with unpolished and unfinished content. It is now March 11 and the bugs that were introduced with the DLC in December still haven't been patched and it looks like the scheduled DLC releases are going to be slow as well.",1673983234,1678546473,False,18,0,0.584748506546020508,3,True,False,False

I can understand this game is a unique survival-themed game with well balanced with challenging survival mechanics. However the story is probably having the worst plot I have ever played across most games on PC.

Basically the progression of the story is too slow to a point that can start getting me infuriated. The game itself has several acts but the only main story is just as short as [spoiler]your ex-girlfriend is delivering a secret suitcase to some cold mountain area. However your plane crashed and she is taken by some rogue.[/spoiler] Instead of unfold and recovering information as the main character progress through the game, the plot became [spoiler]you have to fight a bear and... hm... did you already forgot your ex?[/spoiler] 

So in general, the story ceased to progress starting from the middle of act 1.

On the other hand, I can feel the fact that writer does not have a central plot because [spoiler] right now, whatever happens to the secret suitcase can be explained by a whatever reason at this point. This is due to lack of foreshadow that should be introduced by the game. [/spoiler]

Edit (December 2021, 2 months after Episode 4 came out): I would say better removing story mode would greatly improve the overall quality of the game. In Episode 4, once again the story does not proceed at all because a new character shows up and  [spoiler] technically, intentionally slowing the whole story down [/spoiler]. This chapter seems unrelated to the story line again [spoiler] unless Donnor is the person who spreads the plague, also who is Donnor anyway? He never shows up in the entire game?

I'll leave the goods and the bads here as a list and I'll begin with the good things:

THE GOOD:
- Story telling is pretty good. As of writing this review, the last episode isn't out yet, but I think it has potential to culminate into a beautiful ending.
- Gameplay wise, it has good mechanics. Hunting is good, love the fact that you have no crosshair and have to actually aim by mentally projecting the trajectory of your weapon, making it fun as you need to make every shot count. If you choose to play on a greater difficulty, you have even more things to worry about, but nothing you can't solve with things you find around you (won't spoil much of the content).
- Resource management is a cool mechanic, even though it might seem hard to find what you need at first, you'll eventually be a pro and be prepared for everything, so nothing to worry about there.
- Graphics and atmosphere are beautiful and I absolutely love the setting, the scary tone of night and the beauty of day.
- Except from a minor bug where your crosshair disappears in chapter 3 after leaving a shortcut and a bugged house in chapter 4 (both have a workaround), the game is pretty stable from my experience on WIN11.

THE BAD:
- Walking is slow, I mean REALLY SLOW. Even running isn't that much of an option as your stamina bar depletes so quickly. The equipment you wear can impact your stamina pool, which makes your running experience even less fun. Unless you don't mind the walking simulator, you'll find the game pretty frustrating.
- Clothes that you have EQUIPPED count towards your carrying capacity, which might be true in practice, but in theory the clothes are not packed into your backpack, and their weight is distributed along your body, making it easier to carry. It could at least occupy 50% when equipped instead of it taking it's full weight.
- There is one mission in one of the chapters where you have to [spoiler]carry a wounded person across the map[/spoiler] (walking is slow as it is), in harsh conditions, seeing absolutely nothing, can't use any weapons while [spoiler]carrying the person (the time it takes to place them down and grabbing a weapon is about 3-4 seconds)[/spoiler], enemies following you, and ruining the immersion overall. Not only that, you have to do it 3 more times, turning the game into a chore, and it personally ruins everything for me. If the devs actually found a different objective to replace that with, it would make it much more enjoyable, I don't think anyone wants to log into the game to walk across the whole map [spoiler]carrying people[/spoiler] and being defenseless until dropping the ""luggage"". If I was a bit more impatient, I would've just uninstalled the game. Honestly, it's too frustrating.

After all of these, you can't really listen to reviews, honestly try it and see if you like it, you have the refund option. you have enough time to determine if you really want to play or not.",1677944441,1678090648,True,14,0,0.650467157363891602,0,True,False,False

That's the problem and one that angers me because while the game is immersive and has the ability to draw you in and keep you playing hour after hour just to see what happens next, you can't.  Why?  Because it isn't  finished.  Why?  I don't know.  Its not like there hasn't been enough time.  I've been patient as i am am sure everyone else who bought the game has been.  Now there is a 20 dollar expansion that they seemed to have enough time to develop and push out while we are all sitting around congratulating them on what a fine job they did releasing an unfinished product while feeding us broken promises.  I work.  Day after day.  All week.  Weekends, holidays all through the pandemic.  I haven't taken a vacation in 7 years.  Back when I did take vacations they were working vacations, fielding phone calls and taking side trips.  I helped develop two communication protocols  in less time than its taken them to release 2 chapters.  Its not like they can't do any of this from the comfort of their own home like many of you did during the pandemic  with your jobs.  I last played this game in 2021.  It is now 2023 and there has been no progress on Wintermute., but we got a new expansion.  I love the game but I think the developers are lazy.  They lack direction, discipline and focus and with this last stunt, i think they are running low on funds.  Why else release an expansion to a game that isn't even capable of  being finished yet.  We get update after update and excuse after excuse.  It's like I bought a car that looks great on the outside just don't look under the hood.  I think they have a very creative minds.  I think they filled a gap in game playing that's been lacking in the industry where a good story isn't important anymore.  I love the music, the ambiance, and the edge of your seat struggle at times and the feeling you get when you just make it by the skin of your teeth.  All of this is wonderful but means nothing if there is no follow through.  It's a package of peanut butter cups that you open in anticipation and find out there is one missing.  You still have 3 but all you see is the one that's missing and the experience is ruined.  My advice at this point to them is quit messing around,  Finish the job you were paid to do before taking another one.  This wouldn't be an issue if they would have done what they said they would do, but they didn't and now they want us to throw 20 dollars on something else.

I next went to The Long Dark, and it scratches that survival itch so well! I would compare it to Stranded Deep in that it's approximating realism and gives that lonely feeling of desperation that is occasionally broken by moments of peace and simply admiring the desolate beauty around you. Clearly a lot of thought went into the making of The Long Dark. It really shows in how dangerous the world is, and yet if you're smart ... and lucky ... there is always a way to survive. I highly recommend this game to those who enjoy survival games without fantastical elements. The ""quiet apocalypse"" is a good way to put it.

EDIT: I wrote my original review at around 25 hours, and now I'm at 60 hours and I am loving it even more :) My only complaint with the game is this ... it has no procedural map mode, which is a shame because this game is practically designed for such a thing. I've barely explored Bear Island, and yet I know enough about it now to know some really good spots to go to when I have to. To me, survival games have two main drivers: survival itself, and exploration. While the design of Bear Island is amazing, and I am loving exploring it, that sense of exploration wears off the more you know about the place. Having an option when starting a new game to either go to Bear Island or to create a unique, procedurally designed map (perhaps based off the design principles of Bear Island and using some of its elements) would have made this game infinitely playable.

As I understand it, the designers of the game are focused on the story aspects. I think that's a shame as I am only interested in the survival game. However, I understand that a lot of people must like the story part of it and I get it that the designers have a vision for the game that doesn't completely include someone like me who just loves to explore and survive.

I feel bad even putting in this much of a complaint. This game is something like 9 years old and the developers are still expanding its content. That's amazing to me and goes to show just how loved this game is.

If the developers ever do make a procedural map DLC option, I would buy it instantly. I'll also buy any other DLC content they make as long as it adds some functionality to the game. It seems like even the story mode DLC adds new items to the game, so that makes the purchase worth it even if I don't play the story.",1676657723,1677793746,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. I've never been too interested in the campaign of this game and stuck with survival mode. As such, I only recently found out that episode 5 has yet to be released, despite the first episode releasing almost a decade ago. Its kinda, to put it lightly, silly that they'd prioritize a paid DLC expansion over completing their long overdue promise.

2. Said paid DLC expansion has been a buggy mess so far that retroactively made the entire game more unstable. Its NEVER a good idea to take a page out of Bethesda's book. Its worth noting though that I never bought the DLC and my game is still pretty normal, but I have noticed a few minor bugs that I never encountered before. However, a lot of people have reported a bug, causing them to lose their entire inventory after travelling from one vanilla region to another vanilla region, a game ruining bug that is near unacceptable, especially for it to be caused by paid DLC.

3. I noticed that shortly after the DLC's release, a pop up message appeared when launching the game that says, ""Made without crunch, by a studio that cares about its people.""
It feels suspicious to me that they would add this after getting a bunch of heated community feedback of bugs, glitches, and delayed content releases, like their trying to indirectly guilt trip us for voicing complaints. Consumers have the right to REASONABLY complain about stuff that they pay for, that's how capitalism and democracy is supposed to work.

Many game companies have tried these tactics in recent years, trying to use the pandemic, holidays, mental health, etc. as excuses for slow content rollout. Say it with me people...

No one (who is reasonable) is complaining that you're prioritizing the well being of your employees.

No one (who is reasonable) is complaining that you're taking your time to release fully functional, stable, well designed content.

Everyone who is reasonable is complaining that you promise things by a certain date, let that date come and go without saying a word, finally coming back to them with an excuse about employee morale or work balance when, in most cases, the companies are still treating their workers like shit behind the scenes, release content that is buggy or unfinished even after several delays and again point to those same excuses, attempting to guilt trip and gaslight us into thinking were the ones in the wrong for expecting quality in exchange for our hard earned money. 

This strategy has worked in the past, and it still does today, judging by the amount of recent simp reviews on the DLC's store page, but a lot of people have caught on to this for what it is; BS. From the shady way this studio added in this message after the backlash, I wouldn't be surprised if they did end up treating their devs like trash. 

That, however, is speculation. What I can say for certain though, is that they have played the age old game industry card of trying to blame their customers for their own mistakes. That's not to say that their actions are completely unforgivable, but as a studio you have one chance at complete trust and goodwill with your community and if you're an indie, you have a bigger chance than the big guys, but just because your indie doesn't make you a saint that can do no wrong.

 Hinterland, if you're reading this, know we're not your enemies, we still want to see you succeed, but if you want to salvage any good rep you have left, stop being passive-aggressive, let your frustrated fans vent, and hold true to the principles you (probably) still have.

I had this game for a long time, when it was still in early access. It has come a LONG WAY since the days where the game declared me dead from a sprained ankle after falling off a 4 ft ledge. (yeah, still salty about that)

The Long Dark OOZES atmosphere, it absolutely nails the feeling of a frozen, desolate, and hostile wilderness. It also does realism very well, as fatigue, hunger, thirst, and injury effects can affect different abilities and interact seamlessly. Items, especially small ones, can be easily missed if you're not looking carefully, so its rewarding to search every nook and cranny. Environments and interiors are insanely detailed and are capable of telling you stories about the previous inhabitants without any words.

However, a game with this much realism can lead to frustration. There will be times when you get stuck indoors because of a blizzard for multiple days. While it can be nice to simulate the coziness of observing the harsh weather from the safety of inside, it can be irritating if you want to explore or need to go out to look for food. Sometimes the game can turn into a monotonous cycle of searching for food or supplies. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, as it accurately captures the desperation of wilderness survival, but its something to keep in mind if that's not your thing.

Also, if you really like rabbits or have a soft spot for animals and could never imagine hurting one , do NOT buy this game.",1653525373,1677724636,False,0,0,0.626458585262298584,0,True,False,False

However, my IRL home is located near the region being depicted and the game gets 1/10 for realism for the following reasons:

- Everyone I know eats all-dressed chips, but the game forces you to eat ketchup chips instead. Every time my character is forced to down this inferior chip to avoid starving to death he dies a little inside. It's unrealistic that he isn't nauseous for the length of time it takes for the taste of chemical ketchup to leave his mouth.

- Balaclavas make people look like murderers. Unless you are trying to scare your friend by sneaking up to their living room window in the middle of the night and making creepy noises, they are to be avoided if at all possible. If they can't be avoided then they are paired with a scarf and goggles on the outside to turn you into a snow raider, rather than a serial killer.

- Speaking of goggles, there are none. Snow blindness is no joke, and it's actually very easy to make sun shades for your eyes, so this is a bit of a weird omission. 

- There is a teleporting bear after you but no teleporting raccoons. This does not reflect reality as raccoons WILL get into your tent/house/garbage/backpack/anything. Abandoned cabins should have squatting raccoons in them, food left outside should be stolen by raccoons. Bears and wolves don't want anything to do with humans and just want to be left alone, it's raccoons who have declared war on humanity.

- The entire island is hooked up to (non-functional) electricity and sewer like some kind of vacation resort. Sawdust outhouses are easier to build and maintain as they don't come with pipes that freeze. TVs have largely been replaced by laptops since there is limited power and you can solar-charge laptop batteries.

Want to show off your survival skills? 
Making fire during a storm? Hunting rabbits with small stones!
Just wandering around with a knife, magnifying glasses and a cooking pot 
while shouting death in the face ""You wont get me today!"".

[h1]Does it Run on linux / proton ? [/h1]
Yes, it does with out hesitation.

[h1] About the Story [/h1]
A very vell made survival, where every move you make counts.
Its cold, your alone..well there are wolves, storms, bears, the aurora
hunger, thirst..you get what i am saying. You are ALONE and need to 
accomplish a simple quest. Like, ""go there and get me something"".
Which in the end turns out to be, your death.
Because you did not think about how to approach wildlife.
Well now your freezing to death, game over.
Hope you learned from your mistakes!

[h1] Anything you should be aware of ? [/h1]
From time to time, there will be events. Which are really hard
but make a lot of fun and give, achievements and lot of replay value.

[h1] Level Design [/h1]
The open world lets you decide where you want to go next. That does not mean
you will reach there alive. Might get eaten, sick, starve or freeze to death.

[h1] Development [/h1]
The game is split into episodes. Currently only one episode is missing 
and i can not wait for it to be released. Even if i am still at the second of five.

[h1] When to buy ? [/h1]
If its on sale, you should add this to you list.

[h1] Gameplay Mechanics ? [/h1]
It will take some time to hit a rabbit with those small stones.
The overlay for your stats will be your best friend. 
Combining activites with the current time is crucial. 
Your cooking a tea, then better not run off to cut a tree for 30min,

They even went so far as to release a press topic something along the lines of how they no longer have income from that and expected that to be a valid excuse.  Not pleased paying a full package price 4 years ago and still not having my promised product.  Major fail.

Calling it a giant fetch quest would be an insult to fetch quests because at least you're allowed to do stuff while fetching in other games (also you're not playing our old character so goodbye perks and all your gear because rather than make an actually challenge the devs just want to gimp you). You have to trudge across this new map 4 TIMES carrying a survivor on your back, while you can't run, shoot, or do anything. Every time you pick up a survivor it spawns a pack of timber wolves because the game actively dislikes you. [b]PLEASE NOTE[/b]: Timber wolves are not the same as regular wolves in this game, timber wolves move in a pack of three and are functionally bulletproof and can only be chase away using a marine flare, which is different than a regular flare (which worked on old wolves) because it is coloured blue. After travelling the whole map at a snails pace for the fourth time (it feels like they're intentionally gimping you to run up the play time rather than giving you actual content to occupy you) the game has a lovely habit of [b]breaking the game so you cannot progress[/b] by registering those rescued survivors as missing because you didn't place them on the (unannounced) perfect spot (slightly ajar to the bed you won't even see half the time is not good enough). This issue has been reported for years and years but hasn't been fixed yet. Devs were too busy making DLC rather than fixing their game, or finish it.

Episode 3 is the worst of the game, and it crowns this accomplishment by ruining your game entirely making all the effort you put in to deal with their frustrating bullshit entirely pointless.

[b]DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH[/b]

[b]Original Review[/b]: This game is fine for 1 and 1/2 episodes. Halfway through dealing with Jeremiah the game goes hard south, the part where you have to activate radio towers (in the section of the map with the absurd number of wolves). The bear is borderline instant kill and has an OBNOXIOUSLY long animation for attacking you. This couples badly with the poor hit detection for the spear, the only weapon you can use against it. Half the time it doesn't connect, resulting you having to put up with a tedious animation which you can't pause and quit out of or skip. It gets even worse when the bear attacks you in a cutscene (AND DAMAGES YOUR GEAR WHILE FORCING YOU TO NOT BE ABLE TO FIGHT BACK) and then dumps you into it's cave right after. They've removed all your gear except clothing and force you to crouch or the bear will instakill you while you look for the spear. Why the bear brought the spear with him and not the rest of your gear I don't know. The bear aggro is INSANELY buggy during this segment, it often randomly turns directly at you when you try to move out of these safety little caves. Despite having frozen corpses everywhere, you can no long interact with them to get materials so it's a bait to fuck you over. You also cannot repair your clothing during this segment, and even if you get your spear down in time you'll lose stuff  to damage. They love gimping you during this part. The ONLY positive during this segment is that when they were disabling saving (you cannot quicksave, and if you fuck up and get instakilled you have to watch what feels like two minute long animation) they also, by accident I assume, disable temperature so you can remove your clothing to avoid it being damaged. After you kill it, you're not allowed to skin for some reason, and the game then progresses you for your 'friends' cabin but locks out of it after the cutscene so if you had any gear in there it's permanently lost.

It starts of slow but fine (the whole game is slow and emphasises you walking rather than running) up until this point. I don't know if the developers changed halfway through this but this is sub-highschool student levels of design. Jesus wept. It's so fucking annoying. Abysmal. I remember having this same issue when I played through it years and years ago. From what I recall of the next episode it's one giant fetch quest where you just have to build a stockpile. Recall expressing my frustration on the devs youtube account but they deleted the comment.

I can't recommend this. It gets way to frustrating, way too amateur too quickly. And this has been an issue for a long time. There doesn't seem to be a year that goes by without the devs going back and changing something to be less annoying, but it never really seems to be anything that impacts these ultra-awful parts. Mostly they periodically patch out fetch quest stuff. It so bad at the aforementioned section that it feels like the devs are actively wanting you to get frustrated with their game and quit on it.

The story mode is okay as well. There are ups and downs of every game but in my eyes this is the only thing that I have a problem with. At times the game can be very boring/slow, than it picks up progression. OR it can be unnecessarily hard and consistently frustrating. as you progress everything levels out for the most part.

The sounds in this game are PHENOMENAL!!! you get sucked into this trance like state where everything falls and your only focused on what is happening around you. The ruffling of the trees, the snow crunching under your feet, everything in your backpack clinking around, the wind that raises the hair on the back of your neck and gives you a slight chill even-though its summer. The piece comes to an end when you hear a howl, or something bigger...

This game is a true winter based survival game where the only option you have is to survive and explore. And it is perfectly executed (outside of story mode) exploration lovers and people that crave true survival games, this is the permission/excuse to spend the money.


- side note, 
I don't have many hours on this game on PC but I have well over thousands of hours on Xbox. To the people that crave exploration and/or survival games this is one you will absolutely adore. Trust me
I honestly wish I had more hours to back up my hype up for this game.

The game (and studio?) is/are not what they used to be. The sound, one of the most beautiful aspects of the game, has been breaking up since the last release, really ruining the experience. There are several longstanding issues that still are not addressed with the game. It appears communication, hotfixes, and PASSION from the studio for the game no longer exists.
***end of addendum***
Steam is telling me I've played 426.8 hrs of this game at the time of this review. As you might have guessed, I am very fond of the game. I've held off on writing a review because I just don't think I can do the game justice, but I'll try. 

So what do I love about the game to warrant such an embarrassing amount of hours in the game? I'll try to explain: 

[b]The graphics[/b]. They are beautiful and with the recent upgrade to Unity 5, the graphics became absolutely gorgeous. The beautiful snow-frosted branches of the trees swaying in the breeze; the stark mountains against a beautiful sometimes stormy, sometimes cloudy, and sometimes sunny skyline; The beautiful, but scary nighttime with the aurora borealis, moon, and stars smattering the sky; the bright green, glowing eyes of the wolves...er wait...more scary than beautiful those critters are. :)

[b]The sound[/b]. The voice actors are Mark Meer and Jennifer Hale at the time of this review. Veterans of the industry, with titles such as Mass Effect under their belts. The beautiful stinger music that signals a change in weather or time of day. The haunting, creepy music when you discover a corpse inside a house sometimes. The music is not overdone, perfectly placed, so you don't lose that feeling of abandonment. The sound effects, the creaking and groaning of the trees, the wind, footsteps crunching in the snow, the lonely hoot of an owl, the ringing in your ears when you shoot the rifle indoors, the skin-crawling sighing and muttering when in the ""creepier"" locations, the snarling, howling, and barking of the wolves. The sounds and music in the game are one of my most favorite aspects of the game and it's hard to list them all or describe the feelings of immersion you experience. You must experience them first-hand to truly ""get it"".

[b]The game mechanics[/b]. You have to be careful, you have to be smart, you have to be patient or you die. I love this, it's the player in full control, how long you survive is based on the decisions you make. Plan ahead, learn from past mistakes. Unlike most video games I don't mind dying in this game. I don't feel cheated because I learn what NOT to do or how I can do it better. The saying ""you make your own destiny"" seems applicable to the gameplay. It's a sandbox, there's no linear path you are forced to follow, you can immerse yourself fully and explore to your heart's content. There are three modes of play: easy, medium, difficult. A fit for everyone- from peaceful exploration to death around every corner.

[b]The developers[/b]. The developers have always been very involved in the community on Steam and also on their own Hinterland forum and Reddit. They are AAA title veterans who know what they are doing. The updates to the game are frequent and fun. Hotfixes practically same day. They have a zero tolerance for bugs in their game and it shows in this quality product. It's hard to believe it's an Early Access title. I haven't found a more polished one.

The best part? It's like a free gift everytime there is an update. More fun stuff to check out for free! Another ""best part""...the sandbox will remain available even when story mode is released for the people who enjoy it. I'm looking forward to the story mode, but I adore the sandbox survival.

TL/DR: Get this beautiful, quality game. It's Early Access with a twist - it feels like a complete game already!

I hope this review helps someone. If not, drop by the forums, you'll find a wonderful and helpful community.",1430030460,1676913601,True,260,10,0.943271338939666748,17,True,False,False

For me, the main appeal is the survivor open world. I don't even know what it is. It's a pretty basic survivor/crafting game. It could use with a lot more craftables or upgrades to objects too. It's just appealing somehow to trudge through the snow and try day after day to survive. There is something in that serene calmness. You struggle to survive, and sometimes take unfathomable risks.
It took an exceedingly long time for the developers to bring the game to where it is now though. There are certain bugs that persist, and new ones that crop up occasionally. Which ones depend on your GPU. I've played it on multiple different ones, from Nvidia, AMD, and integrated Intel. Runs alright, but the bugs can be annoying at times, to say the least.
The graphics while beautiful at times, were dated when it first came out, and haven't been updated much at all. Part of it is the style of the game, but I think they might just not have the staff to work on it. It's very obvious that they chose to use the same textures stretched over the rocks, and it looks pretty bad.
The balancing with the survival and time dilation also doesn't exactly feel right. You'll often find yourself struggling to get enough water to drink, food to eat, and carry enough, while moving between areas at times will feel like it takes an exceedingly large amount of your day. Part of the challenge of the game, but it still doesn't feel exactly right balance wise.
The map is also basically useless, as it doesn't center on where you are, so you can't figure out where anything is relative to where you are, unless you're on top of a marked spot. Yet another bug that's persisted for years and feels like they don't have the staff to fix.
The majority of the time, whether or not you survive will depend on what kind of luck you have, and how familiar you are with a map. This is even more apparent on interloper difficulty in survival mode. It took days for me to be able to survive even a day on interloper. Now it's easy, because I know the areas it drops me. If this game had procedurally generated maps, you'd have no chance.
As it is, you have to hope you're put down somewhere close to a good base that you know, or at least something that can tide you over until you can get to one.
It's a great game, but it's also not exactly been brought to where I think it could have been. It's clearly not been abandoned, they simply chose to focus a lot more on the story and the addition of a few items, rather than working on the underlying game. Not even enough items really either. The game doesn't feel polished after years, when it now has a Windows only DLC advertised in the main screen every time you play.
The items are seriously lacking. The only knives are hunting knife or a makeshift knife, which requires a forge to make. If you have a forge, how is it makeshift? How are there not kitchen knives or cutlery of some other type various places? Even if they had low durability it would at least tide you over until you can find a better knife.
There are also times where you're desperate for some better clothing, and you'll search a body and find nothing. Okay, so his skin is just colored like clothing?
It seems intentionally balanced to make it far more difficult than it should be.
The team seems either far too understaffed, or hasn't spent enough effort on certain tasks. Now they seem to be shifting to DLC for additional revenue, while certain parts of the game still feel lacking.
I would say that it's very worth buying...but it's also slightly disappointing to me that they didn't take it farther, and at this point, probably won't.",1616923343,1676650927,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is kind of messed up that they still havn't finished the story mode and now they have a paid DLC coming out. While I would like to see story mode resolved, I don't lose sleep over it. Any new content and especially the new survival modes will be nice.

I can not recommend this game enough for fans of the genre. The development team has been going strong for 9 years since the early access release! They might not have triple A financing or hundreds of staff but they have continued to update survival mode and are dedicated to finish WINTERMUTE. 

WINTERMUTE is a fun story mode version of the game that is a great place for new players to start and learn the games simple, yet highly complex survival mechanics. I definitely recommend new players to start here before jumping into survival mode. The mechanics between survival and WINTERMUTE are mostly identical as of right now, but with the new survival only DLC, this will change a lot going forward. 

They have recently released a massive survival mode DLC that will continue to get new content for 12 months, until this point survival updates have been free but mostly tied to the story updates and content. The fans have been wanting more survival content for years now but doing the story and survival with a small team was already difficult. This paid DLC will allow for dedicated survival updates that will be separate from WINTERMUTE. I am personally extremely happy to see this, as for the last 9 years, the time between survival updates has been rather long due to it being tied to the story mode. This should allow lots of survival updates at a much faster rate than before, as well as, new content that's exclusive to survival.

Survival Mode is where I've spent most of my time with the game and continue to come back, whenever a new region or update drops. Survival has customizable difficulty, as well as, several default difficulties for you to choose from. These range from relatively easy modes designed more for exploration, to extreme difficulties like interloper that will require a deep understanding of the games mechanics and locations to have any chance at surviving. 

This game does not have zombies or other sci-fi enemies, simply wildlife and the beautiful yet frozen Canadian wilderness. Your main enemy will be the cold, constantly gnawing away at your body as you try to find and craft warmer clothes to stave off the extreme temperatures. Building fires and using old derelict buildings as shelter will keep you alive, as temperatures drop rapidly at night. Weapons such as, guns, bows, and and even your tools can be used to deal with your next enemy, wildlife.

In the Canadian wilderness you'll come across rabbits, deer, and the more hostile bears, wolves, even moose. The wolves being your biggest problem as they will smell and track the scent of precious fresh meat you've harvested from hunting. Keeping your distance is always best but sometimes offense is your only solution. Using firearms you've scavenged or a craft-able bow and arrow, you can deal with them from a safe distance. Sometimes though, a wolf may end up on top of you, but luckily using a knife or one of several other tools, you can fight back and fend off the animal. This is dangerous however and may leave you injured or worse... If your lucky he might have just torn up your precious clothing, leaving you more exposed to the elements, or you'll be left with an infected, bleeding wound that could leave you dead if not properly treated. Some medical items can be found and others can be crafted using special items found in the wild. Often after a close encounter with a wolf, if a sharp tool is used such as a knife or hatchet, the wolf will run away bleeding and this blood trail can be tacked through the snow if you wish. 

Hunting isn't easy and an imperfect shot from a gun or bow will leave the target alive and bleeding, running in a panic. Tracking the blood through the snow will be the easiest way to find your prey but depending on your shot, they can run rather long distances before finally succumbing to their wounds. Meat becomes vital as your food supply dwindles and the animals valuable furs can be used to craft special warm clothing after the pelts are cured. Be warned however, as wolves can smell fresh meat and pelts, so as you carry your treasure to whichever building or cave you currently call home, the wolves might catch your scent... 

Those are a just a couple of the games mechanics and you will spend a lot of your time looting old buildings and abandoned town-sites for valuables. Most loot does not re-spawn so if you plan to survive for long periods, you must make every match count. Some things such as fallen tree branches, animals and some others do re-spawn after a period of time however.

Give the game a try! Be warned however, you just might get addicted and spend hundreds of hours in a single survival world just for it to come to an abrupt end... then you just might want to try again...",1675972265,1676313016,True,1,0,0.501716315746307373,0,True,False,False

2020 Edit: I have >700 hours in this game that I purchased back in ALPHA, and to be brushed off as a petulant whiner has deeply soured my perspective of Hinterland. They have lost all my business.

2023 Edit: Tales From the Far Territory is an insult to every alpha player that Hinterland ostracized and quieted over the last nine years. I wrote this review seven years ago, and I'm distraught that nothing has changed. Hinterland has taken our money and done what they want with it. They've decided their most content-critical investors are ignorant of their vision, instead of the disappointed and confused customers we are.

If you're here for survival mode review you won't find it, I played mostly with the story driven part of the game, Wintermute.

The story episodes for the most part stike a very good balance between plot and survival. The environment, with its hazards and views create a sense of urgency and tensness interrupted with moments of beuty and the few save havens you find.

- Awesome soundtrack and scenery
- There is  interesting lore, but you need to scout for it

- Wintermute Mode for those who love story

The chapters are a wonderful story of just two people caught up the chaos of the end. The survival mode can get your blood pumping or be a meditative journey depending on how you set it. The development team obviously loves their work, and listens to its community, and cares for its workers. I'm also thrilled that they decided to go with an art style instead of realism, as with advancing technology 'realism' gets janky fast, but if you choose an art style, that can stand the test of time because the graphics aren't trying to be something they are not anymore.

It's been over 6 years. This is one of the few games I have put so much time into I thought I'd come back to this. Awhile back when Hinterland sent out their questionnaire asking about purchasing a DLC in the future, I said no because I thought I was done at the time and would just wait for chapter 5 to finish out this game. But when it released I was curious enough to purchase it. It still has time to speak for itself and I haven't really had a solid opinion on its release since the content will still be coming. I do enjoy the game. I have been checking out the areas that came out with story mode and updates over the years that I never dived into, so I was checking out Ash Canyon, Blackrock, Bleak Inlet, Hushed River Valley, as well as revisiting Timberwolf Mountain and Pleasant Prairie. So I feel like I've been seeing a lot of new content in a way. The game is buggy though. I just had a BSOD and my game file corrupted or disappeared in Forsaken Airfield; I've also seen items floating, invisible corpses, and the old beard lichen is mechanically harder to harvest. I still have respect for this game, as it's a different survival vibe, but it can get a little tedious in game sometimes. It's a bit love/hate for me and I got tired of it here and there. But overall I still had a good time with this game. Not sure if I'd buy another DLC in the future though, I might eventually need to put this one to rest too and find something fresh.

2016 early access review:
Tbh I was looking for zombie survival games like Left For Dead 2 to play with friends. I was overwhelmed by the different genres while searching. I just started getting into Steam this summer and this is the first game I invested time into. So I saw this under the survival tags. Went to YouTube streamers just to make sure TLD seemed like my kind of game. Got hooked 5 mins in. Bought the early access. Living with no regrets at all! One usually wouldn't when stumbling upon greatness.

This is my second open world type game, but my first survival type, and non-zombie at that! I think 99% of the places I think I can walk over, I go to and I can actually walk over. It truly amazed me how open-world it is! I also like how there's just four main stats you have to maintain, but the complexity and flexibility of deciding how to maintain those are fun and a different experience each time. And the music is perfect! It comes on when I'm so zoned into the game I didn't even realize it wasn't there before... and then it just adds another creepy lonely awesome dimension to the game (props to the composer for setting the mood like a boss).

I really encourage playing on voyager mode, if not scavenger. You really get a good thrill of the game. I played voyager, then switched to pilgrim because I kept getting owned by wolves or blizzards cause I'm scavenging, then realized it was too easy for my taste. Pilgrim for the explorers only.

For one game is extremely atmospheric, you feel it. It also has great, memorable and unique map design. Each map has it story and require different approaches.
But this is where positives mostly end.
Game balance is outright bad and many features are complete absurd ""for balance sake""(like whetstone being only good for 20 uses, and most items in general being apparently made out of cardboard, considering how long they last, or cooking skill making player magically immune to food poisoning and intestinal parasites, two very serious conditions, after maxing it out), even tho it would not be hard to come up with far better solutions after just 10 minutes of thinking. Whole survival part for example is extremely limited, far more that could be considered reasonable. Despite game approaching 10 years mark.
However what pushes this review into negative are several secondary factors. To put it simply devs are poopooheads, that actively attack and demean users/gamers, delete/dismiss suggestions and ideas, and are very vocal about their political affiliations(and by that i mean they will not just let you know about them, but they will ban you for disagreeing, typical ""tolerant"" leftists).

Please fix the following:
- Like casting stones or guns mechanics. The stone hits far away from the crosshair, and it is impossible to hit your target with a flare gun either. Not even close. I had 5 flare bullets and tried to hunt a deer, none of the time I could aim it even close.
- The UI, switch guns, buttons is not very intuitive. It is absolutelly uncomfortable to not have a use button, so the shooting buttong and use button are the same, when I try to pick up a stone the player just cast it. And when you see a wolf, in real life you would've drew a gun in 2 seconds, but in game you have to go for this pie menu, instead of just using slots and scroll wheel to switch it.
- Another annoying thing is when you cant skip dialoges, and you must hear all the mumbling cuz the voice acting is something... I know you tried your best but it's just an overkill. It makes me wanna suffocate listening how gray mama speaks, i literally want to open all the windows in my room cuz I have a feeling that she'll die in another 10 seconds.
- Also you can't jump, and must go around simple barriers such as fences etc. I mean c'mon, if wolf is after you, human being is capable to jump on a roof.

Guys I tell you , if you polish the game, work on bugs, make it more smooth experience and more intuitive with a little bit more action, the game will be a sweet candy. For now, the game is purely for survival fans genre and seem kinda raw for me, just like this undone rabbit. It is too slow, it misses more action, more simplicity, the pleasing experience of fights with nature etc. Cuz afterall it's only a videogame and reality will never be reacreated in it let's admit it.",1675030776,1675031732,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only objective (in survival mode) is to stay alive as long as possible.  As to how you accomplish that, the choice is yours.  If you want a ""walking simulator"", and an overall relaxing experience, or if you are a new player, play on Pilgrim or Voyageur difficulty settings.  Stalker was never my cup of tea as I still hate wolves. :)  Interloper is a whole different experience.  Low amounts of wildlife, terrible weather which becomes progressively worse until day 50, and you have to manufacture some of your own tools.  I've never played wintermute, only survival.  I played on Voyageur difficulty initially to get my bearings and learn the mechanics, and now my longest run on Interloper is over 200 days.  Which could be longer but I always become bored and do something foolish. :)  
  
  This game is all about risk assessment, both short and long term. This is what a typical situation is like on Interloper and what your thought process might be (alot of text, I apologize). ""I found a hacksaw, and I know that this one area nearby has a chance of spawning a birch sapling so I can make arrow shafts.  I'll take a hit on condition, but I shouldn't be out so long as to get frostbite or hypothermia even with my minimal clothing, and by the time I'll be back in this area, the weather will most likely be worse, so I'm going for it.  Then, as it's curing, I'll make a quick run to stone a few rabbits to start curing their hides.  I'll need the additional warmth in a few days.  While those cure, I'll make a run to the forge.  I don't have much scrap metal due to finding the hacksaw after an area with alot of items to harvest for metal, but I can find enough along the way to make a couple knives, a hatchet, and at least 6 arrowheads.  I have a near 100% chance of finding enough coal for 2 forge firings, so I'll just make my essentials now and make another run later when I have better gear, a pile of scrap metal and more cattails in reserve.  Hopefully, I find a maple sapling on the way to the forge and I can make a bow, then I have it made.""  And all of these thoughts are going through your head with each decision you make.

Only tips I will give (no spoilers).  For interloper, there are 3 main things you HAVE to be proficient in, the ability to get to the important locations on a map even if you lose alot of your visibility in a blizzard, the possible spawn locations of important items so you can make tools, and the use of your bow.  There's no point in knowing the best places to go, exactly how to do it, and have all the tools, but not be able to use the bow well and a wolf kills you 20 hours in. On voyageur, practice practice practice!  All I will say with stoning rabbits, is even if your aim is terrible, it's very easy once you figure out a certain process.  And most importantly, NEVER GIVE UP!  You will achieve whatever goal you strive for in this game, you just need to have the determination to figure out how to do it.",1674959241,1674959241,True,1,0,0.485985755920410156,0,True,False,False

The vast majority of games one might play will fall neatly into some genre or sub-genre's box. Fortnite = battle royale, Mario = platformer, Civilization = 4x, etc. Some games will entirely defy such classification (I'm looking at you, Stanley Parable). Then, occasionally and memorably, some games absolutely define a genre and will act as a basis of comparison for all games that look and/or play anything like them from then on. The Long Dark is that to the survival genre.

While it might be true that survival games existed before TLD, this is the game that sets the bar for gameplay centered purely around surviving the elements. Furthermore, it seems to me that most ""survival"" games are actually combat games that incorporate survival aspects. There are no zombies to fight or other human factions from which you must defend yourself. Nature is what is trying to kill you in TLD, and make no mistake: she desperately wants you dead. There is some combat in the form of wildlife, but this is by no means the focus of the game. I've found myself much more interested in avoiding fighting the wolves unless absolutely necessary, or when I'm hunting them specifically. The real antagonist is the cold, and one wrong decision will let it overtake you, and then you find out what The Long Dark really means.

This game really stood out years ago when I put the bulk of my play time in to it, and the Hinterland team has done nothing but implement new content and improve existing elements during that time. This game has coalesced from an amazing and novel accomplishment into and absolute masterpiece. Not only challenging in the unforgiving nature of the game play, but also serenely beautiful at times and as rewarding an experience as any other game I've played; nothing has made me feel more like a rugged outdoorsman than narrowly surviving a wolf attack and nursing myself back to health from the threshold of death's door with limited resources while I couldn't travel due to injuries.

If I did have any gripe with the game, it's that I do wish I could tweak the difficulty settings a bit. While I like having the nature elements be nice and punishing, I wish I could tone down the animal behavior at the same time. While it makes sense to me that I'd need to keep my head on a swivel while carrying raw meat, it's a tiny bit immersion breaking that the wolves will come after you just by spotting you from a distance at any time. I'm hardly a ranger IRL but I know that's not how wolves behave. There does exist some minor explanation for this in the limited plot that there is in story mode, but this is mostly just me reaching for something to criticize about this otherwise nearly perfect game.

The verdict/TL;DR: Don't wait for a bundle. Don't wait for a sale. Buy it now at full price to support this highly deserving team and be ready to sink a lot of time into this game.",1674939252,1674939252,True,7,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Overall i liking the game though.  sadly very unforgiving.  my dislikes.  
no compass,
 map is unlocked very slowly.  
and sadly not all maps work the same way-ie north isnt always up.  so it gets extra confusing.  when there no player marker saying u are here, and on top of that u dont know which way north is etc. 
no save points.  u die game is deleted.  no revivie no reloading etc.....  hard for me to swallow.  i not into those play styles. 

but its so rewarding- fun to explore i so far been able to stil want to get back on

pros.  just nearly if not perfectly balanced.  
plenty of places to explore.  learn etc.  a lot of pros to give.  basically everything but the first few complaints


the story mode not so much.  even though its so well done.  i personaly like building base, seeing char progress etc.  at least so far in story i dont see any of that.  u just following quest guide markers and being pointed on bare basics of the game slowly.  so def recommend story mode to learn for first time players.

Game-breaking bugs. I bought the game when episode 2 had come out, played to the end and then forgot the game for years, until I remembered it and decided to play with again from the start. 

Nice game and all, dull as hell, but the story is interesting. The ""survival"" part is of course nonsense, at least I couldn't find it, unless it's the eating, sleeping and other normal everyday-chores.

SO..
..I can't even pass episode three 'cos the game is so bugged.  This particular bug is about rescuing three survivors, but the game won't accept the last one, so that's it. This bug has been a problem at least in 2019, and in 2023 the same problem still exists. Hinterland was so busy pumping out our money to BLM, that the devs are now busy pumping in more money with DLCs, without a care about the base-game being unfinished and unplayable.

before buying, wait ten years (maybe more) and then see if they've done their jobs. I'm going to forget this game again for at least half a decade. maybe a decade since the past FIVE years gave me just half an episode..

The difficulty settings can be customized down to every detail: calorie burn rate, freezing rate, how many wolves, how fast plants regrow, do you get woken up when freezing, how quickly does the world get colder, etc. It allows you to choose how challenging you want it to be, so you aren't stuck choosing between way too easy and way too hard, like some other games.

This game takes you from your cozy gaming chair, and tosses you into a snow bank with nothing more than some clothes you have on you, and maybe what was in your pockets. The wolves will try to eat you any chance they get, so please obey the signs and don't feed the wildlife; You will have to try not to get eaten at about all times. 

So, jokes aside, this game is fun, and will give you a lot to remember. You will find yourself quite often fumbling to get a fire going, or struggling to move against a headwind while being chased by a wolf or three. The game is rather balanced in its game modes; You can choose a preset gamemode, from exploring in the relative safety of pilgrim, to exploring the harsh and unforgiving wilderness in interloper. I am quite a fan of the custom gamemode settings, as some things just aren't up to my tastes; I can't get it to be a medium difficulty, while maintaining a high density of wildlife, high density of natural materials, and still getting mauled by a bear for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Overall, the game has a lot to offer, and has been worked on for quite awhile. I'd definitely suggest picking it up when a sale is going on, as its a lot better when its cheaper.

Pros:
*The world is incredibly detailed and very immersive.
*The actual story (Wintermute) is easily as good as any TV show. 
*The NPCs are all interesting in their own way and have great character/personality.
*The difficulty was spot on (for me).  I played it on ""Capable Survivor"" (the ""Standard"" difficulty), and I could get through it with minimal frustration with few exceptions and while I felt it was a touch easy to do what I needed to do, I'm not sure I could survive the harder mode and it's scarcer/harsher settings.
*The survival aspect felt good and tough; it's akin to early-game survival/shooting games like Fallout or 7 Days to Die, where every bullet counts and micro-managing supplies is important.  Unlike those games, it never gets to where you can just make everything and live easy.  You will always be counting every bullet, which I appreciate. Resources are (generally) finite.

Cons:
*The episodic nature of the story means you basically reset each episode to having nothing, so it's not really worth stockpiling/delving into the deeper systems (like making clothing).
*There really needs to be a way to make some kind of sled you can haul behind you to carry extra stuff, but not take  into buildings/delving in caves/etc.  Resource management is very well done, but sometimes you just need to haul stuff between bases.
*Some of the more ""gamey"" aspects of the each episode were a bit ""meh"" for me. These are more nitpicks.
---->*Some were useful and applicable to the non-story mode (Flares vs wolves; crafting  medicines etc).  
---->*Many were not (Certain pipe/electrical puzzles/why on earth a spear works better than a rifle vs a bear and why said spear is not available in survival mode)

Moving Forward:

I have high hopes for the upcoming Wintermute episode 5, and the other campaign in the works. I'll update this if/when I play them, but for now I am optimistic.

What I would like to see for the Non-story survival mode is, some kind of goal beyond ""survive"".  Ideally it would be very long/grindy to do, and even better if there were randomized objectives.

wintermute is even worse. some of the poorest crafted quests and story and level design I have ever encountered in gaming. the game tries to make environmental points without much sense, care or follow through (the eco terrorists vs loggers and power station plots are not only lacking clear motivation and depth but just arent interesting). The entire encounter with the bear is enraging (spear mechanics are bad, the times it attacks you are repetitive and predictable, and the final encounter in the cave is just a one-dimensional crawling fest without sensible stealth mechanics.

The game is also buggy (I had a side quest line i couldnt complete because entering a specific building caused the game to crash)

The game hosts patting-themselves-on-the-back and self-defensive disclaimers about how they dont have crunch times in production and that real world wolves arent like videogame wolves etc that give me the impression that the developers have ideological priorities that distract from producing a quality product and that they lack the talent to instead incorporate their politics into their game in ways that are provocative and entertaining.

It's one of the better early-access games. But the game took so long to finish, that the game mechanics are way outdated. Mechanics-wise the game feels like a 2012 game. But on the other hand it's pretty cheap with 20€.

It feels pretty clunky way too often. And for a survival-simulation it has some pretty illogical behavior especially when fighting the bear or interacting with other humans in the story campaign.

What to say... Well developed game. Very solid, very pretty, cool art style.
A very slow game. Trudging through the snow is tedious. The lack of ability to set up a permanent base because you constantly need to keep moving is annoying for my kind of play style. The animal AI is pretty cool, if not overly aggressive (in the real world, a pack of wolves would attack if they were starving or protecting their territory, not simply because you're there, for example).  Meaningful supplies tend to be few and far between. Sometimes the RNG just hates your face and you can't find basic tools like the hatchet, let alone a gun, and honestly that's just annoying because even the simple idea of exploration is a massive pain. Everything takes ridiculous amounts of time. Want to break down a few branches to get some sticks for a fire? Cool, there goes 1/2 a day (I'm exaggerating, but only a little). You can't really do anything at night (can't read/research, can't survey, it's too cold to explore) so there goes 1/2 of your game time. You get hungry and thirsty way too quickly and food replenishes your hunger at way too low of a rate. In short, this game is a huge PITA. To those who love this game, they would respond by saying ""that's the point, that's the charm of this game"" and that's fair. That's why this game just isn't for me; I prefer building and exploring, not constantly fighting a hunger meter or not being able to do anything because there's a storm outside or not being able to make it from point A to point B because it's three-arrows cold instead of two.

I gave this game a shot on two separate occasions, a big stint initially, and then reinstalled and tried it again for 6 hours or so just to remind myself why I left. It's a great game if you're into it. I'm not, this game just isn't for me, but I could see why it gets good reviews. I'm going to give it a positive recommendation because it is a cool concept, well developed, and the devs deserve the support for what they've built.",1674431574,1674431574,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would highly recommend this game, everything you do requires consideration, otherwise the you can end up in a  tricky situation.  The music and the amazing scenery itself make the game worth playing and I sometimes stop at a view point to take in the sunsets. Some maps are easier than others and its nice after exploring some harder maps to come back to a well stocked cache or abandoned property.

Note the other survival games on my list: I've put in a bit of time and I think that this game belongs in any survival gamer's library. I play mostly survival-type games and, for the now, I'm going to call this game the most immersive one that I've played lately. By immersion* I mean being drawn into a game world: your emotions and consciousness are ""there"" in the game, not real life. IMO the game does a fantastic job bringing you into its world and like any game, it's then a decision about how much you want to be there. It's definitely one of the most challenging games I've played. 

It's a beautiful game even though it's pretty gray scale a lot of time: peaceful and quiet...until you hear a wolf howl or you pop over a ridge to find a bear looking up at you. It's a nearly frozen world without any electricity or people (in the survival mode, story mode has peoples.) living or undead. So for many survival gamers, that means that you're not gonna be jumped and that weird noise is just that: a weird noise, not something sneaking up on you. It's a nice break for some of us, lol. 

It seems that every survival game has to have some enemy besides the elements be it zombies, cannibals, mutants, etc etc. In the Long Dark it's wolves, bears, timberwolves, and the dreaded moose that I know of. Encounters are serious in the early game: you're dependent on the RNG to provide a revolver or rifle and there aren't a lot of Points of Interest on any given map but you can use torches, flares, torching, and running like hell to deal w/ the very aggressive animals. Melee is *extremely* limited in that you can't initiate it and a wolf/bear/whathaveyou has to grapple w/ you. If you have a weapon in hand you can use it but you have lots of thick, well-repaired clothing and don't get grabbed in the first place. 

Some nights, a weird aurora borealis happens: the sky and horizons are beautiful and the power comes back! So if you're in a POI w/ lights they'll flash on and off - even stay steady, if you found a flashlight it will work (including against animals), and clues to what's going on will be on computer screens. Pretty crazy nights: they can beautiful and/or creepy...and you can read skill books or mend clothing by the light, lol. The animals turn green and I guess are more dangerous? I stayed inside, lol.

So it's beautiful, immersive, and a very challenging game. Time management is often driven by how much wood you have, how much light (daylight, stove, or lantern) and what the weather is doing. You might have plans to go exploring but naw, you can't do that in a blizzard or if a bear is patrolling your porch. There is crafting: mostly clothes and weapons including gunsmithing.  Clothes need mending and you wear two sets of jackets, shirts/sweaters, socks, pants, and hats. That's a lot of mending but, if you do, you'll survive and have more freedom to move around the map able to sleep in a car or cave w/o freezing to death. There's cooking and boiling of snow to do as well as planning your inventory for the next day. You have to keep it light but you also have to plan for being caught by weather sometimes. 

The community is fantastic: plenty of advice/tips/warnings out there and players have made fantastic maps. [Warning: at the time of this writing, Prepper Caches are currently disabled so don't go looking for 'em, lol] The devs are also friendly and accessible from what I've seen.

Downsides: It is solo only which of course can be a great thing - doing stuff on your own w/o your teammates/partner, all your own time and your own decisions. I do like to play with my friends though, and not just tell them about what I did but solo time in games is healthy imo. Nonetheless, in survival mode, you'll always be alone. You also can't build anything - not even a door or a crate nor can you move stuff like chairs or garbage around. It does add a new challenge. Food is limited to: fish, deer, rabbit, bear, and moose (I assume) as well as wolf. Even as a noob player I refuse to eat wolf because IRL parasites - you can't eat [adult] wolves safely. The foraged plants available are limited to medicinal except for cattails : you're not finding any left over root cellars, ferns, nettles, or roots/tubers in the ground. Canned/dry goods are limited but OK. Like so many survival games it seems like your character can eat a whole deer and half a dozen fish within easily inside of week but like I said, that's common.

As for meat, I'm really not into the early game experience (or later for some) of shooting a deer or whatever and waiting for it to bleed out. *shrug* Personal preferences. Also, ATM the best weapon for a loitering bear is my flare gun - dunno if it will kill it right away but the flare will stay in, tracking it, and I can listen for the bear's groans of pain and distress. Good times! Again, to each their own. =) Fishing is limited to ice fishing through a hole but I'm not complaining because the game *has* fishing at all.

The Point of Interests/structures that you explore and stay in aren't too pretty but very well done! That's part of the immersion, really drawing you into this world and making you wonder what *exactly* happened. On any given map you'll be hanging out in the same bases, game after game. There are twelve regions (so far) two of which are for noobs and if you're used to adventure/survival/etc games they're very small and the other regions ""escalate"" fairly sharply in difficulty: fewer structures, more dangerous creatures, etc. That is cool in that you know where to go, you can plan, and you're maybe hoping that the item spawns are better. I prefer games with randomized maps for replay-ability but note that this game not only is following a fascinating backstory...it HAS a backstory to begin with. I just prefer to be able to move around a larger map more freely and to see new things/combinations of things but that's me. Another ""just me"" thing is I don't always want to be cold - I do *not* get other gamers' fascination w/ living in frozen environments, lol. 

So, overall, I find the Long Dark to be a very immersive, very challenging, and pretty game. For me, it's a ""wife/buddies"" can't play right now, server down, or I just need to *focus* game but it's definitely a game that every survival player (as well as survival game DEVs!) should spend some good quality time in.

The story mode also comes with an annoying intro (some of it is experience twice!), the soundtrack by First Aid Kit is nice, but the cut-scenes are horribly long and during the plane ride i wish the protagonist just stuffers from a stroke and crash the plane so the TV episode stops i can play the damn game. Eventually it crash (Hurray), you crash and finally enter the damn game. Thinking back, it would have been better if they had died and the game had never been created.

I have sincerely tried to like the game, but can't since it is designed like crap and the dev studio caters to people who want a harder experience and totally don't give a crap about beginners. And why can't i save in Survival mode?

The character in the game is also a complete idiot who don't bring any useful kit with him before going into a flight during a WINTER STORM. 12 Matches? Seriously? You live in the damn wilderness and don't even have a firesteel? Eventually i got sick and tired of all the shortcommings in the game and walked my character off a cliff. 

If you are looking for a realistic survival game, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a survival game, buy Stranded Deep or This War of Mine instead. Avoid this piece of shit!

Some issues i noted:

- Moving/working should make you warm. You burn calories and generate heat. And drinking warm water should also warm you up. Regulating heat vs cold is a major problem during the winter, common knowledge for us northerners.

- It takes forever vs real life to melt water, 12 minutes to thaw snow and 18 minutes to boil... FFS. And why is there cooking slots, you put the water you want to much closer to the fire. As long as it doesn't topple over, it's fine.

- Top of the snow layer is mostly drinkable after melting it, it is never ""non-potable"". Especially out in the wild where pollution levels are low. Chances of catching parasites are low in snow (Giardia does not come with the snow, it lives in open waters).

- Also no option to take a little snow and eat it many times over the day, that does not cool you down in a significant way.

- So Matchboxes only have 12 matches in them... I see that shrikflation has visited the game.

- For custom games there is no way to copy the code from Share this experience, why not just push it to clipboard?

- This game seriously need modding support to get rid of lots of problems. The developers seem clueless about winter survival. And game design.

- You shouldn't have to ALT-Tab out of the game to learn how to play it, if you do the something has gone seriously wrong during the design phase.

- Where is the game map? Completely black when you start. Are you supposed to draw it with a crayon or find a map in a car or something? You should have a map of at least the close proximity to your character. You see trees and hills and shit and know where they are.

- Some starts are almost completely in the dark. Like how the fuck am i supposed to see any items or do anything in the game? One start was in a dark church and i couldn't see anything and had no kit. How is this any fun at all? 

- There is no way to turn off View/Headbobbing when you are running. The developers obviously forgot to take game design 101.

The survival mode however, is something truly special. Absolutely worth a buy if you are into survival games. First few hundred hours I spent in Voyeur (medium) difficulty. After getting a hang of the mechanics I found the resources and loot to be too plentiful and when I had explored every map there was little left to do (after 200 hundred hours mind you). Stalker (hard) difficulty almost scratched my itch for a challenge but the hostile wildlife at every turn clashed with the slow burn that makes this game enjoyable. The weapon mechanics are suited for occasional hunting and don't lend themselves well to a difficulty setting which has you fighting wolves all the time. Interloper (very hard) difficulty hits the spot almost perfectly, but I only wish the rifle was enabled (maybe only 1 rifle spawn total) in the base game.

In the survival-genre, I have not played any games like this and I am still only playing it as a casual. I know I will keep returning to and playing this game for as long as it is supported on modern computers.

Pros:
- Your character is alive and monologing. They are not just a silent slave to control. You are on a journey with yourself.
- The game is heavily randomized and customizable which means great replayability at different levels of difficulty.
- The world is large and rich with lore and beautiful locations to explore and it is still expanding if I am not entirely mistaken.
- Active developers with all the boons and joys that entails (and they are hiring).

Cons:
- One word has been mistakenly, but very understandably, translated wrong into my native language. 

This game is a gem and it is aging extremely well. The balance between the harshness of the world outside and your potentially cozy place by your fireplace is a real thing in this game and if you are not careful, that border will vanish.

The Long Dark is an amazing survival game. I don't think anyone can really doubt that, though the walking simulator aspect of it does get boring. But whatever, it's part of the mechanics (not exhausting yourself). If you're looking for a solid, challenging sandbox survival and exploration experience for hundreds of hours, you got it. I can't recommend the game enough for just the mechanics, gameplay, and sheer amount of sandbox content.

However, what I was really looking forwards to was the story experience, which has been developed over a long period of time. It's 4/5 episodes into Wintermute now, and it's not looking so great. Here's why (again, spoilers):

- You don't get properly introduced to the main villains, Mathis and his crew, until episode 4. And even when you do, you barely get to interact with them besides the cutscenes in between chapters. It felt like I was just thrown into the boat with Mathis and the prisoners to just hate them immediately and move on- you get long monologues about how bad Mathis and Donner is instead of seeing it for yourself. Show, don't tell! You don't even have the option to fight them using guns at the end of the episode, either, and nobody actually chases you at the ending- you just get a 'game over' screen whenever they break through a door.
- The impact of interacting with them fades anyways because you have to go on long, uneventful expeditions to do any mission objectives. You have to rest or deal with the weather along the way, slowing you down further.
- The wolves honestly aren't much of a threat considering how much loot you can gather (playing on the hardest difficulty, too) to easily scare them off. Pop a flare, bonk them on the head with it one at a time, and they run, or pull out a revolver and take Timberwolf packs down a shot at a time. It's very simple to deal with them. The most tense, difficult challenge in the open world I had, in all 4 episodes, was running into a bear... and I managed to take it down in three rifle shots.
- The puzzles/objectives for each mission IMO are fun and not crazy complicated, which I can appreciate. If it was more fun puzzles and some random world-building events when travelling on the way to each puzzle, that would be fine. Carrying and helping survivors in Episode 3 was cool too, and something I think should have been kept for Episode 4, honestly.
- I thought we were going to be able to make choices that help shape the story- like killing the Blackrock prisoner in the house in Ep. 1, having the guy by the fire judging us and commenting on what we chose- it was all great. Where is he and the choices we can make now? No one even mentions the Blackrock prisoner in Ep. 4!
- The Aurora only comes out in cutscenes or special segments- why? It'd be way more interesting to wake up in the middle of the night and not be able to sleep because of it. And the special segments that the Aurora does come out, I end up having to sleep through it or wait out the cold weather. The survival mechanics need to be separated from the story elements, or at least not negatively affect them.
- It feels like I know little about Mackenzie or Astrid's personalities. It'd be nice if they could comment more on stuff in the world- it happened in Ep. 4 with the bodies outside the prison, for example. And we need to learn more about their shared past, too! Let them talk more, even if it's silent dialogue.

I was really looking forwards to Wintermute ever since it was first announced, but it seems like it's not really going in a great direction. I respect the commitment Hinterland has to the game and the gameplay core of TLD is incredible. They're amazing developers and the sandbox copy is an instant buy. But man, I can't recommend the story mode/DLC at all since I think it fell short of what it could have been.

That is pretty much this game. They want to be a super realistic survival experience...... as long as you have the IQ of a Boxer. No, they are capable of making a bed to lay down on, should probably go with a beetle. You are presented with the most constraining rules about survival you will ever see. You are so tired you are literally dying..... So lay down right? WRONG! Gotta have a bed or car seat. Ok, so break some limbs off a tree and make a... NO! You are forbidden from hurting trees! You may only use already fallen branches PEASANT! You lack a knife.... So use your handy dandy hacksaw you found and cut a piece of scrap and then the handy dandy whetstone you have to... NO! You must make a long and extremely dangerous journey across the map in search of coal and a heavy hammer so you can scour the world for a premade forge to spend a day hammering on a already flat piece of scrap so you can wind a piece of cloth around it for a handle and come out with a shiv no prison inmate would be caught dead holding. If your playing at stalker or lower the game is stupidly easy. More food than you can carry. Ammo for days. Which you will then expend shooting every animal you see in the face. ( It's ok, animals don't feel pain like trees do..... You better NOT hurt a tree.... ) While interloper is beyond insanely hard until you get your tools made. It is possible after dozens of restarts to achieve. Bit of advice, have no unused weight capacity. Fill it with torches they are literally the only way to drive off the obviously rabies infected wolves and you better just go ahead and google where the stupid matches are, no role playing allowed here. You either use knowledge your character cannot possibly possess or you freeze to death in the day 1 blizzard that ALWAYS happens...God help you if a bear decides he likes your face as a skin suit. After that it becomes just like Stalker. Instead of bullets you shoot animals in the face with arrows. On peaceful it is quite enjoyable to map out the world, this grows old as soon as the maps filled in however. But, If you want a survival experience look elsewhere. There's like 4 kinds of trees, and 5 kinds of animals (Bears, wolves and timber wolves, Deer rabbits and a very rare moose) and the crafting system is laughably small. Only a few foragables to (Mushroom, a moss, rosehips, and birch bark) and anything a sensible person WOULD do in the situation given has been forbidden so you play the game EXACTLY like the tutorials say. You cannot even jump and insta death awaits you halfway down those cliffs you want to billy goat down to explore. BTW its strictly hard core rules, so when you find this out you get to totally restart or when you find the suddenly alive electrical wires in certain places. (I mean what did you expect from a game that encourages exploration.....). I was excited but this (at this point) seems like an alpha stage game. The whole stick is you will die because you are handcuffed in every possible way to make sure you go into the long dark eventually. When you start starving you will inevitably hunt some rabbits. best make it a dozen or so.... Because 3 rabbits will only fill your food meter by half at best.... When that evening rolls around you will be looking for another 3 rabbits because your food meter has already run out. The food drain in particular I find annoying. You can literally kill a MOOSE on Monday and be starving for food by Thursday. Tuesday and Wednesday were spent walking in circles picking up the 257 sticks individually you will be using to try and cook it. You want to talk immersion breaking. Cannot imagine what my poor toons arteries look like let alone his kidneys. If the Dev's would add a bit of complexity to the world ( You know...

I can start a fire with a rock, a piece of scrap metal and some sticks... and i'll burn your backpack and your plastic container to stay alive... wtf kind of shit are you pushing.

Look, don't write a survival game unless you know how to survive. I have spent 10 years homeless in several of the states in the United States of America, from my 23rd birthday until my 33rd birthday. I have slept behind dumpsters, avoiding police and being arrested for vagrancy. I have endured -45 degrees F with -90 degree wind chills with nothing more than a coat. I have provided my own food, sometimes grass, sometimes garbage, sometimes rock hard buns from the homeless shelters, sometimes eating snow for water.. 
I haven't found a single survival game to date that allows you to use your ingenuity to survive.. they all give you rocks and sticks.. but they don't let you use the rocks and sticks for anything productive. 
This game is as lame as any other survival game. they make you follow certain rules that would not apply if it wasn't a game. And it is completely obvious that their mommy raised them.
I'm glad i paid $5 for this game, i wouldn't have wasted $1 if I'd have known this.

What is wrong with you? 3 tries to start a fire with sticks and a flare? are you kidding me? wish i would have had a flare to start my fire in real life... it wouldn't have taken me 3 attempts.

2019 Review:
I think this game rates up with NEO Scavenger for being the best pure survival game out there. It makes a lot of deliberate game design decisions that put the player in a defensive frame-of-mind when it comes to animal encounters and combat. The game manages the tension the player feels quite well through the mid-game. As you progress into the late game, a lack of difficulty scaling kicks in and the game becomes overly easy.

From the Simple status bar management, to keeping track of how much gear you should carry, to even keeping track of the quality of the loot itself. Coming from someone who bought this early access back in 2014 for the low price of $10.00, I have to say this game was the first real risk I took in early gaming companies. The presentation of the game back then drew out the inner survivalist in me. All things considered, despite it being a ""walking simulator"" by nature, it really is the nature and the apocalyptic feel that really sold it for me. With the continuing expansions, the lengthy story mode, a plethora of challenges for those who seek more than just conquering nature, or sandbox mode for just a casual nature walk. This game can  certainly find warmth in anyone seeking an icy grip on survival.

Game is super relaxing, challenging, and enjoyable. I've played for upwards of 200 hours and still have at least 5 regions that I haven't explored at all, with more still that deserve a second or third trip to fully scrape clean of scrap metal and picked-over materials.

Most of the mapping features are awesome from a design perspective, but fall short in terms of practicality, that said, I appreciate the sentiment -- more games should have immersive options for UI elements we take for granted. Rock caches and charcoal are still cute and useful. More surprisingly, once I realized there's an in-game journal I found it super useful. I started recording what happened each day (which helps with returning to a longer playthrough), some ""helpful later"" stuff like where I stored things -- which totally changed my playstyle from my usual ""gotta horde everything"" to my far more reasonable current view of ""I probably don't need to horde this, but what's 5/10/15 more kg"" -- and then more stuff that really helps enjoy the sandbox (goals for each region etc).

Surviving 100 days wasn't difficult on voyageur difficulty, but I like the progression they added (little feats you can take in new playthroughs, but each needs to be unlocked first), and it was definitely the best way to learn the maps. My only gripes are like -- not enough flat spaces to organize my bottled water and teas, basically.

In a real life survival situation, you aren't sure if you'll make it and ""safe"" choices are few and far between.  Sometimes you might have to risk drinking that questionable water so that you don't die of thirst... or maybe getting sick from that water will be what kills you.  I think this is a feel that The Long Dark captures perfectly.

One of my favorite (in hindsight) moments in this game was being caught out in the forest at night in a blizzard.  It blew out my campfire, prevented me from relighting it, and blew out every match I tried to strike for a little bit of light.  I quickly made it to the road and got into an abandoned car, but quickly realized that it made little difference.  I had a choice to make: do I stay put and hope I don't freeze to death (which seemed unlikely) or risk the blizzard, wolves, and even worse cold for the slim chance of finding a trailer (in the pitch dark) that would have everything I needed to make it through the night.  I chose to make for the trailer with a single flare for light, sure I was going to die, but 20 minutes later, by some miracle, I ran into the side of the trailer.  With literally seconds left before I froze to death I made it inside and was able to survive the night.  The game is full of choices like that and it's one of the things I really like about it.

Color me gone from this company and its broken promises.""

Above is my revised ( again ) review . I revised my review to a thumbs up  after the long awaited Episode three finally dropped. I played it I enjoyed it so I changed to a yes vote despite the outrageous delays this company keeps excusing. Here is my vote history: Thumbs down - because of delays and excuses. Changed to a grudging yes after episode three finally arrived. Now once again ( 3+ years later ) Thumbs Down. They split the game into two sales ( Survival and Wintermute ) now when I commented on the Wintermute it says I don't own the game and have played 0 hours. The above review is from the ""Wintermute"" store page since they are now two separate games.

My original review is quoted below where I gave the game a ""No"" recommendation because while gameplay and story was excellent it was also incomplete, incomplete with a nearly two year wait between episode 2 and episode 3. Episode 3 finally dropped and once again story and gameplay are excellent. I've finished Episode 3 and I'm left wanting more which means the developer nailed it, just like they did with the previous two chapters. I'm revising my recommendation to a ""Yes"" in the hopes that it's not another two years before we see the next episode and the remaining episodes that complete the story. Two thumbs up (three if they finish the storyline before the coming apocalypse.)

Original review:

""The Long Dark is an awesome game with one MAJOR caveat - I along with many users bought the game for the story driven content and were promised continued development on the continuing episodes that ends with chapter 2. That was over two years ago. We keep hearing rumors about the elusive episode 3 but they continue to work on survival modes, etc. instead. Survivial mode and Challenge mode gets boring QUICKLY - it's just you with no storyline, no character interaction, just you shooting rabbits, wolves, etc. and crafting items - BORING. 

Until they show some real verifiable progress on Wintermute (Story Mode) I cannot recommend this game.""",1566233898,1673749011,False,0,0,0.649073600769042969,4,True,False,False

The Long Dark is intelligent, beautiful, ruthless, and humbling. It is intentional game design taken to a near extreme- very few things in the game world have a single purpose. All the fat has been trimmed, leaving little in the way of pointless fluff loot or redundant versions of items. For example; the spray paint could be used to guide you through maps as you explore, but it can also be used to label containers in large looting area or in your home base.

The game is harsh and WILL kill you. Map knowledge is the ultimate barrier to survival, over even the agitated wildlife and limited resources. You could be all of fifteen paces from warmth and shelter, in the middle of a blizzard, and freeze to death with no idea that shelter was right next to you as the blizzard reduces your visibility. 

You will constantly struggle to keep up with your own needs, straining through wolf attacks and blizzards, just for an Aurora to come through the next night and freeze you in your tracks with it's beauty. The aurora is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen in a video game, I do not understand how Hinterland captured  something so haunting and mystic. The lore, and ESPECIALLY the implications behind what the auroras mean, makes ""The Long Dark"" itself take on an entirely new meaning as a title. 

With the recent ""Tales From The Far Territroy"" DLC adding so much to the game, not the least of which being interesting item variants with impactful stat trade-offs (a lantern that burns %40 dimmer but burns %40 less fuel for example), The Long Dark only has more to offer. I cannot believe Hinterland has worked on and polished this game for EIGHT YEARS!

The Long Dark takes some getting into but once you do it's really satisfying. At first I was disappointed as this game was praised for being atmospheric, which it is, somewhat, but not amazingly. The graphics are nice. The music is ok. The environment sounds are really cool. The story is not amazing either but good enough to get you going. Like many things in this game, it gets better later. So if you're currently in Milton and not very impressed, keep going :)

Where TLD really shines is the survival part. Things you need to do to keep yourself alive are entertaining and satisfying. Foraging, scavenging, crafting - super nice! And the reason I recommend the game. If only drinking water was so fun in real life...

AFTER TALES FROM THE FAR TERRITORIES

Even before this latest DLC, I have already spent more than 2,000 hours being immersed in this harsh, unforgiving, and beautiful game. I was among the supporters who cried out for paid content and updates.

Unfortunately, when they did it, so far it's underwhelming.

Or maybe I expected all the other features when they weren't supposed to yet be rolled out in this first DLC, like the cougars and new plant life and recipes, etc. We got a new, humongous map in Forsaken Airfield which, frankly, feels like Forlorn Muskeg but bigger with fewer interesting stuff in between. We got the new aurora fog and insomnia which seems pointless since you can still sleep even with the affliction, just that you will randomly wake up sometimes.

I'm waiting for something that is a big step forward for the game and its mechanics and I expected it with their very first paid DLC. We're not there yet unfortunately, folks.",1619161875,1673404845,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have enjoyed this game more than any other survival games I have played, and honestly might be my favorite game overall. I love how realistic and punishing it is to survive in this game, like real life. The sound design is perfect, and the music is beautiful and haunting. The game has one of the most unique art styles of any game I've played. As someone who loves watercolour paintings, it really makes a game like this stand out so much more for me!

And I love that Hinterland has decided to go with a nothern winter environment, it makes me feel nostalgic, cause winter has always been ''the mysterious'' season of the year for me. The atmosphere in this game is on a whole nother level than any other game.

The Survival Mode is The Long Dark in it's purest form, and the core of the entire game itself. It is also The Long Dark at it's very best, and there isn't any other Survival game that feels so rewarding and devastating when something goes well and bad for you. Every update to this game has expanded and made it better and better since the time I joined in late 2016, you can tell that the developers have put so much time, love and care in to it, maybe a bit too much! To see how far the game has come since Early Access is truly a sight to behold! I can't wait to see what is going to be added and updated in the futrue of the game. The Challanges Mode is also a really great edition to the game, it mixes the Survival Mode with specific objectives for you to complete in order to win them, and it is pretty good if you want to give yourself a challange in various degrees of difficulty. 

The Story Mode has become a lot better after the redux update, but it still has some problems in terms how it trys to blend the survival gameplay into a story format, with quite a bit of restrictions and limitations. But the overall experience is nice, I think. It is a neat edition as a backstory to build up whats going on Great Bear Island in the Survival Mode. It is also a nice way to get into the game to get you ready and prepared for Survival Mode. I view the Story Mode as a tutorial so I think it is good in that regard, but I know that not everyone will view it the same way, and for some people the Story Mode might be a little underwhelming. I wish they had fine tuned the story a bit more and done some things a little differently, but it is a really good way start your journey into the quiet apocalypse. So I think it is worth playing it if you are interested.

All I can really say... give this game a try if you are looking for a more realistic and punishing Survival Game experience. It took me a little while before I really got into the game, beacuse I really, really sucked at it at the beggining. But when it all came to place I couldn't stop playing it, and fell so in love with it.

This is literally, and I mean literally, the worst mechanic of any game I've ever played.  I've been carrying a rifle and 40 bullets around for days in this game but I can't kill ""the bear"" with it.  I have to use the spear.  I followed your rules, went and got the spear, forged a new head, carried that stupid bastard around for days and days and days, finally confront the bear (not by my choice but by yours), set the spear, fought back, wound up with injuries and torn clothing but wounded the bear, had the bear run off then attack again, and again, and then it just disappeared.  Literally...disappeared.  The tracks lead out into the middle of a field then disappear.  Great, I think to myself, I have to fight it again sometime down the road.  Oh well, I'll heal up.  I do that then continue on my quest for transponder parts.  Sure enough, the bear attacks again at the next tower.  But this time, it makes me drop my spear for some reason even though I'm still following your rules.  And now for the 5th attack I've had to endure it's running circles around me because of bad AI programming and then it warps through objects and attacks me.  If I don't ""set"" my spear I have no chance.  I can't shoot the wounded bear from any range.  It takes no damage and immediately attacks.  I'm getting sprains so that I can't even hold my spear and the bear will chase me down if I try to heal up.  I can't kit it around objects because it warps around and through them.  The worst of it is no matter if I do things correctly or not I have to sit through animations that take forever.  I'm either watching myself die in lengthy animations or watching myself get mutilated knowing I have to fend off another immediate attack in lengthy animations.  This is far dumber than the end of the original MW2, which was dumb.  I'd be fine with it if you had to fend of one or two attacks then track the bear down and finish it off with a rifle shot to the dome, which I have to say, a rifle shot to the vitals would kill any bear in real life so I'm not sure why you didn't allow that to work in this game.  For a dev team that feels the need to post a message about wanton destruction of wildlife at the start of your video game you're sure dragging out the torture and eventual demise of a bear.  

NOW, to all the would be players, I'm talking to you.  The game is a good game.  There are some quirks that annoy me, like wildlife not behaving properly (in the real world it would be rare for a wolf to track you down and attack you but they all will, every time in this game).  But the mechanics are mostly solid.  It's meant to be a brutally hard game and for the most part that works.  It is just when the devs want to punish you for no reason that it gets old.  The game does a great job of incentivizing you to not take risks, but then forcing you to take some calculated ones, and giving you a huge sense of relief and reward when you get to a safe place where you can start a fire and cook some food and rest without fear of freezing to death.  You can easily find yourself in a position where you have to take large risks and those almost never pay off, but if you plan ahead and plan carefully the risks are more manageable and rewarding.  

I've only played a couple pure survival games and mechanically I think this one is the best.  I'm not sure I care for the story itself (Wintermute) but I like having end goals other than just seeing how long I can survive, so that's what I've been playing.  I find other games like Stranded Deep to be pretty fun but there is something about The Long Dark that just feels more real.  I think it may be the environment and the fact that the calorie, warmth, rest, and hydration mechanics are simple to understand and work through, and that instead of trying to build a lot of base upgrades your character is trying to move through an area to an end goal and you can't really stay in one place too long.  I do love base building, but for a pure survival game The Long Dark just works really well.

Except for the ""killer bear"" in Wintermute.  That is just the dumbest thing I've ever had to deal with in a game.",1673109297,1673109297,True,44,12,0.795432209968566895,2,True,False,False

My expectation
- I was looking for a dynamic and interactive game

Pro 
- Constantly developed crafting and harvesting system with some nice features (e.g. torches, bow)
- Some dynamic events (e.g. weather system, chance of starting a fire)

Con
- Lacking of dynamic ingame interaction animations
- No possibility to build or change bigger objects (e.g. walls, houses)
- Limited terraforming (e.g. only harvesting but no growing plants, no digging, no cutting trees or rocks or keeping animals)
- Limited dynamic events (e.g. you stumble and manage to balance and being rewarded)
- Static map (e.g. location of buildings, streets, rivers, bridges, cars, trees, or furniture are fix) 


In detail
I have been looking forward playing this game months before the release. Now 1 year later I'd like to post a review about my impressions. The record (11.1hrs) isn't really accurate due to my offline gaming. 

Why was I looking forward to playing this game? What did I expect?
I've been playing dozens of singleplayer first person games from different genres (roleplaying, hack-n-slay, survival, ego-shooters and so on) and the ones which mostly impressed me were dynamic and interactive. Examples are the possibility to destroy objects (e.g. Deus Ex, Battlefield 3+: walls or buildings), to harvest objects (e.g. Gothic 1+, Minecraft: plants, trees, rocks) to build / grow / keep objects or animals (e.g. Gothic 1+, Minecraft: weapons, tools, plants, buildings, sheep, chicken). Objects can be literally everything. In most games you are limited to objects like weapons, armors and tools and therefore you are limited to crafting. Very seldom it's possible to change bigger objects like buildings (e.g. a house, a shelter, a bridge) or parts of it (e.g. doors, walls, fences, windows, furniture) and terraforming the world (e.g. harvesting or planting trees or plants, harvesting rocks, digging tunnels, creating a lake). 

Current state of the game (August 23th 2015)
From my point of view the game is making big a progress in developing the crafting (e.g. crafting a torch or a bow) and harvesting system (e.g. harvesting furniture, sticks or plants and its requirements) which is a big plus. I hope they keep updating it and expand it (e.g. possibility to melt metal, bigger traps, shield, spear, binoculars and so on). 

Dynamic ingame interaction animation
One of the things I most miss are the visual effects / animations of the interaction with objects (e.g. seeing how a table is being destroyed while hit the table with every click). From my point of view The Long Dark is at the current state lacking of ingame interaction animations (e.g. fighting a wolf, harvesting wood, crafting clothes, opening a door and so on) and possibility to interact (e.g. open/close windows, doors, move furniture). Some people maybe do like this click and wait interaction but I personally prefer a more realistic and dynamic approach. Some games do have at least static animations for actions (e.g. a short and always the same video animation). However, from my point of view is this getting boring after some times. Other games are more creative and interactive, e.g. with every (inter)action you do you see a progress and that's very satisfying (e.g. in Stranded Deep you can click and chop a tree and after some time you get branches with different sizes. That's nice, but it could be even better, e.g. you see how the tree changes while hitting and seeing how it falls). 

Dynamic ingame interactions
Another thing I miss is the possibility to change more and especially bigger objects. After the release there was the idea of implementing bigger objects like a shelter. I really hoped it would be possible to create or change some objects like a shelter, a fence or bigger and more complex objects (e.g. close openings, isolate walls, build houses). To make this possible objects would need to be implemented like the forestry lookout (=same area). At the current state most of the buildings are in separate areas and therefore it won't be possible to change bigger objects (e.g. destroy or build a window, a roof, a door, a wall and so on) in future times. Unfortunately there are only limited possibilities to terraform the land (e.g. harvest plants and wood) and it's not possible to cut a tree, dig a hole or to plow the land and grow some plants or trees or to keep your own animals, feed them and either eat the pups or use their by-product (e.g. wool, milk). From my point these are some major things I expect from a survival game and a thing I would do first, if I was out there: Ensure survival on the long run, not just collecting all the food in the whole area.

Dynamic events
As mentioned above I was somehow looking for a dynamic game. I personally like games which have unpredictable events (e.g. in Diablo 1+, World of Warcraft, Dungeon Siege 1+: e.g. finding rare ore unique tools / weapons / armors with special abilities; Mount & Blade: e.g. someone attacks you and you dodge or you stumble and manage to balance or you don't and afterwards you are either being punished or rewarded, e.g. improved skills). So far there are some events in The Long Dark (e.g. the weather system, the chance of starting a fire, a randomly spawning wolf in Carter Hydro Dam: don't know if it stills exists) but not that many. The objects are often at the same place and the map stays the same (e.g. location and kind of the buildings, ways, rivers, mountains) and due to this it's quite static and gets predictable and at least for me somehow monotonously.

To sum up
From my point of view does The Long Dark have much potential and its development is another big step forward to a new kind of game. However, until then it’s still a long way to go.

Who would of thought years later after so many monumentous achievments in this art form we would play games such as this one that may not have the story laid out in front of us. Instead what we did or do is the story  and in that process it teaches up more than we thought we would have. Survival games are very common now and thankfully this game is a prime example of how some games will leave a  mark that will not be forgotten easliy. Simply put 20 years of playing different games of different genres and this one giving it a simple thumbs up is not enough this is a  great achievement  by the developers and i would reccommend giving it a try at least.

Edit A few years later...

How can you not finish the main campaign then ask people to dish out 20 bucks for dlc?
Unfinished game with unfinished promises. LIke so many other survival games. You fooled me once shame on my not again.  
If people want to know a game with devs that care that have taken awhile to complete their work well here is a few.

 1.Project Zombiod buy once no dlc and constant mods to keep you going.
 2.Subnactica game finished and did not charge anything else.
 3. Grounded havnt played but the game seems pretty solid and doesnt charge more than just 
 the game.

Now lets see what you guys have done. 
Charged for wintermute a unfinished mess of a story
Charged for Dlc
Charged for multiple soundtracks.

The game is one of my all time favorite survival games, i have an insane amount of hours on this on the xbox but recently got it for steam too due to getting a pc. there is a lot of hours to enjoy in the long dark if you are new to it, as theres a lot to learn and a lot to explore, its quiet apocaliptic feel is relaxing to play whilst at the same time always keeping you busy as when your not fighting off the cold or starvation or injurys, your looking at stocking up on supplys for when you are.

The game for me is very beautiful and feels great to explore and get lost in, and the difficulty modes are impactful enough to make you change how you play when bumping them up if things get too easy.

If you want to challenge your survival abilities, go definitely for it.

I was intrigued by it because I had always loved the idea of open-world wilderness games, and the art style that was presented from The Long Dark was enough to make me take a chance on it without having ever seen gameplay footage of it or reading any reviews. 

Now, with over 150 hours logged on Steam alone, I can say that The Long Dark is everything I had hoped it would be, and is the definitive game in the survival genre. No other game I have played has gotten me as close to feeling that I was actually experiencing what my character was going through as The Long Dark. Since you can put so much time and effort into a single survival run which ends and is deleted after you die, when you arrive at a point where your condition bar is nearly empty, you have no supplies, and you are stuck outside in a blizzard in the middle of the night, you begin to feel anxious, frightened, and panicked... As you presumably would in a real survival situation. The Long Dark is very good at evoking these feelings of dread, isolation, and aimlessness, where the point of your survival becomes what you make of it, and how much effort you are willing to put into pressing on.  

The Long Dark is not only the best survival game, but one of the best games I have played in general. The people at Hinterland studios are part of a somewhat increasingly rare breed, a team that is wholly dedicated to the content that they produce and the promises that they keep to their community. Years ago, they announced an episodic story mode alongside survival mode in which they stated that five episodes of story content would be made free to any who purchase the game. Through the years they have reaffirmed that, and even though they have introduced payed content recently, have never backtracked on their initial promises, delivering four masterfully-constructed chapters of story with a fifth in the works. The amazing and awe-inducing content that the people at Hinterland have made available to this point gave me no qualms about purchasing paid content and supporting a studio which, during a time where publishers like Activision, Electronic Arts, and Ubisoft are plainly and unapologetically lazy and greedy with the content they produce, continues to support their community to the fullest extent and attempts to live up to their expectations in every way. 

No matter what kind of gamer you are, The Long Dark is a game that belongs in your library. Support real creativity and real passion in gaming, and it will do the same for you.",1672873306,1672873306,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is a game I've grown to like over the years, it has matured into a fairly solid survival game with an expansive world and simple, solid mechanics.

Between the story mode, the challenges, and the 4 main survival difficulty levels, you get a pretty wide variety of experience and a good amount of replayability.

The survival mechanics are straightforward: stay warm, rest well, hydrate, and feed yourself.
Be a nomad, or maybe settle down. Scavenge, or try to live off from what nature provide.

The story mode is fairly nice, the experience is relatively ""easy"" and geared towards telling its story rather than pitting you against impossible odds, and can serve as a long form tutorial for those that need it. But the story and goal-oriented gameplay is a good way to explore the game too.

So yeah, recommended.

I feel it should be rolled back - players don't want being fucked with when they're in the midst of finding locales of shelter from wildlife, the cold, starvation, etc, this also fails to portray a realistic reaction to any condition in-game, it's as if they thought, fuck it, they need vertigo while they're dying.  It's a negative QOL issue that someone at Hinterland thought was a good visual/mechanical addition, that's it.  Adding:(SPOILERS) just getting through the part where you carry the chick from the crash, wtf is with Feral wolf packs? Look, the concept is good, but if you scare one away using the 'special' flares without throwing it, I think that should constitute as a demoralizer, instead of constantly having to unhand one of your only pack-breaking items by throwing it at them.  Also, wolf packs every fuckin 25 feet of the way while you're labouring to carry a wounded bitch through the wilds, while you're freezing, fatigued, wounded, thirsty, hungry, this sounds exactly like the game my masochistic, egocentric, middle aged human condition is interested in, but lo, your (other) pack size will obviously not allow you to carry the some 35kg of fabric you broke down seemingly 1:2 from said crash victims' plane luggage, and this reminds me of all the meat, hides, and offal I had curing in my first play thru when they launched storymode, all left behind after a cut scene, not friendly!... I get it but it's not well executed, you want me to decide what to leave behind, okay, okay..... Some of this is forgivable EA stuff or even acceptable blunders on the behalf of a dev team - but like - I just came here to play survival after 360hrs... The finished product has me invested in story mode if only to get through it, and for that it seems to be a painful slog where you're always inundated, hitting pack wolves in the face with regular flares to no avail, traveling insane distances with wounded on your back while dealing with insanely frequent wolf pack encounters after you've scared the first (or the same!) pack off over and over, and basically just, not getting on.  Consequently, If I happen to start a new survival run and - unfortunate and down to my luck - die as a result of being flung 8ft backwards from the door I am attempting to enter whereby shelter and recovery may be had, you're liable hear a resounding Alt F4 somewhere in central Canada where -40c is common and I have braved these temps on foot at times, traversing 15km/week for several years on average.  The Long Dark still gets a thumbs up because of its survival elements that forged its existence and unique presence in the survival genre through EA, but the story-dev kinda hurts me in places it shouldn't... the bear for example.  Animations look entirely abandoned in a 1.0 release.  Otherwise my gripes are newly implemented mechanics that don't really sit well.

I got the game way back and played an hour here and there in wait for the story to get more chapters. With the 5th coming out this year i will likely play the story but as for the game without this story mode.

I adore the art style and enjoy the mid level difficulties where the wild life see you as dinner and the weather is harsh but not impossible. On this sort of level you are looking at a game that Pushes you to survive that 50-100 days walking one side of the map to the other or should plain survival not be your thing the challenges offer survival with a little more fun due to the objective. 

Currently i'm on a quest to make a moose bag and rabbit, wolf and deer clothing while exploring the Vast lands and trying to commit the map to memory but its large and you are limited. Do you carry warm clothing or more fire wood and food do you need a powerful rifle with low ammo and a flare gun or a bow and pistol which are unlikely to kill a bear before it gets you. 

I have to say this has always been a chilled out go to game on and off but coming back to it now i find myself more locking in for 2-3-4 hours at a time and felt it was time to review.

The Long Dark is not for the fain hearted and if you are able to set yourself a goal and explore you will find yourself drawn into this and loving it if you love survival. It's challenging but not so that you can not relax and enjoy the challenge, Some games you may find everything you need straight away some you may freeze to death looking for a coat and others you may get everything but a weapon and a bear declare you as a tasty steak. 

With this game its not the thousands of ours i have on total war games no but i can see now more content is here and my my new found love for setting my own goal over the idea of just surviving and the new content to be released around this.

As noted before i have only played chapter 1 and then left this to wait for the rest now the 5th chapter is looming this year I aim to get restarted and Play through this and enjoy it to its fullest.

Overall The long dark may not be for everyone but its one of the few games i would give 10/10 for effort and how it feels, With a want to see this continue and become even more :)",1672785897,1672785897,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also find the amount of food needed to be consume is a lot, and how quickly your character gets tired, some of the maps also feel redundant like ravine or winding river, they feel like their just they to make the player feel like they walked a straight path.

If you already owned the game prior to a couple months ago, you don't have to buy the storymode but you DO have to buy the expansion pass. If you were to buy the game now, you would only get the survival mode and would have to buy both the story and the expansion pass. Personally I feel like this is obviously really shitty and the game being brought out of early access to then start selling what is essentially DLC is also really shitty. I think personally if you only want to play the survival mode, you'll get a ton of bang for your buck at the moment.

Good and underrated game, slow development, supposedly shitty developers.

This game is the equivocal ""story through survival"" in survival games but it does it well. The story mode is pretty good but before the Ch.4 update I only played up to Ch. 3, all out of 5 planned chapters, so the story hasn't been completed nor have I played all that is currently out. What I have played is really good. The voice acting is amazing, the animations are fantastic, and the multiple secrets behind the setting and history add a lot of depth to the game. That being said, it is incomplete and a lot isn't explained about each area you explore and the people you encounter. Each chapter so far has its own theme and unique tasks / objectives though, so there is some variety.

In survival mode, virtually all of the story telling is told via notes and computer emails/messages, and honestly it adds very little to the survival mode between all the walking, eating, and sleeping you do. In a sense, you can really just make up your own story. To my understanding, the survival mode takes place after story mode, so many things are different in the survival mode compared to the story mode.

The gameplay is as close as you could get to realism for a survival game that tries to be realistic without making it too tedious or difficult, but it really depends on the difficulty you play on and how you choose to play. I tend to play on Voyageur as it's the lowest difficult barring Pilgrim, which makes animals run away from you and is the easiest difficulty. On the ""normal"" difficulty, you will find yourself constantly having to stop to sleep, eat, boil water, find proper shelter, then move 5 steps closer to your destination. 

The gameplay loop is, unfortunately, incredibly tedious. I don't think most players find the most fun in sleeping, eating, and boil water. Most of the fun is exploring the world, hunting animals, managing your inventory and stats, and then maybe following some kind of challenge. There are challenges(as in survival mode ""missions"") that you can attempt outside of story and survival but I can guarantee that most players just opt for the survival mode.

Most of the game can be summed up as such: Extended periods of walking because you move so slowly(obviously) separated by, again, eating, sleeping, and boiling water. Throw in the occasional clothing and tool maintenance and chopping up furniture for materials and you've got your average day. Oh, yeah, there's hunting but it's very much a background activity. You shoot an animal, skin it, and then throw the guts and furs indoors to let it cure which takes several days, so it's really a rarely used mechanic. Same thing with crafting bullets. I only ever found 1 area where you could craft bullets and it is an obscenely long distance and long energy cost just to craft a few bullets which won't even be as high quality as the ones you find by scavenging, which is probably the biggest issue with this game. Most things you can find just by scavenging. There's very few scenarios where you need to actually go out and cut wood, or hunt animals for food and skins. You can find virtually everything in excess by scavenging. This is notable because as per how the game works, you literally CANNOT survive without scavenging. If you don't have an axe, you can't collect wood. If you don't have cutting tools, you can't get anything from hunted animals, and et cetera. You aren't able to truly live off the land in this game which, maybe, is the point. Regardless of how you find the resources you need, 90% of your time is still spent, say it with me now, eating, sleeping, and boiling water. 

You could try the harder difficulties but in my opinion anything past voyager is just excessive in how it makes the game hard. I tried Stalker once I believe and it's a huge leap between Voyager and Stalker(Normal and Hard respectively) to the point that it just feels jarring to go between the two difficulties.

I think most of my personal issues stem from how mind-numbingly tedious this game can get in the long-term. The longest survival game I've had has been 79~ days and let me tell you... that's a LONG time to play a single save. I also try to set challenges for myself that, apparently, are so obscenely out of reach that in the process of attempting them, it puts into perspective how this game just doesn't work in the long-term.

In my case it's the cartographer achievement, which only 1% of players have. You have to map out [b]every single point of interest[/b] in the game. Needless to say, this just adds more stress to a playthrough because you can only survey locations during the day / at night time with the aurora borealis. It's the most mundane and yet interesting challenges to undertake in this game as it is easily one of the most difficult. One of the reasons is that the map detecting locations is very buggy and you have to be standing in very specific spots, but also it's just fun to see the map fill out and see what you discover as you explore. Unfortunately you also need charcoal to map and this requires you to constantly make fires and wait around for them to burn out. 1 charcoal = 1 hour of fire, so... it gets tedious.

There are some unique and interesting parts to the game, however. The Aurora Borealis causes animals to be more aggressive and acts as a sort of reverse-EMP(electronics only work during the Aurora Borealis nights). The latest expansion added Blackrock, which has a really cool mine area, and the steam tunnels. Areas also range from towns with plenty of buildings to an absolute wasteland(hushed river valley, fuck you). I don't even think I could say what area is my favourite.

The sound effects, music, and voice acting are all amazing. Look up the soundtrack on youtube(or buy it to support the devs), it is AMAZING. Fits the atmosphere and immersive gameplay perfectly. The voice actors are also notable: Commander Shepard voice actors Mark Meer and Jennifer Hale, delivering amazing performances as always.

A last point to address is that this game has been in development since 2014~(I've seen 2012 quoted but I believe this was pre-official release). The development has been very slow and, supposedly(according to certain reviews and online comments) certain members of the development team are... not very nice, to say the least. Just a rabbit hole for you to explore I guess.

I could go on and on but ultimately if you enjoy survival games, you'll definitely like this game. It's peaceful, it's calm, and it actually really helps with my feelings of anxiety and stress. The gameplay is immersive, the story and exploration is fantastic, and then you binge it way too much for 3 days in a row and realise that it has its limits and it gets boring, as that is what this game is in the long-run. It's boring. It's tedious. It puts me to sleep because it's so calming and peaceful when I'm not being mauled by a bear or stomped by a moose. I recommend this game greatly but take your time and don't binge it, unless you're fine with a game where you do the same 3 things over and over every 15-30 minutes.",1672600817,1672614646,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Stranded alone in the winter of the Northern Canadian wilderness, you are left with a long, contemplative and lonely journey through the harshness of winter. With the only objective being to survive, The Long Dark creates an atmospheric, and at times haunting, environment, displaying the scenic beauty and vast power of the natural world. The lack of concrete objective in survival mode makes for a free, roaming experience. Once you begin to realize that you're not tied down to a certain location, a certain routine, the expansive map opens up to you to explore at a whim. For those are curious about it, The Long Dark can provide an interesting perspective on the separation—and immense similarity—with the natural world. In this game, you become much like packs of wolves or the bears that will hunt you, or flee from you. With your purpose boiling down to a need to find food and survive, you become simply another member of the food chain, held distant from the other wildlife only by the trembling line of the dead towns of The Great Bear, and what I find most magical about the game, a craving for exploration and innovation.

This is a fantastic game for anyone looking for a trying survival experience that will make you think, both in problem solving the challenges you will face (of which there will be plenty), but also about your place in the environment that you find yourself in.

I've since started a new game, and have really enjoyed it. TLD is a real rollercoaster, especially on a survival run. So far I've fought off wolves, hunted deer and been caught in blizzards, and it never stops feeling like the wilderness is trying its best to kill you. I've felt a lot of accomplishment at surviving for 20 days so far, although I've got a long way to go before I've explored every area on the map!

A lot of the mechanics are common-sense, which is great when trying to find useful ways of doing things. Want to keep your meat fresh? Leave it out in the snow to freeze. Thinking about dropping off a ledge whilst heavily encumbered to take a shortcut? Don't, just don't. Wolves are highly aggressive, but if you keep your distance they'll hopefully lose interest in you.

I've only played a bit of Wintermute (the narrative mode) and I've enjoyed it. You don't need to have played through it before starting a survival run, although the intro does give you a good tutorial in survival mechanics if you're new to this sort of thing. 

It looks like there's a lot of interesting new content coming, and I'm really looking forwards to seeing where it all leads. The quietest apocalypse I've ever seen, 10/10.",1672335585,1672335585,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's very realistic survival and it's truly fun for those who love harsh survival games. It has different setting for different level of players so that casual survival players all the way to hard-core survivalist can play and enjoy this game. It's all about the Journey and it's awesome. There is only one thing I wish they would change and that is the fishing. The hunting is on point but as an avid fisherman I would love to see them put more realistic details into the ice fishing and just as you can see yourself get the kill while hunting you could see yourself catch the fish while fishing instead of it just being a timer type of setup but other then that this game is awesome! The bears are insane and realistic and scary as hell.

The storyline BLOWS. Don't bother doing any side quests, don't bother doing anything except the literal bare minimum that you need to progress to the next location. Whatever interest and nuance that is brought up during gameplay is lost during the 3 hours of mindless unskippable dialogue you have to sit through to make it to the next chapter.

Sidequests for extra gear? - Who cares, they take it all during the chapter resets. 
Stockpiling food? - Nah man, you're back to basics.

I don't know what they were thinking with long, unskippable exposition dumps that offer nothing of interest to the actual survival aspect of the game. If you want to make a story mode, make it a consistent thing, instead of this jank chapter by chapter mess.


Edit: After playing Survival mode for another 80+ hours, the dumb shit this game throws at you to keep the difficulty curve is ridiculous. 

Step outside for twenty second? Here's a 3 day blizzard that never breaks; hope you brought food and water and don't have cabin fever!

Arrows? Need a forge to make metal arrowheads; because there's absolutely 0 way to make arrows otherwise.

The third episode had too many [i]other people[/i] in the frozen wasteland with you, and was also a step back from Episode II in that you only had one (large) region to explore rather than several.

It's brilliant, and I keep coming back to it year after year.  I play for awhile and then play something else, but I havent grown tired of this one yet.  The story mode is nice, and worth a play in my opinion, but Survival is the game.  Its you, and the brutal cold, the starvation, the desperation for heat and calories.  The fear of being lost in places you know well, with real death tapping on your shoulder.  This game has real stakes.  

It also has an incredibly touching soundtrack, and a simplistic yet powerful color palette.  The graphics are not flashy, they don't gloss over imperfections with their amazing levels of detail.  They are simple, because they dont need to be flashy.  I've never felt an inability to sink into my character because of clunkiness of graphics, or simplicity of polygons.  You won't see it, it's not the story, it's not what is important.  You will feel cold, you will feel alone.  you will experience the terror of being lost in a blizzard while freezing to death.  Of knowing that the door you are looking for should be right here but it isn't, and now you don't know where anything is except that this was your last chance.  

Of note:  there is continuing development of this game, and they have released a paid update version for new content.  To me, this is excellent news.  It means on it's face that this game will not fade away into obscurity, and will continue to offer fresh challenges and new content for long term players.  It means that it might live up to the time and investment that players put into their survivors.  I have not yet played this content, and it may not be great.

This is addictive, although sometimes in an unfulfilling kind of way. Trudging through snow constantly may not be your idea of fun but as a survival game it has considerable merit. You want to keep going, to find food, shelter, make a fire, and so on, while avoiding bears and wolves.

I think one needs patience to play this and I like the unhurried way you progress through the maps. Speaking of maps, you do not get an option to show the overall picture of precisely where you are so you can walk for miles and become very disorientated. I initially took to plotting my movement on paper and drawing landmarks. This helped but it took some time before my personal maps bore a useful degree of accuracy.

It's refreshing to play a game where you are not hand-held all the time, i.e. being told what to do, when to do it and where to head. You are largely left to figure things out.

I guess everyone who plays any game will always find a personal gripe or two.  With 'The Long Dark'  mine is that the implements in one's possession are pretty useless as weapons to fight off wolves. I mean, I can have a sharp knife and a hatchet but they are usually ineffectual. The rifle and revolver are okay (once located) but timing is everything, and the game kinda cheats when the attacker is close up preventing a shot and certain hit.

A level of protection from wild animals is finding and repairing layers of clothes to wear. While a good aspect I'm not entirely convinced it comes off well because the clothing interface seems a bit muddled.

A second issue for me is how dark many of the cabin and building interiors are, even in broad daylight. I couldn't imagine them being habitable given you need a lantern to light the black corners and recesses. To offset this I had to alter the brighness/gamma considerably.

Successive updates have detracted from my enjoyment of this game due to the wolves being more numerous and more aggressive on Stalker (in particular). There are also the bears and moose to contend with. But if you play on the easiest level the wolves aren't a problem but the resources are so plentiful and surviving indefinitely becomes no challenge at all. Stalker is the best level to play in my view except that it has now become as much a wildlife avoidance game as finding resources to survive on.

Interloper level means you start with hardly anything and just making it through 1 day is challenge enough because often you have no means to light a fire and no means of sleeping! That's because in most instances out in the wilds you need a BEDROLL to sleep and you're unlikely to start with one on Interloper: This is an oddity because even with food, drink and a warm fire you cannot recover physical condition without a bedroll! What's the problem with just lying down and dozing off?!

There is a Custom level whereby you can alter the game parameters, which is useful and er...okay-ish.

WINTERMUTE (the game story): This is a self-contained, first person game series in which you play a character in a quest - or rather a growing number of quests as the game develops. I can't say I'm that enamoured with it, and sometimes the dialogue you have to watch goes on and on...and on and on... Later on you find yourself having to not only survive with food, drink and warmth (not too much trouble) but an ever growing army of wolves, especially when packs of timber wolves seek to ravage and kill you. Frankly I found this nonsensical for several reasons, not least of which was seeing deer take flight right past the ravenous wolves only to be ignored in my favour. They also seem to have military grade radar in fog at considerable distances despite my not carrying meat or fish to attract them. 

Wintermute the story is pretty contrived and some of the puzzles later on are overdone and laboured. I persevered with Chapters 1-3, then Chapter 4 got, well, a bit silly. I had completed it but with the game update in November/December 2022 my completion of Ch4 seems to have disappeared so I can't start Chapter 5 even if I want to (which em...I probably don't).

Overall a worthwhile and recommended survival game but for Wintermute.",1482613660,1672090323,True,1,1,0.446927368640899658,0,True,False,False

I want to start by saying that this game is NOT for everyone. It is slow, unforgiving, and at times frustrating. This makes it to be one of the most immersive, and (somewhat) accurate to life survival games on Steam. If you don't like slow-paced, singleplayer titles, don't waste your time here. If you do, we can talk more about the game.

What is unique about The Long Dark is that it doesn't pull from many video game tropes that other survival games do. There are no zombies. There is no respawning, base building, or multiplayer. It is just you, the cold, and the wildlife. I love these kinds of immersive experiences. No other survival I have played creates the kind of feeling you get here. You feel isolated, lonely, and at times scared. You only have one life after all, and when you die, your world is deleted. This takes decision making to a whole new level, which separates The Long Dark from the rest. Deciding to go out and forage for food on a really cold day could be the difference between life and death. There is a lot of weight to everything you do. A story mode has been added over the years that is really just icing on the cake of what was already a great survival mode, and the new content they have added for that has all been really good too. The new additions haven't broken the integrity of what made it great in the first place. I want to finish by saying that, while it is an unforgiving and desolate world you find yourself in, there are some very peaceful, beautiful moments to be had in The Long Dark. The lack of people and direction leaves you alone with your thoughts. Not too many games give you that. Simplicity prevails with this one.

This is an absolutely fantastic game; there is a big learning curve at first as it lacks a tutorial but once you get the hang of things this game can be so addicting if you like survival games. Hinterland absolutely nails the idea of being alone and working independently for food, water, shelter, and defending yourself against wolves, bears, and moose.  I definitely do not recommend playing on Interloper as a newer player as the difficulty increases dramatically from Stalker (the 2nd highest difficulty). There is no base building as you have to find what shelter is available and make with what you have. I only played a little bit of the story mode but I liked what I played so far (I'm just lazy getting to it and prefer the survival mode). The soundtrack is a 10/10 and though the graphics aren't realistic it looks fantastic for the art style Hinterland was going for.

There are moments where the game feels boring, especially after you get settled in on a new run and trying to figure out what to do next as there's no objectives or goals listed for you to complete in survival mode. The game is also slower paced than most, and since there's no fast travel option it can make traveling to some zones feel more tedious than others. (Fast travel is not coming to The Long Dark but some people like it in games so here's the disclaimer) This game has bugs as with any other game but it hasn't ruined the experience for me while playing. The DLC is ""meh"" so far as of writing this review but there's more content being released that the community is excited for, so definitely buy it if you enjoy the base game and plan on putting hours into The Long Dark.

You walk around and you click. If you get attacked by a wolf, guess how you try to survive? By clicking as fast as you can. Opening a door? Hold for a long click. Opening a cupboard? Hold for a long click. Picking up a stick? Click once to inspect it, click again to add to your inventory. Click click click click, click click click!

Where there could have been enjoyable mechanics and mini-games in the many situations and circumstances you experience on Great Bear Island, instead, everything comes down to a click, or click and hold, and/or a roll of the die. Fishing is based on chance, starting a fire is based on chance, repairing clothing is based on chance. Yes, there are skills associated with all of these that increase the percentage chance as you build more fires, repair more clothes, etc. - but it still fundamentally comes down to chance.

Now, where it's good: It's a gorgeous game, and the level design is second to none. Understanding why landmarks (like broken or bent trees) are placed the way they are is a truly great design concept that makes exploring the world so much more enjoyable, and I wish more games employed that type of design.

On Wintermute: I've played episodes 1-4 and they are terrible. If you're paying attention to what's happening to the characters, they don't relate. There's no continuity across chapters in terms of theme, direction, intention, or purpose in general. The second episode? Literally, the whole premise? [spoiler] It's about running away from, then hunting an old bear. [/spoiler] FOR NO REASON. I'm certain they had a meeting one day and someone piped up and said, ""Hey, do you know what would be cool?"" and then that became the justification for the rest of the series.

Episode 4 is another great example!! The whole premise is that [spoiler] you're trying to break this guy out of prison for this gang (They were mentioned repeatedly in episode one), but in the end, the guy dies anyway! Never even had screen time! Or a voice! What was the point!!! AND he was in solitary confinement, unable to be accessed by his guys, so how was he eating?

It's also absolutely brutal. I had to restart 5 times before I got past day 4. Poor luck with resources and a lousy start (spawn on a windy day and freeze to death) can kill you long before you find shelter. When you realise this and get used to having to start over alot this game becomes great. 

The survival part is really hard and the aggressive animals can completely wreck your run. Meet a bear early and nowhere to go... Restart incoming!

There is a set amount of resources unless you manage to hunt animals and fish. You set up a base and end up having to move further and further away to find food and things to burn. At some point you either move to a new area. If you wait for too long you get to restart.

- Impressive visuals

[u]Positives:[/u]

it has a really great theme if you like (mostly) quiet, winter solitude.  You feel like you're struggling to survive in a cold, unforgiving wilderness.  If you run around in a snowstorm in this game, you likely will get lost and will die.  It feels really cozy and satisfying when you finally make it indoors, when you were on the brink of death.  Resource management and rationing is one of the bigger elements of this game, especially on higher difficulties.  You need to strategically plan and use your food, water, firemaking supplies, ammunition, crafting materials, etc. If you enjoy long term planning and strategy, you will enjoy TLD. 

[u]Negatives:[/u]
The wolves are kind of BS.  I get that the game needs a sense of lethal danger, but they feel kind of unfun sometimes.  Although I'm not sure that I'd call them unfair.  You either need to be able to kill them, escape into a building, or completely avoid the areas they roam in.  That kind of leads into my second negative take away, is that you can't really aimlessly roam in this game.  On higher difficulties you need to play with a map of the zone on a second screen, or with a number of prior playthroughs where you've learned all the map locations.  The game forces you to be on the move as much as possible.  This isn't a hunker down and build a fort kind of game.  You will set up a main crafting base, but if you try to stay in one location or one base for too long, you will run out of resources and will die.  Every zone has finite resources.  So you really need to have a plan of action at all times.  Which isn't bad persay, it can be fun optimizing your paths through the zones on each subsequent playthrough.  But part of me wishes you could freely wander a little bit more.  Also you end up opening lots and lots of boxes, containers, lockers, drawers, etc.  I wish there was some kind of auto-loot function.

[u]Overall:[/]
I think the good outweighs the bad, and this game is worth your time if you enjoy this style of game.  The game's easiest difficulty (Pilgrim) is tuned to be super forgiving.  Most players will probably find this difficulty much too easy after a couple playthroughs.  It gives you way more resources than you need, and wolves are not very dangerous.  The next difficulty (Voyager) is where most people will probably want to play the game.  The game will often give you more resources than you can carry, and wolves are a problem and are a set-back.  But they often will not kill you and end your run.  The next difficulty (Stalker) is much more unforgiving.  Scarcity of resources starts to become a problem.  Early in runs can be quite punishing.  Wolf attacks will often mean death.  The highest difficulty (Interloper) is insanely difficult.  You need a lot of practice and game knowledge before you'll play for any length of time on this difficulty.  I would recommend starting on Voyager and moving up to Stalker as soon as you can successfully clear 2-3 zones on Voyager.",1671835159,1671835159,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To start, I love survival games. I love the difficulty and realism of a good survival game, and TLD has all the ingredients to make it good. However, it's plagued with bugs and arbitrary difficulty boundaries that simply make it unenjoyable.

The whole point of a survival game is ... surviving. Once you ""achieve"" survival, it tends to get boring. TLD does a good job at constantly making you feel like you're trying to achieve survival, but it does it in the most arbitrary ways. You burn through resources so you're forever searching for the basics, if you want to do anything, you're at the mercy of RNG to give you the gear you need to survive, otherwise you simply can't do stuff. Is there a bush blocking your way? You must find an axe to break the bush down. A bush ... You want to hunt an animal? You must find something to hunt it with, find something to carve it up with, and find something to build a fire so you can cook it. Survival comes down to exploration and hoping you find what you need, no skill or tact whatsoever.

And the controls, you would think a game this far into development would have this part of the game figured out, but I've always found this game to fall short in this area. For some reason, if you're tired you increase your risk of getting a sprain. And the game thinks that any change in player height is a fall, so you might be walking along only to accidentally fall several times per second. And if you're tired, enjoy all your new sprains. 

Also, when you're close to death, for some reason your player stumbles all over. This seems like an interesting mechanic except it's completely broken. I was stumbling at about 40 miles per hour and it took me about 30 yards to finally stop falling. It's a completely bugged out mechanic that causes you to flail in about 100 yard radius, at extremely fast speeds. It just seemed super buggy.

There are also random spots throughout that map that will kill you instantly. I instantly drowned despite not being even up to my knees in water at one spot.

Again, survival for this game is all about foraging and hoping you find stuff. I love survival games because they give the opportunity to slow down and enjoy the peace. In TLD, you cannot slow down at all. Stopping anywhere for any period of time will inevitably lead to your death since there are no ways of surviving outside of looting. I would love to be able to store up some stuff and simply live in a cabin for a few days, but you're left with just enough supplies to get you to the next area and keep you moving.

I found myself nitpicking the heck out of the game just from how annoyed I was with the little details. Even my guy's voice was starting to annoy me just because I was so sick of hearing him complain.",1671823463,1671823463,False,5,1,0.513365209102630615,0,True,False,False

I've spent almost 40 hours playing and am not finished with the second episode out of the four (soon to be five) episode arc.  I played on normal difficulty and found that it's definitely a challenge, but not throw-your-key-board-at-the-wall hard.

It's a simple concept: there are no zombie hordes or other players trying to kill you: only Mother Nature.  You move around the map trying to salvage or hunt enough supplies to find your ex-spouse and keep yourself from freezing to death in the meantime.  The game is excellent at nailing tone: the scenery and music are sometimes wistful and beautiful, sometimes lonely and haunting.  The music, voice-acting, and design are all stellar.

There are a few gameplay issues: the map can be a bit clunky to navigate as there isn't a comprehensive worldmap that you can access, which can make traversing from one region to another less intuitive than I'd like.  Some gameplay aspects aren't explained well: in survival mode you have no idea what spraypaint or charcoal are for, or how to cure items.   I started playing Survival Mode and would recommend starting with Story Mode/Wintermute first, because it gives you a tutorial.

But overall, if you're looking for a slow-paced but challenging survival game in the vein of Hatchet, Call of the Wild, or My Side of the Mountain, look no further.

While the game isn't a perfect survival simulator (but for that matter, is there even one?), it serves the player very well in giving an experience that feels realistic without being too difficult or quite as life-threatening as real life winter survival. 

There are two available game modes in [i] The Long Dark, [/i] a standard survival mode that is presumably endless until you die or give up, as well as a story mode which has an additional $20 expansion available in the Steam store if you enjoyed the story enough. The story follows McKenzie, a man who is separated from someone close to him in this absurdly cold climate and is trying to reconnect with them again. Through the story you encounter a few lone souls along the way, and plenty of wildlife that is out there to harm you. 

The survival elements in this game are quite nice, especially for someone who is into the sport of Bushcraft and likes to camp for fun. There is crafting, harvesting/deconstructing items to repurpose their materials, hunting, stealth, evasion, foraging, looting, and hunger/health/water/energy/temperature bars as well as a system for counting calories to make sure that your character maintains a good fuel level to continue on their adventures. Cooking can be accomplished with campfires, and stoves, and a pot isn't essential for cooking the meat from animals you've hunted. Cooking on a rock does just fine. 

Overall I covered a good portion of the main bases this game covers, but there is tons to be discovered out there! Stay fed, stay warm, and don't fade into The Long Dark.

    The people complaining about how much time it has taken the game to release the newer chapters, complaining about the DLC and so on and so forth. The dev's have mentioned that they where releasing the DLC content in 7 to 8 weeks inter-voles which gives them time to make good content. Same goes for winter mute. They wish to make good content and not crunch times on it. Some are just angry cause they got a 20 dollar DLC and dont have all the content now which was clearly stated to be a 12 month process. And if you dont like the DLC alot of the new varaints will come to base game from what Ive seen. Lotta yall are just impatient as hell.

Now for the actual review


 I have been following the Long Dark since its early days. I will confess Ive seen my far share of bug's in the game and some quite noticeable things too. I did quite enjoy the story mode, I always felt like i was on my own adventure on my way to each story objective or mark..sometimes I'd have to recover from a wolf fight after having fought over a dead deer with it, to waiting out a storm or blizzard in a house or having to brave it cause I didn't making to a cave or my objective in time before it hit. I always felt immersed, the lack of animations of grabbing things and being able a second to look at what I picked up never felt like it was Mackenzie picking it up but rather myself. Its slow snow falls to its over spralling mountian over looks made it very pretty and gained a special place in my heart. The slow quiet somber walks are quite nice and comforting like a calm to the dangerous world whenever I was fully warm, fed, well rested. It was nice little breaks before getting pulled back into the situation your faced with. I did quite enjoy some parts of the story. My favorite momments was with grey mother after her quest line.


 I do heavily enjoy this game but it is certainly not for everyone. The story mode can slow for alot of people who are used to COD's fast paced actions or the use of fast travel or other games that constantly have you on your feet and your attention fully focused. This is not a futureristic shooter or a current gen game where you can be at your destination. It requires long walks back through previous regions or area's. This game is all about survival. What you have to do to survive in its world and unless you play through the story will not lead you by hand if you play sandbox first, it is brutal unless you pick pilgrim. It's slow but that's how walking on foot through alot of area's really is. It makes you understand that cars aren't of use anymore and you must do it yourself. But as i mentioned it is not for everyone and that is fine, I do think the story could be re written here and there..a few game play bugs like the saved states of past games could be fixed and few other's but i do rate this game highly to people who are interested in this kinda topic and do not mind the slow atmospheric trects through several area's while fighting off the cold and the wild life

Stay warm by wearing appropriate clothing (a hoodie won't cut it out in the frozen wilderness). Stay fed and hydrated, boil your water and cook your meats or risk illness. Start fires with tinder and sticks before using wood. Hunt game and cure the pelts for gear. Cover any open wounds and be wary of carrying raw meat lest predators track your scent. NEVER get caught in a blizzard. Find shelter, Stay warm, survive. The quiet Apocalypse is as comforting as it is deadly. 

This game is surprisingly realistic in it's survival aspects and has great customisation. Play however you'd like.

For a few small additions to the game (for free) to delete all the existing saves up to that moment, is to say the least unacceptable.
New jokes were added in the past, there was no need to delete player saves, why is it different now?
You can't say that for a new area, some new ailments and changing some spawm places, it is necessary to delete some saves of hundreds and thousands of days survived in the game (the equivalent of hundreds and thousands of hours invested in real life).

Yet this game is also a good illustration of why I don't buy Early Access games anymore.  Story mode took years and years to come out, and when it did, it was flat and underwhelming.  The writers had a bizarre obsession with virtue signaling and anti-materialism, and shoehorned it in very unconvincingly.

The first four episodes of Story Mode did not address any of the big questions -- instead they grudgingly provided tiny details.  The inciting incident and villains make zero sense.  I feel that the writers have no idea what to do or where to take the story.  Worse, the large amount of cash this game generated means that there's no impetus to actually improve future episodes.

The last straw was this 'new content release.'  Simply put, it's unrelated DLC, perhaps a large expansion of sandbox mode, but ultimately a cash grab... and very much a pig in a poke.

I could make way more checks there for you, but this game is amazing. On steam it shows I only have about 72 hours in, but I've been playing this game extensively for years on XBOX as well, somewhat recently made the switch to take full advantage of the new expansion. The studio is amazing, HIGHLY ACTIVE among the fan base, and really provides amazing support. Since I've been playing this game since roughly 2015, it's been loads of free content after purchasing the main title itself - all the content has been damn near glitch free with some amazing gameplay situations.

The survival aspect is pretty damn real, and who would've thought a cold countryside would produce harrowing moments? No creepypasta stuff at all. It's literally YOU VS. NATURE. I give this game about a 8.5/10 - it's not perfect and I do have a few gripes, but not much:

❌ The game measures food intake by calories, not weight, and it sometimes doesn't make sense to consume 4 pounds of fish to get 3/4 full
❌ Some items that decay don't really make sense - i.e. magnifying glass, whetstones don't decay and break after a few hours of use, and some food items should be good for much longer
❌ Recent updates via Tales from the Far Territory have introduced new glitchy behaviors, but I know they are working on them, and are not game breaking
❌ I feel that when it comes to developing some skills, misses and failures should still count. For example, hitting a target with a bullet does not reflect real-life familiarization with a weapon. You'd still learn about how it fires, how to hold it, and how to operate it - regardless of hitting a target. You should still get experience for failing to start fires, or failing to successfully mend clothing. That's arguably my biggest disagreement.

That's really about it. This game is difficult, requires you to not yeet yourself into the wild. You need to plan. You need to always have first aid. You need to always expect to run into hostile wildlife and carry a flare or a weapon. You need to always have what it takes to start at least one/two fires at any given time. There are beginner areas all the way up to ""nature is outright trying to kill you"" areas. Exposure will probably kill you before wildlife does, so there's alot at stake when you venture out for an exploration run, equipment/loot run, hunting run, or to simply move to a new area.

I'm trying to make it to broken railroad and the new airfield region, and it's day 40 for me and I'm just about ready. I started in Mystery Lake, couldn't find a rifle, moved to Coastal Highway, found weapons, killed wolves, deer, and a bear to craft gear, and now I'm moving back to Mystery Lake to permanently (possibly) relocate in the brand new areas. It's all a big, 40-day, build up to go on a massive expedition to the new regions. It takes time. It takes patience. You've gotta plan for the long game. 

DEATH IS PERMANENT

...so trust in your planning, don't be stupid, don't rush, and you'll have a HUGELY memorable gaming experience.

TLD has the 5th most hours played in my library, and to be honest, it's probably my favorite game I've ever owned. Story mode hasn't been my favorite, but along with every story mode update has come new features for survival mode, which IMO is where this game really shines. TLD Survival Mode is not a game you are intended to win. If you're careful and lucky enough, you can gather renewables indefinitely, but make no mistake, you will die. There is no becoming god-like in this game; you can have all the resources in the world but still come across a wolf, bear, or moose at the wrong time and die. The joy of this game is seeing what you can make of each adventure, surviving each wildlife encounter, throwing a rock to distract a wolf while you sneak by through the wind, finding shelter in a cave during a snow storm.

Lastly, there is no developer on this platform that deserves your money more than Hinterland. They have always been honest and upfront, they have provided free updates to this game for going on ten years now (I've been playing since very early alpha), and only now have they asked for money to help keep the development of this incredible game going. I will easily get 1000+ hours of gameplay from this game, not even considering if I get into Story Mode.

The DLC is working great, all reviews were centered around an issue at launch which was fixed within an hour. Other reviews call out the devs as greedy douche bags for tweeting, during these launch issues, that their game had made the best seller lists, and for calling a player an ass, failing to mention that the very same player had written a toxic message to the devs first. True, the devs should not be calling anyone 'ass', but responding to a launch issue that was quickly fixed - and made the game completely playable - by trashing the hard work put into the DLC certainly fits the description of an ass.

It's a punishing, methodical, war of attrition with the elements and nature, but also yourself. You'll have runs that end with you starving, mauled, sick, frostbitten, trampled, burned, and everything in between. The most remarkable thing is that in all of that you'll almost always blame yourself. Sometimes the game is unfair in the same way life is, but you'll almost always be able to trace things back to one crossroads where you stretched your resources too far that did you in.

I guess what I'm saying is simple: the survival mode in this game is not fun in the traditional sense. It's like satisfying, therapeutic busy work. Everything has a purpose, every choice has a cost, but it's just you alone with your thoughts to muddle through it.

It's a beautiful, unique thing, honestly. There's nothing quite like snuggling up with a hot cup of coffee and a blanket to lug your moose kill back to your base camp. You could lose whole days easily. In the end, ""beating the game"" is almost a disappointment. Getting that far ahead of the curve takes an insane amount of work even on the easier difficulties so there's plenty of content here just in that.

Shout out to the art & design team for this game. They did my favorite thing: they chose an aesthetic and stuck to it. This game will remain timeless because the visuals aren't trying to be photorealistic, they're trying to fit the aesthetic. Great Bear Island *feels* frigid, lonely, and indifferent and it owes a lot of that to the washed out, muted, painterly look of everything. 

The audio design is just as important and actually took nearly the opposite track: it's spot on realistic and it really gives the visuals the necessary support to get you truly immersed. When you step out on a windswept winter morning and are greeted by the sounds of loose boards rattling on a nearby shack and the distant cawing of crows circling nature's latest victim, you'll feel it. 

That all said, if I have a gripe with this game it's that I feel like the survival mode has been neglected in favor of the campaign mode. I'm not going to knock it, but campaign is not what I'm here for and it never was. Survival has had updates, but they felt like they all had to coincide with some new designed-for-campaign zone or gameplay feature rather than putting Survival at the forefront like I truly think it deserves.

Add to that, I think there's very real work to be done on Survival! Some of the elements of the default survival experience are a bit half-baked. For instance: everything in the entire game world begins decaying from the moment you start. Logically it makes sense that things left behind would begin to rot or expire, but the rate at which it occurs is a bit absurd, almost entirely item agnostic, and results in things like undisturbed saltine crackers and premium exploration gear evaporating into dust within about 3-6 months. If you truly conquer the elements and strike out into the world too late you'll discover nothing but empty containers everywhere. Seems like a missed opportunity to add a layer of preservation or shelf stability of items into the mix. Also you'd still be finding functional clothing and gear for *decades*.

Also, you're almost literally glued to the ground? There have been many a time where I was stopped by some ankle or waist high obstruction and it felt ridiculous. Another thing is that gear selection is going to basically be entirely identical between runs. With few exceptions each slot has a ""best"" item and the loot pool itself is quite tiny.

As I post this, a survival-focused DLC is on the horizon, but I really wanted this to be more a reflection on my last few years of on/off dabbling with this game. I hope this DLC addresses survival with the attention it truly deserves. It's a unique experience in gaming and I'd really like it to be even better than it is.

And anyway that's just me nitpicking, this game is a wonderful experience if you're up for some solo cold weather survival. Nothing else like it.

Will you be taken by surprise by a blizzard, wolf or bear? What do you bring with you, is trying to make it to the next shelter in one go, worth it. 
 A great survival game that isn’t against zombies or cannibals, mother nature is more than enough to make survival difficult. There is a bit of a learning curve but its not steep. That being said there are 4 difficulty levels so you can move up or down as you need. 

The game is absolutely beautiful, from the landscape and scenery. To the footfalls of bears and deer in the snow. The far-off wolf howls, even the crows have different calls. Sometimes there is something there for you to find, other times they warn you about an incoming storm. The atmosphere is haunting and immersive, you truly are all alone in the world, its tough and challenging. 

The game world is large but not so big that you can’t explore it all. The regions connect well, but don’t let that fool you. The weather is your biggest threat…. Even if bears and moose have all made me regret my own existence more than a few times.  Don’t get discouraged when you die, you will die. However, you will learn a little more each time. You will learn what works in your favor, what is a disadvantage and most importantly you will learn the maps as you go.

The story mode is hit or miss, some people love it, some hate it. Personally, I didn’t like it initially, I kept dying, I didn’t understand the mechanics. I switched to sandbox to learn, after about 30 hours I returned to story mode and actually enjoyed it. It’s a simple storyline, don’t go looking for plot twists and layers upon layers of depth.  The soundtrack is great, very fitting with the theme of the game. 
It is controller compatible, however I find it much easier to aim with the mouse,  on controller it feels clunky. 
Best survival game I’ve played I recommend it to everyone. 

My love for this game continues to grow, Hinterland has added more episodes for Wintermute (story mode). They have also added more regions and loot for the base survival game.

Now onto the DLC, there is a free version and a paid version, I bought the paid version and it has been worth every penny. The new features have made survival mode fresh. Spawn locations have been adjusted, so you get that feeling of being lost all over again. The loot tables have been optimized for each region. You cant depend on that can of peaches being in the same house anymore. It feels like when I first played the game again.
 
When I first started playing there were 9 or 10 maps, then they added 2 more with the base game, free of charge. Now with this new DLC they've added a New region that is massive, this region comes with 2 transitional areas, so it feels like there's 3 new locations to explore.

There is new gameplay and items etc, honestly just check out their site to see all the new stuff they added. 

Finally, if you aren't a fan of the update, or you have saved games you don't want to lose. You can play in the ""Time Capsule"" mode via steam and return to your old saves.

I love that it's a hyper-realistic survival game, wherein the gameplay becomes not a matter of ""chop wood and build a house"" and more ""struggle to just barely haul your ass into an abandoned house and hope they have some stale beef jerky you can gnaw on""

The game is rather simple at its core; you're basically balancing numbers at all times.  Weight of items you carry, calories, temperatures, clothing and equipment condition, food freshness, etc.  Much like reality, success hinges a whole lot on luck (the randomness of what items spawn in whatever building or location you are closest to).  Encounters with bears and wolves are almost always fatal, for you, unless you've got a good escape route.


The way the game works makes it so that it doesn't have much in the way of long-term gameplay, but it is rough enough and has so much stuff and locations that are almost always just barely out of reach that the urge to come back to it is very strong.  As in, this isn't a game where I could pour 500 hours in a month, but could spend 500 hours over the course of 3-4 years with glee.


The only major downside I have is the storymode.  While the Survival mode is brutally realistic and harsh, storymode has way too much handholding and the missions amount to little more than fetchquests.  There's no real reason to stockpile anything since you're constantly on the move finding some magic spear or some other garbage.


When the urge to play this game hits me, I do not want to spend 2 or 3 hours running across a map just to pick up something and bring it back to some NPC, I want to break my leg navigating a sloppy fall and have to sit in a car for 5 hours waiting for the wolves to wander off.",1670547345,1670547345,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For new players, I would recommend to just play the Survival Sandbox version.  This is where I have spent 90% of my time in this game and enjoy it so much more than the Story mode. There's a progression within the Survival Mode, with each game contributing to earned Feats. These Feats can then be activated in your subsequent Survival Sandbox playthroughs, to give bonuses. There are also Challenges within the context of the Survival Mode. This review is before I have played the new paid expansion, Tales From The Far Territory (TFTFT). So, my opinion on Story mode may change. But, I have played this game since early Beta and the real joy is the Survival Mode. TLD is described as the hardest survival game there is. In my opinion there is greater immersion in the environment, by playing Survival Sandbox rather than Story Mode.  Hope this review helps new players. I am about to embark on the new paid expansion story mode, TFTFT . So, I will update this review with my subsequent opinion on best game version for new players. Enjoy!

EDIT - Great news, all the emphasis is on the Survival Sandbox in the new expansion, TFTFT. In fact there is no Story Mode in there at all. It's great to see that the developers recognise that the main game for everyone is the Survival Sandbox and not the Story Mode, and they are working to develop the Survival Mode experience for their player base.

August 2017:  Hi sir, would you like to buy our new product?
Customer:  Your product looks nice, so yes I would like to purchase.
Great, we will deliver the first two installments of your product now with 3 more to be shipped at a later date.
Customer: That sounds great.
September 2017:  Hi, how are you enjoying our product?
Customer:  It didn't really work when you sent it to me.
We are sorry about that.  Although most of our staff took last month off to rest, we did our best to repair the product we sent you.
Customer:  Well, you did fix the product but I didn't really enjoy it.
October 2017:  Hi, we are calling to inform you that your third installment will not arrive by the end of the year.  We are very sorry for the delay.
Customer:  I guess that is okay.  I really hope it is done by spring.
February 2018: Customer:  Hi, is my third installment ready to ship yet?
We are sorry but due to the fact that our customers were unhappy with the product we shipped, we are currently remaking your first two installments while we also work on your third installment.
Customer:  Well the first two weren't very good, but I am looking forward to the third one being better.
May 2018: Customer:  Hi, Is my third installment ready yet?
We are sorry but we are still working hard to remake and ship you a new product and we continue to work on your third installment as well.
Customer:  Well, it would be nice to have the third installment done a year after i paid full price for 5 installments.  That will be in August so I will hopefully have it then.
August 2018:  Customer:  Hi, its been a year since I purchased your product and still haven't recieved my third installment.
Good news, we will be delivering your remade product along with your third installment in December.
Customer:  Geez, its about time.
November 2018:  Hi, we regret to inform you that your third installment will not ship this year.  We will however ship you the remade installments in December.
Customer:  This is starting to annoy me.
December 2018:  Hi, are you enjoying your remade installments?
Customer:  The product does seem to be better but since its been over a year since I paid full price, I was kind of expecting to have at least half of my product by now.
March 2019:  Customer:  Hi, its been over a year and a half since I paid full price for 5 installments, is my third one almost ready?
We are sorry but due to customer complaints about delivery times, we are no longer giving out possible dates for deliveries.
Customer:  Is this some sort of scam?  Can I get my money back?
..................................
June 2019:  Customer: Hi, is my damn third installment ready yet?
We assure you that we are working hard on it, but due to customer complaints about delivery times we no longer give any information about possible delivery dates.

The hunting, scavenging, survival against the elements and wildlife made the game really feel like you were the last man on Earth. The art style of the game was nice, sound effects were close enough to life to keep me not feeling like any detail was missed. Those episodes we got were leading to an interesting point: what exactly did cause power to fail, the overall downfall of stable government and stable living. There is more to the world within the game and the global story beyond. (edited on 12/07/2022)

I cut out my angry rant that went here before, below is what I have to replace it with.

After some information was brought up, I realized that if you were an Early Access purchaser, such as myself, I did indeed get WINTERMUTE for free. Apologies for the disparaging remarks earlier, this teaches me to pump my brakes in the future. Thanks to communitydev who responded and thanks to everyone else who did as well. With that in mind...

This is a good game. Despite my consternation about the long development times, the art style is very much something that will age well. It feels almost brush-stroke storybook artsy while also being gritty enough at times to not be taken as lightly at such. I'll look forward to seeing the completion of the game. After waiting this long, there are more games to play between then and now, and there will be stuff to do between now and until then.

Should YOU, dear reader, get this game? Yes. The survival sandbox mode alone is nice, the world feels bleak and hopeless while allowing you to thrive in it should your determination hold true. With scenarios to play out and the WINTERMUTE campaign, those who want a core story experience shouldn't be disappointed either.

Highly recommend a cup of warm tea, coffee, or cocoa. This game will make you feel like you're deep in the snowy winter.",1670329164,1670435653,True,0,0,0.555539250373840332,5,True,False,False

It has come the point where I am just unable to enjoy the game anymore, mostly due to the direction the game is taking.
When I was playing the game, it felt standalone, safe, solid and predictable. You could disappear in your little world, enjoying some escapism and not worry about anything.

But then the game had to be changed. Multiple times. All to gear it towards a series of incremental changes to the game to give the developers an easy income stream (as opposed to taking their chances with a TLD 2,3, etc). So instead, TLD gets changed. It gets a story that neuters the main character. My save games become wipes.

It's hard not to be a little personal, but I interacted with one of the dev's and quickly learned that the person I was dealing with was a fucking idiot and was not alone in his line of thought. I was there from the beginning and obviously there are a million stories (mostly good... *mostly*), but the straw that broke the camels back and resulted in me telling the dev to go fuck himself went like this...

For around 2 years I was very active on the forums mainly because Cabin Fever was something thought up by a brain dead gibbon and was authorised by another brain dead gibbon. A game where the goal is to get to safety and survive for as long as possible. A game where the goal is to gather resources and the reward is safety. A game where the *best* place to be is inside and the *worst* place to be is outside... PUNISHES you for being inside and forces you outside... you know, with the bears, wolf packs and moose.

*Slow clap*

Cabin Fever was introduced (*and* the leaderboards were removed) because (AND I QUOTE);

""Players were playing the game in a way that we did not intend.""

Do you know what it was that we were doing to make them remove a loved feature and add the most hated feature?

1) Gather food.
2) Gather water.
3) Stay inside (aka; safety) until you run out of food / water.

THAT'S. FUCKING. IT. That's *all* that we were doing. We were playing the game well, *that's it*. You didn't want players to do... the one thing they *need* to do and actively and intentional punish them as a result?

However... this was clearly a collective brain fart and it was only a bad idea in its current form, it could be turned around. So I was (politely, believe it or not) on the forum for *2 years* trying to talk to the dev's and got stonewalled. Every. Single. Time. I did everything right, I didn't just criticise or name call, I was polite, offered feedback and constructive criticism and I was far from alone.

The dev's were active on the forum... but never any threads that addressed Cabin Fever. After 2 fucking years of being nice, polite, constructive and trying to reach out to the dev's in a perfectly acceptable manor (exemplary, even) and getting only ignored in return I snapped and gave him no choice but to acknowledge me.

In an update thread I left a message that was an entire page long but empty apart from the middle 3-ish lines. It said something like (paraphrasing);

""Dear Cunt, Are you going to ignore me forever? Or are you a run and hide type person?""

To which he replied with a 100% unironic:

""If you want my attention don't come in here swearing, make a thread and I'll get to it.""

You know that thing you've been doing for 2 years and getting ignored despite dealing with it perfectly and having to deal with a fucking prick? Go keep doing that.

I nearly bought a fucking plane ticket.

The game?

Good - However it has been killed by the dev's. You will *NEVER* finish this game. Not because it's too hard, not because it's too long, but because the dev's don't know when to end development. It's been 8 years and they still aren't finished, still updates are coming and I stopped playing back in 2018 because with every updates comes a restart. Back when the game was only *2* areas (+1 small connecting area) my record playthrough was over a year, I was on the first page of leaderboards and was FAR from finished (I was one of the best at the game at the time /flex).

I lost it all to an update (this would continue to happen over and over for around a dozen times).

8 years in, it's still happening, it's still not finished, cabin fever is STILL FUCKING THERE and now there's paid DLC coming over the next year? So it's a 9 year *minimum* development time (It's going to be a decade).

You will never achieve your goal in this game, the dev's won't let you.

I highly recommend you get it if you are on the fence. Any issues (technical or pricing) that have occurred during launch they have been quickly addressing and communicating with us about for resolution and clarifications. I've seen a number of negative reviews that do not give a fair picture of Tales From the Far Territory and their move to split Story (Wintermute) and Survival into separate products. Hinterland repeatedly let players know ahead of time that 1) Saves for the survival mode will not work once TLD is updated (even if you don't buy the paid DLC). 2) All the updates that TFTFT will bring are being released over  the course of the next 12 months via several ""drops"" as they call it - the Dec 5th launch is drop 1 - more will be coming over the next year 3) We haven't known exactly what content is being released with each new drop of TFTFT but common sense should tell you that they will more than likely save things like introducing the cougar for a later drop to keep some of the juiciest stuff for later so we still have some really cool things to look forward to. 3) For the Story mode fans who have waited but are upset - Episode 5 is coming and they have said it will be in 2023. I'm mainly a Survival fan but have also gone through Story and appreciate it, but Story isn't my real interest, Survival is. Hinterland has also said  Ep 5 is going to be a big episode. Raph wants that last episode done especially well I can imagine and he, probably more  than anyone else wants to complete Wintermute. I have full confidence that will happen. 4) I'm also sure this DLC and the Story/Wintermute split is a way to see how things go with providing paid content.

I've watched it go from a work-in-progress indie game to one that, in some aspects, beats those produced by large studios. I paid $19.99 USD for the game when it released in 2014 and, until the launch of the DLC, paid NOTHING else. Over the course of eight years Hinterland has not only provided an unreasonable amount of free updates, but kept them within a single game. When I use the time capsule to remember what the game was like back in 2014, I am astounded. The gameplay, the graphics and the features of this game are constantly evolving and have never dissapointed me. I am so incredibly grateful for the amazing content Hinterland has released over the years and have limitless respect for them not only as developers, but also as a small studio. For that reason, I am so upset that Hinterland is receiving so much backlash with the release of Tales from the Far Territory (TFTFT). 

Hinterland has been incredibly transparent with their development progress and goals since they announced the arrival of TFTFT, making it very clear that the initial release is essentially early access. The DLC is not completed and won't be until sometime next year. This initial release is only the first update out of many that will come over the course of 12 months. That being said, if you aren't the type of player to enjoy a work-in-progress feature, then hold off on purchasing the DLC until it's complete. However, if you (like me) don't mind some buggy features and incomplete content, then by all means purchase TFTFT so we can continue to support Hinterland throughout this launch campaign. As a parting note, don't be afraid to report bugs and glitches. After all, it helps the developers figure out why it's happening and how they can fix it.

[hr][/hr]
[h1] The Actual Review... [/h1]

This is one of my favourite games. A game created by people who care about it, and care about releasing quality stuff, even if that means it needs to take longer to release. I'm not the best at reviewing stuff but here are my rambling honest thoughts on what I think matters.

[b] TL;DR near the bottom. [/b]

[hr][/hr]
[h2] Review Points [/h2]

[h3] Visuals [/h3]

The Long Dark has a rather simplistic art style. It does not lack detail however, with locations being populated with objects/structures that tell a story and create an atmosphere. I find the game to incredibly immersive, as it performs well, and does not have flashy, busy graphics to distract you from the game-play and environment. What I mean is that sometimes less is more, and for an environment that is essentially a frozen wilderness, it makes it feel as such.

[h3] Sound [/h3]

The sound design makes up for where the visuals may at first glance appear to be lacking (You may be surprised how beautiful this game can look) The audio always complements what you see. Are you carrying very little in your backpack? You won't hear much noise from it until you start loading it up with gear, then every step you feel the weight of the load through the sounds it subtly makes. Is there a storm rolling in? Probably, because you can hear the wind start to pick up shortly before you realise that you can't see much in the blizzard that follows. Wolves howling, crows squawking overhead, birds in wooded areas, trees creaking in the wind, wind whistling through the trees, being inside a building as it groans in a storm, etc. I could go on.

[h3] Game-play and settings [/h3]

Game-play wise, its very customisable in terms of difficulty and options for each save. Enabling or disabling specific survival elements; adjusting spawn rates for loot, animals, containers; weather variability; character needs depletion rate and more. 
If for example, you want the survival experience but don't like the idea of animals attacking you, make a custom game and set the animals to passive unless attacked. Can't stand blizzards? Custom game; turn them off.

Each survival game plays like a ""run"", as you try to survive as long as possible. You as the player can follow the in game achievements and challenges to get a sense of what to do, but it is mainly a sandbox survival experience in which you write your own story.
If you die, that save is finished. It's game over, you lasted X amount of time this time around. { * } Replay-ability comes in the form of wanting to improve on how long you can survive, completing challenges, trying out different difficulty settings, and of course, because it is a rather fun game.

[h3] Mechanics [/h3]

Mechanics including; crafting, repairing gear, hunting, gathering resources, looting structures and exploring the maps all feel necessary and rewarding in their own ways and like valuable, interesting parts of the game rather than just things to do for the sake of it. Your survival depends much on how well you can manage a balance of the mechanics. There's a good balance of slow methodical game-play with moments of intensity; like the attack of a bear you strayed too close to, a wolf finding the scent of all that deer meat you're carrying and then hunting you, or desperately trying to find your way back to safety from a storm you got caught in.

[h3] Maps [/h3]

And lastly, there is very good variation in the maps you will explore and live in. From flatter areas with clustered buildings, to cliffs with precarious bridges and little shelter; or a cold and windy valley, to a frozen muskeg. An icy coastal settlement, or a towering mountain. 
The maps connect to each other through smaller more straightforward maps. Some of them being cave tunnels, allowing for more of a sense of making a real journey to get to the next one, rather than a simple and harsh transition to the next big map.

[hr][/hr]
[h2] TL;DR / Final Thoughts [/h2]

A brilliant survival sandbox with nice visuals, great audio, and engaging gameplay. I find this game to fit a niche in my library perfectly; immersive single player survival you can play how you like, providing a good challenge when you want one, with a great game-play loop. No artificial enemies, just you vs nature. Just about no bugs from what I've seen, a well supported and updated game. The base game is absolutely worth it. 

[hr][/hr]

{ * } [i] I understand some people may not like the idea of ""permadeath"" and losing an entire save; you can look up save scumming if you want something of a backup. Basically manually copying your save file every now and then, creating backups. It is a single player game after all, play it the way that you find the most enjoyable.

The main game still isn't complete, and now they're releasing season passes. Game has been in development for 8+ years...can anyone honestly say there's 8+ years of work put into it?

Look at the global achievements for the game and you'll see all you need to know.

Out of the top 4, 3 are from storymode and not missable. It also only takes about 4 hours to get through that bit of content. The other achievement is for surviving a single day in survival mode....
52% of players have completed the tutorial basically and it goes down from there. 

So, the game is at a 91% on steam, but 50% or more of players quit playing before they reached 4 hours. 

Beyond that, I found the game to be fairly boring. The storymode definitely has a decent atmosphere, but who knows when it will ever be finished. They're on episode 3 out of 5. They took time to remake the first 2 episodes so, probably another 2 to 3 years before the game is actually finished.

Developers of this game are supported and funded by the media. They do not need your money, do not buy this game.

Every ""major"" update has broken the game time and again, proving that Indie Game Developers are just lazy as well as greedy. 
I even tried to be supportive of the community of this one, and got many awards for threads I made or comments I gave in the forum.
But as soon as I asked why they would have released a paid DLC, for an INCOMPLETE game, that was so broken as to be nearly unplayable because loot tables were flipped and textures were missing and players were angry left and right as they should by every human right, I was banned forever from the forum by a moderator with NO REASON GIVEN. But the reason is obvious.
The development studio is not serious about producing a game, and only concerned with pushing a Canadian Political Agenda and making you pay them to push it on you.

The survival experience is a joke. Even an amature at camping will come to realize this. Either the settings become to easy, or become a robotic experience. Serious lack of survival tools, equipment, and other things that would make you think you are inside a survival experience. 
The Sandbox, is a joke. Any one that has played pretty much any other sandbox game will find this game is severely limited in options and when you play with the options you do have to much in one direction or the other, you just broke the game. 
The Story Mode, is the biggest joke of all. All it is doing is pushing some weird Canadian Political Agenda that I can't even start to understand, and the gameplay in the story mode is super easy, childish and mostly cartoonish at best because of the art style of pencils, charcoal and pastels but really not a story for children under 14 years old AT LEAST. 

There is almost no depth of play, no depth of realism, and the only thing that really kept me going for 500 hours over the course of 8 years was the pretty lights of the aurora in game event. 

I used to recommend this game, but I can no longer stand by this product. If you are reading this, you would be safer to play a game called UnReal World, on Steam, because it is probably actually the game you are looking for. 

Run away from this game and let it fade away into it's own Long Dark. 

Seriously run away from this game called The Long Dark. 
UnReal World is here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/351700/UnReal_World/

However, since the story and survival modes are getting separated, I thought I'd leave my impressions from when I played it. Atmospherically speaking, the game does a great job. It certainly lies among the most atmospheric survival games I've ever played. Even some gameplay mechanics (such as supplies not respawning) work towards providing an atmospheric experience.

But in my experience, the game leaves a lot to desire in the fun factor. Episode 2 has you hunt an old bear that freely migrates between three maps. You have to follow blood trails to deduce where he is and then fight him until he decides to escape to the next spot. That becomes an unbearable cycle as you run out of supplies, and respawning wolves fight you as you travel from one bear spot to the other. It seems this episode got a rework one year later, but I'm not sure it made things better, as running back and forth looking for the bear while starving and being attacked by wolves made me drop my expectations, and I didn't even feel like playing the game anymore at all.

One more thing to note is the developers decided to take the game out of early access even though the game's content is still unfinished. Long Dark should still be marked as an early access game so that people know what they're getting without having to rely on reviews and forums.

If you're a big fan of survival games, perhaps you should try out survival mode nonetheless.

But what it lacks in visual realism it makes up in survival realism. You must eat, drink, sleep. That's pretty common. Since it is set in a cold climate, you must keep warm. That usually means a fire, or finding some indoor location. 

Making fire requires more than matches and wood. You need tinder, matches, wood...even then you may fail to start the fire.  If you run out of wood, you can break up that crate or stool you found. But to break up that rickety old table you will need a hatchet. Don't think a few sticks will be enough to keep the fire toasty warm. Every piece of wood has only so much burning time before it goes out. Obviously those few stick won't last for long. The nights are long and cold, so you will need a lot of fire. You will need a lot of wood.

The game world is large, with a lot of things to see and find. There won't be any wonders to behold, mostly broken down houses or mines. An occasional car. Wild life. The loot isn't abundant, but almost all of it can be put to use. You will only find these things by exploring. Combat is as unforgiving as the rest of the game, so avoiding it may be wise. 

There are some serious downsides to the game. No manual saves. Auto saves can be spread minutes apart, so that victory over the wolf that has been stalking you may be undone if you leave before an auto save trips. Or if you die from hypothermia, thirst, starvation...so many ways to die. There are no stats or perks, but skills can be learned from books scattered about the wilderness. As for personalizing your character, you only get choice of sex. Since the game is in first person, this choice only affect the voice acting.

Many complain about the wildlife being too difficult to kill. Simply choose to turn off hostility. There are many difficulty options. A story mode. Several story modes if you want to pay for it. You can choose where the game starts. Maybe in a town if you are new. In the wilderness if you are a survivalist. Or random if you like surprises. 



conclusion

even on easy, this is a hard survival game. Though story mode is possible, it usually requires paying extra money. If you are looking for a hard ass survival game, you found one here.

1. More broken promises to the early early purchases who supported the new Dev to make the game. DLC before finished game. Shame. I was telling my friends to try this game back in 2015. This game was added to Steam in September 2014.
2. Another release with shoddy or no QA. This has happened how many times now, you learned nothing. Remember the Wintermute video format making the game unplayable for days after release?
3. I'm not buying the value of the content added and I'm positive it's full of bugs. So were still beta testing for Hinterlands but now we're beta testing slim expensive DLC. I'll pirate preview before purchasing, wonder if I'll find it's worth a purchase? (not likely)

This has gone on far far too long. We're are talking 10 years now. Hinterlands is taking advantage of their community and need to rethink their approach.

If you want to do DLC, fine, better make it meaty and cheap to get some good will back. I already know these 8 to 10 week drops are going to be paper thin based on past performance.

After playing about 6 hours with the new update I can inform you that there has been absolutely no new anything of value added in. The loot overhaul is generic, there's no real difference. Mending clothes? The same. Cooking? The same. Boiling water? The same. Harvesting animals? The same. Harvesting plants? The same. It just cycles a circle. What happened to the supposed new first person animations? I've closed out of steam, logged out. Restarted, signed back in, uninstalled, re installed. The only difference is there are the new rifle skins. As the rifles perform exactly like the old .303 rifle. 100% condition shoot a deer in the face point blank an it goes running away and you have to chase it about to find it. SO wow. Cool  I guess, now the rifle just looks different. 
There are a lot of bugs. The crows don't show up, corpses don't show up, it takes 8 cans or 7 pieces of deer meat just to fill half your stomach bar. I had to eat 1 entire deer a day to keep my stomach full during the day. By the time you wake up you're starving so you have to go make sure you eat an entire deer lol. The HUD doesn't show up on screen anymore? So you have to go in an out of inventory to see what your condition is. 
So that's different. Unless all these new mechanics are /only/ available in the new regions there is absolutely nothing new here. Fire starting? The same. Fishing? The same. Harvesting plants/animals? The same. Mending clothes? The same. Sharpening tools? The same. Crafting? The same. Reading? The same. Just that spinning circle. 
Really all that seems to be new is the regions and I haven't yet gotten to the new region because you have to get yourself to the area you need to be in order to travel there but seeing how you are constantly too weak to do anything unless you eat one entire deer a day there's no way to get to the area when you're haven to constantly chase wounded deer all over the map. 
I was really hoping these new regions and supposed mechanics overhaul would make me fall back in love with this game or at least enjoy it. But instead all I feel is ripped off again as there is absolutely nothing new besides a new area to do the same exact things I been doing the past almost 10 years in. Maddening. Then two more new areas to do the same exact stuff will be coming out. 
Unless my DLC is absolutely broken an things will eventually start to work I have no idea what me buying the DLC actually accomplished as it has added absolutely nothing but the extreme annoyance of haven to go in and out of my inventory to check if I am about to die because of (x) factor or if I am about to pass out because I am tired or check to see if I am starving or dehydrating. 
Sure can't wait to just eventually get to the air field in order to watch that circle spin as I search or watch that circle spin as I make a fire or watch that circle spin as I pry something open or watch that circle spin when I harvest something. 
Absolutely nothing new or good has been changed or done. 

I have to re write this review of this game. 
When I purchased this game it was $14.99 early access more than a year ago. It is now at $19.99 early access. (Edit: May 30th, 2017... 34.99 now...whaaatt tthheee hhheecckkk??) At that time there was NO mentioning of this game coming out as 'episodic'. I have no idea why games now a days have to be 'episodic'. So, at the time I purchased early access to this game thinking that by the time it gets done I would have access to a full complete game. I wanted to try and help out and give suggestions for the game, but it seems a lot of the suggestions from players are not being listened too. 

There are a lot of things that one can gripe about this game now. Back when it first came out it was really fun and really good. But now after all these various updates, tweaks, and changes. It is NOT fun at all. The organizational options, HUD and general interactions you have to do to look at inventories, your health and body, and other stuff is far to messy now. The original starting was simplistic and nice. But now a days it seems that the developers are always having to 'update' everything to make it look good.

Not only are you NOT going to be getting the COMPLETE game at $19.99, like the rest of us at the other prices it use to be, who knows exactly how much the 'second season' of episodes is going to be? Who knows how many other 'seasons' there are going to be? 

You have barely any weapons. Nothing practical anyways. You are besieged by wolves and a bear that is basically a tank and you have a few flares, a rifle that barely does any damage, and a wood bow and arrow. A flare pistol to scare things away. 

You can't even use your hatchet or hunting knife to defend yourself with. Or use them to attack with. I don't know if this will change for the 'episodes' but it very frustrating to try and play this sandbox world anymore when you are so limited in your way of fighting.

Plus, I have owned a .303 rifle. And I can tell you that a single .303 will drop a bear. Last time I went up against the bear I shot it eight times and it didn't go down. I point blanked it in the head, shot it in the butt, shot it in the sides, shot it in the back. And the thing didn't drop or die. What sense does that make?

And I understand there are different gun laws up in Canada then there are in the US. But why are there no revolvers? Why can't we find a revolver in the Ranger Stations? There are a lot of legal gun options then just a .303 bolt action rifle that one could be experiencing in this game but I have no idea why they can't be put in. (12/06/2022 There was a revolver added some time ago and it is better than the rifle for hunting the deer and taking care of the wolves)

Can I have a spear? If I can find branches and twigs, and make a bow and arrows. Why cannot I make a spear? I use to really enjoy this game. But with every update and change and tweak and things. I am just no longer able to enjoy it. 

The story mode has been promised for a while. Even though at the very start it was NOT episodic in nature meaning I have to buy the other 'seasons'. Is there any real point then, for anybody to purchase the early access to this game? Is there any real point to even purchase it when it comes out? Needing to continue putting money towards it for episodic reasons and seasons to get the entire story?

It's very frustrating to see how this game has turned out and how it is becoming.

Original review: 

[h1]STAY AWAY.[/h1]
DISCLAIMER: This game may soon receive a ""season pass"" styled update system. This is a singleplayer survival game. And they're going to charge you for an update roadmap that's split in a timespan of TWO years. How is that remotely acceptable? There's already been two price hikes, and there's no way to know if it'll be price hiked again in the future.
Please do NOT buy this game unless you see it on a large sale, and even then I would highly advise against buying at the time until the devs have decided on what kind of butcher house they want to send this game into. Don't let shady monetization simply get by and be normalized in the industry.

There's all kinds of one-liner ""positive"" reviews popping up just to try to censor the people speaking up about this. This is outrageous and simply childish to be doing. Please be wary of what's going on right now. Censorship is NOT the way to go.
The shilling has become so intense that negative reviews speaking about this have gotten bumped out of view. My anger for this matter is completely out of bounds, and I don't think I will ever play this game again, atleast not in the near future. I'm one shady developer announce away from simply asking steam support to remove this game from my library and moving on. This is ridiculous.
Whatever happens, I'm definitely not going to play anymore either way. Please save yourself the future stress and anger and just don't buy.

Actual review:
A great game that is unfortunately unfinished and with extremely questionable developer ideals. Questionable to the point I can't bring myself to launch the game anymore. I just can't because I get filled with anger at the thought of what the devs might be doing to this game now.

For a survival game it's surprisingly really good. It strikes a great balance between difficulty, realism, immersion and gameplay. There's a few spots where it can become a little gamey, with the ""number go up"" system with clothes durability and warmth/insulation, but that's beyond the point, as it doesn't really take away from the experience.
This game punishes you for going head on towards a serious danger like a wolf, and you have to prepare for any situation where you might receive some kind of injury that might be difficult to recover from, in order to not use up too many resources.

The visuals could use a little more work but it's pretty fine, alright. Not really much to complain about there.
Sound design, however, is fantastic. It's probably the best part of the game, and sometimes the atmosphere can be so spot on it gives me chills and like it's difficult to move forward into a dark room or explore a cave.
There's a few consistency issues with how things are placed in the Story mode, like what houses you can actually go into, the amount of resources, the fact that a certain bonus for having near perfect resource management for the first episode doesn't actually carry over into the second episode, effectively taking away the fruits of your effort, though each episode is designed as more of something you should be able to go through from start to finish without doing the earlier ones, as far as I know.

Overall, this is a pretty good game, fitting of a 8/10 rating, but I'm going to have to take that away entirely because the developers hold little respect for what should be a game that people just enjoy without the annoyances of modern, shady marketing strats in the industry. Two price hikes, paywalled updates starting later this year, for the next two (!!!) years, while the game itself isn't actually finished.
I feel ripped off, cheated and generally shoved aside by the developer, because certain people are happy with paying two or three times as much as they did for any game's base price, and making up for the purchase of multiple other potential buyers. So even if you don't buy it here, someone is going to pay extra to make up for the lack of your purchase.
Please don't buy this until there's been proper confirmation on whether or not the developers want to turn The Long Dark into a rich whale milking machine. With how things are looking I'd have to give this game a 4/10 and a big disclaimer to interested parties.",1651285715,1670306069,False,30,5,0.495322257280349731,13,True,False,False

I've made this decision because my old save file, the game I started after my mother passed away a few years ago, the game I played to keep my brain occupied while I coped with the loss, is being forcibly retired by the developers. 

To be perfectly clear, I am not upset by this. I actually feel pretty good about it. I've seen everything this game has to offer. I've tackled all the challenges and earned all the achievements. I know the nooks and crannies of Great Bear like I know my own back yard. I'm comfortable wandering into blizzards on interloper because I know I'll be fine. I think I've seen enough : )

I'm happy to see the game development move in a new direction, but I don't feel like I need to be a part of that. I hope the new content sells well. The original game is a masterwork, and if the new content is held to the same standard I expect it will be great, but I won't be exploring any of it.

I intend to finish the story mode, but otherwise I believe I will retire the game along with my final run...or maybe I'll get sucked back in by the familiarity of an old favorite. I can't be sure.

Good gameplay with handrawn looking graphics which work well. Its all about the gameplay as you watch your calories, hunger, thirst, fatigue and cold level. Scrounge for food and whatever else you can find in this harsh environment. Not quite like the video above, I explored a bit and never found the shangri la in the video with the hunting rifle, knife etc. The only tip I will offer is that you need to hunt food somehow to survive. You can't live long off old dog food and granola bars that you scrounge. Great game that's a bit repetitive as you search the many cupboards in the many cabins you find.

Something that could be improved is your calorie, water and food consumption when you rest. I don't think it scales down at all because you can die of dehydration in your sleep even if you are fully quenched before you rest. Sleep in short periods so you can drink and eat in between is how you have to run it right now

It's a straight-up survival game, with a story mode, that forces you to explore the world to stay alive, and can be unforgiving when it all goes wrong. Freezing cold, blizzards, stripping carcasses for food, finding matches, avoiding bears and wolves - you will die - often - but you'll have learnt something that keeps you alive longer the next time. And when I say die, there's no restoring games to help you.

The survival game doesn't help you a lot. You want to know where to go? Memorise the landmarks around you so you can get back again. You need to find shelter from the blizzard? You better have a strategy to get out of the snow while you can only see several feet in front of you.

The story narrative is a terrific tale and the pace may ease you into the survival mode later depending on the order you tackle it. I'm eagerly waiting for the 5th and final chapter to arrive when it's ready.

I haven't even mentioned the art, sound and music design. It's captivating.

12/2022 UPDATE: The state of this game is honestly sad. I absolutely adored The Long Dark. One of favorite games I've ever bought. But we've been strung along by the devs for too long. The game will never be finished. The new update should've been a standalone sequel or spin-off to the game. I reckon the only reason it's not a separate thing is because it looks bad to release a sequel when you never finished the first game. 

Instead of working to complete the game, Hinterland has decided to release an expansion that is also incomplete. Based on Wintermute, I wouldn't expect them to ever finish Tales from the Far Territory. They spent their effort overhauling the game instead of finishing what they started, so why shouldn't we expect them to do the same thing again here?

They also changed the save mechanism so the hundreds of hours players like me have spent since this game first came out are gone. Even from a development perspective they didn't even bother to finish the update before releasing it since it does nothing but crash on launch day. Hinterland is the perfect example of the awful trend in the game industry where companies release games when they're only 80% complete.

What's most frustrating is that this isn't even new shit from Hinterland. People have been saying they've been lazy with finishing the content along for years. Turns out those people were right.",1514910722,1670280342,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

The story mode finally arrived after years of waiting. It's a disappointment. The story itself is so cliche, I don't think it required too much writing at all.

Voice acting is only present in part of the game, the rest is just written dialog. It feels rushed and cheap.

There are still a LOT of bugs.

The two episodes are really short, even if you try to make all the fetch quests, which are really boring.

It's pointless to stack up on anything in a region, since you have to climb to get to the next one, and you can only bring limited supplies with you.

I will still say, that the sandbox part is fun, but the devs are still actively trying to mess it up too.

The latest updates had some pretty bad design decisions.

The community has a lot of cool ideas which could be implemented to make it a great sandbox game, but the devs have a vision. This vision seems terrible so far, after playing the two episodes that are available.

Not to mention the other episodes are coming in 2018? If they are coming at all.

I think they should just leave the story mode, and focus on the sandbox part.

update: We got episode 4 in 2021. Wow. The story is still full of clichés and the writing is meh. Sadly the cutscenes are not skippable, so you have to suffer through them. I found the tasks pretty fun. There are many parts, where when you come to a place where you shouldn't be, since you are exploring mid story, there is just an invisible wall that keeps you out. Not a good design choice.
The new map looks nice, can't wait to play it in sandbox mode. It is very buggy though. Floating stuff, missing textures, walking in the air, I almost quit mid game since it was so frustrating.

It has been eight years since this review was initially posted. This will be the first time I have ever considered changing a positive review to negative for what direction the developers have gone with a project still in production.

Eight years ago, this game was launched into Early Access with survival and story mode. The game was to become storied adventure of 5 episodes.

Episode one and two came out in 2017 to great fanfare.
Episode three came out in 2019 among a pile of updates to survival that from 2017 to 2019 deleted more of my save games than it ever created.
Episode four came out in 2021 to a room temperature reception and the development teams head honcho stepping down, but promising to work on the story for episode 5. That's right. The storyboard wasn't even finished in these eight years.

Now we have episode 5 coming out allegedly next year...the game is *almost* finished! But wait...The developers have changed the game. Now we have DLC coming out before the game is finished and it is a whole other variant on the story.

Yep. That's right. The Long Dark is not a finished product and there's already DLC being sold for it along with a planned season pass.

This would be commercial suicide in any sane development cycle. 

Do I recommend The Long Dark? Yes, but don't buy it expecting an ending to come.

I have nearly 1k hours before the DLC update, and I'll probably log at least another 2k over the next few years.

This game is not fast paced in the way that shooters are. But if you think it's slow, it's just because you don't know what to be weary of: everything.

This game was frustrating as heck to play at first. Death after death got me heated, and I became scared to venture out when I did play. But eventually, you grow as a player. That or you put the game away and never look back.

That feeling though, it was as if the game was telling me I wasn't good enough. I felt a challenge that so many games today fail to deliver. It took me not 100 hours to master, and not even 1000. I'm still learning tons of things about this game, even on the hardest custom difficulties that I play on today.

If you're someone who can face a challenge head on, and use each mistake (that likely leads to a death) as a chance to grow and improve - then you'll get your moneys worth out of this game.

Stroll through a peaceful winter wonderland on the pilgrim difficulty level, run headfirst into an unforgiving mother nature on the interloper difficulty level or do anything in between.
Complete longterm challenges, improve your survival skills by using the badges earned.
Or play the story mode if you want an actual questline - that's there too!

Yes, getting from a to b can be tedious, but that's part of the survival experience - it's not just an action-to-action-to-more-action fireworks show, it's actually grinding for progress in ways other than just farming materials (like in runescape :P)

The game is polished and has only few visual, clipping and player-stuck-in-environment bugs left.

Constant free updates keep the game even more interesting, and I've sunk most of my 600+ hours (as of Dec 2022) into exploring the ever-growing regions, each with their unique characteristics, key locations etc. into the sandbox survival mode.

Looking forward to the DLC coming soon, will definitely purchase it.

|✅| The atmosphere of the game is great, you start to feel cold right away. :D
|✅| The story is very good at first, it motivates the game.
|✅| It's really fun to explore in this game.
|❌| I didn't even finish the game because the story got so ridiculous afterwards.
|❌| Think of a game, they couldn't get its story out in 7 years. I got tired of waiting and quit the game.
|❌| Walking simulation. :(

To give you an example, and more or less to explain myself, let me tell you about one of the most memorable survival runs that I had.

I had been walking on this road for a long bit. I had gathered enough food, water, weapons, and everything else to the point where I had the confidence of a dictator. Then, I noticed something in the distance.
A bear.

My confidence got the best of me. I pulled out my revolver, and shot at it, and my stupidity almost got me killed. But, I was alive. The bear hadn't finished me off, but it assumed it had. It walked away as I noticed I was barely breathing (3% condition). And, even though I had stockpiled almost everything, I didn't have the supplies for a bear attack.

There was nothing I could do but to keep walking. And, so, I did. And, within less than a minute, after noticing that I was leaving a blood trail in the snow covered concrete, this track came on, one that gave off vibes of sadness, the feeling that the end was coming faster than anticipated. Right then and there, this game became one of my most favorite games of all time.

If you enjoy survival games, or if you just like to feel emotion in your games, then this one is a given.

The Trailer is awsome the game is awsome. very addictive and immersive. you just want to keep on living, exploring and finding the best equipment. This is just the Alpha and i can wait to see what the next updates bring. deffinitly worth the 20 bucks. The game runs smooth no crashing and bugs that i have found must say its quite polished for an alpha. The sounds are fantastic, echos, foot steps and the voiced characters boy/girl are believable and well done. The only negative things i can say about it at this time is that it would be better if they made it with realistic graphics instead of boaderlands like graphics. and more content is needed but im sure they will keep adding. Thank you deveoplers im looking forward to living this game as you are making it just please carry the saves on with the new updates. im up to day 13 and would hate to start again. P.S people its perma Death if you die

8 years later....

So 8 years later and counting down the days and minutes until the 1st paid DLC comes out. take my money! all the free updates over the past 8 years have been fantastic and i would have paid for all of them. There is something about this game that keeps calling me back. The feeling, its like a public holiday that carries alluring atmosphere. I know 8 years ago i said they could improve the graphics, but its the artistic style that actually makes this game. It is unique, its cold and chilling. and with the sounds added its like a frost on your windows, the steam in your breath, the howl of the wolves over the wind. with this update comes to an end of the 110 + interloper save but i look forward to making a new one with all the new content, as one light is extinguished and the long dark sets in, an ember flickers, and a new adventure is born.",1413301113,1670210769,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

This game became one of my all time favorites very quickly. I feel like this game is made just for me. Or people like me at least. I have always had a fascination with survival games, but nothing ever sucked me in like The Long Dark did. This game has all that I've ever hoped (and didn't even think to hope) for in a survival game.

First off, the ambiance is incredible, helped by the gorgeous graphics, detailed and dynamic sound design and the gameplay. The ""cartoony"" graphics work surprisingly well, having just the right amount of detail. The weather effects make for a lot of variation. Regions look and feel totally different in different weather conditions. The weather affects the game even inside a building. During daytime the sun shines through the windows while moving, like in real life. 

The sound design is one of my favorite things about this game. All the little creaks and noises that come from buildings, trees, the backpack, your feet on the snow. The higher the wind is outside, the more creaky a building gets. If you have a lot of water in your backpack, you will hear it slosh around.

The level of detail is noticeable in the gameplay too. Your clothing wears accordingly with the weather conditions. Wet clothes make you even colder than usual, heavier clothes, supplies and the wind slows you down, materials give specific bonuses. You have many ways of gathering food, cooking it, storing it. This is what makes The Long Dark an individual experience. The list of choices and details goes on.

There is also something to be said about the mentality the developers want you to have when playing this game. Survival is permadeath. You die, that's it. All you have left is your experience. But that's great. That's what it is, an experience. This forces you to think things through. Risk of losing progress makes wildlife feel actually dangerous. A sudden wolf bark makes my heart beat faster than many of the horror games I've played.

The story is good and I have enjoyed it, but the bugs have broken the mood a few times. The story is a nice prepper for survival, giving you the basic mechanics of the game. It also helps set the mood by giving the backstory of living on Great Bear Island.",1657824998,1669717047,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Around when this game came out, survival base building games seemed like they were everywhere, and my friend group were playing all of them. Things like Dont' Starve, 7 Days to Die, Rust etc - I genuinely got sick of base building in games. Frankly I still am sort of tired of that. However, I always enjoyed the SURVIVAL aspect of these games. Early game where you are sort of scrambling to not die, just scraping by, every resource you gather up being like gold - those are the parts of the game I enjoy.

The Long Dark found a niche in games that really feels (and still does) unique - I get to enjoy the scavenging and survival aspects, without the total bore of minmaxing a perfectly constructed base in an optimal place.

Spawning in, you're freezing, and you notice your hunger, thirst, and sleep levels falling. You get in a battle to raise each of these and it never stops - the succeesses you get at the game continues check the same boxes, but come about in different ways that keep feeling rewarding. Early on, you're excited to find a house with some soda and canned food to warm you, allowing you to explore father. Mid game, perhaps you've started to gather some impressive clothing to fight the cold with, meaning you can finally spend time outside in the night or snow and reach farther locations. Later, you feel the rush of finally killing your first moose or bear, and can take a week or two at a house you've stored enough resources at making some amazing equipment. 

There is never win infinite loop in this game - nothing lasts forever. You'll start to really need some cloth or leather to fix your things, or you simply cannot find ammo anymore for your deteriorating weapons. Running out of a supply is an enemy - but the biggest will always be yourself. Every run i have had, it's always ended due to hubris - feeling invincible and wandering off to die in a blizzard I thought i could weather, or taking one too many wolf attacks without enough medical supplies on me. The threat of death dwindles as you get better and survive longer but never truly disappears completely.

If you enjoy survival games, and want a solo experience in a game designed around playing alone, The Long Dark should absolutely be the next game you play.",1669567085,1669567085,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That is, plenty of running around in the wilderness trying to survive as long as possible. Initially sandbox mode was very fun and the exploration and atmosphere hooked me. After a while though, it gets repetitive. When I bought the game there were only 2 major zones, Mystery Lake and Coastal Highway and the devs have been adding more zones periodically. They've also added challenges that give you some more to do in the game so there is progress being made, albeit very slowly.

I bought this game to help support the devs and eventually expected a standalone story to eventually come along. I've been waiting for over 2 years already and am disappointed that it's taken so long for the story mode to be developed. Do not buy this game expecting anything more than the sandbox mode and a few challenges, who knows when story mode will be released if ever. As it is, it's fun but I do feel a bit deceived as the description when I bought it said story mode will be a major part of the game and that is ultimately what I really want from it. 

At the moment, it's a pretty game with a great atmosphere. However once you're done exploring the areas and challenges, there isn't much left to do.

**Update - Since my initial review I had put down this game and totally forgot about it for years. Eventually I noticed that there were updates and episodes of story mode were released. I've gone through 2 episodes of Wintermute so far and it's been a nice addition alongside survival mode.

This was all I was asking for so as a result I've changed my review to recommend the game as it stands.  I see that Hinterland is also going to release a season pass as well so even though this game is almost (?)  10 years in development it is still being worked on and not dead.",1465691687,1669566525,True,0,0,0.497345775365829468,0,True,False,True

The Long Dark draws you in and doesn't let go.

If horror or fright are not your style, then its worth a play though on the 'pilgrim' setting or build your own 'custom' difficulty that makes the game more exploration in nature.
   - Story mode is ""task / quest"" driven
   - Survival mode is open map game play.

Play either or both.      Go explore!

The only problem was I was not in Canada. So I didn't get the immersive experience of fighting fierce cold, bears and wolves in a semi post-apocalytic scenario.
Instead I rugged up in the cool 40C (104F) heat and battle boars and snakes in Australia, after having my friend drop me off in the middle of a forest with only the gear I could carry for 1 week. Traversing  mountainous region's for a more authentic Canadian experience while making my way to a small town of about 700 people; it was then I realised that snow, an endless supply of water does not exist in 40C heat and I remembered that I have never even seen it with my own eyes...

Wintermute is a good introduction to how to play. Your first play through in survival will probably be not last long before you freeze or are killed by a wolf, but Wintermute can help you get the basics. The nomad challenge is also good for directing your exploration early on, but you will need to reference maps to know where to go for it if you are new to the game, and some people may prefer to explore the world on their own.

Ive played two charcters so far one male and the other female and both have had a unique story to tell.

The Male charcter got stuck in a frozen river valley after i got locked out of a Dam after leaving it. He wandered in circles for days until he finally found his way out through a cave system using his last 5 matches in the dark. He came across a handful of houses by a bridge and managed to recover from his exhaustion over two days. Setting out again looking for a larger settlement to call home he got stuck freezing inside a car he used for cover when a blizzard blew in. Running out of time he made a dash for it as the car was not doing enough to save his life only to be eaten by wolves.

The female came across a large settlement pretty much straight away and has been flourishing. Stock piles of food, water, top class clothing and a riffle. she has bested a grizzly bear with a last second head shot and is eating well from deer and wolf meat. But even in this strong state she is by no means safe. My last play session nearly saw her end as a savage wolf attack brought her down to 4% blood and bleeding out while lost in a sudden blizzard. she slept for two days but managed to recover. She is now readying her self for a change of scene to a new area.

What i love about this game is the fact that everything can change in an instant and catch you unaware. You have to think and act fast to survive and when you JUST make it through and last another day, you feel like Bear Grylls.
You will be killed by the small things if you do not watch what you are doing and think ahead. wonderful.

It's even a great game for people looking for that narrative story by playing Wintermute. The Wintermute story mode feels like a must-play introduction to The Long Dark, and introduces you to the main survival mechanics that can help you prepare for survival mode. An atmospheric lonely winter area of Canada, this game is harsh at times, but put it's in a unique way. Most of the time survival games are dealing with the enemies. This game makes you deal with mother nature and everything it throws at you. A man vs nature conflict is always a struggle in this game, and really test your limits and determination to survive. Starvation, dehydration, hypothermia, exhaustion, and of course the dangerous wildlife of the icy region are just some of the many challenges that await you on Great Bear Island. I loved the wintermute story mode and would love to see the conclusion with Episode 5 in 2023. The story feels very believed in and emotional. The survival mode at its heart is the true experience if you are up for a challenge. You will learn through many trials and mistakes of what to do, where to go, and how to plan your journey. The blizzard storms are the most impactful part of this game. Every second counts outside the longer you are out the more likely you will perish into the long dark. I can't even explain also how much dedication and support the dev team Hinterland Studios has put to the game and for the community. I've recently looked over all the previous updates, and the videos of updates show that Hinterland are a well dedicated and trusted game company for the community. They listen to the community and try to make the game better and true to their vision. Stay warm friends and please do try this game out for the winter season.

If you do not care about that and want to support another developer that does not fulfill their promises or Kickstarter campaign then proceed to purchase. It is a magnificent survival game though you may want to wait for when (as of this writing) they separate story mode (Wintermute) and survival mode so that you can decide if you want 1 or both at a split price of its original.

As of this review I have played this game for 134 hours. Not one minute of it is with the story mode, Wintermute which regardless how anyone who plays this game feels, is the main game & what propelled the creators Hinterlands to be able to provide what we have today. It is thanks to the original Kickstarter campaign and fans that we even have this game as of today (which I was not). The full game (Wintermute) was to be released in 2014 but got delayed to 2016, looked like no biggie and for the most part fans were understandable and sympathetic. Another delay to 2017, player base got a little more shaken but fine. But Hinterland was very open that they'd be releasing Wintermute episodically which again, the player base seemed to be still sympathetic but more were getting a little upset for a game they had already paid for, and still had not received. In April of 2017 a friend recommended the game to me which I purchased and I was obsessed with it's artistic style and excellent survival gameplay.

Finally in August of 2017 Hinterland released 2 episodes for Wintermute and they weren't exactly received well. Since I had no interest in a story mode, I didn't care. But others did and the outcry was enough that Hinterland released a new version of both episodes in 2018. I was just waiting month to month for what new things would be added to Survival mode. I thought story mode was an afterthought, something added that no one wanted because when I got into The Long Dark, there was no story mode yet. But I was wrong, it was very much the other way around and that Survival mode was the testing ground for features that would be included into Wintermute. Anyhow, 2019 sees the release of episode 3. Episode 4, 2021.

As of 2021 it is reported The Long Dark has sold 5 million copies. It is widely available across all platforms of PC (Steam, Epic, MS Store), PS4, Xbox One, & Nintendo Switch. The lowest discount the game has ever gone in 8 years is about $7. For a game I've poured over 100 hours into, it would contradict my verdict to not recommend this game. Here is why. Hinterland has either mismanaged or squandered all of that money to this date as Episode 5 will not be released until (projected) 2023. Once again, I don't care about story mode and never will. But they are about to release DLC in the form of a pseudo-season pass that will be released in portions that is just for Survival mode (I should be ecstatic right?).

So for a game that began on Kickstarter, achieved its goals, projected full game release for 2014, delays for a complete game until 2023 and now you have the audacity to launch DLC that customers have to pay for? How many games have you played that are unfinished but the creators release DLC? This sets another bad precedent like the pre-order model and loot crates. I loved the game. I'd sing it's praises of being one of the best survival games. It hit me differently living in a place for a majority of my live with many months of winter and so I found it that much more special. But they (Hinterland) have held steadfast and will be releasing part 1 of the paid DLC soon on December 5th, 2022.

I cannot agree with this practice of DLC before the base game that your fan base paid for almost 10 years ago. It is disgusting and disrespectful to those that allowed players like me to enjoy what I and many others like most about The Long Dark which is the Survival mode. Without them, the game would not have reached 5 million sales. The game would not be available across so many platforms. The game wouldn't be. Survival mode, wouldn't be. So good luck. Have fun to those that will support this practice of DLC before a game is complete. And I hope other developers do not follow this practice. I'm only one person, but I will not follow Hinterland or look forward to their next title. I'm done with you.",1669300965,1669300965,False,8,0,0.536682724952697754,0,True,False,False

For this review, I’ll be focusing on Survival Mode. There is a Story Mode, but I don’t think it shines a light on what The Long Dark truly is.

The Long Dark tests your survival skills: after a geomagnetic storm, your plane crash lands on Great Bear Island in Canada, and it’s cold, really cold. Depending on what difficulty you chose—Pilgrim being the easiest, Interloper being the hardest—you might have decent clothes, a sleeping bag, and maybe some matches. If not, you’re forced to look for civilization and scavenge. If none of the given game modes fit your needs, you can customize and tailor the sandbox experience.

The map is vast: twelve different regions to choose from, each varying in difficulty. The region, Coastal Highway, has a lot of buildings to loot from, but beware of those pesky wolves that roam around. Mystery Lake, my favorite, is possibly the most “chill” spawn location. There is still aggressive wildlife to keep a watch out for, but it’s not too overwhelming. Like any game, having good map knowledge is crucial to surviving longer. You could either choose to look online at each mapped region or try to learn while playing. But exploring first hand might be the most interesting.

The animals in this game are sparse. I say this in an accepting way—since it’s a survival game—but also in a disappointed manner. Although it’s realistic to have limited wildlife in this type of game, I think more could be added here. So far, there are wolves, timberwolves, rabbits, bears, moose, deer, and crows (if you want to count them). If you’re able to hunt any of the down, you can harvest them, cook their meat, cure their leather and guts indoors, and craft better survival gear.

The crafting is a little “light.“ There are a few foragables, and a few things to craft, but other than that, it’s not too much. This could be seen as a good thing for the people that want a “simpler” and less complicated experience, but in my opinion, more should be added here.

Watercolor: That’s what the art style is in The Long Dark. If anyone has done watercolor, you would know that watercolor is not easy (at least for me); it’s difficult to get a good consistency and not have a color too watered down—but I digress. From the sunrise in the morning to the sunset at the end of the day, there is always a chance to be amazed, and maybe take a screenshot, before you freeze!

The music is just amazing. A survival soundtrack is indeed the correct way to describe it. The ambiance it adds makes the survival experience worthwhile. Not much more is needed to be stated here, I love it!

Although many people praise this game saying that it’s the most immersive survival game, I would have to disagree. First of all, why don’t I see my gloves on my character when I equip them? Furthermore, what about all the clothes I have on? Where are my feet? My shoes? Additionally, I would like to see some more animations in this game. Still this game is amazing, and immersive to a degree, but definitely not the most immersive. At the time of this review, the developers of this game are releasing a paid DLC—they haven’t done this in the past, but given this is an indie studio and the base price of this game is not $60 or $70, I can understand this. I just hope that they might add these features into the game; it would add a considerable amount of immersion to the game.

The Long Dark does the survival aspect correctly. The act of being alone in the middle of the snowy wilderness can create such a calming effect; in fact, this might be an introvert’s favorite game! The fire crackling and the water boiling as you make a rose hip tea—these all add so much to the game. The sound design is just incredible and it’s way ahead in that category compared to other survival games. Given this, I’m excited to see where this game goes in the future!",1669223872,1669262516,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In short: yes! the game is...pretty decent now! the story mode has improved drastically though it is still mostly fetch quests, but there are now more NPCS, more interactions, and it's more open. some places still feel scripted, but it's fun.
it's still not worth FULL price but compared to last time where i'd wait for it to be on at least 50% off, you're good at buying it at maybe 20% off.

In Long:
Price for Value - 7/10 (was 4/10)
Balance - 5/10 (was 3/10)
Survival - 7/10 (was 6/10)
Graphics - 10/10 (was 10/10)
Story mode - 7/10 (was 3/10)
Sandbox - 9/10 (was 10/10)

It's a lot more balanced to play now and a whole lot more fun. yes i understand it want's a realistic survival outlook but honestly it really wasn't realistic, and now even though it is slightly better there are still flaws in both the balance and survival.
Aiming with a rock has gotten better for hunting Rabbits, Wolves are slightly less tedious, and Deer's are largely unchanged. bears are still awful - if they go through with putting the bear spear in sandbox it would be a fantastic choice.
the introduction of the moose was AMAZING! A good hunting challenge with rewards actually WORTH hunting the moose for. 

Exhaustion gain rate is still fairly poor - the rate at which you lose it, and recovering it, is pretty bad. while it's no longer so unbalanced that you can't sprint with an empty inventory you can barely get building to building in a building populated area without needing to sleep you're that exhausted, it could still be improved. 
Cabin fever is still a problem, though less than it was. no real additions there.
Food situation has improved, including the addition of ""well fed"" benefits! other benefits like well fed would also improve the sandbox mode.

there IS the weight problem. it's restrictive, and keeps getting worse the more items added into the game by the devs that are treated as vital for survival (the addition of cabin fever discourages you to make a base/home somewhere)

in more positive news, the addition of CUSTOM SETTINGS for sandbox was a god send. literally. it has been an absolute BLESSING! being able to set a custom difficulty for me to either have a relaxing stroll in with some challenges, or to improve my skills slowly instead of being dropped in the hell that is the difference between difficulties.

2022 update: this has hardly changed. The addition of more and more items with no improvement to weight management continues to be a large pain, as well as exhaustion rates",1472996384,1669233258,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've played Subnautica, The Forest, and other similar games and while good, we all know that they quickly become base-building sims once you figure out how to get enough food and water.

The Long Dark, on the other hand, challenges you to keep surviving for the entirety of your playthrough, and with no option to turn off permadeath, a single mistake can cost you hours upon hours of progress. The pressure never lets off!

They nailed all the little things that make for an immersive experience; one of my favorite examples being the sound of a cold howling wind outside of the shelter of a cabin. Getting caught out on a vast frozen lake in a blizzard is actually terrifying, especially when you end up back at the same fish shack you swear you just searched.

Story mode so far has been pretty enjoyable, and I think it's a great way to introduce players to the mechanics of this game in a way that doesn't undermine the severity of your decisions. I've really enjoyed some of the note/clue following quests in story mode. I think that this slow unravelling kind of world building, clue by clue, works so amazingly with the sandbox survival type of gameplay which I feel is really the meaty core of this game.  

Would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a challenging but fun survival experience set in a beautiful world that kinda makes you feel like you're inside a Lawren Harris painting.

It's difficult to come up with a better descriptor for the game. As for the complete story line, I won't give it away (mostly because I [i] can't [/i] give it away.) The story has yet been finished (at least, not for us, as of the date of this review.) The development team has only released four of the reported five chapters. Even so, the story has been great. The survival element has been more than entertaining (again, for someone like me.)

I can't lie. A game like this isn't for everyone. What game is? Nevertheless, people who only like shoot-em'-ups might not like this game. Those who feel that require constant action and/or loud noises from a game might not like this game. Those who feel that they need a lot of colors in their game might not like this game; there is a lot of white, some dark grays and a lot of dark (mostly at night, but also in caves and such.)

On the other hand, if you like hunting games, this might be a fun extension off of what you been playing. If you like a game with some excitement from time to time, but the game play is mostly a slow burn (in this case, it might be considered freezer burn, but I digress,) then I say give this game a spin.

For those who prefer to not hear profanity (truth be told, I'm not fan of profanity) there is a profanity filter. I must confess, I am unable to vouch for the quality the profanity filter, for the filter was added after I started my game.

For all of you who are on the fence, just do as most of us did. Most of us watched the game trailer, looked at the price, looked at the percentages of thumbs up vs. down and decided from there. Should I say more? Uhh...the game works well with Linux (with Proton; I currently run Proton 6:21 GE, but others should work.)

For the sake of openness, I did buy this game on some form of super-sale (like 65-70%,) but it's worth a lot more than I paid (as a hint, look at how many hours I have on record.)

I hope this was helpful. Have a nice day. God Bless to you and yours!

very respectfully,
J.J.

****Update****

I am on the fence about upcoming updates. I get that Hinterland could use some funding to properly fund all they need to fund (Is that the word of the day?). Notwithstanding, I am unsure about their direction about adding a DLC before finishing the main story. I have the DLC wishlisted (mostly for the sake of getting proper and up-to-date updates.) With that said, it might be a good idea to purchase sooner before the price increases (they appear that they'll become increasing...hmm...uncomfortable. I am glad I bought it when I did.

Currently, I am on a video game fast. I find this fast to be kind of a mental detox and time-freer. I am feeling more...in the world, but not of the world (if that make sense.)

Until I try out the DLC, which I'd accept it as a gift, if anyone is so inclined (Ha! ...but seriously, I would...) or until they finish episode 5, I will continue to live life and be busy until the Lord returns. Yeah, I see a bit of hypocrisy in that statement, but I am working on it.

Have a nice day, everyone. God Bless to you and yours!

[b]One of the most enjoyable games I've ever played.[/b] So many different moments in playing this game that were so thrilling. Just to name a few

- Ice fishing in a hut with a blizzard roaring outside. Brought a smile to my face remembering when i used to go fishing with my dad and brother in the mountains.

- Climbing up that long rope Timberwolf Mtn with almost no stamina left. Literally was off my chair, leaning toward the screen thinking I was the one actually climbing. 

- Walked slowly around a corner with a full pack to be surprised by a wolf. Took aim with my rifle ,'click', jammed, and then dead. Even though I died, I was thinking how awesome the game was for being genuinely difficult and yet rewarding when you accomplish something.

- Facing timberwolves for the first time, firing my pistol like an idiot, getting bit, reloading slow, took one, missed the second, got bit again, hit one in the head, need to stop wasting bullets, they're getting scared, I ran off, one came back to finish me, killed him. It was pretty epic. 

- Countless times i was amused thinking 'this is exactly what i would have done in this situation'. Except facing the bear, dont think I got the balls to try that.

Best I've done so far is 300 days on Stalker difficulty. Very excited to see what's coming up with these DLC's. Just hope they keep things grounded in reality and maybe add more detail to the environment. 

[u]Best advice for new players: [/u]
Start by playing the campaign on hardest or second hardest difficulty. You'll still learn the basics thru the campaign but the experience of being lost and scared to venture into the unknown is truly exhilarating.

It’s been more than 8 years and the game is not finished. This is a fact. Instead they announce paid DLC. Not only paid DLC, but because of how they’re going about this, by splitting the community and the game in two, they will also brick your saves. How is this in any way acceptable?

From the get go the devs have been selfish and ungrateful in their development of The Long Dark. The community had an interest in the survival game mode more so than the “story” mode, but because the devs wanted to pass off their mediocre fanfiction, we had to suffer from less attention being given to the survival mode, until they realize, after years, that that’s where the money is, so now they’re finally paying proper attention to the survival mode…. but locking it behind a paywall, while they haven’t finished the base game or fulfilled their promises.

Speaking of promises: Yes, those are binding, or at least they SHOULD be in some way. It is extremely disheartening to see so many in the community willingly fanboy over the devs and defend them in every way, going as far as saying that the content updates they’ve released sparsely in the last (almost) decade were done out of “commitment” or “generosity”. 
No, these things were promised, paid for, and then not provided for almost 9 years. How can you have so little self respect, that you change your perception of reality to bend yourself backwards in defense of people who genuinely don’t give a damn about you?

Because let’s be honest: Devs who actively censor your reviews, your forum posts and your constructive criticism, take your money for years and slack off on their job, use your money to support questionable political movements (BLM, seriously) instead of developing the game, DO NOT respect you in any way.
And such devs should not be supported, in my humble opinion.

It’s difficult to be negative about something you like, that much I understand. I like the core gameplay of the Long Dark. I enjoy the aesthetic and the mechanics, even though I have gripes with a lot of them. The game is of decent quality, despite being unfinished. But when you compile all of these facts, it becomes difficult to overlook the future of the game. 

Which seems to be a long dark path ahead.

Months of narrowly escaping the wolfpack.  Months of living on the verge of freezing to death.  
Food was always a challenge.  The harsh climate does not just hand out resources to those who stand unprepared.

As time passed you were able to learn the ways of the mountains.
You felt secure in your humble spot in this world, almost as if you deserved to be here.

Now months later, wrapped in animal skins, holding a bow that you handcrafted, a belly full of wild game and a cup of tea in hand, you set out on another venture into the wilds.

That was the day.  That was the day you fell through the ice, that was the day the bear finally caught up to you, that was the day of your death.

When I have recommended The Long Dark to others they have had a really hard time initially, until I told them to treat it more like real life and less like a video game All of a sudden things started clicking together. from the way to start fires to harvesting resources. Not having every action pop up on a HUD telling you what to do or where to go makes it very challenging at first, yet so very rewarding as you progress. Not having a detailed map that you can follow makes it easy to get lost and die, yet makes each new area absolutely terrifying and exhilarating to enter, even for experienced players. Every time Hinterland adds a new area, I jump back to the game and search it out with a brand new players excitement. That can not be said for most any other game.

I admit, I do not find the game as much of a challenge or as exciting as I used to, now that I know the maps well and understand all of the system and how best to use it, but getting to this point took me hundreds of hours of play, all of which was an amazing and immersive experience. 

Even now after well over a thousand hours in I still love just starting up The Long Dark, just to walk around and savor the beauty that the artistic style creates. It is hard not to take a moment even while freezing to death, to just look up and watch the Aurora hum across the sky or watch a sunset seemingly set the forest on fire. The music only complements the beauty and inspires you ever onward. The immersion is amazing, I and others have specifically played on the hottest of days, because the world is so engrossing you actually will feel cold when playing.

A final Note:
While playing the story mode is enjoyable in its own right and very useful to first time players. The best part of the game is and will always be Survival Mode. You may not be able to win, but the story created of how you survived and finally died will stay with you as you inevitably start up another survival run and seek to outlast or outperform your previous attempts.",1666306556,1668664175,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The thing I appreciate the most about this game is how they made everything look like it belongs. In most (if not all other) games you can really tell you can pick up a thing laying on the ground because it looks just a little bit off. In the Long Dark however everything looks like it is supposed to be there. You could really need to know where and how to look to efficiently loot and survive.

There are 3 things I personally would change simply for logical reasons :: 

1) Make a second (inferior) type of arrowhead from stones that cannot be salvaged from arrows. Maybe not great for taking out a deer/wolf with anything other than a headshot. Body shots would do less damage and allow the animal to run further before dying. In a survival situation you don't even need a hardened arrowhead, a sharp stick will take out a rabbit/bird just fine.

2) Whetstones either need to last WAY longer, provide some alternate method to sharpen blades, or/and allow a type of whetstone (a sharpening stone/block) to be crafted. Take a bit of scrap metal and some stones to craft one.
2.1) Alternatively allow large bones to be taken from creatures and those can be crafted into rudimentary tools/arrowheads.

3) Allow us to remove all the clutter from the houses. I can kill a wolf with my bare hands (and a knife) but I can't move a few cups or a stack of plates? This throws my OCD into overdrive.

Overall it is a 10/10 experience that IMO everyone should try at least once or twice.

Lastly I will my favorite tip I learned. When cooking fish make sure to have a jerrycan (which you should never let get to empty as that will destroy it) in your inventory so you get oil for your lanterns.",1668656912,1668656912,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yes, it is ""realistic"", with the game's world design. Yes, it's ""realistic"" with how the gameplay functions are similar to outback survival. But the game transcends that, in some difficult-to-express way. When you're out in the The Long Dark'S wilderness, it FEELS like the wilderness. 

What makes this game so great to me is how it takes it's time. The most realistic part on this experience to me is that its slow. Hiking is slow. surviving is slow. life is slow. This takes it's time, in the right way. Not with grind-y elements or back-and-forth journeys, but with a respect and reverence for it's source material of exploration and personal adventure. The game does not encourage you to spend your time sightseeing, much the opposite in fact, as every second spent alive is one second closer to your death. But every time I came upon a vista, I stared, I enjoy walking in this game, I don't feel the need to sprint everywhere, as just being alongside the wilderness just feels... right, in a way being out in real forests do. The watercolor-based art direction and breathtaking soundtrack are both inspiring together, and for someone who does not take screenshots frequently, I find myself hammering my F12 button more than I'd like to admit, with how picturesque the game looks, not just in stereotypical vistas, but of the house I'm living in, a deer I'm tracking, a tree in a snowdrift, or a boulder in the moonlight.

Pros:
lovely music
very immersive gameplay
true canadian game (they have ketchup chips and maple syrup)
the story is very interactive with lots of smaller cutscenes that make it much more entertaining
although the game is old the devs are still working on it witch is really impressive
the health/condition system is actually really smart, instead of just dying in 3 seconds once you start starving or something it actually takes time and lowers your condition
huge replayability, each death teaches you something new

Cons:
traveling is kind of slow because your stamina comes back slowly 
unlike traditional survival games there is no base building (although you can pick a building as your base and leave your stuff there)
once you figure everything out about the game it becomes kind of repetitive, but there are challenge modes to counter this and higher difficulties
total playtime of the story (in my case) is around 8-12hrs so far hopefully more to come though

conclusion
this game is well worth the money and aboslutely amazing, its not perfect and there are a few small things to complain about but nothing is perfect and they honestly dont eve bother me anymore. 10/10 buy this game",1631397363,1668403213,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

If it is, i'll definitely change the review.

This is only for the campaign as I haven't sunk a decent amount of time into survival yet, the story is trash, the wolves are merciless, and I hate the mechanic that makes your clothes wet as it snows, I work outdoors and can tell you that snow doesn't make you dripping wet, unless you're rolling in it maybe.  It doesn't sound like i enjoyed the game much but I honestly did except maybe the currently last episode.  The inmates are OP and yet dumb as fuck,  How do i barely make it almost suffocating but they have no issues with absolutely anything AND their electricity works flawlessly somehow powering many searchlights flawlessly but my flashlight can't match the constant light output of a burning log.  Yet they are seemingly inept and completely unable to open a set of doors with said power and sometimes they have guns, but not in the next scene.

The survival mechanics are tuned well and you can ~mostly avoid the wolves if you have to and provided you have any visibility.  The graphics are a bit like playing in a painting, a very basic colour palette but everything is well detailed and it all meshes together nicely with the vibrant aurora.   It is a bit heavy to run with everything cranked up though with really no big pay off, ultra is not much different from medium.

I find the wildlife to be a bit too hostile considering how well everything else works survival wise, moose shouldn't charge you from 300 metres, and if you fire a shot at a wolf they just keep coming, bears too but they're pretty scarce so w/e.  6.5/10",1668383865,1668384939,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Episode 1[/b]: Very slow one, you are very limited in weapons compared to any other episode so wolves seem like much more of a threat (very good thing), it's mysterious and characters are decent but there isnt any side content, there is barely any action and with that no cool things to find so just walking and picking stuff up may feel boring...

[b] Episode 2[/b]: Much more cinematic episode, you get rifle with a shit ton of ammo (i had like 30 rifle rounds left after defeating bear) in this one but enviroment is way more dangerous - more ropes to climb, longer distances to travel. Its much better episode with many mechanics added exclusive to wintermute but its also too stretched out for my liking.[b](8/10) [/b]
[b] Episode 3[/b]: More weapons, more interesting side content, some actual characters - it seems like an improvement but its the worst episode in my opinion, there is no mystery, map is way too big and two main objectives are to bring 3(!!!) survivors from 3 borders of the huge map to the church and not only do they slow down your movement speed but they also need water and will need to be heated up from time to time (they get cold way faster than player). The second objective is to get some of almost every single kind of item from the game. I really didnt like that one. [b](5/10) [/b]
[b] Episode 4[/b]: Absolute banger of an episode, short one but it's really dense - great side content, much more varied and closer to the paths you usually would take, main quests got AAA treatment - a lot of cutscenes and scripted action scenes, it took them long but prison escape scene is really spectacular. There are also puzzles, pipes one is great, coal mine one is horrible (at least its really short). There was also one with stash that you had to use signs and blinking lights to solve but it took me 20 seconds to open the lock without knowing the answer, seemed cool but i just didnt care to go back to look at the signs.

Story and voice acting very good. Interface easy to understand and use. I do like the chapters switching characters and seeing each side of the story and how they start to converge. 

Most of the missions are enjoyable and not too challenging although the tracking back and forth from one side of the map to the other then back again did get a little tedious at times. 

I bought this a long time ago to support the dev as it looked like a promising title. It was only seeing the new DLC advert that made me think I should actually knuckle down and play the game, assuming it was now complete.  How gutted was I to find it is still not finished after all this time. I really don’t get the logic of the devs on this one, unless it is purely one of greed. It makes a mockery of Early Access, a tag which has been removed from the game I notice also suggesting it’s a fully finished product. 

Not sure I will return to finish the game if and when final episode is delivered.  I certainly will not be buying the DLC, I mean who would having read several books in a series, decide to skip one (already paid for) and then buy and read the next….. It makes no sense.

I have been an owner of this game on one account or another since it came out. The literal week of launch I was hooked. I starved to death all the time, was eaten by wolves, ran out of water, and got caught in blizzards.

I even died a number of times in the game's beginning interactive scene which has since been turned into a cut-scene where you don't have to yank the piece of plane out of your hand, taking damage if you mess up. I yelled at this game, rage quit a number of times and even took whole other game breaks from it. 

But I never stopped playing it. Every tiny victory means something in this game. Surviving the night, finding food, crafting weapons and medicine, each and every one of these things felt justly deserved when I accomplished it. The Long Dark does NOT hold your hand, it does not treat you kindly or fairly. It contains an certain piece of gaming soul that is unforgiving, rewarding and if you love games like this, absolutely ENTHRALLING.

It's a brutally hard survival game, depending on your settings. I have played this game since 2015 and it's simply amazing how much the devs have continued to support it. Honestly, I sometimes feel bad for the fact that I paid $20 or something and keep getting new stuff for free. I'm definitely going to support them by buying the DLC. All of their pricing policies have been more than fair. The reason my hours are low-ish is because of all the updates. I'm always waiting for the finished product before I get too deep.

I think that it's a good problem to have when there's a solid game and the main thing fans want is just more of your product. Thankfully, more is what customers get. Yes, updates can be slow, but the studio is small and states that they try to maintain their employee's health and rights, which is a nice change. Consider other studios who worked their people to the bone and still released a bad product. As with any game: never buy something on a promise. With TLD, I think it's definitely worth your money in its current state though. (unless you're just in it for the story.)

I recommend treating this game as an immersive experience. Don't listen to music or podcasts. I suggest going in relatively blind. Just experience the game as the story pitches it: as someone who crash landed in a foreign land. I enjoy sandbox for the solo experience, but someday I'll give the story a solid go. 

I can't wait to see what other stuff Hinterland makes. I'm really hoping for a sequel with seasons, or something.

I quickly became immersed. The game's mechanics are relatively simple. The crafting system is not complicated. After so much time, wildlife becomes predictable. Certain animals can only spawn in certain locations. Some days you just get stuck inside breaking down boxes and shelves to collect extra resources, hoping to find a couple extra cans of dog food. And yet, I was never bored.

I managed to fully explore several locations. I built up an arsenal, learned to use weapons, mastered my strategy. Finally, after 150 in-game days, I took on a black bear and a moose--I killed both without getting a scratch. I decided to harvest the corpses on the spot, rather than quartering. After 3 days I still hadn't gotten all the meat back to base, and I took a lot of condition loss spending too much time in the cold.

I had become confident and greedy. A wolf took me by surprise right outside my front door. I started bleeding out, and wouldn't you know it? I had harvested all of the cloth from my base and transported it elsewhere. I had one piece left in my inventory, but not enough time to make bandages. I completely forgot about the emergency stim I had been carrying throughout the entire game... And just like that, a run that lasted over 100 real hours came to an abrupt end.
Here I am, laughing as I write this, and gearing up for a more challenging run.

I'm picky about games. I don't play many of them. The ones I do play, though, I play religiously. I played other survival crafting games. But this one is different. You're not fighting zombies, raiding bases, building bases, farming or collecting loot for the sake of it. It doesn't feel cheap in that way. 

It's man versus nature. Your biggest obstacle is yourself.  Some resources are finite and scarce, and thus used strictly for emergencies. Often, you are faced with tough choices, none of which are appealing. Wolves are d*cks, but even they are not the real nemesis here. The wildlife is not really out to get you. You can almost always avoid a direct conflict, if you tread carefully. No, in the end it is the cold that will come for you--the incessant, unforgiving cold, constantly chipping away at you.

There are no monsters here, and yet you must remain vigilant at all times... In The Long Dark, you're always one mistake from game over.

The game just looks good...and i guess everyone else thinks that too but it really is!
Like i can not just walk around and just gawk at the beauty of this game EVEN IN LOW GRAPHICS! :D
But enough about the alright talked to death graphics...the gameplay solid like ice .3. heh
its good as in, weapons feel sharp (with the few that there are) the fishing and hunting system is decent, the survival systems (like Heat and such) are nailed down on the head and the animals are the great idea :3 instead of bandits or just zombies :P and eveything is well...pretty bug free, and the few that there are, there way to far and few between.

Bad:
Theres not many bad's but..there are some i can put in here, There rarely are animal spawning bugs where they can spawn near you when ur setting are very low which mine are but i only heard this from me and like 1 other person who has a brick as his computer... so for as i far as i know its just for weak computers :P
items cant be stack on one another even though u can see this is item spawn points sometimes...

Personal Stuff:
This is a singleplayer game which is well..kinda my bad about it but its fun for about...200 to maybe 300 hours but after that you just start to get burned out after seen everything and theres no mods or anything else to help you carry on playing...like i can sometimes find 3-2 rifles a map but most the time just 2 and i have no use for one and its just a waste...unless u dont have a repair kit and ur rifle is about to break but this has never happened to me because you rarely ever use your rifle if you have less then 5 bullets...which most the time i have like even less but this part isnt important so dont need to this this :/

But yeah this is it :3 i hope u found meh review helpful and i hope you enjoy the long winter ahead of you!

So this is a recommend, but with caveats. It's one of those strange games that I absolutely love some of the time and think 'this is a slot' at others. Wintermute suffers primarily from being a bolt on to how the game was designed, i.e. with survival in mind. This largely comes down to inventory management.

Inventory management in all survival games is designed to be a delicate thing to balance, but this is especially true in the Long Dark. The problem is that in Survival you can create bases where you leave things, so you don't need to carry everything around all the time. In Wintermute though the story moves on, and if you aren't carrying something you can lose it. As a result rather than having a stocked base you are encouraged to carry everything with you as you lose access to any previous caches. It doesn't help that not all inventory increasing objects from survival are available in Wintermute too.

What makes this worse, albeit realistic, is as you go over weight your movement slows down and you lose access to sprint. This means that you are often faced with dropping/losing a useful object (that you may need , may be QoL, or may not know what its for, but clearly may help later) or just moving more slowly. It's thus very easy to end up going slower and slower as you don't know what you can do without. Combined with the fact that being slow is both incredibly dull and also potentially lethal this really detracts from the gameplay. Yes its realistic - and in survival it works, but in Wintermute it undermines the enjoyment of the game. As a result I'd definitely consider a mod that reduces the weight of some items (e.g. tools) or ups carrying capacity a bit. Don't overdo it as inventory management is important and you don't want to just turn weight off and be carrying 1000 items around, but it can help offset the inability to have bases and the additional capacity options not in wintermute. A second mod I'd recommend is one to up light levels in buildings slightly as by default these are very low even in day time.

With all that said, The Long Dark is really good absolutely oozing with atmosphere and really conveys the sense of being alone in freezing conditions where the environment is the biggest threat. The ambient sounds are spot on, with minimal use of music that works well. Wandering through a snowstorm as night starts to fall with the wind whistling and blowing snow so visibility is near zero is hugely atmospheric. Being stalked by wolves while you try and make it to somewhere safe gets the heart racing, and the various options to avoid or defeat them never feels 'safe' so the tension is always there.

Graphically the game is great, although the human faces are very stylised which may not be for everyone. Overall though the graphics work really well and 40+ hours of walking through snow doesn't get dull which is a real achievement.

The game goes for a 'super realistic' angle. Want to repair a shirt, that will take you 30m or more, you get hungry and thirsty, tired and of course cold is a constant threat. Balancing these is a challenge - if it is too cold you can lose health fast or suffer from hypothermia. Starting a fire to warm up is good, but sitting by a campfire to warm up can push you into nighttime in which case the temperature will drop more, and of course make sure you don't run out of fuel for the fire or you'll be in real trouble.

The plot for Wintermute is pretty good. Episode 1 was actually my favourite - 2 and 3 had a little bit too much 'running back and forth' especially given the inventory/speed issues mentioned above. But overall they were all enjoyable and while it had its dips, overall it was pretty strong if a little contrived at times.

Overall Wintermute was good, especially with the tweaks around inventory capacity. I'd definitely recommend, but do consider those mods.",1668100073,1668100073,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you enjoy the exploration and discovery mechanics of Bethesda games like Fallout 3 and Skyrim, you would definitely find something to love about this game. Beautiful art style, a challenging and addicting gameplay loop, and regular new content for free (up until recently with the announcement of the expansion pass, which I WILL be purchasing). I once heard a youtuber describe this game as a ""time puzzle,"" where you're constantly weighing the pros and cons of staying put vs. moving; crafting vs. hunting/foraging; stopping to rest vs. pressing on. Nothing in this game - no item, no mechanic, no location - is superfluous. Everything has a real purpose in progressing you forward, which makes every decision you make surrounding the survival of your character feel important - yes, even how many crunchy granola bars to pack. And if you don't want the game to be too difficult, and you just want to wander a beautiful winter landscape without fear of being mauled by a bear, you can do that too. The game has highly customizable settings that can make this game absolutely brutal for hardcore survival genre masochists or a (literal) walk in the park for folks who just want to escape the hustle and bustle for a while. This game is a prime example of how developers can endear themselves to a player base. If you like well-made games, just buy it & thank me later. 

TLDR: Even people who don't consider themselves fans of the survival genre, heck even people who don't consider themselves gamers, will find something to enjoy in this game. I would argue it stands alone in its own category among survival games, and in gaming more broadly. I've literally played nothing like it & that's why I've spent a ridiculous amount of time in the world Hinterland has created since I purchased it in 2020. 9.5/10 only because I think the game will get even better with the addition of the expansion this winter.",1667828614,1667828614,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I was intrigued how they managed to make survival itself a challenge without enemies. The answer is they didn't. Sure, the wildlife gets mean but they throw more ammo at you than a COD game even on medium. I started on Easy after the game talked me into how difficult it would be if I had never played Long Shlong before, but I didn't realize Easy meant your baby cousin could play it. 

Wolves don't attack at all, they throw more food at you than Grandma on Thanksgiving and I was often shooting random animals for fun with all the ammo. I restarted Chapter 2 on normal instead. Same thing, I was constantly full and the survival itself was easy. So, don't come for the survival. 

What about the story then? Well, what about it? Its really not very interesting. Maybe it gets good after Chapter 2, I wouldn't know. If you can't gain my interest after 12 hours of play time that's not my fault, its yours. Characters, all three of them, aren't very interesting either. Most of their dialogue boils down to random nonsensical platitudes that sound deep on the surface but really aren't if you think about them for too long. 

Graphics? Yeah sure, its pretty. So is a picture of a flower but I'm not engaged by it. As pretty as the world is to look at, that doesn't mean there's much to see. I like how they include an auto walk button so I can face my guy in the direction I want to go, press auto walk and then get up and take a dump, fix a cup of coffee or do my taxes. Anything more interesting than looking at snow and hearing footstep ADR for the next literal 20 minutes. Travel sucks in this game. Always on foot, nothing to see except some sticks, some angry dogs and a whole lot of snow. If you like Euro Truck Sim but wished it had less Euro and less truck and just had endless wandering, this is the game for you. If you enjoy things happening, then this probably isn't your game. 

At the end of the day, its a fetch quest walking sim. Everybody you talk to needs you to go get something because they're too fat, lazy or stupid to get it themselves. The cut scenes and dialogue are soooooooo loooooooooong. It really puts the ""long"" in ""long dark"". In conclusion, watch paint dry instead.

I stopped watching TLD and keeping up with it after all the drama, but eventually decided to buy it anyways as I enjoyed the game for what it was before wintermute came out. Most the 'unrelated review activity' was talking about how toxic and passive-aggressive the dev behavior is. Which is not off-topic. Maybe Steam should be able to allow you to review a publisher, so there is a proper location to give warnings about it. ""A publisher that does not care about their community if they do not share your views"" would be all that thousands would need to say. 

With that past, I'm going to talk about the game itself. Survival mode, and the challenges, are both super fun and can have tense, stressful situations that keep me playing it. I wish there was an escape option near day 500 or after an extended period. Having to fight a sudden blizzard on timberwolf mountain, or even being trapped by the aurora in the bottom half of a mine due to the lift being powered down, not knowing when you might be able to leave next, is very, very terrifying. There is so much to explore and discover that almost any area could take weeks to explore and find all the secrets. The RNG of the game helps for making every trip uncertain.


Now for the bad. Wintermute started with potential, but combined with the lack of fast travel and how easy it is to handle wildlife in wintermute once you get the rifle, it is a walking simulator. It is boring. The story itself becomes a soap opera very fast with a loose moral/political agenda being pulled over you. Most characters you meet are wishy-washy soap opera drama queens. Or they are bitter and lost souls. It gets tiring in the later episodes. Best character has to be The Trapper, mainly because him being voiced by Solid Snake, combined with the grittiness of his character, was really fun to interact with. It isn't worthwhile to play, stick with the survival mode and the challenges. The Hunted: Part 1 and Part 2 are super tense and enjoyable if you need pointers. They are HARD though. Interloper is just 'Losing is Fun' and some people like that intense of a challenge, where you start with practically nothing, one wolf can kill you, almost all tools need to be made by hand. Luckily only a few achievements require interloper. I think only 'Face the Impossible' is the big one. Fun to try out, impressive to master, but I don't recommend trying any achievements on Interloper as you will be too focused on staying alive.

Story gets a 3/10
Gameplay wise with Mechanics, I only have three complaints. No jumping. Either add jump locations in the blackrock penitentiary or make the roofs flat so you can fall off them. The invisible walls that prevent you from moving between the areas, which can have timberwolf packs that get stuck in the yard/outer wall area are unreasonably placed. I'd understand a steep mountainside, but forcing your character to face that many wolves when there is a logical solution to get around them feels cheap.

Second, Preserved foods decay even when not discovered. They are canned. Canned foods can last for years when unopened. If someone stockpiles food they will eventually run out if they are not careful. Make it to where energy bars and sodas and granola bars decompose, sure. Canned food though? Peaches and Pork n Beans? 

With how many preservatives are stuffed into those cans, there has to be a change with that. Or clothing decomposing while stuffed in a locker somewhere. Unless it is exposed to the elements/sunlight/extreme sudden temperature changes that stuff will become mummified like in a tomb. Maybe have a minimum it will decay to, like 25%. Fully decaying away so you'll almost never find loot again after day 60 makes the 500 day achievement very boring. 

Luckily mods can fix that second issue with item decay. 

Finally, maps. You need charcoal to reveal the map, which can only be done in good weather and takes 20 minutes of in game time. It doesn't always reveal a good chunk either. The Vista locations don't reveal enough to be a worthwhile endeavor. Please add in an item/tool you can find that is a partial map of the region that reveals 1/3rd of manmade structures in a region. Something to reduce the impossible task of fully mapping out every region without dying of boredom. 

If the developer cleaned up their act, and the story was a bit better, I'd write a positive review. If I hear them apologize for their behavior, I'll change at least a part of this review. Owning up to ones mistakes is the first step in the right direction. After all, if a game and developers decide to change their behavior or game elements, that would warrant this review changing.",1667615746,1667616107,False,5,0,0.462455779314041138,0,True,False,False

No zombies, no enemies, only nature to kill you and she is lethal even on Voyager (Normal mode) if you make a mistake. Forgot to pick up your bedroll because you were in a hurry and forgot where you put it? Either find shelter quickly or you will probably be dead. Stalker adds in a few interesting things to it, like parasites, Interloper I've only played for 1 day though that's a bit too harsh for me.

For an exclusively single player hardcore survival experience, I've never played or seen anything that does the job better than The Long Dark. 

If you can set aside a few minor annoyances such as debatably clunky UI , questionable 'sprain' injury system and overly harsh crafting recipe requirements, TLD is otherwise essentially flawless. I don't think there's any need to go into great detail, given the game's reputation and 80k+ existing reviews, but just some headliners......

-Massive explorable map with tonnes of rewarding locations of all shapes and sizes ;)
-Dangerous, dynamic and visually beautiful weather cycles
-Very well balanced and detailed character needs, well scaled to the difficulty you choose
-Phenomenal sound design, right down to your rustling backpack making different sounds depending on its majority contents
-Built in detailed stats and 'journal' system where you can manually track your progress and record your own notes or stories on the experiences you have

The long dark is incredibly atmospheric and on the higher options, very challenging. It provides exceptional satisfaction and reward for progression when you get caught off guard, but manage to survive solely from your skills and knowledge of the world/its basic principles. With that being said its also impressively accessible, multiple difficulties are one thing, but the custom difficulty option allows a huge range of player choice in how you want to experience the game. 
You want less harsh temperatures/weather and less aggressive predators, but less loot to balance things out? you can do that. You want to face the extremes of deadly weather and minimal loot, but without having to worry about being eaten by wolves & bears as well? also an option.

TLD is clearly a labour of love, with its devs remaining committed, transparent and generally very well liked. Even now after all these years, a whole new train of significant updates are on the way, giving added value to an already excellent game.

For the sake of balance, there are only 2 things I will note distaste for.

- Sprains. The game unsurprisingly features an injury system , which for the most part is fairly generous and pretty good overall. The one exception is sprains. The idea is clearly that walking or running up/down steep snowy gradients runs the risk of you tripping and spraining an ankle/wrist etc.(especially when you're carrying a heavy load) The issue is imo, the system's substantially OTT in its detection/probability of a sprain occurring. If I'm trekking up a STEEP damn incline with 30kg on my back and I get a sprain , fair enough. What irks me is that I'll fairly frequently be 10-15kg under my max weight capacity (I.e I'm only carrying about 19kg - what I'm wearing and essentials) casually trudging slowly across a ridge that's almost completely flat, any gradient present would be insufficient to trouble a 4 year old..... and then suddenly my ankles AND wrists just start spontaneously spraining left right and centre. The game tells you that you've 'fallen' but there's no fall animation, you're just walking slowly along almost completely flat ground and suddenly you cant sprint anymore/hold your rifle anymore because you apparently have a sprain. This happens remarkably often, and to me feels out of place with the scaling and balance of your other needs/stats/protection ratings. I wouldn't want the system gone, but I feel it needs a rework.

-Improvised tools: I'll try not to ramble. Making an improvised knife requires cloth and scrap metal, makes sense. What doesn't make sense is you have to make a usually substantial trek to one of only 3 locations in the entire massive map to find a forge. Once there/before the trip you need a heavy hammer (Rare tool on higher difficulties) and enough regular firewood AND coal (Rarer fuel) to heat the forge to a certain temp (150 degrees C)  and keep it at/above that temp, all to make a tiny homemade knife or a few arrow heads. We all know that not only irl, but in practically any other survival game ever made, you dont need a goddamn forge to improvise a knife. You also dont need a forge to make useable arrows..... why cant we just make stone/flint arrow heads , or hell even sharpen up the wooden tip of the shaft for basic hail mary arrows? These overly harsh requirements mean if you're playing on the hardest difficulty, or wanting to hunt in late game on the second hardest difficulty, you are basically forced to take a MASSIVE risk into very dangerous territory on a long expedition for something thats really not worth the trouble in any real situation. 

Rant over. Excellent game, well worth buying if you like survival games. 9.5/10. Fin",1666124272,1667183559,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
305620,124696020,76561198284509938,0,3,8063,0,5809,1705103112,"The Reason I am making this review because of how I personally feel with how they are splitting survival mode and story mode. 

I feel it is not fair to say you are going to add new things at one point and then change your mind when things get rough and charge $20-30 USD for the update that was expected to be free. I understand that it is hard to make games, and games cost much money to produce; but, It is not fair to make a game that was sold as a game you don't have to pay extra for new updates and features and then make it a game where most of the good features are locked behind a paywall.

Honestly If the DLC was not this much I would be happy to get it.
But I don't want to pay $20-30 for a DLC on top of a game that costs already $35 USD, It just does not seem very fair.

Other than this choice that I do not agree with, It is a good game and I only hope that they maybe change the price to reflect the base game's price better. $20-30 is a lot of money for a DLC and I think because of this I would rather take the money and buy 2 games for that price then buy features that should really have been in the game in the first place.

Before I end this review I want to say this: I still love The Long Dark and will still probably continue to play it, but I will most likely be not buying the DLC.

That is all for now, thank you for reading this review and hopefully this will be seen by the Devs so they can see the player's side of the choice.",1667182020,1667182020,False,7,1,0.518415570259094238,0,True,False,False

SO, how is the game just as a open world survival game? Fantastic, it's probably one of the finest survival games ever made. Balancing food, water, resources, and overall health is very satisfying. And it really feel like a battle of Man vs. Nature a battle that all people can really feel. I've gone out for a quick run from my shelter in blizzard cause I need fuel for my fire. Just to be lost and in a panic to die in the woods. The game has been out for a while so bugs and polish is nice for an indie game. But, that kinda brings me to a few complaints. First most updates are very minimal. Its mostly like ""Hey, we added two new items and one mechanic!"" which is very nice and well done. It's just that like wait six months (even longer at times) and that's all? Maybe its cause the work of story mode? I don't really know. And I will say late game can get boring if you can get all the best items. The difficulty mode really helps that though. I find it more fun to die and try again. Another sad thing is co-op is never going to come to this game. It gets lonely feeling sometimes. Which is great for the vibe of the game. But, after hours of playing I really feel kinda down and isolated. It would be fun to have one other person is the point. Does any of these issues really effect the quality of the game though? No, its almost near perfect for what it's trying to be. And more games need to be that, something.

Fantastic game one of my favourites of the past decade, so full of atmosphere, tension and the right amount of cozyness. Art direction appears simple but perfectly fits the mood and aesthetic the game is going for. Its become a yearly ritual of mine that around the autumn and winter months i journey back into great bear island to experience this game all over again with the new features and areas the dev's have added.

There are lots of challenges and scenarios for those seeking something more structured varying from surviving whiteouts to being pursued by a unkillable foe, but honestly the survival mode in itself is so chunky with content it will keep you busy for ages. The game is also really good at allowing you to customise your experience through varying difficulty levels, all the way through to fine tweaking it with modifiers. It rewards longtime play by giving the player feats which are buffs that can be used in future playthrough's such as having a better fire starting skill by default or being able to run more. These don't have to be used but are nice goals to work towards if you do! 

I really enjoy the creative spin the devs have put on a ""apocalypse"" with something more natural and quiet than a traditional end of the world scenario, that accompanied with the beautiful setting of the Canadian wilderness and its a recipe for something truly unique. 

 The support hinterland have shown this game is fantastic. Countless free updates with new maps, items, overhauls and challenges that have kept the game fresh for years.

I don't think iv'e played a game that has make me want to visit British Columbia more!

It's beauty lies in the thick atmosphere and story-laden locations, each telling a story on it's past inhabitants. Possible spoilers lie ahead.

Regarding the survival mode, it is set in the far north of Canada. You must brave the hallowing conditions for as long as you can. There is no winning, for one cannot win in these conditions. Wolves bite at your ankles unless you keep moving. Bears slumber in their caves. In the wilderness, the abandoned remnants of a civilisation, many of it's past inhabitants succumbing to the cold. This is a game based on self preservation, and it shows as you begin to ignore the moral implications of stealing from the dead, killing animals becomes a trivial endeavour in your mind as you quarter their corpses and bring them to your home. 

The story mode itself brings a new lease on life to this amazing game. Following the story of William Mackenzie, and Dr. Astrid Greenwood, estranged lovers whose paths intertwine. For better or worse is yet to be certain. Things go Awry as the mysterious Aurora sends their plane spiralling into the mountains of Great Bear Island. The lose each other, and their stories continue with them attempting to complete Astrid's mission and find each other along the way.

Many fearful souls cross their paths, such as Methuselah, A lone traveller who often provides Mackenzie companionship and advice, often cryptic in nature, as he explores the remnants of a forgotten town. While I cannot say for certain if he will return, as the episodic story has not yet finished, he certainly leaves a harrowing mark on our male protagonist. 

Overall, if you are looking for a bright, optimistic survival game about adventure and hope, then move on friend. For there is nothing hopeful about the long dark. There is no end, no 'you win, congratulations.' Only loss. Only defeat. For you cannot beat Mother nature, only succumb.",1604026039,1666586617,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False

This game has some decent strengths and weaknesses....   I would recommend this game, but ONLY if you the list of strengths and weakness appeals to you.   You will not enjoy this game otherwise.   

[u][b][h1]STRENGTHS:[/h1][/b][/u][h1]Survival inventory management at its finest.[/h1]   Good amount of weight that you can carry and reasonable weight for items.  The game is well balanced for it.

[h1]Replayability:[/h1] The map isn't randomly generated, but items are.   Animals generally have a spawning area though, but it still has some decent replay value.   Especially since you are going to die and start over anyway.   :)

[h1]Smart use of audio:[/h1]   The audio helps give you hints of wolves if they are hiding on the other side of a house.   Crows tell you where you can find food and it has good audio cues to tell you how hungry, cold or thirsty you are.  

Smart time management and smart about how the elements are used against you.   You can find warmer clothes, repair worn out clothing.    Pass the time by stockpiling water or sharpening your blades.   Clean your gun, rip useless clothes to make bandages.   Having something to pass the time is really cool when your have a blizzard right outside your door.   It also makes you feel smart for being overly prepared and being able to comfortably hold out in a hut, while you are waiting for a storm to pass.

[u][h1]WEAKNESSES[/h1][/u][h1]If you fall more than 6 inches, then be prepared to deal with a sprained ankle.[/h1]

[h1]Your character is to dumb to attaching fishing line to a fishing hook.[/h1]
I was laughing my head off when I realized your character needs someone to teach him how to do this in the story mode.   A 5 year old could do that and I could do it with my arms behind my back.   

[h1] Awful AI on animals[/h1]
I could write a book on this section....    If you try the bear challenge, the bear can get stuck behind a fence.   The bear will also begin charging at you as soon as you walk out of a house no matter where he is on the map.  He will charge at you until he is roughly 20 meters away from you, then he will slowly start walking towards you.   He will try to stay about 20 meters away for a few moments, so the bear becomes very jittery when a rock or small obstacle is between you.  They have a lot of bugs in their AI design.   A bear nearly mauled me to death.   I immediately started to bandage up my wounds when i got to my feet.   Within 2 seconds the bear attacked me [b]AGAIN[/b] - while I was still bandaging my myself up. 

[h1]The developers troll the players and they don't like to take criticism for terrible ideas.  [/h1]
There is a few doors that force you into a new area when you click on them.   Now you might be facing a full blown blizzard and you can't see anything.   The door ""locks"" behind you and it seems like there is no way to get back into the building.   To bad you can't start a fire in the blizzard and you can't see more than 5 feet in front of you.   I reported this as a bug on their forum and they had the nerve to ban my IP address from their website.  [u]Shame on you Hinterlands.   I ask you to give me an apology![/u]

[h1]The map designers expect players to memorize their maps[/h1]
It feels like you are forced to memorize some of the maps.   I looked up a map from another player and I had a hard time finding a cave that leads to the next zone.   It is sad that you have a rough idea where something should be and I still can't find it.    It is like they hide it from the players on purpose.

[h1]Poor multitasking ideas[/h1]
Burning food right next to you while you repair your clothes?   Hinterlands can't seem to figure out how to deal with time management.  

[h1]Poor AI for the wolves.[/h1]  Wolves are one of your biggest threats and it is stupid that they just have such a rigid path that they follow.   I literally have seen a wolf do a 180 degree turn and start walking back the way it came because it finished it's ""path"".   You quickly learn where wolves will hang out and your just learn to avoid those areas.   You still will get surprised sometimes, but for the most part you will learn what areas are risky.   Instead of piling a bunch of stupid wolves on the map, they should make them smarter and have fewer of them.   The developers idea of making them ""smarter"" is that they just start running towards you if you have raw meat in your inventory.   They are still the same dumb AI wolves that they had from when the game was first created.

[h1] Wasted time with the new story quests.[/h1]     ""I want you to go look at a school bus.  Oh, you already looked at the bus?   You tried to look through it already?   Well, I want you to go back to the bus anyway.    You might get a cut scene this time!    A pointless cut scene of the bus you have already seen a 100 times before....""   This is a survival game about not wasting time!   You also gets quests that say ""I am to tired to talk....  Come back later...""   So many similar time wasting quests....

A true labour of love from Hinterland Studio, this is a game I keep coming back to.

It has a steep learning curve and can be brutally challenging (you will die) but your survivor's progression is very rewarding.
The unique art style works so well in this winter setting and, paired with a great soundtrack, creates some truly memorable moments.

It has an engaging Story Mode that spans over several chapters and is an ideal starting point.
Survival Mode is where this game truly shines, though.

After owning this title for many, many years and patiently waiting for the game to be finished I see the developers have announced today that instead of investing their efforts into finishing what people have already paid for, they have instead spent their time creating a new way to squeeze money out of people. Sure, I understand that the developers have bills to pay which require an income but they've already been paid and are Reneging on their end of the contract. Considering that finishing the game that everyone has already paid for would surely bring in new income from new buyers due to it's being posted in the ""game updates"" section, this new paid content can only be viewed as targeting already paid customers. With all this in mind I cannot now, nor ever in the foreseeable future recommend this title, nor any future title that Hinterland Studios Inc. may release due to their choice of business practices.",1666328992,1666328992,False,25,1,0.571692585945129395,0,True,False,False

I've looked at this game on and off for a while and was kind of put off by the blocky graphics as I prefer more realistic look and feel. As it was on sale and the reviews were great I thought why not as i do like a good survival game. I now hate myself as I should have bought this a LONG time ago! I now love the blocky graphic style, it actually adds to the immersive experience. The weather effects are amazing and the balance of gameplay is perfect. It really is a struggle to survive. Just when you think you may have set yourself up to have it easy for a while, nature has other ideas. 

An attack by a moose has broken my ribs and despite killing the moose and having a mountain of meat and a safe haven nearby. It's taken me nearly 3 days to haul the meat back to my camp due to my injuries, terrible weather, a marauding bear and losing my bearings. I've lost my cooking pot so I have no water and the fire wood is running out. Rabbits aren't sustaining me and i'm getting weaker despite the pile of moose meat on the other side of the valley... I'm close to death.

Buy it!

UPDATE: 500 hours later I still cant get enough of this game!

UPDATE 2: Been over a year now since it got broken in an update. While they keep adding things to the game they dont seem to be fixing the game breaking bugs. They have a workaround but it causes even more game breaking bugs and so i havent played in over a year despite there being two major updates and some hotfixes. The game, when it works is amazing, but I cant play it anymore until they fix the massive bugs. :(

You can't jump, you can't climb (unless you are at a specific climbing wall) and you will get snagged all the time on small bits of 3D geometry that you can't hop over.  And oh my goodness the NPC's and dialogue!  They sound like they are written by an 8th grader, and are delivered in such slow, stilted voice acting, that I found myself checking emails instead of listening to what they had to say.

I liked it back then, but the game is... well it is very boring. 60% of the game is spent sitting around and chilling in a building which makes sense, but tbh I don't really find that fun (it is the same reason I don't rate Project Zomboid 10/10 and more of an 8).

I do not like the ai very much if at all, the wolves are so unrealistic I can't suspend my disbelief at all. Wolves ALWAYS run from humans irl. They NEVER try to attack them (unless you run from them like an idiot). Not even in packs. Sure they might eat your dead frozen corpse, but humans are kind of scary to other animals. (we weigh twice a wolf, and we stand on our two legs instead of all fours giving us a towering presence)

The bears are mostly realistic in the game, my main problem is their sense of smell being too weak, irl they could smell a human from miles away, in the game they are blind until you are literally 8 meters in front of them.

The 'peaceful' ai, like rabbits and deer are just stupid, you shoot a gun and they run away for 10 seconds before going back to chilling. (I literally shot a deer 3 times with a revolver and he didn't even care, shot him again and wooo... free food.)

Other than that, Stamina. food, and water are fudged to hell in this game. Humans have some of the best stamina in the world and you can barely run 1 block before having to stop. (EVEN WITHOUT CARRYING ANYTHING) We can survive a month without food and even on the LOWEST hunger setting you need to eat once every day and a half roughly. And water is just a slightly more needy hunger meter (the water meter isn't that bad, but it is still annoyingly too needy.)

Overall 4.9/ 10 I do not care that this is a game and therefore shouldn't equal real life. But come on man, this is a SURVIVAL GAME based on a HUMAN. The cold is the main enemy, but the side characters need to be fleshed out too! Well anyway cya!",1665418611,1665608920,False,5,0,0.457872331142425537,0,True,False,False

I'd basically cleared out the town scavenging so all I had left was to spend a while killing rabbits, which was... tedious. I liked how tense it was surviving the first night, huddled next to your fire, bleeding, thirsty and starving. Each move you made had to be purposeful or you could die of cold or hunger. Good stuff. 

But, the second chapter lost a lot of that tenseness for me. I'd figured out how to survive properly, and food wasn't an issue anymore now that I wasn't trying to take care of someone else. And the maps just got bigger. Wandering farther and farther for pointless caches full of stuff you already had. Wolves weren't really scary anymore, I had flares, a gun, a flaregun, no problem. I was bundled up well, so I didn't get cold fast, so freezing wasn't a worry. 

I was still trudging along but then I got to the second half of chapter two, where I had to trek across an entire map, just to trek across an entire map again to get to my quest location, and then I presume, trek all the way back. Like I know Canada is big, and things are spread out, but it just isn't... interesting. There aren't any other mysteries or dangers or anything, just you trudging along in the snow. Which I'm sure for some people is fine, but I'd really like to do something else rather than walk across an empty map for 30 minutes, occasionally scaring away a wolf.

Story:
I made it through two chapters of the story before I got bored. I enjoy survival games a lot, so it takes equal amounts of tedium and emptiness to actually make me feel bored. I initially started the story mode on the easiest difficulty, unaware that it turns the game into an event-less walking simulator. I restarted on medium difficulty, which is still 80% walking through unexciting landscape and 20% gameplay, and made it through the second chapter before I was no longer able to enjoy what little the game was offering me. I would sit through conversations with NPCs, or cutscenes, that seemingly lasted an eternity, and then trudge through an hour of unexciting trekking to get to the next frustratingly long cutscene/conversation. Along the way, maybe I'll see a single wolf and chuck a torch at it. Maybe I'll find a can of beans. Maybe I'll find a ripped up ballcap I don't need. That'll be it, that'll be the most exciting thing that happens during my excruciatingly slow journey through multiple map areas.

Survival:
Imagine taking the only goal pushing you to continue playing the game described above, out of the game, and instead utilizing a progression system that is designed to waste your time. If you're the type of person who can just play an inherently unexciting and unrewarding game for hour upon hour and still feel a sense of accomplishment, awesome. Most players need more than that. If you're going to make a huge, relatively empty survival game.. make it co-op. Give it online features. Trudging through hour after hour of empty landscapes and uneventful discoveries can potentially be made fun by including the ability to enjoy it with a friend or two.
Utilize a character creator. Create a more acute but rewarding progression system per permadeath character. Give the player some way to create some kind of attachment to their character, or at least make it more rogue-like by including a condensed progression system.

My main issues:
1. Dear god the lack of a jump function. It's 2022. No game in this genre and style should lack a jump function. The amount of time I've wasted walking around objects my character could've easily stepped over is ridiculous. This is a basic function of any modern video game. It is baffling and shameful that they've put resources into so many other things while leaving this function absent. Nothing else in the game frustrated me as much as this, and for a game that includes permadeath, I should not be dying to sub-par design in the form of being mauled by a wolf because my hardened survivor can't figure out how to step over part of a fence sticking 3 inches out of the snow.
2. Lack of content. When I say this game is empty, I mean it. There's just .. nothing. In every direction. Making your game map expansive and relatively empty is fine if you're going to include some kind of rapid traversal or fast travel system. It's not fine if you're going to make the player walk through nothing-ness for hours at a time. I should not be spending 45 minutes doing nothing but walking straight forward through featureless snowscapes, stopping once in a blue moon to pick up a stick.
3. Inventory management. You can only hold so much weight, which by itself is a normal RPG element, but this game does it .. just kind bad.
The weight of objects makes no sense, and there's been no common sense balancing done to the conversion/breakdown of items. On more than one occasion, I broke down an item, and ended up with more weight than I started with. I broke the laws of physics and created matter from nothing.
The game is also not ported well to PC, which results in some frustrating and inconsistent menu navigation. This is an issue on its own, however in the case of this game, it's unacceptable considering the game does not pause during menu screens. I'll be slowly freezing to death while attempting to stumble my way through my inventory screen.

Overall, can't recommend. If it was just the lack of eventfulness or content, I'd still give it a thumbs up just for being a decent survival experience. However, given the lack of basic game functions, and the bad port, I can't recommend *most* people play this game with any expectation of enjoying it.",1665161277,1665161277,False,11,0,0.522786796092987061,0,True,False,False

You can hear the wolves howling in the distance and can barely see through the snow storm as you put one foot infront of the other , trying to find some outline of a building or see an opening in the mountains for a cave. You just need to make it to some place you can rest and make a fire.....

The story mode is like a tutorial for you to learn the game and I would advise at least doing one Episode/chapter of the story before trying the challenges or badges or Survival mode. 
The thing is, if you have done the story and i mean the whole story (all the episodes/chapters available) , you have a better chance in challenge Mode or Survival , as there is no map in those (there is in story mode).
In the challenges and survival you have to use charcoal everywhere to put location on your map and it does not actually show you where you are on the map. 
In story mode you have a map and you learn the locations and what location takes you to what location and where all the nice loot is , which can help you make your decision on where to start when having to choose a starting location. 
It also help with the challenges : The 30 Days Storm Stock up on Supplies Challenge (if you know where to go and where the most food would be found and where a gun might spawn , you so much better off)

For Nomad challenge (Surviving at each location for 3 days) - Story mode helps you remember where that tunnel is you must find to go to that other location or what route to take (blind in a snow storm) cause you already remember the way due to playing story mode. 

I think the hardest part of the game for me was the steam tunnels puzzle and the bear cave (where i had to find my way to  the spear and not get killed or seen by the bear , just so i can try kill him) ...sneak here , go into that hole, sneak here, up that thing, around that corner, run to next hole and crouch , run take spear and turn around getting ready for bear to charge you. Sounds easy , but its not - sometimes i just ended up back where i was already.
The steam puzzle was the most hardest one - after 6 hours turning valves and trying to figure it out - just so i can progress, I googled how to do it - dont judge me , at least i tried it for 6 hours first and only googled when i had no more ideas or strategy how to do it. 

The Game is definitely addicting, fun and especially for those that love survival games. 

I still would have liked to make a carpet of that Big Old Bear that chased me over the whole episode and not to mention pushed me in a cart off the tracks -  he would have made a nice warm carpet. 

Now what would i like to be fixed - THE WOLVES !!!
Why is it that after i shot the wolf like 4 times , he still runs to me and attacks me - he should be dead or at least running away dying (Its happened a few times)

It covers all your bases - there's a story-based game, with heaps of content (I think the description says 5 hours worth per episode - I'm still on Episode 2 at almost thirty hours because I'm taking my time and being completionist.
There's also raw survival - no plot, no quest, just live. Except it's more than that, because you still have tasks - finding all the buildings in an area, uncovering landmarks, gaining skills. You still have a checklist to work off of if you need a focus.
And finally, there's challenges, which I haven't tackled yet because I still call myself 'new' to the game. But they're an additional level of content that takes survival and ramps it up by giving a specific additional goals and hurdles.

For example, my first long-term survivor died because my character couldn't step on a sheet of ice which was like 30 cm tall, and got eaten by wolves which were chasing him.

Another survivor died because he couldn't fit through a meter gap between two fences, and you guessed it, got mauled by wolves.

My current longest surviving character was moving across ice, on the thick slab of ice right next to the rocky coast, when out of nowhere the ice started cracking, i sprinted like 10-ish meters to the ground (which looked perfectly within vertical reach, was almost level with the ice i was walking on) when i hit an invisible wall, after which the ice cracked and now i have hypothermia and probably will die on the way to camp.

I'm still going to play, but these are some issues that are just criminal to have in a permadeath survival game.
