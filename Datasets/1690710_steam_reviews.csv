IEH2 is hands down the king of the idler/incremental game genre. If you're a fan of this genre (trimps, kittens game, almost a hero, CIFI, universal paperclips, Clicker heroes, etc.), if you remember old ""Kongregate,"" if you've ever been to reddit/incremental_games: This game is for you. I've played them all, some for many weeks/months. This is the only game I've played for years.

The game has six classes. You start by playing/progressing these classes one at a time, but gradually you end up playing many of them at once passively, with one hero active. Each hero provides it's own buffs/resources/strengths to your team. You need to have all heroes leveled and invested into in order to succeed with certain challenges. There are bosses to beat with your solo heroes. There are boss challenges to beat with your whole party. By tabbing between your active and passive heroes, there is always plenty to manage, and when you learn more about the game, it seems there is always something to be doing to get stronger.

The game has a battle progression system that is rewarding. There are power spikes which automate previously tedious tasks, and create a new desire for new automation when your task priority progresses. There are additional difficulties of each zone which increase enemy level, hp, damage, defenses, and rewards. 

The game is incredibly well balanced. 

The game has a very active discord. 

The game's depth is unrivaled. You just need and want to upgrade ... everything.

The game has unlimited ""New Game Plus"" (world ascend).

The game has a built in ""nitro"" system, which allows you to unlock the ability increase game speed (this comes naturally with progression) to allow you to blitz through previously tough barriers, which will then create new barriers to topple.

I want to dispel/discredit the negative reviews of those who have claimed this game is ""pay to win,"" or destroyed by premium currency. This is totally bogus, and only reported by people who zero/minimal experience playing the game. There are dailies which give hundreds of currency each day, and only take a few moments to do once you get a bit of progression under your belt. There is an INCREDIBLY small/insignificant ""money only"" reward from one of the bundles, which is (not an exaggeration) less than 1 percent of my total epic coin gained over my total game hours. At first glance, the ability to purchase ""nitro"" (consumable currency that speeds up the game speed) is pay to win, but you learn very quickly that you can create nitro as a resource in the game, making it an infinite resource. After a bit of progression, you will have permanent nitro going all the time with no money spent, and the concept of spending money on nitro is obsolete. The epic store gives you huge quality of life unlocks which are something you get excited about purchasing with your daily currency. IU can't say this enough - this is a different vibe from predatory mobile games. You passively do your dailies each day and every few days you are rewarded with a new feature that you get to choose which will help you progress wherever you are in the game. These purchases are not ""double your power forever"" type purchases. They are to automate certain processes which make your life and time in the game easier and more effective. I would encourage anyone who does play the game for a long time to make a purchase or two to help the dev - they've certainly earned it from me. 

One slight downside is that the game has a bit of a slow burn start (first couple days may feel slow in contrast with some other games from this type of genre). Once you start rebirthing and gaining exp multi, the game pace and tasks pick up immensely. Soon, you will unlock a feature to auto rebirth, and progression picks up substantially from there. Trust me - stick it out for a bit.

If you like these types of games, give this one a shot. You won't regret it.",1707678459,1707678578,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

New characters, new possibilities. New systems and revamped systems that are more fun to challenge. Progression is organized in such a way that while everything needs to be done you can focus where you want more or less and achieve the same results. There's probably optimal play but the game is designed in such a way that you only really need that if you want it.

Monetization: I dislike that some things are locked behind DLC, mostly the Global Slot. That's huge. However it's a free game and that particular dlc is alone is all you really need to be even and set. Pretty much everything else aside from some buffs from other DLC is available in game without making a purchase, you just have to try to play daily for about 20 min (roughly, it can be more or less) to get the most out of it. Invest epic coins in the quest related purchases quickly for maximum gains. Once there was a buy list where it had you get other things first, and that's entirely up to you. significant automation and options for automation are locked behind epic store purchases, which again you can earn in game or buy epic coins. 

The most important thing is that you can have fun playing the way you want. And if you skip something for awhile, you'll have a nice thing to catch up on and power you further along later.

It's fairly active in the beginning but you'll run into farming stops along the way and eventually you can automate and plan to let it run in the background and still get plenty of gains.

In a nutshell, the premise is that you ""rebirth"" and do it again, only faster/better with various boosts and gear that you accumulate over time. What took you a long time, now takes you less, each time you do it. Eventually you can even automate the process.

I don't like it. I like idle games, and automated games, they're fun to have in the background and tinker with a bit, or even directly play as needed. But having to start over repeatedly as the basic core of the game feels bad. I want to progress, not rehash where I've already been over and over again.

It's a different take on the genre, I suppose, but it doesn't feel enjoyable to me. Maybe I'll let it idle some more, since I already bought the thing, but...it's not fun.",1659536876,1659536876,False,3,1,0.490217387676239014,0,True,False,True

It is surprising to see mixed reviews right off the bat, even the first game has better reviews.

All the negative reviews are about the ""pay to win"" aspect. Just know that you can earn up to 250,000 epic coins (worth ~$400) from achievements, missions, etc. plus even more from daily quests.
