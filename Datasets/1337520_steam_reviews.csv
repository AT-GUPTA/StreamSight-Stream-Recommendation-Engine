This game has less than 500 concurrent players at any given time.  BECAUSE IT SUCKS. Hoppoo unfortunately took ROR1 upgraded the graphics and then made every mechanic that made ROR1 good, worse.  Maps are bigger for no reason with no more stuff do in them to compensate. The enemy scaling is less forgiving. Providence trials are just bad in every way. Last but not least even the new stuff they added from ROR2 is bad. Artificer is terrible and easily in the running for worst character. The new enemies they added are bad.  Also don't forget to google to see if they changed any of the bosses, so you can find out they didn't so all the terrible bosses that literally just sit still while you kill them, Ifrit Cremator, Pigs, they all still suck and literally get defeated by spawning near a ledge, or become invincible if they spawn in a bad spot. None of these things will be changed, they have been mentioned since release and no upcoming changes have been announced.

Risk of Rain was an ok game, I never really cared for it but I got all achievements

Risk of Rain 2 is an AMAZING game that is super fun, I had a blast getting all achievements

But Risk of Rain Returns... Oh BOY is this game a piece of work. If spending an hour on a good run and dying to enemies you literally cannot avoid because you're restricted to one axis sounds fun, than you'd like this game.
The difficulty of this game feels absurd and downright unfun at times and the providence trials are a PAIN to even play. (I've given them ~30-40 attempts and no wins. You have to beat them FIFTEEN TIMES to get an achievement.)

I will admit you can lower the difficulty a ton and cheese a lot of the game. However the base, unchanged game is too difficult for my tastes and some achievements are so mind-numbingly terribly designed that I just can't recommend this game to anyone who is a casual or likes 100%ing games.
I like earning achievements in games, even really grindy ones (looking at you, Blades of the Darkmoon from Dark Souls 3), but the RNG reliance and brutal design of this game has left me completely uninterested in putting any more time into it.

My rant is over, I just needed to put this out.

For a few dollars more, you can have Risk of Rain Returns; a faithful & polished remaster of the original.

The good: the original soundtrack still bangs. Remastered sprites are beautiful. Gameplay is fluid. New items & survivors are ace.

The bad: only a few survivors a rewarded for beating the game, so there's little to strive for. Most items are locked behind gimmicky challenges instead. Almost all meaningful unlocks can be cheesed by altering player damage & defence. Adjustable difficulty sliders trivialise the game. It's a weird design choice imo.

The ugly: Providence trials are hit or miss. Some are interesting gimmicks, many are frustrating and irrelevant to the core gameplay loop. The final Providence trial is tried to 15 Steam achievements. To 100% this game, you have to beat the same trial 15 times, and it's identical every time (i.e. same items, same levels, same monsters). It takes 20 - 30 minutes per attempt, and most failures occurs on the final stage, so it's a slog. It's also locked behind all 48 of the lesser trials (also a slog). Crazy to me that 10% of the achievements are tied to one challenge which features no randomisation. It's repetitive & boring.

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",1708452823,1708452823,True,0,0,0.412242352962493896,0,True,False,False

The impending ""rainstorm"" that approaches during each run forces you to make decisions on going fast or staying to gather more power to face the storm. Every 5 minutes, the difficulty increases, making monsters healthier, more abundant, and hit harder. Fortunately, there's a ton of power to be had in items pickups, and there's no limit to how many you can carry. There are also further ways to customize your run with unlockable abilties, characters, items, and ""artifacts"" that dramatically alter each run. 

The game is abound with Quality of Life improvements over the original, such as only requiring the boss of each stage to be killed, and a camera zoom option. Difficulty options and adjustments are also a welcome change, providing good spots for newbies to enjoy the action while they learn the ropes. There is also a new gamemode called ""Providence Trials,"" featuring small platforming/combat challenges that unlock new abilities and items. Some of these are really cleverly designed, but also really tough. 

My frustrations are mostly of the ""git good"" variety. Bosses hit really hard. You don't get many invincibility frames between hits, so you can die quickly that way too. Some characters are really hard to play, intentionally weak, or gimmicky, lending themselves to group play or challenge runs. 

Recommended to everyone. You can make the game extremely easy, so almost anyone can enjoy it. Handicaps can even be set on a per-player basis so it doesn't ruin a co-op experience.",1708282915,1708282915,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. Enemies are too tanky. Plain and simple.

2. While ""Providence Challenges"" are a cool idea, many have issues regarding difficulty and map design, and seem to default to Monsoon difficulty and cannot be changed. This presents little benefit to newer players, who would otherwise have a less grindy way to unlock skins and skills.

3. Gameplay is still very clunky, despite the new control schemes. Just please let us shoot up.

For fans of the 2D version though this is very much an 'enhanced' re-release than a true 2D sequel.

If you own the first game you're going to be very familiar with Returns at first glance. Everything that was in the first 2D game is all here just with a healthy portion of new additions and upgraded sprites. It feels very much like they wanted to cash in on the new audience while giving those who didn't vibe with the 3D version a little something extra to justify the re-purchase.

Don't get me wrong, the new content is welcome. You have a variety of fun challenges for each class which unlock alternate abilities, and everything that there can be more of has more of it from player characters and bosses to maps, items, and monsters - though it feels like playing the base game with a bunch of packaged DLC.

Personally I really loved the first 2D Risk of Rain and never got into the hype for the 3D version so I'm happy for more of the same. The enhancements, additional content, rule and content customisation, game modes, and everything else make this a clear upgrade over the original but it doesn't do much to distinguish itself beyond the extras. Even so, I'm having a blast and will continue to chip away at this through the year. If you're looking for more rain it's here, but there's no risk of new innovations for better or worse.",1707869013,1707962543,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And while these problems are adjustable with the damage taken and damage received modifiers, the default scaling which most players will use, is middling up to 2 players, and abysmal with 3 or more. Enemies will spawn in too high numbers, and do far too much damage even given the additional player counts. Yet despite this, I still have fun playing Risk of Rain Returns most of the time. Perhaps not due to the difficulty, but rather the smoothness of the application of tactics with the character's movesets mastered quite well in its previous iteration. This is exemplified most in the final providence trial, which I personally believe to be the best test of skill in the game, and is so well made, that it makes me wonder what excuse certain other providence trials have. Even despite the initially daunting nature of the trial, matched with the defined constants, each run felt like it genuinely tested me to my fullest extent and rarely felt boring even after managing to clear the initial parts more and more easily. It also provided the most close-call moments, and bursts of adrenaline. It captures most of what makes Risk of Rain Returns work, when it does. The ramping dread of dealing with the overwhelming horde that might be possible to escape under the right circumstances, doubly so with friends, is ideally to me what Risk of Rain Returns is, and should be- though at its worst, it can feel like you've stumbled upon a situation which is far too dire to be dealt with, leaving only to pure frustration at the game's inflated numbers, as opposed to your own mistakes. But if you're willing to suck it up, and go on easier difficulties, and adjust settings to what you find most comfortable, playing to how you want to, Risk of Rain Returns does have a lot to offer.",1699498765,1707961037,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One of the big improvements this game offers over the original is the ability to use the RoR2 controls which work pretty well especially with the mouse aiming. Another thing I have to commend Hopoo for are the brand new items introduced here. I'm especially a big fan of Prophet's Cape and Substandard Duplicator especially given the overall item balance here as just one of these items can really define a good run depending on if you try to loop to see how far you can get or by trying to tackle the final level and getting that sweet bit of survivor lore. With everything good I've said about this game, there is one issue I do have and it comes with the alternate skills some survivors have. There's some really cool ones like Enforcer's Shield Dash and HAN-D's DISASSEMBLE but then there are ones that while cool in theory, feel a bit too gimmicky to use. A problem I feel that RoR2 also has with some alternate skills. One other thing I would like to see is have some form of incentive to go for the final level like Eclipse returning with some (better) modifiers to really test true veterans or people who have invested quite some time into the game. Overall, Risk of Rain Returns is definitely worth checking out as a fan of the series and is a fantastic send off for Hopoo leaving the IP in the hands of Gearbox.

Dealing with flying enemies, for example, can be extremely painful, and dealing with swarms can take a long time if you don't want to die, due to constantly having to reposition. Additionally, it seems like it's considerably more common to end up in an unrecoverable run due to RNG or other factors that you have minimal control over. Obviously, both of these issues can be mitigated by playing more and understanding the game better, but I really don't feel compelled to spend my time doing that when I haven't had fun in close to ten hours of gameplay thus far.

I really enjoyed the first Risk of Rain, but was unsure about getting what looked to be mostly a graphical upgrade and maybe some extra challenge modes. I'm really glad that I bought it and have been playing it contently since. If you have not played any of the original I recommend it as a fun Rogue Like that feels different from many of it's contemporaries.

More detailed review
Background
I really enjoyed the original Risk of Rain, but I did feel it had its flaws. At times it felt a little too RNG based and punishing. As such, despite putting in hundreds of hours and really liking it, I think I only beat the final boss a three times.
Risk of Rain 2 is clearly a great game, but not for me. I have much less experience with shooters and Combined with RoR's time mechanic it was just too stressful.

They did not change too much between this game and the original, but what they did I feel had a big impact to make it play much better and remove frustration. The two biggest changes are updating the level maps and removing the need to kill every enemy before leaving on the teleporter. All the maps seem a little smaller and some, such as the dried lake bed, seem much less annoying to go across, especially when you start near the teleporter and have to double back to it after picking up loot. Then, because you don't have to kill every enemy once you activate the teleporter you aren't spending as much precious time tracking down the last few random Lemurians who are back on the other side of the map walking against a wall. This makes it much easier to pick up a handful of useful items and still get out of the first map before the difficulty gets to Medium which sets you up much better for a successful run.
They also adjusted the drop rates and what items start out unlocked. Some items that were originally behind difficult or very RNG based achievements now start in the pool. There also seems to be slightly more chests. While it can still happen, I don't feel it is as common to teleport in and have to walk for minutes before finding anything. Also, the color coding of certain chests can be nice, although realistically, other than the orange barrels that hold the Usable items you will try to open everything you can regardless of the color.
While I feel both of these changes do make the game easier over all, it is mostly by removing elements that made the game more annoying and less about removing the over all challenge. Also, if you do find the game too easy now, there are a lot of ways to adjust the difficulty to make it potentially much harder (or shift it in the other direction to make it even easier).

The one aspect that I am mixed on are the Providence Trials, new challenge levels that the game introduced. I really liked the idea behind them. Stages with a unique objective and set of restrictions or modifications. Many also serve to introduce new attacks for the different characters, which you then unlock after you complete the trial. Some of them were really fun and original and I enjoyed pushing myself to complete them or even get the max possible result. Unfortunately, the design quality was not uniform. The first few are super easy, which helps you learn the basics, but some of the later ones are really frustrating coupling a difficult task with a timer that seams way to short. Also, the way they unlock means that some characters it is really easy to unlock there alternate attacks while others it seems pointlessly much harder. However, the challenge itself is the main reason to play them since, while the idea of alternate attacks is cool, most I have not found that useful, and they all have a secondary way you can unlock them by just playing the game normally.",1707274073,1707274073,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There was a lot of room for skill-based maneuvering that made it fun. Even if you had bad items, if you were good you could handle most things, which caused me to slip 700h into that game.

This game, on the other hand, is a massive letdown. Speaking from the perspective of Mercenary: gun damage is scaled down considerably, so you end up shooting enemies with basic attacks for overly long periods of time. Special and accessory skills are less game-changing and more small damage boosts. This effectively results in you having to train monsters back and forth in almost rhythmic patterns while waiting for their damage to accumulate/kill them. It becomes super boring and there's little room for complex maneuvering with the basic utility skills which don't change in midair like ROR2. 

And yeah, I'm sure as you get to endgame you'll become an unkillable monster of sorts thanks to item buildup. But before then? It's just a chore tbh, it's not fun, and I'll pass. One could argue uncomplicated movement is an inherent limitation of the 2D genre itself but imo RORR makes no attempt to ameliorate this flaw.",1707252247,1707252247,False,0,0,0.434782594442367554,0,True,False,False

The aesthetic aspects of this game are pretty top-notch, the animations and everything give this game so much more personality than Risk of Rain 2. I was pretty addicted to it at first, but after a while it started to feel like I wasn't actually getting better at the game, I was just gambling until I happened to get the right combination of items. I say this after even finishing several runs on both Rainstorm and Monsoon with Huntress, Commando, Pilot, Mercenary, and Sniper.

Here's why I think that. It's significantly more difficult than Risk of Rain 2 and the timer matters so much more, and yet many maps are incredibly huge, which encourages you to get going to the next stage instead of exploring and looting more thoroughly. There are good improvements to many items  that have carried over to this game, and cool and interesting new items, but generally speaking, items feel much less impactful, especially when it comes to damage. To make things worse, you don't have mechanics like scrap and 3D printers to combat the RNG and improve the lacking aspects of your build. There's no proc chaining like in 2 either, which if you don't know basically involves items triggering other items, resulting in huge amounts of screen-wiping damage. With all these factors at play, I found myself struggling to deal enough damage to survive most of my runs. Attaining that feeling of being overpowered and unstoppable is so much more difficult to do, I think to this game's detriment.

One thing that allowed you to combat the RNG and the timer in Risk of Rain 2 was your ability to avoid attacks. Even if you didn't have a ton of mobility items, you would have three dimensions and cover from various objects to avoid attacks, and many characters also had a get-of-jail-free card in the form of a mobility or invulnerability skill that you could rely on to get out of a sticky situation. But if you're not lucky enough find mobility in Returns (which happened to me pretty often), you have very few options. Your base run speed very slow, your jump height is very low, there's platforms but you're often fighting on completely flat surfaces with nothing to protect you from enemies or projectiles,  and your get-of-jail-free card is often extremely lacking, either because you can barely use it due to a long cooldown timer, or because it barely takes you anywhere (like Huntress' Blink).

While I applaud Hopoo for getting creative with item and ability unlocks through Providence Trials (this is very similar to Smash Bros. Melee's Event mode), I found many of them frustrating. The unlock challenges are also a lot more character-specific than in 2, so as someone who hates playing characters like Engineer, I'll be left out of potentially hugely helpful items in my runs just because I don't enjoy playing certain characters (even knowing this I still can't be bothered). I don't like being forced into a particular play style, or feeling like I have to do something that feels like a chore in order to unlock something. (Meanwhile, I've stuck to the characters I like in 2 the entire time and I have basically every item unlocked). Some challenges are also unreasonably difficult, like the Miner challenge to unlock Shattering Justice. This is a problem that I wish Hopoo had learned from 2, with absurd and frustrating challenges like Mercenary's Ethereal and Commando's Incorruptible marring an otherwise great game.

I hesitate to give this game a thumbs-down, especially Hopoo clearly put a lot of effort and care into this. It's absolutely not a bad game, don't get me wrong. The 50-ish hours of playtime I've got out of it is great value from a $14.99 game as well. But that being said, once I beat this game on Monsoon with a few characters, my enthusiasm for it died a lot. I rarely think about coming back to it even though there are still plenty of things to unlock because the runs often feel like a slog, and like I mentioned earlier, the game generally feels like more of a gamble than a test of skill. In hindsight, I think the challenge I set for myself to beat Monsoon was really the main reason why I kept playing, and that I stopped having fun with it much earlier. The fact that a lot of Risk of Rain channels on YouTube have gone right back to Risk of Rain 2 after just a few months, despite this being a much more recent release I think says a lot.

If you haven't played Risk of Rain 2 yet, I would recommend trying that out first. If you've played 2 and you're interested, then you'll get some fun out of it, as long as you understand that it's going to be a somewhat different experience. It just doesn't have the same replayability or fun factor that 2 had in my opinion.",1707095535,1707095535,False,40,7,0.659435868263244629,0,True,False,False

Item balance is bafflingly lacking a lot of the improvements that RoR2 added (ex. Slug/Egg HP regen scaling with level, Medkit healing %HP instead of flat HP), and loot doesn't scale enough for Multiplayer (anecdotally it feels like the amount of loot does not match the playercount), so sometimes co-op can end up being frustrating when one person ends up hogging all the items while everyone else starves.

its an okay game if you are willing to sit through the getting one shot to things you cant see and the abilities not working half the time, but that's not all! you will often die to nothing. i have died to something that wasn't near me almost every time I've died

That being said, the massive bosses can at times seem difficult or even unfair to dodge, leading to some deaths that feel unearned.

Even so, Risk of Rain: Returns has all the hallmarks of the fantastic Risk of Rain design that Hopoo has cultivated over the years. The characters feel fun and interesting to play. The new and ported characters feel look gorgeous. The new Providence Trials make RoR:R feel like whole other games. And of course, the work of the legendary Chris Christodoulou cannot be understated.

The inclusion of vertical aiming does wonders for this type of gameplay. 
I also enjoy the efforts to make multiplayer more accessible. It's way easier to set up an online lobby than in OG Risk of Rain.

The updated art style is a nice touch to. I enjoy how things look more defined and well-thought out than how they did in the original.

The movement and overall game-feel is sooo much better here. Everything feels as smooth as butter to control. 

There is more content to digest here as well. Not only with the introduction of the Trials of Providence but other things like more items to unlock, More challenges, and more characters! 

Overall I rate this game 9/10. It's a much needed reboot to a classic.

Played the OG back in like 2013-2014 with my older brother, still as fun as I remember. This is the quintessential roguelike. You'll get dropped like a sack of potatoes 90% of your runs, but every once in a while, you'll get the exact item combo you need to get to the final boss. 
And then providence will melt your pitiful health bar like a snickers in a bonfire. 
I'm really bad at this game, but it's still one of my favorite pass-times. 
Couple of wins in now, considering achievement hunting.

1337520,153715615,76561199060395963,0,6,2702,0,2299,1705400125,"Risk of Rain Returns is a huge step up compared to the previous game. But in its current state, I would not recommend this game to other people. The game has a lot of good points. The pixel art is superb. In fact, it would not be an exaggeration to say that this game has the best artstyle among other games that use pixel art. It would say that the pixel art in this game is on par with Celeste, which has pretty much the best pixel art in my opinion. The soundtrack is amazing (of course it is. It is composed by Chris Christodoulou). There is a bunch of new content, including alt abilities, new items, new stage variants, new enemies, etc. But beyond these, there are a lot of issues with the game that really ruin the experience for me. Some of them are:
1. There is no quick restart/back to character selection button
2. The new scaling is even worse than OG risk of rain. Now, it doesn't matter if you play on drizzle or on monsoon, the teleporter on third stage will always spawn 2 boss enemies, something that doesn't happen in ROR1. Also, activating the teleporter spawns way too many enemies. In ROR1, at third stage on rainstorm when the timer is around 7-8 minutes, about 4-5 enemies spawn every 10 seconds. IN RORR however, 7-8 enemies spawn every 5-6 seconds under the same conditions. In other words, the game spawns too many enemies during the teleporter, which is not really ideal. Also, apparently the multiplayer scaling is hell, which I won't comment about because I haven't played this game in multiplayer
3. The QoL features in this game are just the bare minimum. No stat hud, cannot access the logbook from the pause menu, no save system, the list just goes on. These are suggestions that have been made multiple times for both ROR1 and ROR2 over the years. One would expect that the devs will add them to their new game but no.  The aren't there. And before someone says that these can be added by modders, no game dev should rely on modders for adding basic features that should be present in the game. It doesn't matter if it's bethesda or ubisoft or some indie studio. The features listed above are very basic and should be present in singleplayer games at the very least
4. Bugs. And very basic ones at that. There are a bunch of bugs and softlocks that will make you wonder if the game was playtested enough. Certain utility skills clipping the player out of bounds, certain skill not working in tandem with other skills on a certain character although it should and a lot more. You can head to the discord server where you will find a lot more of these bugs that should make you think if the game was playtested enough
5. Providence trials. Not that they are really difficult and stuff like that (some of them are annoying). It is the fact that the game unlocks more trials as you finish the previous trial. I accept I have skill issue but at the very least let me tap out of a trial and move on to the next one locked behind it. Everyone has different skill level. I was able to complete the trial [spoiler] hot rope hop [/spoiler], which a lot of the folks on the discord say is very hard, on my second attempt but it took me 10 tries to complete the trial where you [spoiler] play as the drone [/spoiler]. Even now, I tried both the trials again couple days ago and found the former easy. My point is that there should have been a system to allow the player to skip the current trial and move on to the next locked one as long as the player has unlocked the appropriate characters
6. No alternate endings cutscene for [spoiler]acrid. I think it is well accepted that acrid was captured and trapped in the void. With this in mind, I expected a different ending cutscene for acrid, showing how he got captured.[/spoiler] To my disappointment, there wasn't one. [spoiler] I think artificer should also have one but I don't know the in depth lore so I won't say too much about her[/spoiler]
7. Skins. All the skins that the game offers are recolors. I think the [spoiler]judgement skin is a bit more than a recolor but all it does is add 3 dots over the player's head and switch the color palette to make them look like providence.[/spoiler]. I get that not all skins can be unique because the sprite work would take a lot of time but at least make the secret ones more than recolors. There are secret [spoiler] prismatic skins for a few characters that you can unlock. These are also recolors and don't change the character looks by a lot. [/spoiler] At least make these skins unique and more than just recolors. It really feels like a kick in the teeth to obtain a secret that is so lack lustre. Again, modders can add these things but it shouldn't be the job of modders to add content that should be in the base game in the first place
I won't comment on any characters feeling too weak or some items feeling too weak because I am ready to accept it is a skill issue on my part. But the above problems should be addressed quickly. I will change my review once these are fixed but for now, I would not recommend this game to anyone
Edit: Now that I have played a bit more, I will add more points
1. The last and the hardest providence trial is just not rewarding enough. All you get is a secret skin that is again a recolor. At least give me some other good stuff like unique passive skill for the characters you have beaten the trial with. Moreover, completing this trial is necessary to 100% the game. Eclipse mode exists in ROR2. Though it doesn't give you anything on beating it but it is totally optional. The said providence trial isn't.
2. The amount of new content. More specifically the lack of new stages (not variants). How come there are no new stages. Compared to ROR1, there are no new stages, hidden or otherwise. Come on now. New survivors are good and all but you have to add some new stages
3. There are no dedicated animations for attacking while jumping for any of the characters, which is off putting in the case of most characters. This is just a visual bug and doesn't affect gameplay
The game feels polished but rushed at the same time. It is clear to me that this game wasn't playtested enough. I don't understand how the devs decided to not release this game in early access first or delay the release to playtest the game more",1702735417,1705232365,False,1,2,0.485294133424758911,0,True,False,False

I really wanted to like this game, and I've really enjoyed the first hours or so, but unfortunatelly while this game does fix 'some' of the bad parts of the first one (like creating/joining multiplayer lobs) it stills doesn't feel like a 'new' game nor feels like an overall improvement.

After the initial runs, I've been left with with a bad taste on how dated the roguelite aspects are... later either runs end very early due to a bad matchmaking against enemies (especially when you try to run with artifcats) or they snowball so hard that all challange and dificult is thrown out of the window lefting you to end the run just cause there's nothing that can possible kill you anymore.",1705166130,1705166130,False,25,2,0.57644885778427124,2,True,False,False

It is one of my all time favorites. However, I cannot recommend this game in its current state. Maybe future updates will solve some of the many, many issues that currently exist, but as it stands, the game is buggy (I just got stuck permanently in a wall with no way to continue the game) and in many ways is a step back in game design from Risk of Rain 2. The levels are difficult to navigate, not in a way that is challenging but in a way that is obnoxious. Movement speed is far too low considering the maps are giant and the point of the game is to collect items from random chests scattered over the map in the shortest amount of time possible. By far the largest step in the wrong direction comes in the form of how items work. There are no scrappers which means you are left completely to chance when it comes to the items available on each stage. This leads to the feeling that you have no control over your game as even if you collect every chest in a relatively short period of time the enemies will still quickly become bullet sponges who can end your run almost instantly if you make even one wrong move, and you will be making wrong moves because your control will disconnect and lag out at random intervals. It almost happened so frequently that I thought it was a feature. One last major criticism is that often the 2d maps will have some background features that look exactly like they are in the foreground and able to be used by the player and vice versa. The only way to tell what can be used as a platform or a wall is to try and run into it since the artwork gives almost no hints as to whether it is usable or not. This game is disappointing and the developers should be sad with themselves. They went from a great game with solid game play, map design, and strong art direction to one that is nearly unplayable and simply annoying to try and sink time into.

Incredible, if you played any previous version of Risk of Rain, you are really in for a treat. The system is great, graphics are very friendly, and you can use key configs of your own, or any of the previous games. :) 
0 Strain on GTX1070, runs at one or two degrees more than idle temps; :) 
Love it, 
15 Characters to play with, each unique to how they conquer the battlefield 
You can use the levels to 'outsmart' enemies that cannot reach you, you collect so many things JUST LIKE THE OTHER GAMES :D 
There are challenges per character, to unlock their upgraded abilities, x15 - so it's super deep, and you'll eventually work out the item synergies through the sessions.
The one gripe is, it can offer you 3 items, but if you don't know what it is yet, it doesn't inform you with any text... quite surprising , will wait for this to be patched? i'm pretty sure in ROR2 i knew exactly what i was choosing. This game, it's icon/picture only, despite all the screen space available to tell you. I tried mouse hovering over it? standing next to it, choosing one reveals it, but then the other two disappear. So it's a sacrifice when you choose to learn. But as I say, later in the game, this may not matter as much anymore.

ONLINE CO-OP ? I actually need Local Co-Op, AND THIS IS AVAILABLE!?! WIFE-QUALITY_TIME COMMENCES
Basically, you cannot aim in the sky, you are going to be heavily reliant on your shift button to dodge enemies, Keep levelling up, and pick up EVERYTHING you possibly can. 

Great game, setting new boundaries for a 2D platformer, roguelike.
You get logs, you get stats, you get unlockables thanks to your in-game progress. There's very little not to love :? [i haven't found them yet]
You get coins and other currency for every single enemy you defeat, and it's magnetized to your existence, as far as I've seen. Spend the coins throughout each level to gain upgrades, new weapons, mods, equipment, ETC.

I play ROR2 key layout, and love it. Will test with a gamepad eventually, as i shmaaak a lekker sit back and don't keyboard-mouse time, but I'm pretty sure you will have fun.
You can jump and shoot, 
You can use the terrain to hide / be unhittable
But you get many enemies. The longer you last the more swarmed you become.

Level design and graphics are gorgeous to look at. There are relics/shrines/containers to open/Containers to pay to unlock/ weapon assortments of which you pick 1, The world is always rich to help your success. Sometimes you will see the worst synergy of pick ups vs character, but that's within your hundreds of hours of play.

Difficulty in these games are based on how long are you currently alive in our world. Are you really going to get further?
The AI that taunts you is always getting stronger. In Easy/normal start/ you are facing shielded baddies from wave 2/ after your first two creeps. 
Creatures spawn out of everywhere, and some can travel through the terrain in their flying state. Each monster has unique methods of moving, and makes you need to shift dodge and build a habit if you want to Survive.

Normal mode gets harder the longer you stay alive, but it starts pretty slow. Tsunami mode is hardcore, but you will make money much faster in comparison.
Money does not transfer to the next levels.
Boss fights are when you activate the exit level trigger. You have an amount of time you must last while the whole level's upgraded creatures are thrown at you to survive. 

Controls of ROR2 :
EQ - equipment :) that you pick up,
Left click - Standard weapon,
Right click - Special weapon
Shift - Dodge mechanic 
R for something of a combo shot,
WASD - Movement 
Space - Jump

The items you pick up, are siiiiiiick; try to never leave a level without having bought everything..
You should also memorize everywhere you go in a level to prevent missing out on stuff. Some levels will puzzle you.

This is only the beninging, there's going to still be many updates to this gorgeous beauty.

[h1] The Review [/h1]

The remake of Risk of Rain 1, or the modernised version as it has been advertised, does a lot of things right while also doing a lot of things wrong. I am enjoying the game, but they left in so many issues from the original.

[h1] The improvements [/h1]

You can finally strafe while attacking
No need to kill all enemies for the teleport to unlock.
The graphics and audio design are so much better. I can't notice much difference in the remastered soundtrack, but the in-game audio and visuals are fantastic.
New survivors, items, artifacts, enemies and unlockable alternate abilities added.
Better multiplayer system makes it easier to play with friends.
Manually crafted ""mini-games"" in the form of Providence Trials.
The game is definitely harder than the original or RoR2, depending on who you are that might be a good thing or not.

[h1] Now for the truck load of things they either did not bother to change or made worse [/h1]

[strike] Still no way to quickly change your direction of attack, either by double tapping direction key or using a mouse or any other way to do it. You have to stop, change direction and start attacking. It's not difficult to get used to it, but it is bothersome most of the time. [/strike] This has been patched
No animation cancelling, meaning you have to wait until an ability finishes casting in order to press another one, otherwise the game will completely ignore your second key input. Commando seems to be the only one not affected by this as much.
Bosses can drop equipment instead of items, which makes no sense especially how often it happens, this invalidates the usage of mountain shrines. Instead of making your life harder for better rewards, you make it harder to receive 2+ equipment drops. There should be a limit on how many equipment drops/equipment chests you can receive per stage.
Out of combat items do not activate while on ropes/vines. You have to either get off the vine or wait until the item activates and then start climbing.

Stages are made to waste your time. Some are way to big to traverse, especially on characters with no mobility. Others do not have a full loop mechanic, meaning if you fall down you have to traverse the rest of the map to go back up, Sunken Tombs being one of them. 
In addition to the big maps, there will sometimes be a max of 2 chests and other times you will get 3 useless drones or 5 shrines which drop nothing. Coupled with a map like Damp Caverns, which has so many layers and is bigger than most, you will waste so much time searching for a chest that it's far more worth to just skip it all together. 
Still no indicator on what number stage you are. This is not that big of an issue, but it would make it easier for people who want to 100% the game and gather all logs.

Now that enemies can climb ropes, plus enemies that teleport into you and the new enemies that dive-bomb you, makes kiting really important and harder to do. This reaches a point where, you need to articulate your movement in such a way to dodge everything or you get oneshot by certain mobs. Especially on higher difficulties like Monsoon, it feels more like a chore and I know some people like doing this (me included sometimes), but for most it's not a great time and it gets tedious rather quickly.

There are a lot more issues, I will just quickly list a few of them.
[list]
[*] Enforcer not blocking AOE, pierce attacks or even enemies standing in you.
[*] [strike] Huntress auto-aim is more of a nuisance than being of any help [/strike] This has been patched
[*] Artificer simply sucks and is not fun to play
[*] Certain multi-hit abilities do not proc items multiple times
[*] Providence trials are fun for the most part, but some are absolutely horrendous to complete
[*] Bosses directly countering certain survivors, to a point in which you can't do anything about it.
[*] Most items are pointless, more so on other survivors
[*] Stages do not feel intuitive to travel
[*] Attacking, even if no enemy is nearby, cancels certain out-of-combat items like Red Whip and Bustling Fungus
[*] The game is capped at 60 fps and sometimes there are lag spikes pushing it down to 20-30, not that great for a 'modern' game.[/list] 

[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1]

The gameplay of the original RoR is vastly outdated. RoR Returns is basically 80% of the same game, but it does not feel and look like a browser game.
I do like the game and it is surely an improvement with a bit more content, but adding a few characters and items does not make a game better, that's just a DLC. The only important thing they fixed, is the ability to move while attacking.
I know Hopoo Games will release more patches for the game, but some of these problems should have not existed in the first place, especially when you call it a modernized version.

So should you buy it? If you loved the first game then yes. If you do not like platformers, dreadful RNG and learning gimmicky movement, then to do not buy it. If you just want to give it a try, then go for it, the game is rather cheap, but I would wait until more patches are released, before buying the game.

As it stands right now, I give it a 6/10",1701843950,1705035263,False,68,9,0.59652334451675415,10,True,False,False

So yea, if you were a mapler like me but wished for some more action, get this immediately. It was a great game back in the day, it's an OUTSTANDING game now. Good multiplayer, eye-poppingly fluid pixel art, some of the best OST tracks out of all indie games I've ever played. If you wanted to know where the genre roots of VampSurv started, check out this OG game, remastered! 

It's basically just what you see in the screenshots but tuned super well and with extreme polish and thought as to the mechanics. If they could make an ability or character feel good, they did. The gamefeel is masterclass quality. The only potential downside is that it's a bit simplistic overall but I can't really recommend RoR enough. 

And interestingly, just like Maplestory, I hated the move to 2D with the sequel but this remaster has reminded me why I loved whittling away the early morning hours with the first, red eyed and fingers twitching, just like those old Maplestory Beta days when I could get permission to use the Dial-up until my parents went to bed!",1705023911,1705023911,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Right, so as much as I criticized other people for not liking this game, I'm gonna join in the crowd myself. To put it plain and simply, in its current state, this game just isn't balanced very well. It doesn't feel like enemy damage is tuned well, as in it feels the same throughout every player count. The same goes for enemy health. The multiplayer is simply a big step-down from what Risk of Rain 2 provided.

TL;DR: I do not recommend the game in its current state. If the balance issues were patched up, I would without a doubt buy it.

Updated: January 11, 2014 @ 1:53 AM/1:53 [EST]
I've given the game another go since the most recent patch, and...honestly? The game's fine now!

That alone is immediate not recommendation in my opinion. However, that alone is not the reason I'm not recommending it. The side content, Providence Trials, which can hardly be considered side content because of how much it unlocks for the main gameplay, is also complete and utter bs. I'd tell you just to mod the game to make it easier for the trials, but still no mod support. Although there is no mod support, there are difficulty settings, such as the ""Drizzle, Rainstorm, Monsoon"" but also a little menu where you can increase the damage you deal and decrease the damage you take by a bit. The difficulty has been sharply increased from the original Risk of Rain, and I heard that 50% damage taken is much closer to the original game, but this isn't much of an issue as it can be fixed, more like a mild annoyance.

Thatâs over ten years ago, and it looks and feels pretty dated. This is a RoR remaster that pretties things up and changes a few gameplay elements to modernize things a bit. 

As for whether I recommend itâ¦thatâs a bit more complicated. This certainly has some things going for it (as I said in my original review of Risk of Rain), like easy couch co-op, a great stylized design, and a lot of variety in characters. Itâs not a bad game by any stretch, and itâll kill a few hours no problem.

On the other hand, Risk of Rain is over a decade old - and you can overhaul the graphics, but if the core of the game feels dated, modernized visuals and a new skill system wonât change anything. Sadly, I think thatâs the case here. Things fall into a weird hybrid zone where itâs too different to feel like Risk of Rain, but not different enough to feel exciting.

One of the rare reviews where I wish for a âneutralâ option. This is a passable remaster, but felt like one that came too soon, or wasnât extensive enough. If you absolutely adore these sorts of randomized run-and-guns, Iâd recommend it, but for the more casually interested I probably wouldnât.",1704534733,1704534774,False,63,9,0.521206438541412354,0,True,False,False

[h1] Don't listen to the people complaining about it being 2D. [/h1] (What a stupid complaint)

 This plays really different from RoR2 in a good way (but not necessarily better or worse). Characters will usually have an evasive move/attack and an attack that knocks back enemies and you need to combine them with your other attacks to keep the enemies at bay.

I think it's been an advantage to come into ror returns, since they have added so much additional content, including Providence Trials.  This game hooks you on having so many unlockables, and different ways to play.  The most recent game i've played that gave me the same feeling was Vampire Survivors.

To start off, I have never played Risk of Rain and only played Risk of Rain 2 before this dropped. I was quite excited to be able to experience the first game with more polish and more content, so I bought it on day one. But as you can see, I don't have nearly as many hours in the game as in the sequel, yet I feel justified to leave a review. Speaking of, my only direct comparison here is Risk of Rain 2, so that's what I'll be comparing Returns to in this review.

The first of my problems stem from the fact it's a two-dimensional game. Stages are just way too big and/or base movement speed is just way too slow, you just end up doing mostly nothing while walking to the right or left, which also means items are scattered too scarcely across the map. The problem with 2D is that you can't see where you have to go to get items or which ways are just a waste of time. The 3-dimensional gameplay of the sequel fixed this by allowing you to see very quickly where you should and shouldn't be going for items. 
Stages are also incredibly clumsy to travel, with you having to resort to climbing to reach higher places. Climbing doesn't allow you to engage in combat or do anything rather than go up or down, which obviously isn't very exciting. Of course, this issue becomes less prevalent the more movement items you get. However, getting movement items isn't guaranteed (exception being the Artifact of Command), which means you'll be slow during at least the first three stages. In Risk of Rain 2 characters never felt as slow as in this game, even when you have a few movement items. 
The stages being so large is a major factor in me not wanting to do just ""one more run"" like with the sequel, because runs take way too long to get exciting, which hurts replayability - off which roguelikes tend to live or die - a lot. 

Another problem with the two-dimensionality is that at some point in the mid-to-late game where a lot of enemies start spawning, it's almost impossible to see what's going on. With all the effects going on, the majority of enemies being way bigger than the player, and the enemy sprites in general just overlapping with each other it becomes near impossible to reliably avoid damage let alone know what's attacking you.

Items play a huge role in avoiding and dealing damage, but it always feels really bad to get equipment for a boss. I don't really understand why this is even a possibility, especially since stages have plenty of them already. Beating a boss should feel rewarding, and the nature of the game makes it so that items in general are very valuable. Getting equipment feels like a huge waste of time. While beating bosses is something you have to do if you want to progress, getting equipment while you already likely have one doesn't just give you nothing for beating the boss, it actively handicaps you since you could've gotten an item that would at least passively help you in some shape or form.

Providence Trials are a novel concept of unlocking items through other means than just regular runs, but there's a lot of them that aren't fun at all. It feels like they've been made as annoying as possible purely for the sake of adding artificial difficulty to unlocking new items.


While I haven't experienced the original, Returns added a ton of new content, and all of it is of very high quality. It almost makes me wish some of it would've been in Risk of Rain 2. There's new abilities for characters, new items, and new enemies. Part of me feels this could've just been a DLC and update for the original game, but I guess making it a seperate game garners more attention.
The soundtrack is once again phenomenal, with composer Chris Christodoulou remastering the original OST for the game. It has this familiar Risk of Rain vibe, but definitely feels like its own thing and is always a joy to listen to. Sound design in general is very well done and the game always looks pretty.

By the big red downward thumb you could have deduced that I don't recommend this game, and I hope that through this review it has become clear why. For me, the positives don't outweigh the negatives at all. Playing a game should never be boring or feel like a chore, and playing this game definitely does most of the time. The beginning of runs are too slow and uninteresting, while getting to late game is too confusing. While the game looks prettier than the original, and adds new content, I can't shake the feeling it could have been sold as DLC and/or a major update. They're good additions, but they're not mind-blowing pieces of content and thus don't warrant being sold as a standalone game.",1700646346,1704032533,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a stand alone title, this game is great. But this is just a remake...

Some more minor gripes are:
-Poor keyboard controls 
-very sensitive menu controls
-and massive stages that are hard to traverse

Some massive befits are:
-the game looks great! compared to the first, the visuals are much better
-the new content is great. Hopoo is great at adding content to their games post-release. And it shows here
-The controller controls are good (i play on controller 90% of the time)
-Music is great! (Chris dont' miss)
-and the difficulty is very well balanced, want a fun but easy time; choose drizzle, want some torture; play any provenience trail or monsoon!

overall, as a stand along title: 8.5/10
as a remake: 7/10

I own the original and didn't play it for too long, loved ROR2 and expected this to be similiarly polished and fun. I haven't played the original enough to probably compare them, I guess the graphics are updated a little, but graphics are the least important part in roguelike games like this imo. I really hoped they would completely overhaul this revamp some time after release. 
I expected them to integrate something like the concepts in ROR2 that give you more control during your runs like lunar items or shops, instead there are just some very annoying issues with the game imo, like not being able to see anything through the chaos of the late game in part due to the 2d nature of the game, pixel perfect platforming unless you have certain movement items, and general balance.
There are a lot of modifiers to change the way a run is played that you can choose in advance, but I'd rather have the core game be more fun and replayable.

This game is worth your money. This game is worth your friends' money. Get it. Buy it. Play it.

The original version of the game was an indie darling, a cult-classic roguelike that was praised by almost everyone who picked it up. However, it showed its age, and at the time had quite a bit of jank associated with it, from accidentally clipping into walls and softlocking to items sometimes dropping out of the map. Plus, the controls weren't quite there for a lot of people, and the difficulty was too static, stuck somewhere between a casual breeze and a unforgiving beyond belief for the majority of players.
This version fixes just about every problem the original had. Characters control better, enemies are more responsive and more varied, the games underlying systems are more refined and more transparent, there's even more lore. All of it, stellar improvements, on top of adding just enough spice to make older players of the original have to re-assess and re-learn the game's systems. It can be genuinely unforgiving at times, but rewarding to learn and addictive once you do, and with added difficulty modifiers able to smooth out the gameplay experience for newer or less ""hardcore"" players.

[h3][b]UPDATE[/b][/h3]I don't like the providence trials (challenges) much. You have to do them whether you like it or not in order to unlock items that will allow you to have decent-ish runs without getting curb stomped by stage 3-4. Alternatively I believe you can play with 3 other people, beat the game a few times easily and then unlock most stuff since many trials offer the option to for example kill 3000 enemies with a specific character instead of doing the trial.

Putting aside the bias of this being another RoR it would be an excellent 8/10 either solo or with friends and its one of those very few ""co-op"" games that you can actually play solo.",1699473432,1703783933,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The music is perfect, the environments are cool and fun to explore, the lore is endless, rich and fun to discover, and the enemies, especially the final boss Providence, are some of the coolest and most interesting enemies to learn about in any rogue like. Tons of extra content has been added, including new characters that feel amazing to play, new extremely challenging Trials to unlock new powerful items and new ways to play survivors, and even more enemies not seen in the original, items not seen in the original, new artifacts not seen in the original, and stage layouts not seen in the original.

Despite not having played the initial installment, I found this remastered version quite impressive. However, my enthusiasm is tempered by the challenge of dealing with minuscule sprites. When characters require binoculars to be visible, it becomes a logistical issue, as I find myself without a free hand to operate the keyboard.

Furthermore, the consistent left alignment of most maps presents a navigational challenge. Venturing to the right often leads swiftly to dead ends, which can be frustrating. These design choices hinder the overall gaming experience.

Notable new things in the game being moving while shooting with ranged survivors + horizontal mouse aiming makes combat feel way less awkward. More survivors who weren't there in the original + more alternate abilities, enemies, and stage variants adds a booster shot to the replayability of the game.

They have also added a functioning online multiplayer, which is a nice thing to top it off.

If there's any valid negative criticism to have of the game at this point, I would say it is too big maps for the amount of chests found on said maps.

However...one thing that didn't change are the abysmally bad controls. They. Suck. They offer to use the control scheme of RoR2 which is a nice addition and WOULD make people more comfortable with the game much quicker, but you can't aim with the mouse...
I don't expect us to be able to shoot up or something, but I was expecting to at least be able to use the mouse to...you know, aim left and right? Instead, you can't do shit with it other than shoot, which makes it do the opposite of what getting RoR2-like settings should do, they are confusing and counter intuitive.

I could not get used to playing anything other than Huntress because she just shoots whoever's closer, no matter the direction, but a character like commando or literally anyone else but huntress, just feel awkward to control.

Dear devs, let us use the mouse for directional aim. There's no excuse for how bad this feels to control.

Still recommend it tho, good game regardless of counter intuitive controls.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you

and its hard too! working in a 2D environment after playing ror2 is a huge shift, and took me a while to get used to, but even after unlocking all the characters and items i still cant beat monsoon consistently! 

Some could argue this is due to imbalance, (the elite enemies go CRAZY in this game) but honestly i think master knows best so im not arguing.

this remake deserves as much respect as ror2 does as a stand-alone game and idk if they intend to add more stuff in the future but either way im eating that shit up.

The controls feel unresponsive (I frequently desperately struggled to fire off a skill in the midst of combat without it registering my inputs) and are more of an issue then enemy actions. Flying enemies get to shoot straight at you while you only get to shoot left or right, they are also frequently faster than you and their positioning makes returning fire an ordeal, completely breaking any remnants of flow the combat had to begin with. Speaking of movement: the default speed and jump height are agonizingly low and make travesing the levels unfun and the aiming being non-existent coupled with the pathetic damage dealt on hit make gunplay unfun as well. In terms of balance, some characters are completely overpowered, while others struggle with doing anything.

This sequel redefines the roguelike genre with its seamless blend of heart-pounding action, strategic depth, and addictive replayability.

From the moment I stepped into its dynamically generated worlds, I was immersed in the relentless pursuit of survival against hordes of otherworldly adversaries. The diverse roster of playable characters each brings unique abilities and playstyles, ensuring that every run feels distinct and exhilarating.

The revamped visuals and audio design breathe new life into this iconic franchise, enhancing the immersive experience while paying homage to its roots. The thrill of scavenging for loot amidst the chaos, coupled with the escalating difficulty over time, keeps the adrenaline pumping in every moment of gameplay.

What truly sets Risk of Rain Returns apart is its ingenious progression system. The time-based difficulty scaling adds an extra layer of challenge, rewarding both quick thinking and adaptability. The plethora of items and power-ups synergize in unexpected ways, allowing for thrilling combinations that can turn the tide of battle in an instant.

Moreover, the cooperative multiplayer mode amplifies the fun factor exponentially. Collaborating with friends to survive the relentless onslaught of enemies fosters camaraderie and makes for unforgettable gaming sessions.

While the game maintains its challenging nature, it never feels unfair. Each defeat only fuels the desire to jump back in, armed with newfound knowledge and strategies.

In conclusion, Risk of Rain Returns is a triumphant continuation of a beloved series, offering an electrifying and endlessly entertaining experience for both solo adventurers and co-op enthusiasts. With its seamless gameplay mechanics, diverse content, and addictive nature, this title stands tall as a must-play for anyone seeking a thrilling, replayable adventure.

Also the providence trails are completely shit, ror is not a precision platformer and these challenges act like it is, it wouldnt bother me so much if they were challenges for fun but some really good items are locked behind them and they are fucking infuriating at times.

Edit: They released the update to let you fire in the direction of where your mouse is and i can safely say it makes a huge difference to the gameplay, you have a lot more control over your character.

Some survivors are very hard on monsoon (hard) difficulty, while others are so easy you might catch yourself daydream while playing because it requires no concentration. This alone makes it not recommendable.
One big aspect is unlocking items, other playable characters and such things. Most of these are alright, more or less complex or difficult to unlock. But some of them are actually horrible. Without guides online I would not even have a single clue to unlock some of this stuff. 
Another big aspect is movement, especially in the ""trials"". Which are probably the worst kind of content I've seen in a modern game. I can excuse bad mechanics or some bad movement options (climbing, huntress second utility etc.), but these trials are semi optional and unnecessarily hard and unpleasant to play, let alone master in a given time limit. Sadly most die hard fans will just say ""git gud"", thankfully you will rarely see these kinds of people in online mode. 

Some other problems are horrendous visual clutter, boring soundtrack (purely subjective), bad boss design (purely objective) and some normal mobs that are harder to fight in small numbers than 5 champion bosses at the same time.",1703110680,1703110680,False,4,0,0.48772081732749939,0,True,False,False

Gameplay wise they added great stuff from RoR2 like alternative skills and the challenge of the mountain. It also has some complete new stuff like drone scrapping, complete new enemies and bosses. And the best of all is the fact that if youre an oldhead and just wanted to play the modern RoR you can disable all the new content.

Providence trials has been a heated topic but i enjoy the challenge a lot and think it gives you some fun alternative to the usual runs. 

If youre coming from RoR2 you should be aware that this game is a platformer and generally harder at first than RoR2. It has similar mechanics but plays differently.

I had dabbled but hadn't unlocked that type of gamer inside of me yet. So I didn't really play it at all. Fast forward a few more years and Risk of Rain 2 releases, and I had spent much more time on various rougelike games, as well as looked back on Risk of Rain fondly even though I never spent proper time with it. I spent a lot of time on RoR2 and love the hell out of that game so when I learned about the reboot I was eager to play a remaster of the original. I have had a blast relearning how to use familiar items 2D, a whole new learning experience on maneuvers, and avoiding damage. I'm so glad I came back to give RoR R a try. I can already tell I will be spending just as much time on this one as I did with RoR 2. I highly recommend playing this game. It's so fun. It can be challenging and RNGesus doesn't always answer your prayers but honestly that adds to the fun.

HOWEVER, even though I think it is worth the money, it is still a bit disappointing. The graphics are better than ROR1, but not miles better. They are still pixelated and kinda low detail.

A lot of people point out that the controls suck, as someone who has almost 100hrs in ROR1, I kinda agree. For a 2023 game, what really stopped them from just allowing you to shoot into every direction while running around? It would have changed the first game, but maybe for the better.

The Huntress is still op because it is the only character that can properly kite enemies, don't know why they didn't just balance everything tbh.

If you like ROR2 you might like this, but maybe you won't. ROR2 is from a gameplay perspective just better designed.

My biggest gripe with this game comes down to the stages themselves, they are so big and yet feel so empty. Chests are very inconsistent, you can traverse half of the stage and not find a single one of them or you find like 5 within 20 meters of each other, there's no inbetween.

Navigating the stages is also a nightmare on its own, you have no minimap and you can get lost very easily, and don't even get me started on finding that damn Teleporter.

Platforming sucks. You fall off of ledges too easily, and that often results in you taking a lot of fall damage. Your jumps have to be very percise in order to cross gaps and get on ropes.

Enemy density is also a really big problem depending on the survivor you're playing. If your survivor has no piercing abilities or weapons, you're kinda screwed. Enemies tend to spawn in very large numbers (especially in later stages) and they can very easily overwhelm you, especially during Teleporter events where most of them are Elites. This wouldn't be such a big issue if finding chests was consistent and easy, but alas, it is not.

There's a good game underneath these issues, but until they're not fixed or improved upon, I cannot reccomend this game.",1702739716,1702739716,False,23,7,0.508998394012451172,0,True,False,False

[*][b]Teleporter[/b] : You rush it, then you loot the stage, most of the time you finish the event and looting at the same time. (feel more proactive)
[*][b]No scrappers and printers[/b] : They're not present which mean you don't spend 5 mins printing and scrapping items to get 10 crits lenses. (less downtimes!)[spoiler] no recycler either to create down time because you so so need that specific red item.[/spoiler]
[*][b]Drones[/b] : They feel waaaay stronger, upgrading them at a station or scrapping them is quite fast too.
[*][b]Ai[/b] : Most locals can't follow you everywhere, which mean you can just run to the other side of the map and lose half of them if needed.
[*][b]Ropes[/b] : love em. :)
[*][b]Dying in multiplayer[/b] : You can now loot items as a drone and piss on enemies so dying doesn't mean youre going to lose 10 items.
[*][b]Looping[/b] : You don't have to do a full loop to go to the final boss. After every teleporter events they let you go there.
[*]Temporary items are nice.
[*]I like the last stage more.
[*]Not a single boss has a ""hide from me mechanic"". (almost undodgable laser beam, sun ,supernova...)[spoiler] lame mechanics, Ifrit walls are kinda annoying though.[/spoiler]
[/list]
[h3]What I like in Ror2[/h3]
[list]
[*][b]Itemization[/b] : Lunar items, void items, scrappers and printers aren't present so your average run is more luck based.
[*][b]Newt[/b] : Newt was a great way to pause the game in multiplayer.
[*][b]Eclipse[/b] : Isn't there but it's fine since we got the final trials instead.
[*][b]Mods[/b] : The game is older so obv there's more mods.

I don't want to take the time to organize a well written review because I am still digesting how conflicted I feel about the games current state. So instead I will rant about things I hate now, then come back when the game settles into it's more ""final"" form. 

- So much RNG it causes more bad than good. Or more specifically, the inconsistency of every run. By stage 2 I can feel like the run is a wash because of low/bad drops. Up the loot quantity?

- Multiplayer (my desired way to play) is a hot mess. Bosses only drop 1 item for all players. Why?! Loot hardly scales to number of players, drought all game. Accidentally walking over items or playing with forced item share is NOT fun. Trying to keep the items equal between players is a chore. Why not be the first risk to drop items out of inventory?

- Elites. Why are elites so damn common on any stage at any difficulty? I will go through stage 1 and wipe the boss in seconds, only to get hung up on a lightning elite proving to be WAY more of a boss fight that the portal boss. 

- Is that a ledge I can stand on? No...

- Lava portal boss Cremators can be a run ender just for existing. 

- Items feel really weak aside from a select few and are few and far between. 

- Need more range on TP particles for ease of tracking down.

- Some characters skills (most) are, in all cases, worse than the alternative.

While they didn't add completely free aiming, which was what I really wanted, they did add free directional aiming that is completely disconnected from your movement. Considering how badly I think totally free aiming would mess up game balance unless they allowed monsters to move much more freely, this is about as good as they can do without making major changes to the game.

They also gave slower characters more movement speed, one of my biggest gripes and the easiest to fix. I was certain they weren't going to do anything about that, but they did, and it's awesome. 

I still stand by what was probably my second biggest complaint, which is that the printers and scrappers from ROR2 deserve to be here. They were genius run-savers, and it's a shame that they somehow missed that addition when they added so many other items from the second game. Who knows, though, with how things are looking now, that may very well be added some point in the future, and it isn't enough to truly take away from the fact that they fixed my other major complaints.

Instead of rewarding target priority, it rewards crowd control and positioning, it is satisfying in its own way to bunch a big pack of enemies up and pop them with your full arsenal of abilities. 

Some of the complaints just seem very uninformed to me or stem from skill issues, like saying the alternate abilities are bad or that Miner is somehow worse than the original. Complaints about aiming being stiff with mouse controls are valid but the impact this actually has on gameplay is overexagerrated. 

Its also worth mentioning that the game improves not just on the original but also on RoR2's mechanics in some ways. One big change is the removal of the teleporter bubble/needing to kill every enemy from RoR2/RoR1 respectively. This adds alot of flexibility in how you can approach the teleporter, and lets you use the 90 second timer to scavenger for a few more chests if you so desire without being forced to just sit in one area like RoR2. Also, players in multiplayer turn into drones upon death and can still pick up items, which is an excellent way of ensuring players who die early do not always fall behind the power curve (another big issue in RoR2).

Overall as someone who did not like RoR1 and liked RoR2 but got burnt out of it, I am enjoying this game, but I am not sure I will play it as much as RoR2 overall. It still has the same fun of getting a cracked build as RoR2 and wiping out everything in sight but some parts of the game feel outdated (such as bosses which can be very easily cheesed). Multiplayer being highly accessible like in RoR2 is definitely a huge boon though. If you like RoR2 then there is a good chance you will like this but don't expect it to feel the same as RoR2 or other 2D rouge-likes, this game is its own beast. 

Rating: 8/10

Pros:
-Characters are fun and are all viable from my first impressions
-New characters (Pilot and Drifter) are some of the best in the series
-Excellent art design for everything
-Interesting world building
-Drones are good unlike in RoR2
-Alternate abilities are cool and Providence Trials are a smart way of unlocking them
-Final boss and area are better than RoR2

Cons:
-Some of the bosses feel antiquated, they are overly simplistic and too easy to cheese
-I wish more enemies had unique forms of movement, while it is fun to kill a bunched up group of enemies I like how some enemies can fly or teleport to break things up
-Some Elites feel cheesy to die to (just like in RoR2 lol)
-I get why Printers were not included but honestly they were really cool... bring them back tbh (but not Scrappers)

{Edit: my review was initially negative due to the way they handled aiming, since then they have given the bare minimum of allowing the character to aim using the mouse position still just left and right however}

It keeps a lot of the things that I would consider issues and flaws in risk of rain 1, if you like risk of rain 1 you will love this game, if you're a risk of rain 2 player, you may not get what you wanted to out of this. There appears to be no scrappers or printers unfortunate considering that was the something that made ror2 stand above other roguelikes, the movement is, well is limiting in comparison to ror2 (I know it's 2d but that doesn't mean it can't be improved upon), I've played quite a bit of ror1 I should care to mention and it never quite stuck with me due to how janky things like falling and shooting feel, I went in expecting a fine tuned experience something more akin to its sequel, risk of rain 1 but with new mechanics, but its kinda just the first game with a visual upgrade, rule changes and new content, QOL changes. 

I feel like a kid lost in a walmart playing this, there doesn't seem to be a map button (correct me if I'm wrong), the map is massive and i just feel so lost and for how big it is, i feel like there should be more items with how massive the map is (i never had this issue in the first risk of rain or it's sequel). {Edit: i no longer found this as much of an issue, but it's worth considering.}

I like its remastered music, I like how polished the game feels in aspects such as characters shooting or moving, the environments are significantly better drawn and designed...

that's all I can really say considering my playtime, just buy it if you are a major risk of rain 1 fan, even to a risk of rain 2 fan its {definitely} worth considering, just go in open minded.",1699498933,1702417940,True,0,0,0.47070014476776123,2,True,False,False

Honestly I do a lot of complaining below so I might as well say some positives... Well its Risk of Rain, so I already like it, but I like how they brought a lot of stuff from 2 into this game. However, even though I haven't played 1 I like how there's unique items, maps, and enemies in this game. It for sure keeps it fresh. I also like how the music is similar but not exact, like sky meadows I thought it was the same song but it changed up quickly. Speaking of music it's (as always) beautifully crafted and I just can't get enough of Chris Christodoulou's beautiful art. As well the graphics are amazing compared to 1. Pixel art really is the best because you can be so creative, I'll always love it most. At first I did like that skills can be unlocked via Providence Trial or simply challenges like ""kill x enemies."" I really do like this and some of the trials are really cool and unique.....

....but the bad ones are absolutely awful. And of course some awful ones can only be completed by trial. Maybe it's a skill issue but ""Hot-Rope Hop"", ""Routine Maintenance"", ""Go On Without Me"", and Judgement were the absolute worst. If I weren't achievement hunting and wanted the skills I would've skipped them. I loved that from ROR2, having achievements with skills locked behind it with a very specific challenge. But wow these suck. I'm here for the roguelike not the minigames..Also there are some cool challenges but there's also a lot of niche skills that feel they were made just for the challenge and not the roguelike. Specifically Artificers Pulse Spear.

Maps are way too big and characters are way too small in the beginning. I feel more inclined to play on Artifact of Command just so I can start with a red whip sooner(which is so good in this game). The first couple levels are unbearable because of how long it takes to find the teleporter and more items at times. Hoping Hopoo will release a patch soon that will make it so you can see the particles of the teleporter better. 2D really makes it hard to find. Luckily as I'm editing this they just released a patch that makes it so you can aim with your mouse and bosses don't drop equip items. Slowly but surely fixing the small problems I had with the game haha.

But regardless of the complaints I still have a good time. I don't like it better then ROR2 but it's still an enjoyable experience even with its downsides. I feel I'm so critical because I enjoy the franchise so much and I want to see it be it's best.",1699508929,1702411651,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

overall the providence trials were really fun, a few notable exceptions were routine maintenance and some characters on judgement.
gameplay wise controls pretty well with some slightly obnoxious minute details like how targetting works with movement.
in judgement I would say only miner, mercenary, and artificer were actually difficult, the 2 former being exclusively stage 1 that's difficult, most others I got in a reasonable time span, not sniper, but that's because I'm bad.

Must play for Roguelite fans. If you're coming from RoR2, playing in two dimensions is a bit of an adjustment, and the game does have a steep learning curve. Fortunately, you've got plenty of ways to play, from dropping the difficulty down to drizzle or using artifacts like ""Command"" to make the game more approachable. 

The amount of un - lockable's really sets this remaster apart from the original. Alternate abilities that often ""fix"" characters flaws, skins, items, more survivors,there is plenty of meta - progression here. Providence trials while a mixed bag (some of them are infuriating) are an overall really cool experience culminating in a ridiculously challenging, but engaging, final challenge. 

Seriously a wonderful game, would recommend it to anybody who's fine with some level of challenge. I'm unsure if Hopoo game's has any intention of continually updating the game, as the IP has been sold to Gearbox, but I would love to see the return of printers ala RoR2, a slight increase in base jump height for characters lacking mobility and some enforcer buffs. Love the character, but he needs some help.

Choose your guy, kill stuff on the screen as fast as you can (or deal with the consequences), and do it all over again.

Roguelike, with little progression between deaths other than unlockable items to drop for future runs. It has a 'mini-game room' reminding me of Super Smash Bros. where, if you complete a challenge or a game with special rules, you can unlock an alternate move or skin, which is a pretty sweet idea.

The screen can get ridiculously chaotic during the late game, so you have to know your characters well to have a chance to figure out just what in the world is going on. Every character feels extremely unique; not two are even remotely alike, and characters can switch 3 out of their four abilities at the beginning for even more variety.

I still fucking despise the nerf to infusion that makes it garbage, but at least most of the new items are pretty cool. That said, more items means more bloat when you're playing without Command, which can make some runs somewhat questionable. 

The new Providence Trials are fun since the ones that unlock abilities also have other ways to unlock em. Most of them are pretty fun, but by god some suck so hard. Also, the final Trial can go die in a ditch. It's the most unbalanced thing I've seen. If you're gonna limit items, negate healing and force 8 stages in a row at least tweak the bloody items for the characters, some chars like Miner and Artificer are hell to play in this mode since you can barely stack enough to make them work. 

I've got a few other qualms too. Since they were revisiting the game they could've tweaked monster health and player damage. Much as I might love the game I CANNOT play it without having Glass on. I'll take dying in one hit for killing enemies at a decent speed any time of the day. Sure, it's playable without that artifact, but mate, I don't wanna be sitting there for 10 minutes the first few stages till I get some proper damage. 

Besides that, I don't mind the new enemies, but most are just mediocre at best. I hate the jumping balls and the birds with a passion tho, adding more aerials to a game with no means to deal with em is..... Sure, they eventually land, but screw waiting for that. Add lemurians and children now being able to climb ropes and shit just got a lot more annoying.

We got new survivors, items, map variants, alternate skins, alternative abilities, artifacts, challenges, and secrets galore!  And on top of it all, the sprite art has gotten overhauled and looks gorgeous. (Also... you can play multiplayer through steam now.)

What's even better is that with all of the changes they've made, you have the option to turn them all off if you're a purist! Don't like the new maps or enemies? Get rid of them! Don't like how the teleporter works like in RoR2? Toggle it off! Is the game still too hard or easy for you on any given difficulty? Scale your damage taken/dealt up or down to your heart's content!

Going into a more serious section, Risk of Rain Returns is a fun remake of the first game, adding new changes to make it easier to get into for newer players familiar with Risk of Rain 2. At its core, RoRR is a 2D platformer with horde combat, and need for precision. Whether you are the hyper-mobile Digger with 2 dashes, in-built double jump, and 50 i-frames on average, or the bulky and immobile enforcer with no base-skills to shift you place to place, understanding the basics of the movement system will make a mountain of difference in survival.

Aside from that, another big difference is the impact that items have on runs. Sure, in RoR2 an ATG or Ukelele is nice, but often, character skills carry a major part of horde clearing, but in RoRR, a single ATG heavily impacts how much pain you'll be in. That is to say, items are a lot stronger, and tend to be what reduces the bite of the pain in this game. Granted, you can still die within a mistake or two, items are unable to be a crutch.

10/10, it has Chef, and you can vibe in people while you throw 50 Cleavers",1702187343,1702187343,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Currently, the game is extremely difficult in single player, but not in a good way. The difficulty stems from the fact that the maps are too large. Given that a main mechanic of the game is to optimize the tradeoffs between time (difficulty), collecting gold, and collecting items from chests, the size of the map makes this far too tedious as a single player. It can take several minutes to simply traverse the map and find the teleporter, and after clearing the boss, you need to then traverse back across the map to collect items, then traverse all the way back to the teleporter. This also doesn't factor in the times where you don't find the teleporter on your first traversal.. Was it back at your spawn? Did you miss it on a cliff somewhere? Better check the entire map again.

I'm not sure why I never hit this problem so hard in the first game. I'm not sure if there is a difference in the map size, character move speed, teleporter location, or density of items, but I find myself spending 75% of the game just.. walking across the map. I've also never found myself short on gold for items -- you almost always want to hit the teleporter immediately, because there is no way there will be enough items for you to spend all your gold. This removes one of those tradeoffs, where sometimes you would hold off on hitting the teleporter to collect more gold. 

I think, fundamentally, I would like to spend more time fighting enemies and collecting items, and less time walking all the way across the map to get a barbed wire. I'm not sure if this could be achieved with out-of-combat move speed, smaller maps based on the # of players, allowing the teleporter to be activated after the 90s from anywhere, etc. But, currently, it feels awful to have to restart a run because you spent 6+ mins on the difficulty timer just looking for the teleporter.",1702149160,1702149160,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Originally, I played risk of rain 2, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. 
when I saw they were remaking the original game I just got the game soon after release, during the festival of gup sale. here are my thoughts. 

The main difference between the two games is that one is 3d, one 2d. the switch between perspectives is not particularly jarring, the same strategies that are used in one, can be used in the other, with the slight change that returns is not as focused on using movement to survive as items, and certain movement focused skills are not as good in returns as they are in 2, such as the huntress' blink, which is only good to avoid enemy attacks, unlike in 2, where it was a long-range movement skill. 

I did enjoy my first couple of runs as there was not too much difference between returns and 2. my first run to complete the game with was with huntress, and I enjoyed the levels, which were much bigger than in 2, owing to an entire dimension being removed. I worked my way methodically through the bosses and enemies, getting reasonably good luck on item drops, until I reached the temple of elders and could go to the contact light and fight providence, the end boss. the only level I found annoying was the contact light itself. there are large blast doors which are required to go through, and you have to wait ages for them to open. several sections of the ship are locked by keycard doors, and the keycard item required to open them is a rare drop from enemies. the keycard doors are not required to fight the final boss, but almost all the item chests are behind them. 
Providence himself is actually a pretty fun boss, in comparison to his counterpart, mithrix. while Providence uses graceful and predictable attacks, mithrix flails around like an idiot, but somehow does more damage. while Providence uses giant worms that fill up the screen to attack you, Mithrix just spawns surrogates that die to a toothpick. In general I would say that returns does the end boss better than 2, as Providence is fairer and more fun than mithrix. 

The characters have not changed much. I only played 4 characters, so this may not follow for the rest. commando is slightly better in returns than 2, but is still a poor character that is designed to teach you the basics. Huntress is good as always but requires a slightly different playstyle of using your secondary and utility skill more, and relying on your movement skill less. Bandit is much worse, with his shotgun being nerfed into oblivion, he relies on his alternate skill, the whip, to be at least moderately effective. the loader is still decent, but not to the level she was in 2, as the really powerful charged punch is missing, and the scrap barrier, which means that hitting enemies gives you a shield, is replaced with a secondary attack which makes you momentarily invincible. the loader's grapple is slightly worse also, as it is had to control and not the overpowered traversal tool it is in 2. the loader's problems pain me as she was my Favorited character to play in risk of rain 2. 
Later edit: I have tried one of the new characters, the Pilot, and I think that it is my new favourite. 
The playstyle for the pilot is pretty complex, but still fun to use. all the attacks switch function depending on whether you are on the ground or in the air, and this creates an interesting character that requires strategy, skill, and a good deal of button mashing to get through. I would recommend this character as I have not seen anything like it in the previous game. 

The providence trials are an interesting new addition for the remake, as previously you needed to complete almost random tasks to get new items and abilities, and you still can do that, but the providence trials let you do it in a quicker way by doing trials of skill and strategy to unlock abilities and some items. the majority of items are still unlocked the old way, and all abilities can be unlocked the old way too, it is just more difficult. 

In general I would say that risk of rain returns is a good remake, and a amazing addition to the risk of rain series, adding new and old things in a more modern way. Highly recommend to anyone unsure as to rougelikes, as risk of rain is a good introduction to the Genre. I would also recommend it to anyone who played and liked risk of rain 2 or risk of rain 1. In fact I would recommend this game to almost anyone. 

I may update this review in the future but maybe not. 
for now, I would rate this game 10/10.",1700671501,1702135944,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has fun and creative combat, interesting items and characters, and difficult enemies and bosses. Everything is polished to a sheen, and the game looks and sounds amazing. The game has some very obvious flaws though.

TLDR: Buy if you love platformers and rouge-likes, but don't expect many QOL things from ROR1 mods or ROR2. :)

--- 1. Stage progression is painfully slow. The large stages, slow base move speed, and low density of items makes the game feel very slow paced at times. I've lost most of my runs to not being able to find the teleporter quickly and enemies becoming too hard to kill. This can be slightly fixed by zooming the game all the way out, but then things can become very hard to see. A minimap would help this issue. There is also no way to shorten the teleporter charge time. It will always be 90 seconds no matter how powerful you are.

--- 2. Bad items feel terrible to get. While many of the items in this game are good, some of them are basically useless (headstompers and bungus comes to mind). This is also the case in ROR2, but that problem is hugely mitigated by the existence of scrappers. This makes any item you get good, as you can change them into better items. Scrappers are not in this game, and as such, bad items are just bad. There are also no extremely good items that will save your run. (Except for Prophet's Cape, lol) This is compounded by my last point, spending 1-2 minutes to open a chest only to get a terrible item makes the game more RNG based then it should be.

--- 3. Lack of information. It can be very hard to tell what an item or ability actually does because the in-game descriptions are comically bad. Some items have very vague descriptions, some just have flavor text, and none show any numbers to let you know exactly what it does. This is a problem in many rouge-likes, but is even more baffling here because full item descriptions are already in the game! In the logbook, you get full descriptions of every item. Also, this game focuses on stacking items, and picking up an item a second time may have a different effect than picking it up the first time. Prophet's Cape, for example, heals you more when stacking, instead of shortening the cool-down on the block, like you would expect. (Not so say it should stack like that, I just what to be told how it works when I pick it up.) There is also no information on HOW items stack. I can guess that crit glasses stack linearly, and that the hermit's scarf stacks logarithmically, but there is nothing telling me this. (Though I recognize that this is very nerdy and most people don't care.) There is also no in-game stats menu. You cannot look and see your base damage, how much armor you have, your current attack speed, or anything for that matter. All of these issues can be solved extremely easily, the amount of mods for different rouge-likes that do it, even ROR1 and ROR2, shows this.

--- 4. Some unlockables are very dumb. For the most part, the Providence Trials are very fun. Many of them work as a tutorial on how to use the thing you are unlocking, and are challenging yet fair. However, some of them are terrible. (The Han-D bridge cleaning one is really truly terrible.) Some of the other achievements are pretty tedious too. (I hope I never have to drown another whorl.) But this is all pretty minor when compared to the other issues.

All in all, this is a great game, but it is dragged down by a collection of easy to solve issues that somehow made it past QA. Hopefully these issues can be solved in future patches. (they are adding horizontal aiming based on feedback, so there is hope) I've also heard rumors of workshop support, which would instantly solve all of these issues.",1699513930,1702066419,True,2,0,0.528880476951599121,0,True,False,False

otherwise, the gameplay is fun, but gets kinda samey once you play the game enough; just spam jump and hope the enemies don't smack your ass; good game to play in class while ignoring a professor's lecture~

Nvm I just be talking shit the game is very fun. There's still stuff that bothers me, but I guess I should write a review that's gona help people who are unsure if they want to buy the game.  
  
[b] If you haven't played the original RoR [/b]
I recommend reading the negative reviews that talk about the original game. You'll get a good idea about the ""failures"" of the first game and why people are disappointed. Once you understand ""the bad side"" of the original try and asses whether those are a deal breaker for you or something you can gloss over/manage.  
From personal experience: the game becomes A LOT more fun when you get better at it. It's flaws start looking like quirks or something you don't notice anymore.  
  
[b] If you've played the original RoR [/b]  
It's veery similar to the original. Has  more content and looks more pretty, Biggest change for me is the ability to move while shooting. Everyone can kite now, but you move slowly while doing it. Right now you can't change the direction of shooting while kiting (except huntress) which feels pretty clunky and bad, but you get used to it. They've announced earlier they're gonna ""fix"" this in an update that adds more aiming options so eagerly waiting for that.
  
  
Providence trials range from extremely fun to extremely frustrating, but overall they're not too difficult.  
Waiting for the artificer buff and for some alt abilities to feel more like sidegrades rather than obvious downgrades. Ropes are buggy, but it's a problem on just one map.  
  
There's plenty of secrets to find/unlock (characters, skins, areas, bosses, artifacts etc.)  
Most of my playtime is unlocking stuff by clearing achievements which was pretty enjoyable. You can modify how much damage you deal and take from enemies. This along with [spoiler] Command [/spoiler] make some horrible achievements turn into a breeze. Overall, unlocking stuff is easy and fun in this game.

Visually, everything has taken several steps up, the sprites, the effects, the animations, everything. Soundwise, I don't even have to say that the music is once again amazing, that should be understood already.

My main gripes are pretty few. The challenges, as so many others have already said-they need tweaking! The feel of attempting to climb ropes/ladders, as well as attempting to shoot while leaping off them or leaping between them feels....odd. Weirdly sticky but at the same time oddly inconsistent as to when I'll fly off or remain attached, not helped along by the fact that you can't jump to quickly dismount a ladder downwards (or to climb faster) while within terrain, though I can't recall if that was in the original or not. The artificer.....she needs a big rework, they've absolutely massacred her in attempting to keep her RoR2 kit in 2D-and they didnt even MANAGE that. The overloading worm seems to need at least some optimization, as it's reliably ending runs with Prowess, or just long enough ones that the game locks up from particles (the ONLY instance so far that I've seen, unlike the original game where getting three daggers could brick you)-amazing work on that end. And finally, the enemies' damage seems a little overtuned on default settings, but I suppose that's what the adjustable sliders are for. They also seem to scale up a lot faster than the original.

RoR Returns is a HD remake of the original game, with some absolutely gorgeous sprites and a few modern tweaks on gameplay (most of which can be tweaked in options to be like the original if desired). My favourite addition are the providence trials - little one-off challenges using specific items or skills, which allow you to unlock new abilities and skins for your characters. Makes a great change of pace from the main game now and then, and getting new abilities on old characters can sometimes make a big change to the way they play.

When the original RoR came out, I was impressed for the size of the team behind it (and that it had started as a school project?) The controls were archaic, but worked just fine for the game, and the lore and music elevated the game to another level. While the sequel, Risk of Rain 2, got some well-deserved popularity (and is a great 1-4 person 3ps), the original had a certain style to it, and played just differently enough, that it was always in my mind.

If you liked the original this is a no-brainer, and for $20 I think it's worth it at full price even just to try out, though if you didn't like the original then don't expect a change here. Note that I don't have friends, so have not tried the multiplayer on this (but it stands well as a single player game).",1701831174,1701831174,True,1,0,0.526315808296203613,0,True,False,False

To specify what is better: I think the art is better. I think the game handles better. I think the UI has some special touches (for example, your healthbar shaking as if it were hit, when you are almost killed) that really just make the experience feel... nice. 

It also adds a kind of minigame mode called providence trials, which is honestly my favorite part of the new game. Every character has 3-5 challenges, and the challenges are all fairly diverse. Many of them challenge you to get as high of a score as you can, or complete a goal in as short a time as possible. They all have an unlock tied to a target score, with an optional 'golden' score which is much more difficult to get. What I love about these challenges is that so many of them take advantage of risk of rain's systems to create an interesting challenge. 

My favorite is Main Systems Offline, which severely cripples your character and starts you in a small room, and periodically you get a key, which allows you to open more rooms and get items which make you stronger and allow you to access other areas. This is such an interesting take on the item system, it's almost like a very short metroidvania which is survival based rather than having you reach an 'end' point. I'd love to see games expand on this concept, but I'm not sure that'll happen, as this mode uniquely utilized the systems from this game. Maybe when they add mods, people will be able to make their own trials, and expand on this concept.",1699507966,1701818158,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h2]A must-have if you enjoy Rogue-Likes![/h2]

I came from Risk of Rain 2, having logged an absurd amount of hours into that game. I've also never played the original numero uno. This game has now become my favorite of the series. The graphic redesign is amazing, and the accompanying soundtrack has some new classics to add to your library. There's so much to unlock (I've even still got a few log entries to go), and the new Providence Trials add some intense challenges with mostly good rewards. Runs in this game compared to RoR2 are noticeably more difficult, especially on Monsoon. The RNG can really affect your run this time around, where I felt in RoR2 you can make just about anything work. The new characters are diverse in play style so I'm sure you'll find a survivor you will like to play. Runs with friends are enjoyable, but I feel are a tad more difficult than it should be with the lack of items being very noticeable. There's also a nice option to enable if you've got some greedy friends who don't like to share items. The logbook adds a lot of lore to the series which was something I greatly enjoyed about RoR2 as well.

[h3]Should you 100% the game?[/h3]

You absolutely [b]SHOULD[/b] unlock every item! There are some really powerful ones that will greatly increase the success of your runs.

You don't [b]NEED[/b] to unlock all the alternate moves, but some are vastly superior to the originals depending on the survivor. *ahemCyclone* Excuse me.

You don't need to [b]GOLD RANK[/b] all the Providence Trials. No extra content, no secret achievements (You do need 15 though for one achievement though). Just bragging rights! If you'd like some assistance getting Gold Rank, please check out my [url=https://www.youtube.com/SE4LS]YouTube Channel[/url] as I am making a video for each trial with tips for success.

This title is one of the best roguelike arcade shooters of its time. An addictive gameplay loop packed with a cool pixel artstyle with and an equally awesome soundtrack. I daresay, the original title is way better than its 3D Sequel. 

Risk of Rain Returns refreshes this gem with more Survivors, more Mobs, and more silly-ass gear you can horde to your heart's content. 

Survivors come in a fresh coat of much detailed pixels, different color skins on the get-go but most importantly unlock-able alternate skills. These change up how each survivor plays out, and you can choose the skills that fit your play-style. 

There are new mobs and more elite variants that will hinder your progress -- the more you take your sweet time, the harder the punishment. 

And of course the ever-reliable equipment system is there with some fresh pieces that make each run unique from the last. 

The randomly generated stages are still there but packed with secrets to discover and collect -- one such aspect would be the artifacts which provide additional conditions to the run when you enable them. 

Last but not the least, the runs can be tailor-fitted to your play-style. Classic and Modern rule sets are available for your to tweak each time you deploy. A slider for Damage Dealing and Damage taken is also available on top of the hilarious difficulty settings. Dial it up or down based on your skills or lack thereof. And if ever running the gauntlet on end becomes boring, the game now boasts a Providence Trial mode that pit you against specific scenarios for a way to unlock certain alternative survivor skills, which are unlocked naturally through endless (frustrating) gameplay -- as if you don't have a taste for punishment.

There are a large variety of characters with very unique playstyles, there is even variety within those characters with unlockable alt skills. There is a similarly impressively large quantity of items and game modifiers (artefacts which each need to be unlocked). Some of these can be obtained relatively quickly but many either require you to complete a specific objective or will naturally accumulate over time. These therefore combine to give you a great sense of progression over time, whilst not giving you any inherent advantages on subsequent runs. The artstyle and soundtrack are also absolutely fantastic. 

Gameplay itself is just as, if not more fun as the sequel; the time = difficulty mechanic keeps you constantly on your toes and keeping you from playing it too safe. Skill is definitely a big part of the game and while it may feel RNG heavy at first due to randomised items (though this can be changed with an artefact), you will learn how to play better and survive longer. The fact that shooting slows you down significantly may seem clunky at first but its definitely something you get used to and does keep things balanced. There are a large variety of stages, bosses and enemies to keep things interesting too.

Providence trials are a new addition and from my experience are very hit or miss. Some of them are great and make you learn new mechanics and test your ability to use them; the trial where you play as mercenary and parry 25 attacks in a row is initially difficult but each one is satisfying to pull off and mastering the timing feels great. However some feel more frustrating than anything. One of the most disappointing in my opinion was one where you, as mercenary, fight another mercenary AI, which is fun to learn. However half way through the game just throws a ton of enemies in, ruining the duel and just making it more frustrating for no reason, as if the developers thought it wasn't hard enough, and instead of improving the AI or introducing more interesting challenges such as environmental hazards, they just threw in some difficult enemies and called it a day. These trials are how you unlock alternate abilities for survivors but thankfully you can also get them by just using the corresponding survivor a lot, so you don't have to complete them if you don't want to. 

Its a great game. Great variety in almost every department and tons of customisability to suit the game to your liking. Just like the second game, this is one of the only roguelike games to ever really hold my attention, and I'd strongly recommend you play it even if these kinds of games usually aren't your thing.

Risk of rain 2 babies i am very sorry to say this but you being good at risk of rain 2 doesn't mean your gonna have an easy time and in fact it will kick you in the nuts and while your on the floor crying it will then say to play on drizzle

The providence trials for unlocking abilities is cool and there's a lot of creative challenges, but they range from being super easy to feeling impossible. And sure, there are alternate ways of unlocking the abilities, but its usually like kill 3000 enemies or something that's pretty uninteresting and takes a long time.

Risk of Rain Returns is the first game but with less clear visuals and with pre-installed mods/things you'd get from a DLC for it.

Several annoying things from the original are still present in this remake, such as:
Waiting minutes for enemies to spawn so you can buy equipment.
Enemies and bosses spawning in areas they can't attack you from.
Still no sort of map selection.
Only getting items that do not synergize at all with each other.
The game spamming too many enemies at once, leaving you unable to defeat the current wave before a new wave of new enemies spawn.
Some item descriptions are still completely useless without checking the wiki.
(Though, admittedly, some of these aren't as common as they were in the original.)

Some enemies' attack hitboxes extend far beyond what their animation would telegraph.

Your drones will sometimes get too close to your character, making it hard to see your exact position and your immediate surroundings if you have more than 3 or 4 of them. Which is quite a problem in a game where you're supposed to dodge projectiles and do platforming.

For some reason, different from all other survivors, The Drifter doesn't have auto-fire for their primary attack.
This will lead to the player often and repeatedly pressing the primary attack button to fight off enemies, which not only causes discomfort and pain to some people, but it is well known as the source of Repetitive Strain Injury. This is exacerbated by the short length and range of the attack in a game prone to spamming enemies at you.
There is no reason for this in a game where literally every other character allows for auto-fire.
The only explanations for this from the part of the developers is that they are either somehow unaware of what it feels like to play their game or simply do not care if they are causing injury to the people playing their game.

If you think ""the first game but more"" is enough to justify a purchase, go for it.
However, if you were expecting ""the first game but [i]better[/i]"", just play Risk of Rain 2.",1699648239,1701623482,False,5,2,0.375054270029067993,0,True,False,False

A single red whip should honestly be the base move speed for every survivor. Not only are the stages too big horizontally, but also vertically. I feel like a quarter of my time playing is just going up and down ropes. The stages are so large that if you don't play zoomed all the way out, you're basically trolling, and at that point your survivor is so tiny you can barely even see them let alone appreciate their design.

I don't quite understand why the difficulty scales with time, shouldn't it scale with what stage you're on? It doesn't hurt anybody if I want to take my time and play at my own pace. But instead I feel punished if I'm not constantly going through the next teleporter. I heard the devs are adding mouse aim in a later patch, but for right now, every survivor feels clunky to play except maybe huntress.

Returns is using the same engine as 1 with the same 60fps cap, so you won't be taking advantage of any high refresh rate displays. I wouldn't expect extra meta progression, but it would be nice if I had a reason to keep playing the game outside of trials. I understand the game is inexpensive, but so is risk of rain 2. At this point in time, risk of rain 2 is actually cheaper when it's on sale.

Risk of rain returns is faithful to the original, no doubt about it. But risk of rain 1 had so many issues that they just simply didn't do anything about. It seems like the devs decided on a remaster, when what we really needed was a remake. A fresh coat of paint and some new assets can only go so far.

Honestly, I don't get why people are comparing this game to RoR2 so much when it's just remake of the first game. Tons of new stuff added, and you even have an option to switch all the rules to classic if you are masochist (killing all enemies before activating teleport honestly was least favorite mechanic in original). Other people are talking about how remake is not fixing some finicky or not streamlined flaws of the first game, like maps that are maps layouts and the fact that you, oh boy, can be instakilled if you walk into the crowd of enemies, like RoR2 doesn't have such situation and nobody complains, when it would really just mean they would make different game or something like parallel sequel, idk. It's literally core of first game with new face and new stuff and ideas added on top, while couple rough edges being smoothed. Also a hack for those who didn't played first game and want to get mad advantage: 
[spoiler]move Zoom Scale slider in option to x1 and your eyes will literally open. But at same time it might be a bit harder on your eyes in general. Honestly this option is almost a cheating in game where decision on where to go is crucial because time plays a big role, lol.[/spoiler]

[h2] Good [/h2]

[list]
    [*]All the fun that was fun in first one is same here, every run can go rather absolutely fantastic or horribly bad (most of the time, lol). Looping back through levels still brings chaos to your screen. 
    [*]First game was beautiful in it simplicity, second game was beautiful in adaptation of it's style to a different medium, remake is just beautiful in adding details to what was working good.
    [*]Music is still, in my personal taste, better than the second. It's more raw, more ""tangy"", suits the style of the game better.
    [*]Movement and gameplay overall feels just a bit more dynamic and faster, but still just like the first game.
    [*]New stuff mostly is pretty good. New items and items from RoR2 freshen up the experience.
[/list]

[h2] Bad (kinda) [/h2]

[list]
    [*]If you don't like more raw and hardcore kind of rogue-likes or didn't liked first game, this might be not your cup of tea.
    [*]Just like first game it can feel a bit frustrating and unfair because of bad rng or you loosing your character in chaos of action, but it's nature of rogue-likes, it's not meant to always dominate the game, sometimes it kicks you in the gut.
    [*]Providence Trails is somewhere neutral, towards bad I'd say. For me, they just seems like they are not fun. It's almost like devs was testing the water to new games trying to encorporate existing stuff and give it some kind of puzzle/challenge twist, but most of them honestly feels like task you will do once to open stuff and never come back. In general not bad idea for unlocking stuff (especially considering they give you alternative to open it via other achievements if it's too hard for you), but half of them are not very fun or challenging, others kinda a bit too hardcore for what they giving to you.

[h2] Conclusion [/h2]

It worth to get if you love first game and want renewed experience, or didn't tried the first one and want to give it a go, you are not skipping anything from original. If you don't like more raw, harder rogue-likes or wanted completely new part Risk Of Rain, this might be not for you.",1700616532,1701602210,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has what the original game had, plus a lot more new stuff. A nice feature of the game is that you can disable a lot of the new stuff if you want the OG experience. A lot of accessability options have been added, plus more options for changing damage taken/dealt values if you want a more chill run.

Providence Trials are a new feature added in Risk of Rain Returns. They are difficult challenges that unlock skins, items and alternative abilities for your characters. Something worth mentioning is that there are alternative ways of unlocking the alternative abilities through normal gameplay, in case the challenge is too hard or you don't wanna bother.

One thing I need to get off my chest is that the Providence Trials are all difficult, with some being frustratingly so. And if you want a Gold rating on challenges, the difficulty rating dial is turned to 11. I am not a fan of it. Some challenges I'll never beat and some I've beaten I'll definitely never get Gold on. A large amount of achievements are tied to beating all challenges to unlock a special challenge, so you who seek to 100% the game will probably suffer quite a bit.

I found myself playing with different characters than i did in ROR2 and the trials are like fun mini games. Despite how fun it may be it is still very challenging at some times and i am far from walking through monsoon difficulty.  Having the artifact of command is awesome because you can test out different builds and see what the ideal is for each character and your play style. The levels are hard to navigate sometimes but it really helps if you zoom out and get a second jump immediately. 

If you enjoyed any of the ROR games i think it is worth a shot, i did not enjoy the first one myself but found this one fun. One of my favorite games for sure now despite the fact that I despise side-scrolling 2-D games.",1701498419,1701498419,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let me start off by saying this is one of my favorite games of all time and I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a challenge. I've been playing Risk of Rain since the first game came out in 2013. Each game was even more enjoyable then the last. When i saw this games trailer i was so excited to play and when it finally came out I grinded the game. At the time i'm writing this I have 100% the game and only need to finish the last trial with every character.

First off, the graphics are a lot better then the first game I enjoyed getting to look at each of the characters and enemies new sprites. Along with the new enemies and stages everything was great.

Finding all the new stuff, such as Robomando and Boar Beach, was so exciting. The new artifacts as well make the game more challenging, after unlocking the Artifact of Prestige i used it almost everyone, which crashed my game a lot. I enjoyed the Providence Trials, some of them were difficult but that made it even more fun.

One of my most favorite parts of playing was when I beat providence and he had one last phase, it was awesome to see that even old stuff got something new to it. Every aspect of the game was amazing and didn't find anything negative to right about, and I can't wait for the new Risk of Rain 2 DLC to come out.",1701393749,1701416190,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, you shouldn't expect this to be better than Risk of Rain 2 if you're coming in from that. This is very much a different game and chances are you may not enjoy it as much. Alongside that, there are some issues such as the chests spawning like 30 miles apart, causing you to feel like you're playing a walking simulator at times with nothing happening (mainly early-game but it's always boring). Though, I've heard that turning off the new map variants fixes this since apparently they are so damn big compared to the original ones for some reason. Another thing I'm not really a fan of is having to kite enemies for 20,000 years in Monsoon if I didn't happen to get good items (unless you use Chef baybeeee best character in the game). The fact of this game being 2D kinda kills the enjoyability of that since it can feel pretty BS at times. I don't really remember that being a problem in the original game so that's why I bring it up here. Despite my complaints, I STILL think this game is an improvement. The new damage dealt/taken stuff, for example, actually mitigates every aforementioned issue rather well.

When it comes to the side stuff, I thought the Providence Trials were meh. A few are good, most aren't anything impressive, and some of them are like the worst thing ever designed in the history of video games. I have no clue why they decided to get Satan on the design team for some of these, like the one where you need to shoot 10 targets as Huntress while climbing ropes and then if you want to crown it you need to get 40 more. Like why? Who the hell decided that? Or alternatively the one where you have to knock enemies off of the map with HAN-D. Why do you have like -8 HP in that one? AND they have the boss that surrounds you with walls. Once he spawns, you are pretty much flipping a coin to decide whether or not you win since it gets way too chaotic for you to manage anything. It's so fucked up.

I've gotten my money's worth from this game and don't really feel like playing it that much anymore when Risk of Rain 2 exists, but I'm sure that there will be a lot of people that'll be able to have fun with this for longer than I did. Even if you don't, you'll still get a good bit of hours in since the progression is fun to go through. Once that's up though, you'll probably just go back to playing Risk of Rain 2, which is fine. At the end of the day, I shouldn't reaaalllly complain about this game since they didn't even have to add everything that they did. All of the new items, enemies, bosses, characters, sprites, music, and more are fantastic; we should definitely be grateful this remake even exists. I just wish it came out a little better gameplay-wise.",1701267835,1701353343,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The stages are huge and barren and when you do find chest or shrines its extremely likely that youll get a useless equipment instead of anything remotely useful.

RoR original was extremely hard and I'd say this one's just as much so you probably won't see your first win until about a dozen or so games in, but if you take your time to learn the way your character interacts with items, enemies and terrain, the game opens up in a wonderful way, especially now with all the added content.

I should note that if you did play Risk of Rain 2 this game might be a bit hard to get used to as it has a different gameplay feel than the 2nd game. I don't mean that as in it being 2D, but rather how items are more spread out and how maps generally feel to play in compared to something like Risk of Rain 2. I did not like it at all myself when I started but after playing a lot and getting into the rhythm of the maps, I've come to enjoy them quite a lot, maybe even more than the Risk of Rain 2 maps. 

Small balance issues regarding enemy scaling as of writing this like 5 minute Blight enemies on Monsoon nearly one-shotting you or overloading enemies feeling much more difficult to get away from, at least compared to Risk of Rain 2, leading to some deaths feeling cheap. However, all of this just needs some minor tuning to be in a good state.

Unless you're playing with a friend that can loot your items even when you stand directly on the chest dropping the item. 
I cannot begin to understand how he does it. The game doesn't have a ""pick up item-button,"" but every single time I buy an item off a chest or something and it drops to my feet, he's there and he gets it.

Most people would think, well, that's simple. Just do the same thing to him, right? WELL! I can't! Every time he opens a chest and I stand right there beside him, he gets his own item, so... He gets both my items and his own items.

Would I want to be enraged over something like this again? Of course! 10/10 game!

It's a game designed for those who relish the fast-paced, constant movement inherent to the platformer genre, with expansive and vertically challenging stages

ReturnsÂ visuals and animations are commendable, preserving the same tone as the original but with higher definition sprites. The unlock system, which incorporates Providence trials, provides depth to growth by presenting players with distinct challenges and powers to unlock. Chris Christodoulou's music shines like usual, capturing the charm of the original while expanding

However, there are some serious problems. The levels are way too big, which causes annoyance and slowness when navigating them. The use of ropes can become tedious, and the lack of surrounding cues makes directions difficult. The secret places are also prone to shoddy design, which detracts from the overall delight of exploring. Traversing some of the maps are a nightmare. I feel like they could have added much more versatile ways to get around besides ropes and geysers. The mobility of characters isn't that great either the movement speed for most characters isn't that great compared to enemies.

Equipment are way too plentiful, Most of the time you get equipment almost every time on the first stage and probably never select another one again. From my experience almost every other chance shrine I get one. Not to mention bosses for some reason drop equipment. Shrine of mountains aren't as good as R2 because of this

Items are way too spread out which doesn't help with the strict difficulty scaling, it's hard to go through the entire map and collect all items when you are on Monsoon it's almost always better to just get what you can and hit teleporter early instead of spending additional time finding items that probably won't help you

In terms of combat flow, there's a lack of engagement since most of combat is facing a linear line of monsters and using all your skills just to wait and dodge everything just to do everything over again. This diminishes the strategic aspect and turns combat into a routine of using cooldowns, retreating, and waiting. I feel like with combat they should introduce more variety in enemy behaviors, potentially including more flying enemies or those that demand different tactics. This would create a more engaging combat experience, encouraging players to adapt their playstyle

by all means I still think this is a great game but I don't think it's good as Risk of Rain 2",1700632115,1701250848,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Does it ruin the game? No, in fact there's alot to enjoy about the remaster not the least of which is a reminder about how damn good the original soundtrack was and is. I will continue to play this game. But I can't recommend it to people starting the series.

I am someone that joined the series at Risk of Rain 2 and while it has taken adjustments, I have a massive appreciation for this game and the challenges it provides. 

Co-op has run near perfect for the most part. My main gripe is that enemy scaling (bullet sponging) is far more slanted in favor of the enemies and tilting than it was in RoR2, and in multiplayer runs this feels like a handicap.  There is a scale to adjust player damage, but it feels kinda weak.

It is basically a remaster + expansion of RoR1, but in essence it's the same exact game. It is still a platformer at heart, if you didn't like the original chances are you won't like this one either.
Added more stage variants and stages are bigger. OST is a banger with remastered music and new songs.
The bestiary and log section is incredible, you can view the entire map of every stage variant, high quality pixel art for every enemy. The pixel art is simply gorgeous.

There are some bugs and the autoaim feels very wonky compared to the original (from my experience this is due to the added ability to move while shooting, and there is a confirmed fix coming), the movement on the other hand feels a bit better than the original.
The trials seem very fun and knowing Hoopoo I expect them to get very hard in the later stages. (Already read posts about people getting tilted over some of them lol)

Could use some more settings especially when it comes to UI, no non-V-sync frame lock option, no og/modern soundtrack options, unintuitive borderless option, no way to toggle enemy corpses, etc. Some bugs like being able to order lobbies by ascending ping yet the displayed ping is always 0, and minor text bugs.

Intensity alongside other tweakable features to customize your gameplay even further, which can be individual or shared in co-op lobbies. Talking about co-op, you have chroma skins and outlines. You can force item sharing so one player doesn't steal every item. Whenever you die in co-op you turn into a drone that can fly around and shoot until killed or TP'd to the next stage, during which you can still pick up items but not interact with objects. No ability to ping though.

It's weird seeing how some setting having so many options and some others having so few, and some of the inconsistencies. The font is still horrid but you can now toggle between that and a bigger more legible font, no scaling. It gets worse because when using the bigger font, some tooltips are cut short due to no 'overflow' setting for the text areas.

-[b]For the purists[/b], it includes a ""Classic"" setting it ends up playing like the original, alongside a custom one to disable whatever new feature you don't want to see.
-[b]For the RoR2 babies[/b], this is RoR1-2 bitch!!! we clown in this muthafucka betta take yo sensitive ass back to RoR2! (there is no free aim option at least as of yet, 2-directional aim only like in the original).

Overall and assuming most bugs are gonna be squashed and some things rebalanced, it's a huge upgrade from the original in every way, and no need to port-forward anymore to play online co-op. Certified banger.

I played a crap ton of risk of rain 2 though and love it. One of my favorite, genre defining roguelike games. When I saw a updated version of the original, I saw it as a great chance to try it out. I got worried cause it was announced soon after the gearbox aquirement.

Thankfully, it's amazing.

9/10 game

The gameplay is really smooth, the art was cleaned up and looks nice compared to 2013 ROR, items are fun and unique with concepts and features coming back from risk of rain 2 like mountain shrines.

Would I recommend it to risk of rain 2 players or risk of rain 2013 players? Yes 100% 

But I would not recommend it as an entry point to risk of rain? Not to say it's bad, its that it is extremely unforgiving and difficult. A new player to the franchise might give up due to difficulty and never play it again. ""Oh but roguelikes are often hard"" yea this one takes it a step further. 

Of course, if you want difficulty, by all means. Just be warned if you aren't familiar with Risk of Rain already or play a lot of roguelikes.

Most of the new items entailed are essentially a curated backport of RoR2's actually useful ones, and Artificer is just as bad here as she was there; some things never change. The other new survivors are otherwise good, there's a 'that kid' unlock process, a few more artifacts hidden around, and there are some new stage variants to shake things up a little. But there's no actual 'new' stages proper, and the soundtrack is still mostly the same outside of a few cases. Still a fantastic one as ever, though it may create something of a juxtaposition with the game walking a blurred line between remaster and remake between the gameplay and visuals as-is.

Whether game balance is any much better is debatable; some survivors got notable tweaks, flying enemies are far stronger, chest distribution seems to be worse, some enemies now climb ropes, many of the less useful items are still bad, and while Infusion is actually balanced with Glass active so bad players can't cheese it for free damage, other changes make playing that artifact more annoying than challenging. Unmodified gameplay may still result in fighting rather spongy enemies. Percentile modifiers to damage given/taken though do provide a solid alternative but will realistically be abused by many to unlock content reliably.

The most notable new feature in Returns otherwise is a bunch of pre-made trials. They vary massively in difficulty and fun, rewarding more unlockable items but also notably as the method to get RoR2-style alternate skills. Sadly, many of them suffer the same problem, that by comparison to the original they're either a straight upgrade or so gimmicky, that they're basically designed around its trial.

Being able to use Steamworks to host and join games with ease than having to deal with any port forwarding is a good point worth noting over the original, but sadly it's limited to four players until modding finds a way around that. Dead players now also become drones and have an opportunity to collect dropped items if they survive in that form.

In the end, it's a fine re-release and it's still classic Risky with some welcome amenities here and there. But it also does have to compete with the selection of mods available for the original, including Starstorm - which one of the developers for Returns worked on originally.",1701153829,1701153944,True,19,0,0.629066884517669678,0,True,False,False

This franchise as a whole feels like what happens when you get a decent, engaging idea going, but the team developing it lacks experience. Every entry in it thus far has had several things I could point to bringing it down. It usually manages to be fun despite this, but the potential available is decidedly not being met.

In Risk of Rain 1, the primary let-down was the controls being bad, the maps being far too large, and mobility feeling about nonexistant. As far as a first game goes, however, this is highly forgiveable.

In Risk of Rain 2, the maps are [i]still[/i] too large, the terrain is very plain, and you will more often than not end up winning hard until something spontaneously one-taps you without you even knowing what it is. Not to mention a final boss that is entirely obnoxious to fight. Still, movement was a lot better, as was the aiming and controls generally.

But then we get here, to Risk of Rain Returns. The controls are still much better - I'll give it that. I'm still very annoyed I can't aim with the mouse properly, but that's coming in a future update, so I'll let it slide. But the rest of the problems are still here in force. Sure, you can move while shooting now, that's great, but you're still slower than molasses in January, so I still feel like a slug in tar. The maps are still immense and irritating to navigate, and both of these issues compound the difficulty unnecessarily.

But the thing I hate most about this release is the Providence Trials. I don't know what was going through the heads of those that made them, but the vast majority of them are ridiculously infuriating to complete. Difficulty out the nose, with several of them utilizing gimmicks that the game was very clearly not designed to handle. I [i]loathed[/i] them, and while you can ignore them for alternate skill unlocks (as other unlock methods are available), there are several items that can [i]only[/i] be obtained via them, and I find it obscene.

And yet honestly, despite this all, this review could've been a tentative positive one. Indeed, for a while, it [i]was.[/i] But the constant difficulty imbued in so many of the challenges in combination with the entirely unnecessary put-down lines thrown at you every time you lose is just barely enough to tip it over the edge into the negative, as I can't respect developers who feel the need to insult their own players.

Overall, Risk of Rain as a whole has been defined to me by its inherent possibility for greatness in combination with its consistent ability to disappoint and fall short of that promise. It's decent, and you'll probably have fun, but it [b]will[/b] be very rough around the edges.",1700073145,1701125879,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The Characters:
You start with 2 characters, the commando and the huntress. there are 15 to unlock (along with [spoiler] [i]a certain someone[/i] [/spoiler]), and they are all good, fun and different.

The story:
No real story spoilers (figure it out yourself).
A cyclops by the name of providence is pissed that the contact light (the ship your on) is passing through petrichor v, and also annoyed because someone managed to take a teleporter from the planet and put it on the contact light. he decided to go and commit task manager against the ship, killing essentially all of its crew except for 15 characters [spoiler] and a funny looking robot [/spoiler]. your dropped onto the planet with nothing except what you could grab on your way out, and anything in those chests that are raining from the sky.

The gameplay loop:
This IS a rougelike, so its a gameplay loop instead of following a story
You drop onto the planet and need to immideitly commit mass genocide, because the locals aren't too happy about you encroaching on their land, and will do everything in there power to stop you. but for some reason, they are MADE of money. kill some, and open the money locked chests to gain new items to keep up with the ever increasing threat of the timer which makes enemies stronger that father into a run you go. oh, and worry, they WILL outscale you, so you need to be fast and keep ontop of the hoards. Once you reach stage 5 you are given a choice, go to the contact light and make your escape, or return back to that first stage to continue the run and go through all the stages all over again. if you choose this path, I have some good news: every stage including and after stage 5 contains a more powerful teleporter, which is capable of letting you continue the run or letting you go to the contact light whenever you please, so long as your still alive. IF you are still alive of course, as after that first tele loop, monsters start to scale much more rapidly, doing way more damage and becoming way tankier and you will be seeing a lot more elites. when you decided to go to the contact light, the goal is no longer to find the tele. the goal is to instead reach the front of the ship, so that you may go ahead and kick providence's kneecaps in. Providence himself is no joke however, as he's capable of demolishing your healthbar in an instant if you are too stressed to dodge. thankfully, he has tells, and even with literally no movement items or ability's, with enough skill, EVERYTHING can be dodged (he's actually a really cool boss, but he's not extremely hard. I do wish he had more attack pattern variety but its fine). Once he's dead your allowed to leave and win the run.

Meta progression:
This game has over 150 different total unlocks, from items, to survivors, to skins, and all the way to unique abilities for everyone, no stone goes unturned. However, some challenges are VERY hard, so you better be prepped to have your ass handed to you on a silver platter.

Music:
Chris don't miss.
the tracks for this game are some of the best I've heard, managing to rival legends such as the bop of the jetpack joyride theme, pizza tower soundtrack, ultrakill soundtrack, and payday 2 soundtrack. that's how good it is.

All in all the game is AWESOME and you should ABSOLUTLY buy it without question. it will be tough but you'll figure it out. go and kick providence's ass, for all of us.

Some of the ""new"" characters are from RoR2, and some are completely new. Characters now have alternate ability choices much like RoR2. Some abilities have multiple ways to unlock them which gives accessibility for players who don't want to interact with the Providence Trials game mode.

When the original game launched, setting up multiplayer was a pain with having to get a Hamachi server up and running. Thankfully in RoRR multiplayer is as easy as creating a lobby and inviting or joining from the Steam friends list.

Many art improvements have been made, and the soundtrack is as great as it ever was with some additional  songs added in.

I had over 100 hours in the original game, and I can see myself getting even more than that out of Returns.
If you're at all familiar with the original, RoRR will feel right at home with you with enough additional content added to keep the experience feeling fresh.

The new tracks for the OST are absolutely INCREDIBLE, Double Fucking Rainbow Returns is probably the sickest boss-theme ever. And Risk of Rain Returns fits perfectly, the other tracks like Coalescence Returns is really unique and very good.

The gameplay is fun, still super hard in good'all RoR fashion. I'm waiting to play more when mouse aiming gets added because it feels really clunky on some survivors right now. Artificer feels pretty bad still damage wise even though she got patched a few days ago but the other suvivors feel pretty well balanced to me currently.

Like the original - and unlike the 2nd game - it's side-scrolling, aim left and right, so controller controls are perfect for it (I just swapped the triggers as it feels more natural to have primary attack on RT). And I've been playing on my Asus ROG Ally while travelling, and even in silent mode (10W) in later stages when it's chaos on-screen it's a rock solid 60 FPS.

I wont leave a negative review like the other people because while I do have a couple of issues with the game, overall this game is great and I have had fun my entire time playing this game and the issues this game has I am very confident they will be addressed in future updates, just like in risk of rain 2.
I have two main issues with the game right now(and no I will not mention trials cause I personally enjoyed most of them) character balance and difficulty.
[h1]Character Balance[/h1] 
Now, while most of the characters feel fine to play there are quite a few of them that are a little....odd.
The main, and arguably worst, character I want to talk about is the artificer. I feel like I kind of understood what they were trying to do with this character, but what it boils down to is a very gimmicky and frustrating character to play as. Like you are supposed to kite the enemies around into a large group, block them off with ice wall, then use the abilities to mow them down with your ""high burst and DoT"". What actually happens is you kite around for 15 seconds with no mobility, to get all your cooldowns back, pop an ice wall, charge for 10 seconds and shoot your secondary in the wrong direction, and then use your flamer that's not sure if it wants to DPS or DoT while half the pack of mobs ignores the ice wall and mauls you down before you have time to do damage or cancel, all this to be less effective than most other character's LMB.
The other cast members that I have gripes with (acrid, sniper, bandit) are....fine, but I feel they could use some tweaks and they are the characters that I feel are also super gimmicky, but unlike artificer their gimmicks actually work for them.
The main character issues I have are with the character alternate abilities. Like....WTF are these? 70% of the alternate skills are straight up just bad. Like the teleport arrow for huntress, basically every single secondary skill for artificer (no surprise there), the drifter scrap cube, etc. Like all of these abilities felt like they were made for the providence trial puzzles alone and nothing else. Some of these abilities need like major balance changes or just be reworked entirely cause it feels like there is no point in wasting time in the trials/grinding the character getting these.
[h1]Difficulty[/h1]
Now before I continue I want to say I will put this section into two separate reasons that I believe is the cause of the seemingly high difficulty. Enemy scaling and item-to-enemy ratio.
So in the official risk of rain discord (shout out to the amazing dev team) they themselves confirmed to make the game feel a little more fair and less of a steamroll on our side is they scaled the enemy health and damage up so it wont end up as a giant one-shot fest. While Im all for this I feel this was a little over-tuned on their part as in levels, especially once you get to Stage 3 or so and once you get past the first loop then....well good luck from there. I personally play with damage taken at 75% as that makes it feel a little more like the original game, which is how I have fun.
The second issue is the item-to-enemy ratio. When playing through the game and grinding all the achievements, artifacts, items, etc. It became increasingly clear that there was a large gap between the amount of items you got in a stage and the sheer amount of enemies spawning at once. But it makes sense for solo, what about co-op? its just as bad there as the amount of chests feels almost the same as when playing solo and makes for a worse experience as it feels like you are fighting for items at time. I have had multiple runs where I load into a stage and NOT A SINGLE chest spawns in the entire area (IDK if its a bug with this, but I did report it to the risk of rain team and we'll see where it goes). So with very little items and enemies that can pile on and ramp up in damage and health it can make the game seem way more difficult than it actually is.
So for anybody reading this review, while these are issues with the game I can 100% recommend picking up this game and giving it a try. Don't let the doomers fool you into thinking this is an unpolished game. All the issues with this game are mostly addressed and will be fixed by hopoo.",1701071889,1701071889,True,1,0,0.497175127267837524,0,True,False,False

However, I do find the Providence Trials largely tedious and not enjoyable in the slightest... which makes the fact that some items and an artifact are unlocked solely through doing them even more exhausting. Locking certain skins behind the final trial is fair though. Furthermore, I do find a couple of the new enemies to be very annoying to fight, namely the Macrobe.

Risk of Rain Returns is a faithful ""remake"" of the original Risk of Rain 1, bringing back the original mechanics, while adding in new refinement from Risk of Rain 2, with new characters, items, enemies, and more to boot.

[h1] More than a Remake [/h1]
Despite technically being a remake, I would honestly say Risk of Rain Returns is more than that - many remakes are characterized by refinement of mechanics from the original, such as in the RE4 or Dead Space remakes, with not too much new. However, Return is a step up from that, with numerous new mechanics to play around with [spoiler] and the cute little fella, Robomando! [/spoiler]

[h1] Difficulty Done Well [/h1]
Risk of Rain Returns is a fairly difficult game compared to many modern roguelikes/lites nowadays, Risk of Rain 2 included. However, this is a preservation of the original game's difficulty, and it's preserved practically perfectly while also maintaining the refinement of a remake - compared to the original game's more clunky and bullet sponge-y enemies, Return drops the bullet sponge in favor of a somewhat more advanced AI, as well as the gameplan-changing ability for enemies to climb ropes, a huge change for those who played the original.

So no everyone, Return is not more ""difficult"" than Risk of Rain 2 - rather, Risk of Rain 2 is just got easier. 

[h1] Polished Control [/h1]
While the controls and movement are not to everyone's preference, Return smooths out the clunkiness (and lack of mouse binding!) from the original, allowing for a better overall experience and more comfortable feel.

In addition, the tricks to avoid being stopped when attacking continue to exist as well - try jumping just before you attack! 

The accessibility options are also a welcome change, even if they might end up accidentally breaking some characters, such as the Autofire option allowing Loader to just attack at maximum primary speed as opposed to you needing to tap the button to get that fast.

[h1] Graphical Refinement [/h1]
That said, the mechanics aren't the only well-maintained aspect of the game - the graphics have received a large upgrade, with much more detailed and polished designs and sprites, especially with the new logbook format allowing for excellent portraits and stage viewing. 

Some may not like the pixel art, but this was the style of the original, and frankly, the pixel art is part of the charm of the game, especially with the overhauls.

[h1] A Worthwhile Play [/h1]
All in all, Risk of Rain Returns is a very faithful ""remake"" of the original Risk of Rain 1, giving us many quality of life improvements, as well as entirely new content, and is something I'd recommend to roguelike/lite enjoyers as a whole, and of course to dedicated Risk of Rain fans as well.

It takes 1 or 2 videos and lots of failed easy difficulty runs to figure out the flow of the game but once you get the tempo down the game becomes way more enjoyable.

There are lots of different characters to unlock, each with different playstyles but mainly between ranged or melee playstyles with smaller differences in each character.

As youâre playing throughout the game youâll complete different challenges to unlock new items that will appear in your runs. The game also gives you lots of different âminigameâ type challenges that are a fun break from the normal game and reward you with new items, moves, or cosmetics on completion. These minigames and challenges provide you with a nice feeling of permanent progression in a rougelike game.

The amount of customization and replayability in this game is major and if you enjoy playing it youâll be able to play for a long time before getting burnt out. Each run youâll get different items, levels, and bosses, youâll have to play differently and try your best to adapt. (Or sometimes you get screwed over by bad rng like any other rougelike)

Watch some gameplay videos on this before you get it. Itâs nothing like any other rougelike Iâve played and did take me some time to get into, but now that I know how to play properly Iâm enjoying it a lot.

The only thing I hate about this game are those stupid green bird enemies that crash into you. If they kill me again Iâm going to change this review to a negative one.",1701050283,1701050283,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The best ones are locked behind finishing every single trial which is about 50 of them, i don't see why i have to suffer through these just so i can play the characters i want to play and to try the new skills when i've practically finished the damn game. it's a nice addition for hardcore andys but for casuals who just want to chill it's a waste of effort and time. 

if you want the normal experience i highly suggest finding a save file with the trial stuff unlocked so you can actually enjoy the risk of rain.",1701044112,1701044112,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It retains everything from the original and even leaves you the choice to not use some of the new stuff if you'd rather have the entirely original experience. But whether it's the art, the items, the survivors, the music, the difficulty (etc.), they all feel perfectly on par with the original game and improvements were actual improvements, not stylistic choices changed for no reason that make it derive from the source (art style being a big one, everything looks better but still feels the same).
Unfortunately, that also means some of the more frustrating things of the original game came along, but just gotta get good I guess? (like a challenge for not getting hit for 3 stages being a little much, or the way controls work sometimes can be frustrating)

The new additions are also pretty nice and fun, the new survivors and items, as well as the Providence Trials. Trials seem more or less fair depending, but I managed to finish even the most frustrating ones and they're not mandatory (at least for most things, there are two achievements for getting 5 and 15 with gold).

And the biggest of all is probably just having a multiplayer that works. It looks heavily inspired by what they did in Risk Of Rain 2, but that's good because the experience is very simple and straightforward (when before it was just a pain and even when port forwarding things correctly didn't work sometimes).

I think overall it's just a wonderful improvement of the original Risk Of Rain, there's not much reason to get the original when this exists (especially since you can play it with all the new additions disabled if you wish). And after Risk Of Rain 2, it's nice to see they understand their roots (and learned from Risk Of Rain 2 rather than let it define what they are), instead of trying to make Risk Of Rain Returns into something different.",1701036503,1701036503,True,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

They missed real hard with Artificer's primary (which is meant to be her main source of damage), the only way you can get away with using it is just with stuns and the ice wall, other than that, it isn't as snappy and high-damaging as her primary in Risk of Rain 2. I wish they gave her an alternate primary to mirror the ones she had in her previous game, which although were affected very little by attack speed increases, at least served their purpose as a consistent main source of damage. The new one is a wet noodle multi-hit attack that can't be used that consistently, so she generally feels one-note because you're just using nano bomb or flamethrower most of the time. as the damage output of the primary lacks so much impact. 
Another frustrating element has to do with how extreme the game makes its challenging aspects relative to how much the player can actually do to strategize or mitigate punishment. If there is an overloading enemy in a horde, there is no real way to single them out of the group, they will stay there and you just have to deal with getting your healthbar snapped in half constantly due to how frequent and high damage their absurd passive shock attacks are. Other challenging games at the very least attempt to give enough control to the player while also making enemies challenging, this is just ""there is no strategy, die"" but in the form of a single enemy gimmick. I believe this is mostly a fault of the 2D environment, it's something that i'm surprised doesn't seem to have been looked over as much as it should have. If you come from Risk of Rain 2 and are used to actually feeling like the game gives you a crumb of power while being fun, then you're probably gonna find that this game offers nothing in comparison. Almost no chests per stage, an alarmingly wide spread of items that offer minuscule impact to your gameplay, shrines having a consistent chance of giving you equipment repeatedly, and characters like artificer feeling very weak while others like enforcer, loader, and drifter being given insane gimmicks are just a handful of consistent problems that really take the fun out of the game.

+ Solid gameplay
+ The theme of RoR is as classy as ever.
+ Good class spread
+ Decent build variety across runs.

[h2]Cons[/h2]
- Running across maps with a lot of it being kind of empty is just really unrewarding.
- Platforming alternates between being simple and being too slippery depending on your speed.
- Control inputs feel clunky. From minor details like aim being where you face to not having much control over your momentum (in a platformer...) and the more jarring things like attacks needing to play out before a skill input can be received.

-----------

[h1]Summary[/h1]
It's a fun enough game and if I rated in a vacuum, I would actually recommend it.
RoR:Returns is nowhere as much of a lightning-in-a-bottle experience as RoR2.
Nor is it as good a platformer roguelite of any note, from Spelunky to Dead Cells.
As it is now, there's dozens of roguelite platformers I'd recommend over this if you want to see the true potential of this genre, which I'm sad to say, for my current 11 hours, RoR:R hasn't matched.

I don't have enough time on this game to give more feedback on the intricacies of the game, so this review may receive updates if I change my mind at some point. For context, I've not played the OG RoR.",1701020353,1701021849,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Don't forget to do trials to unlock more character abilities if you do not want to grind one character at a time to unlock all the abilities. Some characters have skills that didn't seem that helpful in single player game play for speed which is a large component of the game. However, with friends you can use any character as long as someone on the team has speed. Once you get the hang of the game I can see how almost any character would be possible for single player. Art is cool, concept is fun, getting loaded on items is satisfying, playing with friends can limit the number of items each of you get, short 15-30min games depending on your speed.",1701021825,1701021825,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Beaten the game 7 times now, attempted the game over a hundred. It's such a blast.

This is just like the original RoR but there are some new enemies, items, and CHARACTERS. I LOVE PILOT I LOVE LOADER.

The updated art and animations do wonders for clarity in this game and there are a lot of little qol details all over the place. The game was about zooming out as far as you were comfortable with and dodging tons of various enemy attacks which really cannot be avoided by simple disengage/run away tactics. Now it's easier to see the enemies, what they're up to, etc.
QOL includes: Ability to leave a floor after beating the boss, rather than ALL enemies. Tighter controls and small movement changes, like skill buffering and the ability for certain characters to ""strafe"" to some degree, make the game way more comfortable. Accessibility options that let you drastically cut enemy damage output, great for if you want to explore stages.

There are options to change the rulesets to more similarly resemble the original RoR, so I can say that RoRR is the definitive version to own.

This was mostly to praise the improvements RoRR made on the classic formula, but here's the general rhythm this game follows.
Survivor crashes on a semi-randomized environment(stages are pre-built levels but there are several variants for each stage) and scrounges for items while searching for the teleporter. You want to balance item collection with speed of progress... because the game's difficulty is on a clock and everything gets a lot harder every 5 minutes.
After going through several stages there's a temple stage and you can choose to loop or to teleport back to the ship you abandoned in the intro, using the ship to ultimately escape the planet.
There are tons of fun characters and items, the way you need to fight enemies and avoid their attacks is the brutal star of the show. Early on you'll find enemies simple and inept but later there will be some devious attack patterns that require thoughtful movement to avoid, and then you're fighting dozens of enemies at a time. Frightful.
Tons of fun items, there seems to be this wonderfully inconsistent consistency to the game. Hard to explain, you can often rely on finding certain items you feel like you ""need"" until you get a run where you don't find those but you're still fine just thanks to totally different circumstances.

TL;DR - play as a few pixel tall character fighting tons of slightly more pixels tall enemies in this interesting take on the rogue like formula. Balance the constant race against the difficulty increasing clock with item collection, have fun with nasty attack patterns from hectic mobs of enemies. btw the final boss is so awesome, I hope you enjoy.",1701019845,1701019845,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is an absolute masterpiece that effortlessly combines the best elements of its predecessor with fresh, exciting features that make it a must-play for both fans of the series and newcomers alike.

The first thing that struck me was the stunning visual upgrade. The art style retains the charm of the original game but with a level of polish that's truly awe-inspiring. The attention to detail in the character designs, environments, and special effects is nothing short of breathtaking. The world of Risk of Rain has never looked this vibrant and alive, making each playthrough a visual treat.

But visuals alone don't make a great game, and ""Risk of Rain Returns"" knows that. The gameplay is where this title truly shines. The core mechanics that made the original a hit are still present and refined, providing a satisfying blend of challenge and reward. The addition of new characters, each with unique abilities and playstyles, adds an extra layer of strategy to the mix. It's a joy experimenting with different combinations to find the perfect synergy for your playstyle.

The level design is another standout feature. The procedurally generated worlds are more dynamic and diverse than ever, keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting with each run. The sense of exploration is heightened, as you never know what challenges or treasures await around the next corner. It's this unpredictability that keeps you coming back for one more run, and then another, and another.

The soundtrack deserves special mention, as it perfectly complements the game's intense and atmospheric moments. The music seamlessly transitions between calm exploration and heart-pounding battles, enhancing the overall immersive experience.

In conclusion,  is a triumph. It successfully builds upon the strengths of the original while introducing new elements that elevate the experience to new heights. Whether you're a long-time fan of the series or a newcomer looking for a captivating roguelike experience, this game is an absolute gem.

4) there are a shit ton of 'backflip' abilities, is that some kind of a dev fetish? they feel very fucky
5) zoom slider is shit, it makes annoying sounds and you can't lock it

1) AMAZING new resprites

It is also very sad that Gearbox is making a survivors/gacha game using the IP.  I cherish Risk of Rain and it's not making me happy seeing what it's become over the course of 10 mostly good years.

Risk of Rain Returns maintains the addictive core gameplay of the original while adding exciting new elements. Playing as one of 15 unique Survivors with fresh abilities keeps the experience dynamic. Personally, the Huntress's hit-and-run style was immensely satisfying.

The departure from automatic homing shots in the sequel adds a welcomed challenge, demanding precision. The introduction of a platforming element and potential fall damage adds strategic depth. The adjustment becomes second nature, enhancing the overall experience.

Enemy Dynamics create a dynamic environment, requiring adaptability. Some enemies can't navigate certain terrain, while others possess unique traversal abilities, keeping every encounter unique and challenging.

The game's Visuals and Atmosphere retain a distinct style, revitalizing Petrichor V. Hazardous lava and towering heights in certain biomes intensify the atmosphere, reinforcing the need for constant movement and strategic positioning.

Conclusion: Risk of Rain Returns is a nostalgic yet refreshing journey for fans of the roguelike genre. Whether you're familiar with the series or a newcomer, the game's thoughtful additions and commitment to the signature gameplay make it a must-play for any roguelike enthusiast.

Some providence trials seem a little too unbalanced and unfair, like the fireball artificer and the shotgun enforcer, where i spent 10+ tries and couldn't even get halfway, while most others i could do in 5 or less. Some trials are also just annoying like the pilot parachute one, took me forever because it's essentially just trial and error to figure out the best routes and items. No doubt there is a decent amount of content, but 2D games are not my style, so i'll probably just go back to ror2 when dlc2 comes out

I was unsure about this one, since again, I had never played the first, and thought that the 2D format might ruin it for me. I had another friend who loved the first one, and when the remake came out I saw he was playing it on day one. I messaged him to ask it how it was and he said it was fantastic and I should totally get it. Thing was on sale too, on day one.

It took a little getting used to, since some of the familiar items have different effects, and this game is definitely harder than the sequel (even with the benefit of Command), but damn is it fun.

I think this game at my current playtime is already worth the money I have a lot of fun. I've been doing lots of challenges (trials of providence) and they are just that, challenging and tons of fun to retry and get better at. 
The music is sensational as per usual with Chris Christodoulou. 
Some people say that the difficulty is very high but it is hard to agree, I feel like it is just right but the discovery of every maps makes you sub-optimal on your first runs.
The only thing I dislike about this game, at the moment, is that your character launches spells in the direction he is moving instead of where your cursor is.

    [*]Incredible soundtrack.

The crowd this game is trying to appease is the veterans looking for a feeling of Nostaliga. If you're like me and didn't play this game back in the day but played RoR2 first then I would strongly advise against getting it. 

Pros: 
1. Some of the abilities feel cool I guess. 
2. A lot of characters to unlock right from the start. 
3. At least the game was cheap as dirt. 

Complaints: 
1. Maps are way too big for how absolutely empty they feel. Feels like you can't find loot and finding the teleporter is a massive pain.
2. Moving around is slow and clunky and both jumping + the ""movement utilities"" feel absolutely pathetic. 
3. Item text is too small and vanishes too quickly imo. Still don't know what half of things I picked up did.  
4. The maps are terrible and uninspired from an artistic point of view. None of them stand out to me. 
5. The power scaling feels like it's all over the place and extremely inconsistent. Sometimes I'd get lots of items and it felt like it didn't matter and other times I'd barely have any items and it'd go about the same as any other time. 

TLDR; It's boring and I'd much rather be on RoR 2 or bang my head against a game like Noita than continue to slog through another dull moment of whatever this is.",1700942776,1700943484,False,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

dodging enemy fire by jumping often feels like a toss up, mainly because of how limited your movement is in 2D, but that's okay imo. it just kind of forces you to really outscale the enemies or else you DIE die.

- Cremator is just uber broing and made you travel through the whole map.. There's 2, and both of their attacks are super strong, their projectiles travel through the whole map too.

It borrows a lot of mechanics from ROR2 that makes the gameplay more streamlined and sensible for new players, or others coming from the second game. That's all it really does though: expands on the original. There are still glaring problems with the game as far as enemy and environment balancing, especially on monsoon difficulty. Certain new enemies such as swifts can spawn in massive amounts (and with many elites among them), which almost guarantees the end of your run. Certain bosses such as the toxic beast and cremator pose extreme threats, and for some characters are nearly impossible to kill without cheesing them. The extreme variability in chest spawns can also be run ending if you happen to suffer low numbers for multiple stages in a row. Some stages are also hard to navigate as the foreground and background are at times indistinguishable, which can lead to a frustrating death in some situations; the odd shape of the levels doesn't help either. Most of this I can dismiss as the brutal charm of the game, and these criticisms are easy for me to overlook; however, I know many won't feel the same way. I think the game is worth a try if you love a challenge or enjoyed the first game despite its shallow content. If you hated the 2013 version for any more than that: then I'm not confident that you would enjoy this one.",1700928415,1700928465,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Since it has just released, some elements (mainly a handful of the Providence Trials...) are still leaning into ""Difficult and unfun"", but for normal gameplay, the developers have made it way more flexible than they technically needed to.
In singleplayer, and multiplayer, there are options for intensity (and in the case of Multiplayer, the host can even let individual players tailor their intensity settings to their liking) in the form of buffing, or nerfing, both incoming and outgoing damage to/from the player.

Hopoo, as they always have, do NOT lock achievements or most unlocks behind not having artifacts or other ""cheats"" enabled. You could unlock everything with Sacrifice and Command (some of the most powerful artifacts available) while maxing out your outgoing damage and minimizing incoming damage, without that progress mysteriously not applying or vanishing.

Even if, like me, you have a tendency to get ""skill issue'd"", you'll still be able to pick this up and have fun, especially in Multiplayer.

Another thing to keep in mind is the game (as of writing) is still a pretty new release, so there's still a lot to iron out.

It is not just a simple port or a graphical update, but a complete overhaul of the original game with new content, mechanics, and improvements. It is a tribute to the fans of the series and a celebration of the genre.

The first thing that stands out in Risk of Rain Returns is the beautiful graphics. The game has been remastered with high-resolution sprites, smooth animations, dynamic lighting, and stunning effects. The game looks gorgeous and runs smoothly on modern platforms. The art style is faithful to the original game, but with more details and polish. The game also features a new soundtrack by Chris Christodoulou, the composer of Risk of Rain 2, which adds to the atmosphere and mood of the game.

The gameplay of Risk of Rain Returns is similar to the original game, but with more depth and variety. The game still follows the same formula of landing on a mysterious planet, fighting through randomly generated levels, collecting items, and escaping. However, the game has added new features and elements that make each run more unique and challenging.

One of the new features is the introduction of two entirely new survivors: The Drifter and The Engineer. The Drifter is a resourceful brawler who can gather scrap from enemies and use it to spawn items that boost her and her teammates. She can also take the items for herself and unleash powerful attacks. The Engineer is a versatile survivor who can deploy turrets, mines, drones, and shields. He can also upgrade his equipment and switch between different modes. These two survivors join the 13 returning survivors from the original game, each with their own abilities and playstyles.

Another new feature is the addition of secrets and artifacts. Secrets are hidden areas and events that can be found by exploring the levels and interacting with the environment. They can reveal lore, items, challenges, or even new levels. Artifacts are gameplay modifiers that can be activated before or during a run. They can change the rules of the game, such as enabling friendly fire, randomizing item drops, or spawning more enemies. Artifacts can make the game easier or harder, depending on the playerâs preference.

The game also features an overhauled multiplayer mode, which supports up to four players online or locally. The multiplayer mode has been improved with new and better services, such as cross-play, matchmaking, leaderboards, and chat. The game also has a new mode called Prismatic Trials, which are seeded runs that change every 48 hours. In this mode, players can compete with each other on a global leaderboard, or cooperate to achieve the best time.

Risk of Rain Returns is a game that is faithful to its roots, but also expands and improves on them. It is a game that is fun, challenging, and replayable. It is a game that is full of surprises, secrets, and discoveries. It is a game that is a must-play for fans of the series and the genre. It is a game that is a masterpiece of roguelike design.",1699705788,1700902898,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Positive:

Graphics 10/10: I want to highlight how amazing this game looks. For a pixel art game, it is incredibly vibrant and full of life and makes the 2013 risk of rain look like an NES game. The environments all look amazing and the character sprites are a lot more expressive now. I also really like the new logbook artwork and look forward to seeing each new drawing whenever I pick one up..

Gameplay 10/10: Although it's basically similar to the original risk of rain, there are some new tweaks in the gameplay that make it more enjoyable. The fact that you no longer have to eliminate every enemy on the map in order to move on to the next stage makes the game a lot less tedious.

Soundtrack 10/10: All of the amazing songs from the original ost have gotten some minor audio enhancements (I literally cannot tell the difference)  with the addition of 4 new ones. Coalescence Returns is especially my favorite and the vocals in it are amazing.

Accessability 10/10: I wouldn't normally rate a game based on this, but the amount of customization in the game's settings, both technical and gameplay-related, is very vast and I can tell they put a lot of effort into making this game enjoyable for everyone. They didn't have to add add in pre-made control mappings, but they did it anyways.

Negative:

There is only one very miniscule change from the original game to this version that I didn't like. In risk of rain (2013), you are able to assign multiple actions to one key.  This allowed me to make the ""jump"" and ""climb rope"" button both the same and made the games platforming less annoying. However, RORR does not let you do that. Again, this is very minor, but it kind of bothered me.

Other Notes:

The new providence trials range from stupidly easy to mindbogglingly difficult. I could never figure out how to beat the ""scavenger hunt"" one. 

I love finally being able to play this game's multiplayer without having to get a PHD in software engineering.

Enforcer and Mercenary canonically have beef. 

FINAL BOSS SPOILERS: [spoiler] I love the changes they made to the Providence fight. The surprise fourth phase genuinely caught me off guard the first time [/spoiler]

END CREDITS SPOILERS???: [spoiler] One thing the confused me is, during the end credits, there is a showcase of all the enemies that you encounter in the game with their sprite from Risk of rain (2013) next to their remastered sprite from this game. However, some of the new enemies that are exclusive to this game also have ror (2013) sprites. Did they just redraw them in the original game's artstyle for shits and giggles? Not sure why they did that, but cool.  [/spoiler]

If you expected something different this is not the product for you. However if you enjoy Risk of Rain, and the overall feel and gameplay loop then this is the product for you.

This game is fun but there are a few minor problems I have with it.
My first being the delay in changing directions. Besides the Huntress, every other character has to finish their animation before turning. Huntress locks onto the nearest enemy automatically.
The second being the damage output. I haven't noticed any items that directly improve damage. That and certain characters feel vastly underpowered compared to others. I love the Bandit but their ""150% Damage"" Blast might as well be me using a cotton ball launcher.

That's about it. I enjoy Risk of Rain, always has been a frustrating experience full of joy and baddassery. But this game feels like something that would be an Easter Egg in another game not a standalone experience.",1700892743,1700892743,True,1,0,0.514600872993469238,0,True,False,False

I haven't really messed with the providence trials too much but that also brings another mode and way to unlock alternative skills, something that wasn't present in the first game.

Risk of Rain can be as difficult as you want it to be, or easier with the modifiers and artifacts, Personally I'm going to play this in my spare time with friends but I'll also go back to Risk of Rain 2 as well.

Music is straight up fire, and many stage themes are a straight improvement over the originals, such as surface tension returns, and the surprise Double F!$%ing Rainbow Returns. #ChrisDontMiss

However, it has many frustrating flaws that drag down the fun gameplay.

1) The inability to switch directions while firing or performing an action (This and the inability to move while shooting was originally also implemented in the original ROR1, however devs decided to forgo the inability to move while shooting in favour of a more flowy experience)

2) Parkour and gravity feeling extremely different to most platformers makes it a uniquely unsatisfying experience when performing tougher parkour challenges (such as the parkour towards the artifact of spite)

3) RNG on your runs dictating certain unlocks, such as miner's unlock and acrid's unlock only appearing on certain variations on certain maps, that might not even get chosen for your map pool because, rng? Its a mistake not to allow stages to change or be randomly picked while continuously looping (Just like how it was implemented in ROR2), having to LOOP AGAIN OR START ANOTHER NEW RUN because your wanted stage or variation did not get chosen for your stage pool.

4) Animation locking - Specifically the inability to cancel or use another input until your animation is finished, this is especially apparently for something like trying to climb ropes, only to realize you missed the jump because you were attacking during the attempt to climb the rope, which results in completely missing the rope.

5) MASSIVE STAGES - on stages 1 to 2, if you're not actively moving around trying to find the teleporter, it can take you upwards of 2 to 3 minutes to even find the teleporter in the first place. The scarcity of interactables exacerbates these issues to the point where you may die on stage 2 monsoon because you've been outscaled by the game, spending too long looking for the teleporter.

6) Providence trials - Easily the worst addition to the game. These are essentially level edited maps of the selection you encounter in game that are specifically tailored to the trial you complete, most of them are time trials, but some are survival trials, and some just feel like tutorials.

Some of these are enjoyable (mostly the mobility focused trials), such as commando's slide unlock, pilot's gliding trial, acrid's dissolving ambush and caustic sludge parkour trial or the final JUDGEMENT trial. But the majority are plain frustrating to go through, both because of the game's frustrating controls and jank preventing you completing the trial properly while being completely irrelevant to the main game (We all had fun during Hot-Rope Hop, right? RIGHT?!?!). 

Like huntress's alternate utility warp dart. In WHAT situation would that be more useful than an immediate blink with no room for error? Some abilities feel like they are just made for the trials, and that ends its usage which is completely idiotic in concept.
 
Some unlocks are also GATED BEHIND MULTIPLE PROVIDENCE TRIALS, such as kited blades locking out the Arcane Blades for players to pick up on their own runs. Because you DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE PROVIDENCE TRIALS AT ONCE, they must be completed in a certain sequence. So it is entirely possible for multiple unlocks to be gated behind EVEN MORE TRIALS.

Most of the trials here have nothing to do with the main game either. Players should not have to play ANY of these trials to unlock key items, and the items that ARE gated behind providence trial unlocks should have alternate ways to unlock them so players do not have to endure the frustration fest that is the trials. (Just like how the survivor skills have alternate unlocks, such as collecting 300 items, or getting to stage 25 etc.)

Having crowned around 90% of all the trials, I can confidently say it has been one of the most frustrating experiences that Ive ever experienced in an ROR game, and Ive fully 100% ROR2 with all the challenges which did not even come close to the amount of frustration Ive had with Provi trials.",1700885044,1700885044,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have never played the original RoR before. I am not sure why but something about the game just never appeal to me. And now it returns, with both the original stuff and those from RoR2. Risk Of Rain Return's improved visual, and my love for the second game finally reel me in. I jump right into this reboot and fall in love with it immediately. Of course there are some stiff learning curves when it come to the transition from 3D to 2D run'n'gun, and the map knowledge as well. The experience stays the same. It is still the same running and gunning. It is still the same stacking items to make your stats absurdly high to the point of defying space-time continuum. It is still the same situation if you stop moving for 0.5 second a horde of elites will instantly vaporize you. In addition, RoRR also introduce a new way to unlock survivors' alternate abilities, which is something I cannot praise enough.

[h1]Things I Like About Risk Of Rain Return:[/h1]

[b]1. Gameplay[/b]
Coming from RoR2, the 2D platforming of RoRR gives me quite a pickle. You can go any direction in a 3D environment, but you can only go up-down-left-right in a 2D one. This, naturally, creates some frustration. However, as hours and hours dumped into the game, I grow to love this game, in a quite different way comparing to RoR2. Learning which enemy can climb ledges is important. You need to bait away the enemies with high mobility while gunning down others from the high ground. I would even say that RoRR focuses more on map knowledge than the second one. Because enemies also suffer from fall damage, baiting them into geysor with you is a great way to create breathing room and deal some decent damage. Another thing worth mentioning is that since you and your enemies are fighting on the same platform(except those accursed jellyfishes), abilities with homing trait or penetration are highly preferred. Again, because of 2D environment and Rain of Rain, later stages can become really chaotic with tons of enemies and visuals clogging your screen. It is just as terrifying as RoR2, and I love every second.

[b]2. Providence's Trials[/b]
This is the wonderful feature I love. One of the prominent characteristic of the RoR franchise is the challenge to unlock new survivors and their alternate abilities. Some may be easy like collect a certain amount of drone, but some can be really hard to pull off. I still vividly remember how many times I've attempted to unlock Bandit's alternate secondary. Now with Risk Of Rain Return, the hard challenges are still there, but there are alternative way to unlock the alternate abilities. Providence's Trials offer customized challenges that are designed around the unlockable abilities or mini games. For example, Huntress' ""Where You Want To Be"" trial allows players to practice using Warp Dart to teleport to various high platforms, while Bandit's ""Retrograde"" trial give players the taste ""what if Castlevania but made with Risk Of Rain"". Of course players are unnecessary to do those trials to get the abilities. The OG way still stands.

[b]3. Other Compliments[/b]
âThe music still slaps.
âCrazy item stacks to get god-like power.
âI love every survivor's ready-up animation.
âEach level hides lots of secret passages for unlockables and lore text logs.
âMany survivors, abilities, and skins to unlock.
âFunny that my favorite survivors in RoR2 become my least in RoRR.

[h1]Things I Dislike About Risk Of Rain Return:[/h1]

[b]1. Maps May Be Too Long, Or Empty?[/b]
This is the only major problem I have towards the game. I am not sure this is due to level generation or because of specific maps, but in many runs I often go through a lot of platforms and corners to find nothing at the end. It is frustrating to run around the whole map and has no way to spend the coins. In Risk Of Rain, finding items fast is just as important as your maneuver, and this situation not only wastes time but also might ruin the run because of the speeding up difficulty. Maybe it is done to hide secret passages, or maybe it is trying to connect different terrains together. No matter what, the frustration is there and I cannot deny it.

[b]2. Other Complaints[/b]
âFlying enemies can be massive pain in the butt for specific survivors.
âSome challenges in the main game are absurdly hard and RNG-reliant.

On these metrics this is a good game. However, as the product that comes after Risk of Rain 2? This is quite sad and a departure of quality.

It is important to preface that I think Risk of Rain 2 is one of the best rougelikes out there. The items are fun, the gameplay is compelling and immensely replayable, and though rng based in terms of items, with enough skill you can overcome most challenges. In this regard, it is a bit unfair to compare this game to that as it was almost certain the product wouldn't've measured up however that is the most apt comparison.

This game being a 2d side-scroller which is very different from RoR2 being 3d and leads to a bunch of downgrades from RoR2. First, it is significantly harder to dodge attacks. You WILL take damage which is pretty bad because that means you are much more reliant on items to protect or heal you. Unlike in RoR2 where skill can supplement, getting bad items means you might as well quit your run cause you're going to get killed eventually unless you are one of the 2 or 3 characters that can manage without.

Second, items are just way weaker here than in RoR2. I don't know what Hopoo has against fun, what with all the stupid, misguided decisions they made with nerfing items or mercenary in RoR2 but its in full force here. This again means you're much more reliant on items of the right types and quantities to get a decent run off the ground. 

Third, though fixed with enough time and getting used to things, the game gives you what I would consider to be the worst characters in the game to start with. For the aforementioned reasons, it's pretty rough. 

Fourth, the lack of inclusions of features from RoR2, like scrappers and 3d printers is disappointing to see. 
There are other nitpicks to the game but I will leave it as is.

Fifth, Providence Trials are neat. It is more content so regardless of the quality, that is always a plus. While some are fun, others lean more towards irritating, with a few (especially when trying to get gold ranks) being purely frustrating. The last providence trials not allowing you to select alternate abilities is very disappointing and lame as well.

Sixth, until I see more to prove me wrong online, there is a disappointing lack of secrets (unless you count unlocking items or artifacts which I do not). This was true of 2 as well so its sad to see that this has not changed.

TL;DR: This game is quite the step back from the fun and quality of RoR2 with the game being significantly more item and thus RNG reliant to get a good run going. Skill can still allow people to succeed in bad runs but the limiting 2d aspect of this game makes that be more of a matter of running away for awhile than proper kiting leading to boring gameplay. Do not let these criticisms fool you, this is a good game by regular metrics. However it is disappointing to see this be the follow-up from Hopoo, especially considering that this is what they decided to focus on after dropping support for RoR2 as fast as possible.",1700876596,1700876650,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Do you hate roguelites as a genre, or do you hate 2d sidescrollers?[/b]
[list]
[*]If yes to either of those, you can probably skip this. Or just try it out, just in case your expectations are wrong.
[*]Otherwise, go on to the other questions:
[/list]

[b]If you never played RoR 1/2:[/b]
[list]
[*]Choose if you enjoy 3rd person shooters or 2d sidescrollers more, and buy the one you prefer. They're both excellent games, with similar content.
[/list]

[b]If you played RoR1 a decade ago:[/b]
[list]
[*]This can be a good excuse to replay the game, with some added content. Realistically a modded original RoR can give ""better"" results for now, but if you can't bother with modding, this is just objectively a better version of the game.
[*]If you did [b]not[/b] enjoy original RoR1, this remake probably won't change that. There's just more content and a few small(ish) tweaks.
[/list]

[b]If you played RoR2 and enjoyed it, but never played RoR1:[/b]
[list]
[*]Considering the content structure is somewhat similar, the main difference is just 3rd person shooter vs. 2d sidescroller. If playing a game with similar content but completely different gameplay sounds like a fun concept, go for it.

Positives:
Great music
Great gameplay loop of Risk of Rain
Great artistic style
Many distinct characters
Actual procedurally generated stages


Negatives:
1. Base movement is a lot more restrictive than in RoR2. This means any mistake in platforming (which generally isn't too difficult, at least) can be extremely punishing. Comparing the game to RoR2 or Dead Cells (Another platforming roguelike), it feels like you have less options to outplay enemies with movement.
2. To not get lost on the procedurally generated stages or mess up your pathing, I felt obligated to zoom out the screen in options. While helpful, it also makes everything tiny and hard to look at on a laptop.
3. Items seem less impactful than in Risk of Rain 2. It might be just because I don't know what many of them do yet, but I haven't had the feeling of a run being ""saved"" by a godly item like in RoR2 or other roguelikes. I do understand that many of the same item concepts have vastly different implications in a 2D vs 3D game.
4. Combining all of these (slower movement, zoomed out screen, less impressive items), the game as a whole feels pretty slow paced. Not necessarily a bad thing, but personally I like my action roguelikes fast-paced.

Lot more listed in negatives simply because that's how the human mind works, but I still think the game is fun. I've already rage alt+f4'd a couple times, but I've always ended up loading it up again later.

Fans of Risk of Rain 1 will get to enjoy the soundtrack again and experience what the newer items from Risk of Rain 2 feel like in a 2D environment, along with a couple of new characters. Not all of these characters and/or their abilities transitioned well between 3D and 2D though and it's VERY apparent. The difficulty for unlocking things, between Trials and Achievements, varies wildly, to the point where I've seen many people express frustration at attempting to achieve gold on the Trials. I think they're a great way to become acclimated to abilities or give the player fun ways to unlock new abilities/items, but gold metals in these give too little reward for the amount of effort most players will be willing to put towards achieving them. While this remake/re-release is nice for people like me who enjoyed the original and like to see the animation updates and have additional lore and nice pixel art to appreciate, the lack of quality of life updates suggests this is not a priority for Gearbox/Hoppo. Faithful remakes are nice and all, but you can take out the things that were bad and replace them.

The graphics are amazing and it plays beautifully. Soundtracks still hits hard. Some of the changes are great (teleporter not requiring to kill all the mobs from the map) some a bit less(character abilities, especially Huntress). I would also want to see more of an overhaul to the maps themselves. 

I didn't play enough to see all the item changes, but it feels like it's a bit more difficult to get a ""god run""(might be an user error though)

Although i prefer the original this is still an easy recommendation!

edit: Zoom scale x2 looks great but if you want to be more efficient you should play on zoom scale x1, you will see a lot more of the map and plan your route accordingly.

The game itself definitely gives me a feeling of nostalgia from all those hours i spent playing the original Risk of Rain but other than being true to the original, it HEAVILY improves on all aspects, both graphical and game-play wise.
The game can feel quite difficult, especially when starting fresh but more often than not, i find myself thinking of how i could have avoided my death by having done something different.
Of course that may not always be the case and i have come across situations that felt simply unfair but im not too harsh about it since its usually a minor inconvenience and besides, the balancing can, and is always being tweaked.

Risk of Rain Returns is a roguelite platformer open-world bullet hell. If this sounds appealing to you, go ahead and get the game. You will not be disappointed. If you are unsure of what that means or if is the right fit for you, continue reading.
   This game has an immensely high skill ceiling. Every time you die, and you will die, you will find yourself at fault for your death. Whether it be poor time management, bad dodging, or incorrect item choice, whatever happens to you is your fault. Whilst there is an immense amount of luck involved in this game, you can always win no matter what RNG says. The best way to describe it is in terms of poker: The game will always deal you a run or a flush, and it is up to you to bluff or bet your way to victory.

**People who will want this game**
   
+ If you love platformers, this is a game for you.
+ If you don't mind platformers but you just really want to find another Dead Cells, this game is certainly for you.
+ If you want more of that iconic action-packed strategy of the first two Risk of Rain games, this is for you.
+ If you love the tactics and strategy of RTS games but want something a bit more personal, get this game.
+If you love uncovering mysteries and hidden narrative 

**People who will not be satisfied with this game**
- If you do not like hardcore games
- If platformers are something you avoid
- If bullet hells like Just Shapes and Beats are too chaotic for you
- if being overwhelmed is not something you enjoy

Plenty of others will tell you how the game is played. Rather than summarize old information, I'll quickly hit the highs and lows of the product: 

+The art style is stunningly well-made.
+ The story underneath the surface of the roguelite is touching and intense.
+ Each Survivor feels like a completely new game.
+ Easily replayable into the hundreds or thousands of hours. Worth your money.
+ Excellent balance and unparalleled passion for a fair experience.
+ One of the best couch co-op games out there.
+Secrets galore!

- As of now, you have to zoom out to the max if you want to find items easily. This hampers the personality of the survivors and detaches you from your character. **Hoppoo is currently working on fixing this.**
- Two characters are slightly more powerful than the rest due to their speed (Huntress and Pilot).
- Can get very boring if you don't actively attempt to get better at the game.
-Parkour requires dexterity and could be unfavorable to people who dislike platformers.

I hope this educates your purchasing decision. Thank you for reading!",1700855089,1700855089,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This remaster beautifully revitalizes that original game, fixing a lot of the balancing issues without removing any of the content, and instead adding plenty to it. 
It was always a harder game than RoR2, but now it feels fair with its difficulty, and I'm having tons of fun revisiting this remaster with the friends I made in RoR2, sharing my game knowledge with them as I re-explore the familiar terrain.

If you are like me, and enjoy Risk of Rain 1 more than 2, or enjoy 2-D roguelites more than 3-D roguelite/roguelikes, you will be absolutely amazed at the quality Risk of Rain Returns has to offer. The highly improved pixel art, with much more fluid animations than the first, brings about a feeling of nostalgia while still feeling like a new game. Its familiar, yet it looks so dusted off and cleaned up that it feels good to play it. This is coming from a decade-old fan of the series.

The 2-D platforming is very similar to that of the original in terms of movement and physics. The environments and characters have been revamped to look more interesting while you are running about, killing the monsters on the different planets. Its the little things that count in a game like this, and especially in a remaster. For example, when Commando shoots, his hands alternate every second of firing to switch out which gun he is firing with. It is accompanied by muzzle flashes on his body and in front of the gun. The bullets don't go in a perfectly straight line when you use your suppressive fire, and every now and then one goes astray (and actually misses the target, too!). The details are immaculate, and the game looks beautiful in every aspect. 

The one downside to Risk of Rain Returns, in my opinion, is that we don't get a new soundtrack. I think most fans can agree, one of the best parts of the series is the incredible music by Christ Christodoulou. We get a few remixes at the end of the album, but just remasters throughout the stages while playing. It a minor complaintâbut if I am going to be honest, a new soundtrack was something I was looking forward to the most out of this game. 

To my knowledge, there are new items and/or items from Risk of Rain 2 that were put into the game, so I am highly looking forward to a new experience in this 2-D universe I am already accustomed to. I am excited to continue playing this game, and hopefully I can eventually get 100% of the achievements on it like I did the original. I love Risk of Rain, and I think I'm going to love Risk of Rain Returns, too.

this is a great modernized take on the original risk of rain. definitely improves a lot of aspects in the old version but maintains what made the original so fun. my only critique is that stage traversal can be tedious (especially on Ancient Tundra) and chest spawns are not plentiful (although this might just be me getting used to RoR2's chest spawns). overall a very solid game, and i will look forward to many hours of the planet destroying me",1699758285,1700827779,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It really is just how you remember RoR1, for all that encompasses to mean, but with new content - like how Age of Empires 2 keeps getting new DLC.

In particular, it feels like they made the platforming slightly more forgiving; in the first game I would often waste a lot of time repeatedly failing basic jumps because they were unreasonably precise. You can also now (slowly) move while attacking which makes the game feel so much more dynamic and fair. 
The updated art style is simply phenomenal. It's beautiful and detailed pixel art that completely preserves the feel of the original designs while adding to them.
This is more than just a remake though. Returns ads a lot of awesome content like new survivors, items, alternative loadouts (like in RoR2), mechanics and more!
Overall I think Risk of Rain Returns is an excellent remake. I used to really like RoR1 but I stopped playing because of how difficult and clunky it was and never revisited it for those reasons. It was super awesome but some aspects of the gameplay just didn't feel good. I'm so glad there is now a version that addresses all these issues I had and improves the game as a whole. I can finally re-experience this fantastic piece of art.

There's loads of secrets and things to unlock for your next play through so you're not just stuck with the same thing ad nausea. 

As someone who sunk countless hours into the original and it's sequel, this was a highly anticipated game and boy it delivered. And it's only going to get better with mods.

[*]The tight, core 2D gameplay of RoR1 is back and better than ever.
[*]Beautiful spritework, both for old and new content. It all captures what the original game was going for and looks nice while doing it.
[*]Legendary soundtrack. Chris Christodoulou's work is unparalleled. 
[*]The Providence Trials are a wonderful addition.
[*]New content added to regular runs to keep the game fresh, such as new items, stages, enemies, alternate skills, and [spoiler]four[/spoiler] new playable survivors.
[*]Actual online multiplayer this time, and it seems to work seamlessly.
[*]Plenty of quality of life adjustments to the returning survivors, such as Engineer's turrets retaining his items like in RoR2.
[*]You get a LOT of content out of this for $15.
[/list]

[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]
[list]
[*]Abrupt difficulty spikes are present in some of the Providence Trials (which they seem to be taking feedback on)
[*]The game performance dips tremendously with certain artifact combinations/when too many enemies are present. (Though this is only in very extreme cases.)
[/list]

[b][u]Conclusion:[/u][/b]
If this is Hopoo's love letter to fans before moving onto other things, I honestly couldn't have asked for anything better. Risk of Rain 1 was already a notably solid and fun game, but this remake manages to push it even further. So much thought and care was put into every little detail that this was probably what the devs had originally envisioned for this game back when it was just a college project, but they just didn't have the resources to do it at the time. But now we all get to witness their vision in its beautiful glory. The amount of effort put into making sure this game feels like the original both aesthetically and mechanically, but still making it feel ""fresh"" is something to behold. If you're a fan of the roguelite genre you can't go wrong with this game, especially at just $15.

For those unfamiliar with the title, this is a wonderful roguelike.  You play a survivor of a crashed cargo ship (one of several to choose from) who must survive on a hostile world.  Good thing all those cargo crates that fell out of the ship are full of useful items...
The art has been updated in a way that is really lovely.  Not just that, but the visual style is more clear.  Any glance at the promo material will show you the pixel style of the game.
The gameplay is fun, but is best with friends to co-op.  Not that the single player is bad, but it's comparing a home run to a grand slam.  A play session takes between 20 and 45 minutes, typically.  Well, unless you beef it on stage one, but that *never* happens...

However, what I noticed the most was how near-perfectly the art style was remastered. As someone well-versed in games featuring pixel art graphics, I can attest that the artists have excelled in revitalizing both the art and game-play.

The inclusion of creature lore in the monster log adds a fair bit of depth, and the finely composed and mixed soundtrack enhances the overall aesthetic experience. Do keep in mind that this game is currently in its alpha stages, and displays a noticeable presence of bugs. Nevertheless, it's noteworthy that updates are actively improving the overall experience.

Basically, it includes every gameplay content from the game it's based of while reworking some aspects to better fit today's standards. It also adds new stuff including survivors, items, and artifacts. There's also quality of life addition such as being able to walk slowly while shooting which you'll see a lot, it is however a bit janky at times.
The soundtrack you know and love also returns, with a few new tracks which sounds amazing where they are played.

The only change that'll take me some time getting used to is the difficulty ramping up slightly quicker than in Risk of Rain 1, runs are naturally slightly more random due to having more items in the roster should you pick default game rules and play without Artifact of Command.
Some of the things I don't like about this game as of so far are the fact that you face numerous of airborne enemies during runs, which can be bothersome given how often they spawn and how some classes can struggle on dealing with them. There are Providence Trials which I enjoy for the most part! However, some are really unfair to get a gold crown score on and takes numerous of tries due to luck being involved.

For a remake of a game that I really enjoyed playing 10 years ago, having this remake is one of the best things that I could have. It may be slightly more difficult than what I remember, but I'm having as much fun with it as I did back then. Almost all of the past experience from the original game will transfer well to Returns.

Love the original and am getting big nostalgia playing RoRR now.
The new artstyle is great and with all the nice and new artworks collecting monsterlogs really feels rewarding.
There are new characters, stage varaiants, secrets and other unlockables which make this really fun to explore for rookies and veterans alike.
The biggest pro on this version though is probably the actually stable multiplayer, this feature not working properly was the only reason the original game was a 10/10 instead of 11/10 imo.

Only critique on this version i could possibly think of is that there is NO new original music from Chris, ""only"" remixes of his original soundtrack which are fine aswell but i was honestly looking forward to hearing new pieces of him.

The looting cycle is the same, technically, but the way you have to strategize and deal with combat is very different. You're a lot weaker in a lot of ways than you are in RoR2; dodging's a lot harder, mobility abilities are worst, shooting slows you to a crawl, and you need to fiddle with positioning to shoot flying enemies because most characters only have attacks that shoot in a straight line horizontally. Fits with the theme of this game, which is being a desperate survivor having crash-landed, as opposed to RoR2 where the characters are part of a professional rescue team.
Also, for speedrunners (or just people who get bored of doing the same runs over and over): the Trials gamemode adds a lot of options for time attack or for trying to get insanely high scores, with a lot less RNG than the main game. The final trial especially.
The game's lacking some peripheral features right now; modding support doesn't really exist so a lot of those very helpful UI mods that 2 had aren't available yet or are very annoying to install. And as for new gameplay content, good luck.

i originally found out about the risk of rain franchise through risk of rain 2 and i 100%'d it after 300 something hours and i LOVED that game. though i never bothered with the original. but i got excited when this got announced. so far i've put 56 hours, 127 runs, and 44 providence trials into the game. i've been having so much fun with it and i do plan on 100%'ing it and i can tell ill put as many hours into it as i did with ror2.

the pixel art and animations are absolutely stellar and i can tell each sprite has a lot of time and care put into them. definitely took a LONG time to make all of them. the artwork in the logbook is amazing and the stages look very nice as well.

i do have to admit i do NOT like 2D platformers (terraria is fine tho) but after i got used to it, it felt natural. though i am very excited for mouse aiming when that comes out in a later patch. gameplay can be kinda spammy at times, especially in the end game, depending on which character you play though.

so i am very excited to keep playing and you NEED to buy this for its price cause it will give you a great time. im a huge fan of the risk of rain franchise so ye

Positives:
- Amazingly done sprite-work
- The scaling feels slower than ROR1, but faster than ROR2, leading to a fair but tough time crunch
- The providence trials are overall nice and provide a good challenge in trying to get a gold rank.
- The characters feel fluid to play
- Better Providence fight
- More items & artifacts :D
- Mountain shrines are rewarding while challenging
- Wayyyyyy more stage varieties (6 each)

There are a few things though,
- The levels are massive, and sometimes it feels like there isn't enough loot for the stage size.
- Flying enemies are pretty annoying, and can be especially frustrating to fight on specific survivors.
- The providence trials, while most are fun, some are tedious and frustrating to do. There is no way to get around doing these, as some items are locked behind frustrating trials.
- Commando is still dogsh*t and under-powered when compared to the other survivors.
- Mouse aiming isn't a thing yet, but will be implemented later
- Because of the level varieties, grinding for some specific achievements can be annoying, given that you can only get them on one specific variant of a stage
- Third game in the series, STILL NO SAVE FUNCTION!!!

These are just some nitpicks, but if you can see past them you discover an amazing game that has plenty of hours to dump into, a must play for anyone who enjoyed ROR1, and a new adventure to those introduced through ROR2.",1699840131,1700760511,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The new coat of paint is very nice, pixel art's quite crisp and neat looking without being too far away from its origins.
The new survivors are extremely fun, except one. (Even after some fixes, I still think a certain returning survivor from Risk of Rain 2 just feels bad to play as.)
Providence Trials were quite interesting, it's very cool to see the fun ideas and twists the team came up with within Risk of Rain. Some of them would require slight tweaking though. Difficulty was all over the place.

Multiplayer is not that great of you come from RoR2 though. Items are scarce, and except a text chat, there's no method of ingame communication that eases it a little bit. No pings or such.

Another small complaint I have would be that levels are huge and annoying to navigate at times, which makes finding the teleporter quite the chore. A bigger radius on particles would help. (Especially for people playing at higher scaling.)

Overall had a great time with the game and I wholeheartedly recommend it. Enjoyed it and will continue to enjoy it.

Even though I haven't finished the game on my own yet (it is [i]very[/i] challenging), it has proved itself to be one of my standout games of the year.

There are some issues that plenty of people have pointed out in their reviews but most will soon be patched. The remaining complaints are just... baffling to me. It feels as if people have come in with expectations that the game would be like Risk of Rain 2 which is clearly not what the developers were setting out to do with this project. I'm disappointed to see the game drop a percentage point in its approval rating every time I look at the steam page. Please understand that this game is [i]not[/i] for everyone and it is certainly not RoR2 -- it should not be held to the same standards.

For $15, it is a spectacular bargain deal. If you are a fan of challenging roguelikes, do yourself a favor and buy this game.

And to the people who say this should have been a free update to Risk of Rain 1: fuck you. You fail to understand how much tireless effort must go into a quality remaster like this. I am appalled by some of the privilege and entitlement some people have in this community.

The first thing players will notice is that they can't shoot backwards easily: the player has to do an annoying backwards step, then click while they're still moving backward, and then they can walk forward again, but only moving at half speed.  The second thing players will notice after a couple levels is that they can't hit flying targets! Players have to wait until enemies happen to swoop down low enough to equal height, or try to jump-hit them, which they can't do, because of the third problem.  The jump height is microscopic.  Frequently there are staircase jumps where the player has to jump, collide halfway up the next step, wait for character to fall, and then jump again; all the while hardly moving horizontally. Controlling the character feels awful.

The move speed is so slow and the maps are gigantic.  Compared to monsters, movement feels fine and balanced because of the mobility ability. But after clearing a bunch of enemies, there's empty space to traverse--the maps are huge and procedurally generated--and the player has to waste their time walking around in search of the exit portal.  Meanwhile, the difficulty ticks up every second, and the player isn't getting any items to scale comparably.  The portal could be in any corner of the HUGE maps.  How do you have a good run on Hard difficulty? Get lucky finding the portals quickly.  Now THAT feels bad.  Risk of Rain 2 didn't have this problem because the 3D camera lets players see so much further.

Once arriving at the portal, it summons a boss and player has to ""survive"" enough time before they can escape.  Let me stress this: the portal text says ""STAY ALIVE..!"" with a timer ticking above the player's head (x/90 seconds) and an objective at the bottom of the screen reading ""Stay alive!""  Nothing about that experience informs the player that they are REQUIRED to kill the boss to advance.  In any game I would usually do this anyway, because it means more loot/scaling, but a few times it was inconvenient so I tried to...literally just survive!  Only to find out that I must hunt down the boss.  Okay, one time learning mistake, but it's not always an easy task (new player experience matters!).  Sometimes, the boss is actually across the map!  The player must follow a red arrow guiding them to the boss, forcing them to backtrack large distances.  By the way, time's ticking and difficulty increasing.  The developers seemed to intentionally design a map [lava map] to work this way.  On another map, the boss de-agro'd and walked away. Of all bosses, this was the Imp Overlord, which should be teleporting to the player to hit them.  Simply infuriating.

Crucial to a platformer is the affordance given to said platforms.  The game fails again.  Constantly I would run straight across a large level platform and was surprised to find I was falling (yes, there's fall damage).  The art is not clear to the player what is and is not a platform.  Platforms briefly blend into slightly greyer drawings of themselves (of distance two player widths), then reconnect with other large platforms of the same art style.  I know this sounds ridiculous (this guy MUST be a bad player luhmouw), however the game tries very hard to make the levels look good (they do, with very diverse maps), and it interferes with my gameplay.  I tried to recalibrate myself to the game, but then I swung too much in the other direction--I didn't think valid locations were reachable!  Adding to the problem, there are some secret locations where the player can pass through normal walls and reach what looks like an isolated pickup inside a mountain.  Even more, there seem to be some locations that can't actually be reached without 2 (or 3?) jumps.  Nothing is as it seems.

My final major complaint is the lack of content.  Literally all concepts of characters, items, and enemies are re-used from Risk of Rain 2, the only difference being the 2D platformer format, so the game already feels stale.  I played RoR2 to completion and it's just grind to unlock everything I already know about.

More minor bad things:
[list]
[*] All abilities have small delays so it's next to impossible to jump hit enemies.
[*] The huntress doesn't have any way to stop fall damage in her kit, and the game has a ton of high ledges where players can accidentally fall.
[*] Climb speed also feels slow, so it really sucks trying to get back up after falling.
[*] No movement ability increases vertical height.
[*] Some ladders were hard to discern.
[*] I was forced to fight a bunch of mobs at the exit portal in a small passageway, and some background pillar was a random ladder for no reason and I would grab it occasionally, slowing me down.  The ladder was about 3 character lengths tall and just hit a [real] ceiling.
[*] Character model is hard to discern from all the on-screen noise.
[*] I also can't tell if my partner is on top of me inside all the enemies.
[*] I wish my health bar also appeared next to my party-mate's at the top left so I only have to check one place.
[*] The player can use the mouse if it feels better for them (as it does for me), but Dear God please just let me aim with the mouse, it feels so bad.
[*] The good parts of the game aren't enough to justify the pain of big maps and slow player speed.  Yet Another Game That Is Balanced Around Wasting My Time. YAGTIBAWMY
[/list]

I cannot recommend this game to anyone who played RoR2, which I assume is most of their customer base.  It's too stale and the controls don't feel fluid.

Pros:
-Very nice pixel art that, in most cases, feels like a direct upgrade to the original's.
-New survivors, items and a handful of new gimmicks like temporary items (plus updates to old survivors' kits)
-Several general gameplay refinements, like not needing to hunt down every enemy in the level to move on to the next
-Several different ways to adjust difficulty to your liking, from being able to set modifiers to the amount of damage taken/received, how quickly the in-game timer fills via the three difficulty settings, and being able to change between several of the remake's reworked gameplay mechanics and the original's. This is also on top of the unlockable artifacts that have all sorts of bizarre or interesting effects on the gameplay. At its baseline, this game is very challenging.
-Just feel like playing the original but with working multiplayer and a new coat of paint? There's a setting for that too.
-How quickly the game physically runs isn't tied to framerate anymore so it doesn't feel like time is moving slower the more enemies are on the screen, among other performance improvements! Hurray!

Cons:
-While in most areas the game is a visual upgrade to the original, sometimes the maps feel too busy and not very clear about what is and isn't an obstacle/ladder/able to be walked on.
-This seems... Harder than I remember. Like much harder. People coming from Risk of Rain 2 will probably feel like this game's Drizzle difficulty without any difficulty adjustments is on par with RoR2's Monsoon difficulty. The new Providence Trials are neat in concept, but wow, are they all very difficult- and not able to have their difficulty tuned like the main game...

However, once you begin playing co-op and/or unlocking and playing more characters, the cracks begin to show. It feels like this could have used around six months more in the oven, if only to balance characters and co-op. My friend and I played a few hours of co-op, and the game feels immensely unfair. Even by the third level, enemy damage spikes drastically; having green or better items doesn't really make much of a difference after a certain point.
-Base player movement is too slow.
-Artificer is one of, if not the worst, characters in the game. Her flame chakrams lack enough damage to be worth using. I feel that an improvement to them would be to add a trailing flame behind each chakram throw, that way you do not have to time each throw perfectly so that it hits an enemy dead-on, and flame damage can be more easily stacked.
-Drones deal too little damage and die way too quickly to be worth using a majority of the time.
-Bustling Fungus needs a buff, badly. I know I'm not the only one that thinks this. Its ability needs to activate when you are standing still and attacking, as it does so in RoR2. You're running around and dodging attacks too much on later levels to make it viable to stand around for a few seconds to get healed.
-Enemies get huge buffs at level 3, at the earliest. That's insane. Sometimes you've barely gathered any good items because of poor RNG and you end up getting steamrolled pretty quickly.
-PLEASE get rid of the ball-shaped bouncing enemies that show up in the underground cavern level, or nerf them somehow. They're terrible to fight, and are more obnoxious than they are a true challenge.
-Traversing some levels, such as the aforementioned Underground Cavern, is a chore and not enjoyable. I feel that this would be well mitigated by buffing base player speed and putting more chests in each level to increase the player's chance of finding movement buffs and items overall.
-Chests are spread too thin and sometimes it feels as if the current level doesn't have any chests at all.",1700717819,1700718618,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I personally have never played the original Risk of Rain, and I knew full well going in that switching from 3d to 2d would probably short circuit my brain a bit, but I still went for it and I'm glad I did. The 2d has really grown on me, and so too has the unique way that this game plays compared to the 3d sequel. The pixel art is phenomenal, I mean just gorgeous, and the little comparison in the credits of the sprite work from the original game to the remaster, cute as hell. The one ""downside"" I kinda have, though it's hardly super negative, is that, by comparison, this game feels a good bit harder than 2. Not really a big deal, but something I noticed while trying to get one of my friends into it is that this specific jump in difficulty seems to make the game just barely cross that line of ""worth learning"" for some people. Again, I love it, but I also have hundreds of hours in RoR2 that have built a very solid foundation for me to start with. I immediately have a great deal of, at the very least, baseline knowledge of certain fundamentals and mechanics. For someone like my friend, who has never played 2, or the original for that matter, the sheer amount of stuff that is immediately thrown at you, with little explanation, proved to be a bit overwhelming. You can still do your best and learn in the process, but for some people, dying every minute or so to an enemy you don't understand how to effectively fight can stunt most, if not all enjoyment of the experience. I feel 2 eased you into what it's all about a lot smoother than this game does, and for some people, that can make or break the whole thing. AGAIN THOUGH, not me.

Heres a few

Cant target prioritize threats (Cant SHOOT past enemies/Body block)
Combat is a platforming DPS check
Also imagine if every boss you fought slowly dressed them selves up in a flesh suit of armor and slowly becomes a mass of death.

Cant plan your routes cause you cant see SHIT. (TELEPORTER AND CHESTS)
COMMANDO/Most survivors cant aim DOWN or UP at FLYING ENEMIES. (WTF!?!?!?!) + YOU GET SLOWED TO A SNAILS PACE
CAN ONLY AIM THE DIRECTION YOU WALK (DATED DESIGN)

(Providence fight is cool)
(Great sound track)

Hopefully i end up taking down this review as they release more patches like fixing the dated aiming system (Cant aim at flying enemies LMFAOOOOO + Aim in the direction you walk LOL)",1699517450,1700716260,False,7,2,0.326989233493804932,0,True,True,False
