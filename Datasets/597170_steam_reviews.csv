The game's premise of battling through waves of robots in deadly arenas is not only entertaining but executed with a level of polish that captivates players from the get-go.

The combat mechanics are a shining beacon of the game's excellence. The swordplay feels fluid, and the ability to slice and dice through enemies with precision is immensely satisfying. The inclusion of various weapons, upgrades, and abilities ensures that each playthrough is a dynamic and strategic endeavor, making the combat both accessible and deep.

The game's sense of humor is a delightful touch. The witty commentary and quirky interactions contribute to a lighthearted atmosphere, making the intense battles feel even more enjoyable. The developers' creativity shines through in both the design of the enemies and the humorous dialogue, creating a gaming experience that is as amusing as it is engaging.

Clone Drone's innovation extends to its Twitch integration, allowing streamers and their audiences to directly influence the gameplay. This interaction not only enhances the entertainment value but also fosters a sense of community involvement that is rare in the gaming world.

However, the glaring downside to Clone Drone in the Danger Zone lies in its server issues. The occasional lag spikes and connectivity problems can disrupt the otherwise seamless experience, leading to frustrating moments during critical gameplay. This issue, while not pervasive, does detract from the overall enjoyment, especially in the more intense stages where split-second decisions are crucial.

Despite the server-related drawbacks, Clone Drone in the Danger Zone remains a stellar title that excels in its genre. The combination of engaging combat, humorous elements, and innovative features makes it a standout experience. With a bit of improvement on the server stability front, this game could easily reach even greater heights and solidify its place as a beloved indie gem.",1708455074,1708455074,True,0,0,0.480769246816635132,0,True,False,False

Is has no steamworks support nor P2P support. 
All servers are hosted publicly, no dedicated servers and for private games you have to join using a code so no inviting and joining directly through steam.
Private games are really fun but public games take a very long time to start since after every round you have to effectively rejoin the server, which depending on your region may have latency issues as well.

For endless mode, difficulty doesn't seem to increase past a certain point. After we had all upgrades unlocked it was a slog to keep going since it was a constant repeat of the same maps, the same enemies.

For Last Bot Standing, private servers have a glaring lack of customization. You have a set amount of credits (4) you can spend and that's it, you can't increase/decrease initial credits nor can you lock certain upgrades, which would otherwise allow for some very interesting matches.

Otherwise, a really fun game to play with friends, but I wouldn't recommend it unless it's on sale. May amend my review if they ever add steamworks support since that's my biggest qualm with the game.",1705613667,1705613667,False,2,0,0.51754385232925415,0,True,False,False

If you're intrigued regardless of the high price, Clone Drone is one of those challenge games where you want to unlock all the achievements even if you're not an achievement hunter. You're gonna get pissed at times, but that's when you go to another game. When you're burnt out on everything you have, this is a nice option to default to.

I enjoy this game, and I'm the type to play exclusively online PvPs. Me liking single player / offline content is pretty rare, but Clone Drone seemed to have slipped through the radar this time. If the game seems interesting, I'd snatch it whenever it's on sale. There's a lot of replayability in this title and it's a great game to grind.

As an objective rating, I'd give this a || [B]6/10[/B] ||.

I played many hours of this game, have every achievement, and is waiting for the human plush to come back in the shop. This game never gets old. I'm a person that is not a fan of skill trees but some how they pulled it off. The fact That there is a sword, spear, bow, and hammer is CRAZY! Also, with the other things like kick and jet pack that are so cool! I like how instead of having to buy arrows and foul, this game has its own thing, energy so it makes the game way more fun. And it is cool to hear the commentators talk about the next level so you know what to upgrade.  Not only that, the fighting is really fun! Having the different types of robots all trying to make you garbage is amazing! This game could just have an endless mode and it would be amazing, but they took it to the next level! Having a story line, having endless like I said, Having challenges, having a twitch mode for streaming, multiplayer that you can play with you friends, but if you don't have any, you can play multiplayer endless, multiplayer challenges, a game mode that's called ""last bot standing"" and its one of the best game modes ever! You can even make or play levels form other people. And there is achievements that are really fun and give you rewards  like fire hammer, mega kick, flame breath, and much more! I will be honest that there is some rage inducing ones like random upgrade challenge, armor only challenge, insane chapter five, one, and two. I had no problem with them but many ""normal"" people would HATE them.  They even have there own store with mugs and shirts and pushiest.

Visually this game looks very simple. Everything is made of blocks. All the enemies in this game have different designs and different colours to make them easy to tell apart and to tell how dangerous they are. Music is also pretty good. All characters in this game that can speak have the generic robot voices that you would assume they might have.

The gameplay is what you're really here for. The gameplay focuses almost entirely on the combat and the combat is quite unique compared to other games. There are no health bars in this game. You die whenever your body takes too much damage. These can evolve losing both your legs, losing your right arm, because then you can't hold weapons, your torso taking too much damage, or your head taking too much damage. Your strikes are directional, you can either strike left, right , or straight down. Your weapon will cut wherever it lands in that direction, so its possible to cut enemies in halve, or cut off their arm, or their leg. This game also has a lot of content. There's the single player endless mode and a co-op endless mode, there are single player challenges and co-op challenges, there's a free for all pvp mode, private duels, twitch mode for streamers, and a campaign. The first two chapters of the campaign is pretty simple, it's chapter three where the campaign gets insane, it's a lot of fun. There's also a workshop for this game, so there is always more content if need it. A warning though for this game is that it's quite difficult. Some flaws with this game is that the co-op challenges drag on for way too long and the UI sometimes glitches and needs to be reloaded.

The game does have a story, but it's very simple and only serves as a set up for the game and is there for the purpose of the campaign mode. The humour will work for some people,but will annoy others. Personally I think its fine.

In conclusion, you can get a good amount of hours out of this game and the pvp mode is pretty competitive. Combat is unique and different. I would say though to buy this on sale just to be safe.",1705168541,1705168541,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can just swing at enemies until they die and dodge and stuff and it will be fine, BUT, there are more effective ways to swing and kill the robots.

OR you can wait till they're swinging at you and slice through the chinks in their armor killing them instantly.

One thing I look for in a combat-focused game is a deep and intricate combat system. At first, this game's combat system seems pretty simple. Sword hit enemy = dead. Easy, right? Then you learn about things like blocking, parrying, armour-bypassing, the difference between side strikes against different enemies, and suddenly it becomes a lot more complicated. Then you realise there are four (maybe five) weapons that CAN be used in isolation, but can also be combined with your other weapons, and all of a sudden the combat system feels a lot more complicated. There's a lot to learn, and while the skill floor is very low (since anyone can grasp the basics of this game's sword combat, it's really simple), the skill ceiling is incredibly high. What's even better is that they didn't need to include any combo system in the game, making it much less daunting to players new to combat systems.

Another important thing in combat-focused games is the enemies. Clone Drone in the Danger Zone has a whole host of enemy types, each stronger than the last and carrying various weapons. What makes the enemies even more fun to fight is that each robot sports its own AI. The lower tier ones just run at you in a straight line. However, the higher tier ones move almost like actual players, requiring a great amount of skill to overcome.

Onto the graphics. It takes a voxel-based approach since slicing and dicing robots is a big part of the game. It's quite satisfying to melt away a robot by slamming a hammer into them, or cut up a robot with a laser sword. The colours can be a tad bit flat at times, but the game still looks amazing.

The music is also stellar. There are a whole host of tracks that convey different emotions. From intense combat, to fear, to heroism, etc. Although, it can get a bit repetitive at one point, especially the arena music that plays constantly throughout the survival mode and in parts of the campaign mode.

Finally, there's the story. Clone Drone in the Danger Zone has a campaign mode comprised of five chapters. The story itself is quite exciting, and has its fair share of twists and turns. However, I felt as if it did end on a bit of a ""not sure"" note. It absolutely didn't have a bad ending, but the ending didn't feel extremely satisfying. It felt a bit rushed. Although, it didn't detract too much from the overall story.

In the end, Clone Drone in the Danger Zone is a fantastic horde-based fighting game with a lot of depth and fun to be had. Whether you like slicing enemies, taking them from afar, feeling like a hero, or designing your own levels, there's always classic fun to be had in the robot arena.

Yeah I just beat the new challenge level today with no ROBOT HANDS!! One of the zombies swiped my hands off and so I had to kill the boss with spike traps and with my kick upgrade lol. Crazy! I thought I soft locked myself there and I would have to restart but thankfully I didn't need to do that! Jetpack zombies were easy to take out with the kicks and spike traps too. But I did notice audio problems when I died close to the start of the level. Like the friendly and non friendly npcs were 'offline' and not doing anything. It didn't affect the progress of the game though! So glad that was not a soft lock. Thanks for adding the solo zombie challenge level!! Kind of mad how the ending kind of adds more to the story which is cool to see!

Newer Review: 
Game is still great and highly repayable but I am not a huge fan of the battle royal game because of how over powered the fire in the game is. If the devs were to remove fire weapon upgrades from the battle royal I would actually try playing it.

I personally prefer playing the offline modes more than the multiplayer but it can be very fun if you are playing co op in a group fighting against smart robot AI!!! Co op is great but battle royal not so much. 

The story is good too but nothing too expansive! The final boss is great!! Was fun to cut that monster into pieces.

Zombie mode was a nice bonus in this game but I wish there was a offline version of it which isn't only for co op.. Devs could you add a zombie mode for solo challenges? Would be quite nice!

I fully recommend this game btw. Good spent money! Almost endless replay-ability and it can run on the Steam Deck at full 60fps too!

Old review where I had only 5.1 hours in this game:

One of the fun fighting games I've ever played. I first played the demo and beat it without losing.. But they did use a death star laser on me once they realised they couldn't kill me the normal way.. I'm glad they made a demo for this game. It would have taken me years to finally decide if this game is worth my money. Actually it did. It really did.. I recommend this game 100%.",1670533562,1698428309,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A game of pure skill. I am actually not the best at hand eye coordination but still, every death feels fair. Simple game loop will never get old. Lots of stuff to do in single player which is a + for me. It has the old skool feel of, a game that was designed to be fully finished with out extra stuff. And lots to do with the basic interactions in the game. It has a great level editor which seems to allow for scripted events. Some very good levels out there. Story is nice. Challenge modes are great. Endless mode is there to live out whatever over powered set of upgrades you dream of trying together, but only if you are skilled enough the clear enough endless levels to get them all.  (my top score is like 23 lvls right now). 

Voxel characters allow for a gameplay with no HP mechanics. You die when your head/torso is destroyed, or both legs or if you lose the ability to attack. I used to think both arms counted but if you have flamebreath you can actually continue with out arms. Once I cleared a level with only one leg left by hopping around and breathing fire on enemies. 

Good soundtrack. All voices are text to speech, but good text to speech that is funny to listen to. As such anyone can create custom dialogue for the game. 

There is MP, I have not tried it. Duels are private lobbies only for example. 

Basically infinite replay value. Amazing game play. Unique.. there is nothing light it really that I have played before. Art style that will always look good. Amazing price range. I actually bought two copies but the guy I gave it to found it too hard. His son likes it though, but would feel weird playing with some internet friends son who I have never met. So I'll probably pick up another copy for someone else at somepoint. That's the good thing about its pricing, I could happily buy this game 4 times and not feel ripped off.",1698205043,1698257750,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Commentatron is one of the robots in the duo that makes up the commentators. Only the top half of his torso is visible, as he is behind a table. He has a deep, dark voice. He is a robot with a rather large chest, resembling a muscular man. He has a black suit, headset, red eyes, and reddish hair accessories. As his name suggests, he will usually make comments on what the player is doing and what the outcome of the level was. He will often wave his arms around while speaking, and is notably more expressive than Analysis-bot, he views the user and watches him burn
In one of his lines, Commentatron asks Analysis-bot what his relationship with Purple Shep is, referencing the fact that Analysis-bot uses the same voice as Purple Shep.
In another one of his lines, Commentatron says that he loves the smell of energy swords in the morning, revealing that he has a ""nose"" installed.
In one of his lines, Commentatron proposed the idea that he and Analysis-bot should form a band (although he calls it a ""popular musical act"" due to robot speech patterns).
If you use the camera, you can see that he has legs, and has been standing up the whole time. His legs seem thin and awkward when compared to the rest of his body.
He appears to be a re-purposed mark 2 sword robot, or some sort of sword robot, presumed by his body shape.
In chapter 4, he can be seen when the human diplomat is sent to the arena to ""negotiate.""

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Analysis-bot

""Soon all the humans will be garbage!""

Analysis-bot is one of the robots in the duo that make up the commentators. Due to his small size, he sits on the table that Commentatron stands behind. He has no limbs at all, black coat, green eyes and accessories, and as the name suggests, he will often analyze what the player is doing and the upcoming level, occasionally answering questions from Commentatron.
In the ending cutscene of chapter 3, we get a look inside one of the Harvester Fleet ships. Inside, we see what appears to be a command center, with four robots that are the same model as Analysis-bot, just with military uniforms and different eye pieces. In chapter 4, they are revealed to be ship officers, specifically Logistics, Warfare, Mind Space, and Infantry.
In one line, Commentatron asks Analysis-bot about his relationship with Purple Shep. Analysis-bot quickly responds with ""I don't know Purple Shep! We are not best friends!”
However, in another line, when Commentatron asks him about Purple Shep, he replies that they share the same voice modulator.
During the Random upgrade challenge, he mentions that if he had arms, he would like them to be the same as Upgrade bot's.
The Harvester ship officers had emergency combat modes, which included flight, flamethrowers, shooting arrows from their mouths, charging at the player, and sword wielding (although they needed to use their mouths to do so). It is unknown if Analysis Bot has these abilities as well.
In Chapter 4, Analysis-bot can be briefly seen when the human diplomat is sent to the arena to ""negotiate.""
Analysis-bot is apparently a big fan of Spider-Tron 5000 and Spider-Tron 6000. In one quote he says that ""[he] likes robots that analyse things!
In multiple lines during story and endless mode, we are shown that Analysis-bot displays an interest in poetry. Some of his lines follow some sort of rhyme scheme, usually followed by commentatron applauding his poetic abilities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Commentators

The Commentators are a duo of robots who add colorful comments (Red being Commentration bot and Green being Analysis bot) before and after each battle. They do not comment during battle unless a Spidertron gets cut by a saw blade or the player hits their booth. The Commentators give information on the upcoming level and make remarks about the chosen upgrades. These are often humorous, sarcastic, or even rude. The commentators are displayed on screens on each wall of the arena, and on four screens in the upgrade area. If the player manages to get up to their booth in the arena, a force field will blast the player back. The Commentators cannot be harmed. Their true thoughts on the player is unknown, as they appear to want to see the player die at one point, and at other points, they appear to favor the player. The commentatrion bot did not tell analysis bot that he had a nose installed!!


Trivia
When using photo mode inside the commentators box, you can see that Commentatron is standing on a thin ledge with the end of his toes.

On the nintendo switch varyient on one level commentstron say spider tro on instead of just spider tron if you listen closely

Story Mode - You fight as a robot body but with a human mind you will fight a lot of hard enemies and encounter even Spider bots not small spiders thou big Robot Spiders and their name are SpiderTron5000,SpiderTron6000,FleetOverseer,FleetCaptain,SpiderTron7000, Mind-Set Robots and the mark 5 robots :O ! They are hard to defeat but with block arrows and some fire you should manage to defeat them (except SpiderTron7000 and the other minions. Those can be defeated with pretty much anything.) !
Endless Mode - Levels that go Endless from 1 to Inf you stand no chance against Sword Mark 5 robots in the new two difficulties Uranium and Insanium but careful thou these bots don't mess around they see the enemy they track the enemy human then they kill it and they dash into you too that is a lot of Bad Stuff! 
Challenges - You can defeat hard challenges and easy ones for New Upgrades and Amazing Trophies! and Skins for your robot! Only in Multiplayer!
Twitch Mode - When you get live on Twitch you can go in Twitch mode and your viewers will spawn stuff and try to kill you! 
Multiplayer Coop - You find a sibling or a friend and play Endless Mode with your friend or friends, there is a maximum of 4 people in one lobby :) 
Multiplayer Challenges - You think the single-player challenges were too EASY!! well there goes the fun stuff..:( there are MUCH harder and you can defeat all of them with your friends :)
Last Bot Standing - You fight for your life get upgrade drops and try not to die! GOOD LUCK!
Private Duels - You in private with your friend and try to kill him for not letting you copy at the exams xD :D                           

Everything you see here is in the game but these things below will come to the game in the following update they are in brackets when the update is out you will see the brackets gone: 

New Icons for the upgrades in the Upgrade Tree.

The Game will be translated in many different languages such as French,Russian,Portuguese,Chinese Simplified,etc!

A lot more but you will see less bugs and many changes i hope i see this update soon!

This is a lovely game and the update is out....the next big focus will be..something....cool!

Go in TWITCH and follow Doborog for more information! :D

Well the BALANCING UPDATE IS SUPER GOOD ! Finally no one will die like a noob from a Spear Spinner or a Spammer of Using the Kicking Tail of the Raptor!

If you plan just playing the game to get through its content, it has a story mode with 5 chapters along with some challenges. Fun but can be finished pretty quickly.

However, this game has some of the best PVP melee combat I've ever played. The slicing and dicing, smashing and kicking, It's all very satisfying. There's a massive skill gap to climb as well. The downsides are the developers haven't given any sign of expanding on this. There is only a small battle royale mode and option to private duel your friends. Occasional hackers in last bot standing. And you wont find a game past midnight in your region.

It's very fun and it is by far one of my favourite games of all time.  There is a mode on singleplayer called challenge mode and it is definitely my favourite because you can complete them and for some you unlock a new upgrade to get from upgrade bot during matches like one I will mention later (endless mode).  There are other challenges that just unlock trophies which i really like and my favourite being the inferno challenge trophy but my favourite challenge probably being the laser only challenge or the hammer only challenge due to the laser one being so unique and the hammer one i just liked smashing everything.  It is also fun to play with friends on multiplayer with lots of fun and hard challenges like the ones from singleplayer but instead changed so its harder for you and your friends to have more fun instead of it just being too easy, but if you are like me and have no friends you can still get the rewards from multiplayer by playing it by yourself but it is a lot harder.  Or you can just join a random public game.  My personal favourite challenges from multiplayer are probably the zombie challenge due to it being fun and unique and the random upgrade challenge since it was always unpredictable due to the random upgrades and random levels.  I also love the story modes (no spoilers) and if you play it on insane difficulty you get special rewards for completing each chapter but beware they are very hard and can be frustrating.  There are 3 more modes to talk about 1 of them being endless mode.  Endless mode is on both singleplayer and multiplayer and is just as it sounds it goes on endlessly until you die.  The second mode i haven't mentioned is only on multiplayer called last bot standing.  It is a fun mode where you and other real people fight off and see who is the best human out of the rest.  The last mode is one i haven't tried out yet due to me not streaming on twitch if i would stream it would be on Youtube but I just tend not to anyway.  The mode is called twitch mode where i think you can bet what bot will kill the streamer? I'm not really sure.",1690501900,1690501900,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Many things caused my dislike of the game, like striking an opening in an armored opponent and the game making the sword phase through the body to hit the armor on the other side of the body from which you sliced. Or that sometimes your weapon will just not do any damage when the enemy seems to not have this issue. Or the possibility that the enemy is programmed to have an unfair advantage in other parts than size or weaponry, such as cutting an enemy with a flame sword could cause a slight burn if you only did a scratch. If the enemy scratches you the same way, you instantly combust into flames. I also somewhat confirmed that enemy's have an unfair resistance seeing that earlier an archer bot lost his entire right side of his body and was still running around [they're supposed to die if they're unable to use their weapons]. There's also the inconsistency in how you can die, some times a wittle boo-boo on your torso and head has your character instantly dropping dead. Then there are times where you're missing all but a small corner of your head, having a hole through your chest from an arrow and STILL chugging along perfectly fine. Then there is insanity, which is just complete anarchy. Game design? pffffft, whats that? I don't even consider this a challenge, it's straight up unfair and requires luck beyond my comprehension to beat. It highlights all the problems with the game with a very disgusting bow on top. It feels like it wants me to beat it competitively in a game where precise moves that requires nano-second inputs are something that straight up doesn't exist as every attack is sloppy, has huge delays and annoying quirks [probably due to the animations]. It makes me crazy as there are so many moments my sword SHOULD HAVE done damage if only the sword continued to do damage for another half second, 

I can go on and on about this, but it's time I cut to the point.

Don't buy this game, it isn't worth your time. 

If you buy it and give it your time, expect to encounter a frustrating dead end where you'll probably realize that you should've listened to me.",1688786758,1689149082,False,1,3,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Verily, this game has brought me much joy and amusement, yet it bears certain elements that do not resonate with my personal taste. Nevertheless, I wholeheartedly recommend it for its captivating mechanics and its ability to provide solace in moments of relaxation.

Firstly, let us discuss the matter of the soundtrack. Whilst the game boasts an intriguing array of mechanical marvels, the dubstep-inspired melodies, albeit skillfully composed, do not align with my devout inclinations. It is but a personal preference, for which I offer no reproach to the creators. Each soul finds solace in different harmonies, and it is mine humble wish that future endeavors may cater to a wider spectrum of musical tastes.

Another aspect that I feel compelled to address is the perceived ""Soy Reddit air"" that lingers within the game. As a devout follower of the Islamic faith, I seek environments that cultivate virtues of dignity, respect, and modesty. Although the game may exhibit certain elements that may be incongruous with my sensibilities, I bear no ill will towards the creators, for it is their artistic expression. I do implore them, however, to consider diversifying the themes and dialogues to appeal to a broader range of players, encompassing varying cultural and spiritual backgrounds.

Notwithstanding these observations, ""Clone Drone in the Danger Zone"" shines brightly with its captivating gameplay and intriguing mechanics. The thrill of facing formidable adversaries, wielding weapons with precision, and honing one's reflexes brings delight to one's heart. The variety of challenges, such as the duels, waves, and even the chance to control a mighty spider robot, fosters an immersive experience that captivates the mind and nourishes the spirit.

This game serves as a sanctuary, a respite from the trials of the day. The ability to unwind and immerse oneself in the thrilling world of robotic combat is a blessing indeed. It offers an opportunity to detach from worldly concerns and indulge in moments of leisure, allowing the mind to find solace and rejuvenation.

In conclusion, ""Clone Drone in the Danger Zone"" is a captivating arena of robotic battle, though it bears certain elements that may not align with my devout beliefs. I extend my sincere recommendation to all seeking an engaging experience, for its mechanics and gameplay are truly commendable. Let us embrace the diversity of artistic expression while offering feedback to shape future creations that encompass the values we hold dear. May Allah guide us in all our endeavors and grant us tranquility as we embark on our digital adventures.",1685379477,1685379477,True,1,0,0.476377934217453003,0,True,False,False

Don't got too much time on this game, but here's the principle. You are a robot, and the 2 announcers make fun of you. You fight different levels, getting upgrades inbetween. Once you die, you restart. At first audio sounded trash, but I started to like it after 5-8 minutes. Cool game, fun experience.

A game that's truly in a class alone,
Where metal warriors fight to the bone,
And the player's skills are constantly honed.

The visuals are sleek, like polished chrome,
And the action's so intense, you'll feel in a cyclone,
Enemies attack from every side and zone,
But you'll keep fighting, never to bemoan.

Combat's your weapon, your defense, your cornerstone,
Use swords, axes, and hammers to smite foes unknown,
And with every victory, you'll steadily enthrone,
A champion, skilled and battle-hardened, like a milestone.

All in all, Clone drone in the danger zone,
Is a game that you won't play and simply disown,

Clone Drone in the Danger Zone (CDDZ) is a side-splitting, rib-tickling, robo-romp that'll leave you in stitches! Let's start with 3 pros and 1 con that sum up this comedic chaos.

Pro #1: The game's hilariously absurd premise has you controlling robot clones, slicing and dicing through arenas like a tin-can samurai on a caffeine high. It's the perfect blend of futuristic mayhem and slapstick humor.

Pro #2: With razor-sharp wit, the game's commentators deliver punchlines with the precision of a laser-guided sword. You'll be laughing so hard, you'll hardly notice your own gruesome, dismembered limbs scattered across the arena floor.

Pro #3: CDDZ's challenging gameplay is the cherry on top of this humor sundae, adding a sense of accomplishment to your metallic massacre. Surviving each wave of enemies feels like a well-earned badge of honor (or a really twisted joke).

Con #1: The only downside? You might end up with an uncontrollable urge to punt your Roomba across the living room after playing.

In conclusion, Clone Drone in the Danger Zone is a gut-busting, laugh-a-minute adventure that combines the best of robot combat, witty banter, and a difficulty curve that'll keep you coming back for more. Just remember to give your household appliances a reassuring pat after each gaming session.",1681056090,1681056090,True,20,5,0.592374026775360107,0,True,False,False

give the player a normal bow, without any upgrades

make the ally respawn after death after some time

give the player 3 energy

make the player be able to pick its weapon before fighting

Story is fine. There are some cool mechanics that are story only. So it's a cool mixup to the maingame.

The graphics are good for the game.

The gameplay can be repetitive, but you can try out different playstyles and that's where the game is shining. I'm not recommending the online mode though, anyone is tryharding and I had no fun playing it, but you got enough offline modes to play instead. These modes are in a nutshell all the same (killing a wave of robots that get more difficult and versatile the further you get) but the true challange, is to get actually good in it. You got so much elements you can try out and so many different enemys you are encountering. 
It won't get boring that fast in my oppinion.

All in all, it's a nice little game for anyone. I'm recommending the game for the full price. And if it's on sale, just buy it. Don't think about it. It's worth",1678038305,1678038305,True,5,0,0.581749081611633301,0,True,False,False

The graphics are meh 8/10
FPS is 10/10
Server and ping in multiplayer is 7.5/10
Community 10/10
And the workshop levels are awesome :)
The wide and large variety of challenges makes it even more fun and pumps the game up more for when it gets boring,i overall recommend it as it's quite worth the price. It can get very annoying when you can't do a challenge but i managed to do more than 5 in solo and all in multiplayer.
So overall it is a 9/10 game,i find it very fun to play with friends and the map creator or adventure creator,whatever you wanna call it is pretty neat,large variety of access to such things in the game. However,I do wish that we can have a proper chat to type into,as the emoting and things aren't very ""functional"" at communication with allies. It can get confusing and allies might not get what you say and screw the level up causing you to fail.

     The main gameplay is the endless mode, where you fight wave after wave, battlefield after battlefield of enemies, getting harder and better with each tier advancement. You pick upgrades, from mobility, to a kick, to three other weapons. I'm trying to get all the upgrades for the achievement, and I still haven't gotten them all at 67 hours of play. Sure, running out of clones leaves you back at the start, but I'm still playing and still having fun.
     There's also multiplayer, be it doing online challenges, or the free-for-all. There's not many people playing at a time, but there's also very little lag. It's good if you want a quick online experience.
     I'd highly recommend this. My only issue is that I don't think I can get the twitch achievement due to the person I'm supposed to watch hasn't streamed in two months at this point. If they make it so that you can get the achievement when anyone on Dogborg streams, or maybe make it not mandatory to complete the game to 100%, then that'd be great.",1675529880,1675529880,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game is easy to master, and easy to learn and read.
Great AI, And good mechanics.

But something's off. You know, When I heard this game had a campaign, I felt happy So I bought it.
Expecting a thrilling, Great, Amazing game play experience in campaign... When I finished all of the chapters...
I was a bit disappointing.
Now, you could go into the comment section and talk about how the campaign is good, But I am speaking from MY opinion.
Now, when I first started campaign, it started off good. Plain old game play, I got a bit bored then.
Then, I completed level 10, an then, a Robot just came out and disabled the force field.
Hey, Listen. If the robot tech is SO advanced in This universe, how did a random robot just come and disabled the force field? Don't you think the other robots could have done something? 

I mean, if there's some LORE, or something i'm missing out on- Please do tell me!
Chapter 2 was good... The levels had gotten a bit harder, 
(Especially with the addition of hammer bots, kick bots, And more), but the thing is..

The end of the chapter- Is quite confusing.
There's this harvesting thing that is supposedly ""Harvesting"" all of the humans, to be sent into the danger zone, or something.

And then the garbage bots just pick you up and just carries me and takes me back to the human I played before?
I mean, It makes sense, It's probably just the work of the robot that sabotaged the barrier.

And well, I don't feel like writing my review's for the rest of the chapters, but the rest of the chapters are decent and confusing, so Kudo's to the developer's.

But I liked the game, but I dislike the campaign a little.
If you enjoy robots, action, and fighter games, This one's for you.

So what do I give on campaign? 6.7/10. The rest of the game? 7.9 out of ten.

So, For my review on the rest of the game.
I like the rest of the game. Sorta.
It has endless mode, Some challenges you can do (if you get bored of slicing robots).
I feel like this game has Much, Much, MORE potential, and that this game could be better and expanded on.

So, I enjoy the game in some way.
If I could change a part of this game, I would make the campaign a bit more understandable.
Then again, that's just my opinion, and you should respect it. (If anyone has the merit to do so.)

Es un buen juego, las 4 o 5 armas que tienes estan bastante buenas para pelear junto a las mejoras correspondientes de cada una, los graficos estan buenos y la historia esta bien pero no hay mucho que decir, las cosas negativas serian la repetitividad de los niveles osea se que es por la historia pero hubiera sido algo mejor si los niveles fueran mas aleatorios para que no se vuelva aburrido jugarlo a lo largo y el soundtrack del juego es muy monotono(literalmente son 1 o 2 canciones casi todo el rato excepto en otros lugares pero no es mucho el cambio) pero dentro de todo es buen juego, si lo quieres comprar yo lo recomendaria en una oferta si o si.

English Review

Its a good game, the 4 or 5 weapons the game gives you are pretty good to fight with each upgrade for the corresponding weapon, the visuals are ok and the story is fine but not much to say about it, the negative of this game are the repeatability of the levels, i know is because for the sake of the story mode but in the long run it becomes very monotonous it will be nice if  the game had more randomness and the soundtrack of the game leaves to much to be desired (literally is one or two songs for almost all the fights in the arena) in other places changes a little but not too much but overall is a good game, if you want to pick it, pick it on sale.

Endless is self explanatory, you can complete the campaign in harder difficulties and achievement hunting and multiplayer is super fun with poeple that greet you and help you with the emotes to people who try to say the are better than you but the emote system is it´s own filter and it just makes them look dumb. The first thing i dislike is the battle royal gamemode thing where you just get thrown into an arena and fight actual people, but, i don´t know how complicated it is to make some sort of skill ranking thing like csgo so i shouldn´t judge a book by its cover but what i can say is that a lot of sweats play that mode and it can frustrate and discorauge you like it did to me.

the second thing i dislike a little less is the mountaion you need to climb after getting to know everything the game has to offer since when you get to the highest difficulty you have a lot to learn and memorize to then apply that into idk, that arena gamemode?

I love the level creator, i have made a lot of levels in the re-use style that the devs made for the endless mode and the system is so clean that if you want to start making levels all you need to do is let your imagination (and balancing logic) do the rest for you, and maybe some tutorials but i never used those and i have sone really good levels but i mostly keep them to myself to have more endgame content.

There isn't any health bars, an enemy is dead when: both legs are cut off or when the head is destroyed/ separated. The movement in this game is fantastic, I you can run, jump and it's such a large part of dodging enemy hits in this game. There's a boost which uses up your energy and has a small cooldown, but you can buy an upgrade to get a jetpack, which sends you forward at great speed. Each weapon has upsides and downsides and counters different weapons. There's upgrades for each level you complete and it gets harder through different categories of levels. there's: bronze, silver, gold, diamond, titanium, uranium and then insanium. There is also an amazing campaign to pay through. I'd rate this game 10/10, would highly recommend for people who like platforming and melee combat",1616830308,1669153294,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

- You find funny people in the ""Every man for himself"" mode
- You start to worry about those people who spared you
- You make friends and try to help those who are interested in you
- You kill the Emperor in the 5th chapter longer than you go through all the other 4th chapters

Endless Levels
Adventure Levels
And Last bot Standing Levels
The presence of a fun and easy to use level editor always gives me joy, and the ability to toggle between only workshop levels, both workshop levels and regular endless levels, and only regular endless levels is a good feature of the game too. I do feel like the game needs the ability to make custom private duel maps as it is possible to make custom last-bot-standing maps so it would be possible, and it would complete the trifecta of endless, last-bot-standing, and private duels.

Clone Drone in The Danger Zone is a pretty solid game where you play as [b]John Drone[/b]*, a human who has since been turned into a robot for gladiatorial entertainment by other, morally impaired robots.  Your goal is simple; Survive the arena's dangers, and maybe overthrow an evil robotic emperor while you're at it.  Or just that first one.  The plot's lightweight, and outright nonexistent in some areas, and with a game like this, it's relatively okay.  There is a Story Mode that tells a tale of resistance, and the story, while light-weight and offering a simple series of justifications for the enemy gauntlets it hurls you into, also does a great job of introducing new mechanics and weaponry in a rather natural way.
[spoiler]*Clone's name may not be John Drone[/spoiler]

Graphically, this game uses volumetric pixels, or voxels if you're not an [b]utter snob who uses fancy words.[/b]  This means 'Minecraft looks' for those who need further help, and it lends the game a blocky look that only needed a few particle effects to truly shine among the competition in that space.  Obviously, it's very readable at a glance, and with how the game plays, that's important.

Gameplay is semi-simple.  You can wield up to four weapons, a sword, a hammer, a bow, and a spear with shield.  Your goal?  Kill everything else without dying in the process.  Combat controls are simple; Swords and hammers swing where you're moving, or default to a vertical swing if you're still; Bows shoot where you're aiming, spears stab forwards at all times.  You have a dash, a jump, and with upgrades, a kick.  The game's enemies are many, varied, and vast, and all can call for different means of taking them on.  The game balances all it's weapons with strengths and disadvantages, too; While you can go [i]'pew pew'[/i] and kill stuff that way, some robots can deflect arrows.  While your hammer can certainly bonk those guys aside, now you're being shot full of holes by bow-wielding enemies.  While your sword can deflect that, it's range is too short and you are now at risk of receiving the [b]forever bonk[/b] from MC Hammerlots over there.  And while your spear has minced Hammerlots' head, his fifteen friends are now out for your oil.  So on, so forth.  Multiplayer is present and fun, too; Duels, a battle royale that's actually good, and co-operative play all round off an otherwise solid experience, and it's arguably the best part of CDiTDZ.

In terms of performance, this game runs smoothly, but be aware that voxels are anything but lightweight; This game can be a bit taxing on CPUs and GPUs alike in terms of temperature, so make sure your stuff's relatively flame-resistant before going in.  Otherwise, my CPU held a perfectly stable frame rate, save for multiplayer, where server lag becomes everybody's worst enemy, alongside the raptors that fires lasers from their faces.

While the game's story mode is relatively short, a surprisingly addicting Endless mode, several single and multiplayer challenges, and the multiplayer itself make Clone Drone rather replayable, and it supports Workshop levels in case you get tired of the game's stock levels and want to mix things up, from simply adding new arena layouts, to outright adventure maps that go beyond the arena's bounds to create long gauntlets of foes for you to die horribly to.

All told, it's a solid indie package that offers a fun time, and while it's no GoTY contender, Clone Drone is a deliciously delightful time that I can solidly recommend.  [u]Get it at MSRP, you won't be disappointed.[/u]",1661740219,1661740230,True,18,2,0.685821294784545898,1,True,False,False

1: Make the great-sword an upgrade instead of restricting it to multiplayer and the level editor.
2: Give the spear a shield re-enforcement upgrade (make it more durable), or give it a range upgrade (make it longer).
3: Give the hammer a faster swing speed or shorter cool-down.
4: Give the bow more arrow width, or more arrow speed.
5: Give the potential for 5 energy bars.
6: Give an even faster get-up upgrade.

For weapons I would like to see.
1: A grenade projectile that has the same effect as spider-tron's bombs. (Range and blast force for upgrades)
2: Dual-wield daggers (a faster but weaker version of sword) (only 2 ticks of projectile block and one tick of fire).
3: Scythe (fire and size upgrades)
4: An actual F***ing Gun (this would use up energy, because it would shoot small energy orbs, and would be deflected by projectile block) (Faster firing speed and less energy consumption for upgrades).
5: Claws like the zombies have (size and fire upgrades).
6: Energy Boomerang (size and fire for upgrades).

MEME weapons.
1: Frying pan (size upgrades).

Weapon re-skins
1: hammer: Stop sign (with an option for an ""!"" instead of ""stop"" in reference to ""Madness Combat"").
2: sword: Katana.
3: spear: Tribal Spear (shield would have a different design on it to).
4: bow: Mechanical Bow.
5: ALL: Choose what color you want the weapons/glow to be (from the already available options).

Two chad commentators known as ""Commentatron"" and ""Analysis Bot"" will make intellectual remarks during your time in the arena, in which there are a variety of different maps and a variety of different enemies can spawn. 

These enemies will typically wield: swords, bows, hammers, and spears (sometimes with shields), and they come in Marks I to V, getting harder to defeat each time. However there are some with jetpacks, some that look like they're lawyers (business bots), and flame/laser raptors.  
The story is a beautiful tale of human defiance, and friendship, between two humans who have escaped the gladiator arena, and  fight their way, from overseers to ship commanders, to kill the emperor of the robots, thereby setting mankind free. 

Also, there is a pretty cool multiplayer option, in which you can work together with other humans to complete challenges in the arena, or fight in a Battle Royale style game in Last Bot standing, or even have a 1v1 duel with your friend.

From the outside your first look might be ""this game looks really simple and the style reminds me of Minecraft with the ""blockyness"", but let me tell you there is so much more to this game than it seems. The story: The story was one of the things that got me and my brother hooked to this game, the story seems so simple and the next thing you know, your in a completely different feeling game. The physics: The physics are pretty good when it comes to aiming your weapon, you see your able to cut off different limbs depending on where your looking while your swing, and if you take damage you don't die right away (sometimes) instead you can still fight while only having... lets say half of your boy, one arm, 2 knees, half a head gone, its pretty astounding really. Online mode and Extras: once your done with the base game there are still a lot of things you can do like for example fight together or against other players. The game gives your challenges in order to unlock trophies, upgrades, or skins if your playing online. There's also an endless mode where you have to keep fighting and see how far you can go.

Every day when i was 5-7 years old i would go on youtube go on to Blitz's channel and watch his Clone drone video's it was such a treat to watch. And when i first got my greedy hands on it, i couldn't run it because of my crappy graphics card. and when i finally managed to get a new graphics card i couldn't even start the game because it was even CRAPPIER it was the worst card you could ever get and i'm not making that up. EVENTUALLY i got a card that was even better than the first and i could finally run it at a crisp 60 fps however it took me 3 years to getting back to the game. Me being a Slow mf aside, when i first booted the game up, finished the campaign, took a quick look at the other difficulty settings, died a lot to insane mode, looked at the workshop, and ya know what. This game is worth every penny it is a treat to slice enemies in half with the sword, send enemies to the moon with the hammer, and cut heads off with the spear and bow. And it is fun overall everything feels like it has weight, especially the hammer and every weapon has their strength's and weakness's the sword is quick and fast but incredibly short ranged, the spear is longer ranged and defensive but requires precise aiming and upgrades to become useful, the hammer is strong and hard to avoid but makes you vulnerable and its slow swinging doesn't help ether, and the bow is powerful but quickly falls if a bot gets too close to you and some bots just block your arrows forcing you to either kick the bot or switch to a different weapon.

Since there’s already been a ton of reviews about the game in general; I will just focus on the things that pissed me off while I was trying to 100% the game so you can decide for your self if you wanna get the game. If you don’t I don’t really recommend getting it at full price either, wait for a discount.

I have spent too much f****** time & stress getting all the achievements of the game and I do NOT recommend you do the same.

Number 1) EXTREME artificial difficulty on insane

For a mental representation of how bad this game is on insane (the only achievement granting campaign mode difficulty) think about iron keep from dark souls 2, bad right? Now multiply the knights inside of it by 10 and make it a 1 hit kill (usually) with no way to heal even if they don’t kill you immediately – which usually cripples your ability to fight and leaves your death dragged out.

While I understand that it’s supposed to be a really hard difficulty, they should have implemented it in a far different way such as having more enemies than *usual* but not to the extreme level that the current version of the game has alongside making them higher MK versions of themselves so its actually challenging in a way that can be reasonably countered verses being quite literally swarmed with an impossible amount of enemies to the point where you need to kite them around traps until they reach a fair number.

You know its bad when 99% of the enemies die to friendly fire because there’s too many. It literally is RNG on if you die most of the time because of this unless I’m missing something.

2) MP Lag

Like seriously, I have NOT got a bad connection – I have 30ms on most games and I basically never have issues with any game except this one. Like it’s really bad, my character will just die for no reason some times and its genuinely infuriating considering a good half of the achievements are multiplayer. I have lagged in a lobby with only me in it for some godforsaken reason.

3) Dead MP & Sweats (ish)

Despite half of the achievements being MP based, basically all the modes are dead (this is especially potent for LBS, the pvp mode) as there’s like 300 people playing on a good day which is bad for obvious reasons. And when you DO get a game in the LBS mode its probably going to be some Russian with 500 wins so its not looking good from the start – I somehow scraped it but others might not be so lucky.

Good luck getting to Insanium if you decide to do the coop challenges solo as sometimes you just can’t find anyone, since you only get 3 retries. 

4) Challenges being repeated

On the subject of these challenges, they are literally identical down to a T as the solo versions, what’s the point? Its just making it more grindy for 0 reason.

5) Nonsensical achievement decisions

I despise, despise, despise the fact that the devs made us have to go play coop to get the coop insanium achievement if we have already done it multiple times over for the challenges. Alongside this, they straight up made it so you can’t progress the kill challenges on workshop maps for some godforsaken reason (“we did it to stop people cheesing it!” is not a valid reason since they can just use SAM). 

Finally, WHY is there an achievement tied to the devs streaming??? That’s terrible for obvious reasons.

6) Spyware

Apparently the devs put red shell spyware in this game and have it in their TOS that they can install spyware on your computer whenever they want so id be a bit cautious regardless of if its true or not.

This is basically everything I have to say about this game, I won’t be playing it again. I'm free.

That said, the gameplay is very repetitive and dry. Navigating singleplayer is tedious. One mistake, you're dead, and regardless of where you are in the chain, you have to start back over from the beginning of the 5 game chain and do it ALL over again even if you're just struggling on ONE specific matchup. You can grab clone upgrades so you don't have to immediately startover, but then you're missing out on ability upgrades you almost certainly need to overcome whatever is killing you.

Finally, everything feels very slow paced and lethargic. You feel like you're in a clunky industrial robot and not a robot designed for arena combat.

All of that said, I can totally understand why this game has the overwhelmingly positive rating it does. I don't think this is a bad game by any stretch, and I can see how many would find this enjoyable.

I instantly realized it was different from other games and I got it. I don't remember why but I didn't play it myself for a bit, but when I did I could not put it down. It is a great game, if you don't believe me and want to know more you can add me and talk to me about concerns on this game. Back when multiplayer, the fire update, story modes conclusion, zombie robots, the hammer, spear, and laser... I could go on but basically before all of that, the game was still addictive and crazy fun. There were some things I got frustrated at but overall it is a very well done game that I hope continues to stay alive and updated because every now and then I come back to it to get some nostalgia. Below I will list some good things I remember and bad things I remember.

Good things:
-The PvP system is balanced and new players can take down very skilled players.
-There is a way to limit use of powerful powers such as fire breath and lasers in the form of energy consumption.
-A very different system where you can lose limbs and parts of your body making the remaining enemies harder to kill before you can repair yourself increasing the stakes.
-The stakes are always high, if you die, you could lose a clone, which you will find are limited. If you die without a clone, you have to start over.
-Before you can unlock game changing powers, you have to complete challenges to test whether you deserve them.
-AI can be strong and give a real battle.
-Players can win even in a PvP setting even if the opponent has the clear advantage. 
-Emotes exist.
-Players are very chill and offer help with multiplayer and achievements often.

Bad things:
-Limited maps and enemies, there aren't as many maps as there should be. The enemies can be hard to fight, but after a while veterans can take out rooms of the hardest enemies with there eyes closed.
-Not many weapons and powers, not much to say here. There could be a more advanced skill tree and weapons.
-Cross teaming was a big problem, I'm not sure if it still is but I can say without a doubt that there will always be a teams in PvP
-The bosses, to put it simply, are not very entertaining or interesting. The final boss is in my personal opinion the only boss fight that was somewhat difficult. All the other bosses were either just swarms of robots that you could fight rather easily, or a spider or robot with spider legs that had a very simple kiting pattern, or a set of four robots that when fought alone become easy but when fought together are the stuff of nightmares.
-Lobbies are either very full or not full at all. 
-You can see peoples wins PvP, so everyone knows your everyone's skill level making it very predictable who to fight and who to avoid. 

There are many other things but I can't remember them well enough to give an honest review of them such as the level editor, the maps, the controls, etc. Overall a very good game I found worth the price and that I can say without a doubt is what got me into video games.",1652660817,1652660817,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For starters the music sucks, there is really one track you will hear the entire game and its just generic. The graphics are all right for what they are and that doesn't really matter, what matters most is the art style and that part sucks, I don't think the voxel look is really a bad one but this game doesn't do it that well and makes every thing look like an asset flip. The gameplay though is really good, the game goes for a less is more approach and I think that works in its favor, and its the only reason I keep coming back to this game. That ends the only good thing I have to say about this. The story mode sucks complete butt, what you get are some cool ideas implemented badly. The level design feels like if a 5th grader got their hands on a level editor, there are lots of open and unused space with a lot of walking and not a lot of fighting. This is mostly in the space ship part.

The weapons and upgrades. The way that this game has made its upgrades is fantastic, the weapons are unique and all feel like they have a use that no other weapon fits. Each weapon has its upsides and downsides, some weapons have some overlapping  upsides and downsides and can fill a similar purpose so it doesn't force you to get a certain weapon to deal with something and it is always possible to do it with another weapon.

The levels and maps. This is my personal favourite thing about this game, every map and levels play differently to the last, the layout of each map is different from the one before and even if a map is reused the level will still feel different from the unique set of enemies. Every map has different ways to deal with it from jet packing with a hammer to sniping with a bow.

The multiplayer modes. The multiplayer in this game is great, the connection is always smooth and doesn't feel janky. The modes from co-op to duels to ffa, they all feel like they fit and weren't just forced into the game for more content.

I would highly recommend this game to anyone who has some friends who has some money to burn and time as well, you can just chill with the bois and have a good time.",1645255034,1645255034,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False
