When you launch my rise all will appear normal, up until the match starts then all control input is ignored (or not event recognized) - I have gone through every suggestion I can find to try and resolve this issue - different input settings on steam, unplugging keyboard and mouse and launched in big picture mode, checking for any virtual devices or additional hardware being detected as an input device, even some more odd suggestions like launching it in normal mode and quickly unplug mouse - But still no matter what I have 0 ability to control the character in my rise.

They intentionally didn't put bad bunny on sale to force you to pay full price for a complete collection. 2K also started killing ALL online services to force you to buy the ""newer"" version within 2yrs. WWE 2k22 got hit by that, and it's likely they'll do the same with this game.

You fight the same person 6 or 7 times in a row and then finish the rivalry at a ppv.  Like the fans want to see that 7th match after the previous six weeks of weekly matches between the two.

Also, I got put in a tag team rivalry without my tag partner. Instead i had another teammate added that was part of a different tag team.  And the worst part is after the rivaly finished I immediately got put in another tag team match with my not teammate as my teammate.  I can't skip the match. I can't change to classic mode. I can't go in and quit out to resign the match and I'm not wrestling it.  So i'm uninstalling it.  

I hate this game.  Seriously one of the worst times i had with a game in recent memory.  All because i broke out my ps3 and SVR2011 and had such a good time in universe mode. I thought they surely would have made the mode better after 12 years......but its somehow way worse in every way.  

I didn't expect this at all from a 2k game.  They always deliver quality game modes in all their previous sports titles.  I don't even like basketball and I still buy NBA 2k every few years because franchise mode is so good.   2k5 still has a better franchise mode than madden.

If you're buying this game for other things like the showcase, online, gm or the myrise, it may be ok.  I didn't try those.  But do not buy for universe mode. Its seriously terrible.",1708388187,1708388187,False,1,0,0.492307692766189575,0,True,False,False

Introduction:
WWE 2K23, the latest installment in the long-running wrestling simulation series developed by Visual Concepts, brings the high-flying action and drama of WWE to life with improved graphics, enhanced gameplay mechanics, and an extensive roster of WWE Superstars. With the promise of delivering the ultimate WWE experience, fans eagerly anticipated this release. In this review, we'll examine the highlights and shortcomings of WWE 2K23 and determine if it lives up to expectations.

Improved Graphics and Presentation:
One of the standout features of WWE 2K23 is its impressive graphics and presentation. The game boasts highly detailed character models, lifelike animations, and dynamic lighting effects that add a new level of realism to the in-ring action. From the iconic entrances of WWE Superstars to the bone-crunching finishers, every moment is brought to life with stunning visual fidelity that captures the spectacle of WWE events.

Enhanced Gameplay Mechanics:
WWE 2K23 introduces several gameplay improvements aimed at delivering a more fluid and responsive experience in the ring. The revamped grappling system offers better control over moves and counters, allowing for more strategic and dynamic matches. Additionally, the addition of new match types and mechanics, such as backstage brawls and environmental interactions, adds variety and excitement to the gameplay experience. While these improvements are a step in the right direction, there are still areas where the gameplay could be further refined for a more polished experience.

Extensive Roster and Customization Options:
WWE 2K23 boasts an extensive roster of WWE Superstars, past and present, allowing players to step into the shoes of their favorite wrestlers and compete in dream matches and rivalries. The game also offers robust customization options, allowing players to create their own wrestlers, arenas, and championships with unprecedented depth and detail. Whether you're recreating classic moments from WWE history or forging new legends of your own, WWE 2K23 offers endless possibilities for creativity and expression.

Challenges and Drawbacks:
While WWE 2K23 delivers on many fronts, it is not without its challenges and drawbacks. Some players have reported issues with bugs, glitches, and performance optimization, particularly in the online multiplayer modes. Additionally, while the roster is extensive, there are notable omissions and outdated character models that may disappoint longtime fans. The game's career mode also lacks depth and replay value, with repetitive objectives and limited storytelling options that fail to engage players in meaningful ways.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, WWE 2K23 shows promise as a step forward for the franchise, with improved graphics, enhanced gameplay mechanics, and an extensive roster of WWE Superstars. While the game delivers an authentic WWE experience with its stunning presentation and deep customization options, there are areas where it falls short, such as technical issues, roster omissions, and lackluster single-player content. With further refinement and updates, WWE 2K23 has the potential to become the ultimate WWE gaming experience that fans have been waiting for.",1708107014,1708107014,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I did the tutorial, created 2 custom characters and several movesets and only played the ""the lock"" campaign once to completion. I tried medium and hard difficulty, but medium became too easy quickly, taking away part of the enjoyment. Hard is the appropriate level to really experience the story.
All this together took me 28 hours. A, imho, decent deal for 20-25€.

As for this story, it starts really, really badly. The setup is that you are the new future champion, winning your first title in your very first WWE match (you were a British wrestler before). The problem is that this premise is boring because it is essentially a ""Chosen One"" story. You have to complete story fights and have optional ""side fights"", which are presented in the most boring way: a paragraph delivered by a non-character that means fight X. Why would you do that? Upgrade points, which you will need [or play on medium]. There is no meaningful decision-making here. So the actual story is weak and the side stories are less interesting than food labels. 
About 5 hours into the game I switched from hard to medium for a single reason: I wasn't having fun. I was skipping the tedious and irrelevant chatter of non-characters and had one difficult fight after another. It felt more like grinding. But I decided to press on because while I had bought the game at a sizable discount, it was still 20+€ and I wanted to get my money's worth. And I'm glad I did.
You see, what I described is just the first 40% of the campaign. Then a shift happens and suddenly your Chosen One isn't the Chosen One any longer, but an actual character. Other characters who by that point have only been window dressing suddenly develop a certain depth and...well, become actual relatable characters. (Voice work is also great.) Stakes are raised and the unexpected happens time and again. Is it at the level of War and Peace? No. (E.g. a lot of interaction with others is via text messages, you know the drill.) 
But after almost quitting the game, when I finally landed the last punch of the campaign, I shot my fist into the air and shouted ""yeeeess!"". After the tedious 40% I had started listening to the story again, and I turned difficulty back up to hard. 
To me, the campaign succeeded in what it set out to do.   
So if you belong to a niche within a niche of players who actually just want to play your avatar in a wrestling season, get it. At a discount.

And to the developers, writers and voice actors: why the flying F are the first 40% of the campaign such utter garbage when you the rest shows how incredibly entertaining you story and characters can be??!! (Cudos)",1707083458,1707083652,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love the old 80/90s wrestlers Rick Rude and Mr Perfect etc so wanted to try a game that had them in it. After a lot of research into which (modern) wrestling game to go for it was between 2k14, 2k19 and this .. according to the fans. 

So, I initially got 2k19 and it's great, a bit fiddly to install mods etc for my fav wrestlers but I'm getting there. 

Anyway, I saw a youtube video of 2k23 with Rick Rude and saw it on offer so decided to get it and see what it's like but straight away compared to 2k19 I didn't like it. Felt shallow and child-like, almost stupid. Even the animations weren't great so I immediately uninstalled. I couldn't help but think that a lot of hype and presentation goes into the new games but this one shows that the game-play itself is an after-thought. Maybe if I was 12 years old, mashing buttons while screaming at the monitor with my friends, it'd probably be an excellent game but as an older person looking a bit more substance and depth it's sorely lacking. It seems more and more modern games are becoming about how it looks and how slick and flashy it all seems but underneath the bonnet there ain't anything there.

Yes, the Quick Grapples (along with Chain Wrestling) were removed for 2k22, but they are still missed here. Every grapple requires a lock-up presiding it in order to do a move, making every match a complete slog to get through and steadily sucks the fun out of each match. Don't let the other positive reviews fool you, many are of the casual persuasion and don't engage with this game for many great lengths of time. This might be ok for the causal gamer only passing through out of curiosity, but everyone else who expected a ""Wrestling Game"", as opposed to a watered-down, mortal kombat-esque fighting game, are just out of luck. The improved striking system, while not at all bad, replaces the Quick Grapple mechanic, greatly limiting gameplay feel. You wanted to wrestle in the style of a technical/mat-based or cruiser-weight wrestler? Your out of luck. The gameplay only favors Strikers and slow-moving giants. Fast moving gameplay is non-existent. 
And of course 2k's controversial decision to nuke the modding community is the biggest mistake they made. I bought 2k23 on PC solely for this reason, as 2k19's modding scene was fantastic. But this decision hurts them greatly.

This game is carried by it extensive CAW system which is unmatched by any other game. In hind sight if you took the engine and just made a generic title, then the creation community would remake every wrestler. The WWE name mean nothing to this game CAW engine. My faction is a system of gambling on cards.... yet when they shut down the servers, none of the card can be used or even transferred over. So you are literally throwing away money if you use money in my faction. Servers are slated to be shut down a year after the release of the next game.
The DLC is also only for the moves and parts not the characters. The DLC character are already CAW creations that are better than the one they offer. If you are playing this game it is either for nostalgia of your favorite wrestler, your dream to be Vince, or to scratch that wrestling itch. By no means are you playing this because it is quality. Same people did AEW but its a flop, why you say. They left out there detailed CAW engine, but I feel they did that on purpose to not compete with there real cash cow. 

Final call on the game 5.5/10
Creation mod 9/10

This game literally make money off of kids gambling, banning content creator and allowing corn to run free in CAW servers. Seriously I can not go into images with out leaning a new corn stars name and look. If you have a child keep them away from this game or monitor there play. They have the MAPS flag in this game. If you do not know then educate yourself. I am for every one in all walks of life....just stay in you lane. I don't push my religion or lack of religion on you, so don't push you thoughts and lifestyle one me. All of this yet the bra and panties match is considered taboo lol. Seriously check the flags they are at the bottom if you own the game.

Oh boy... what a mixed bag we got here. 

Visuals look good but not exactly to the quality and smoothness I would expect from a game updated every year for the last 23 years in comparison to contemporaries like Madden, NBA2k or Fifa.

Despite this the download size is eggregious with it being 65gbs with another ""synchronization update"" after you boot the game. 
Which will then railroad you into creating a faction in some new mode they seem to really want you to be excited about. Everytime you accidentally select this option onwards sit tight for several minutes while it downloads more ""updates"". 

In case you thought you could blindly skip through all the new features nonsense by spamming the A button you now have to hold it down to progress to the next sections everytime you select something new. 

The Roster seems to have drifted towards a pay to unlock model like an EA title even to the extent of preventing you from downloading community CAWs that have clothing elements in them you have not yet purchased.

Speaking of the CAW section it feels like a step backwards with less to offer out the gate than previous versions from 10 years ago. The Community downloads area takes forever to load each page and does not have a intuitive search function with the community having to overcome this by using searchable custom ""hashtags"". 
If you are not discouraged by all of this and continue forward through with downloading CAWS you will likely then run into a ""cloud synchronization error"" which will crash the game and prevent you from launching the game again until you turn off cloud sync in the game's steam options. 

That being said I have already spent too much of my life playing this game. The core game that held me so long ago is still there, just mired under a myriad of bullsh!t.

As a game, it's fun. Controls are comfortable, aesthetics are mostly pleasant to look at, and the gameplay modes are pretty fun if you're looking for something to kill some time. My favorite part of the game is easily the Creation Suite. You can apply just about ANYTHING you want to your custom wrestler and movesets. You can make really cool customized arenas and championships, however Custom Entrances are a bit buggy with certain elements (light show options, pyro options, etc.) I personally can't stand game modes like what MyFaction is, but that's just my personal taste. I'll get into that later.... Overall the game itself is average leaning more positive.

HOWEVER... This series of games has a very real issue I would like to shed some light upon. For starters, as I write this review on 1/20/2024, 2K have already begun promoting their next release, WWE 2K24. In the weeks leading up to these announcements and promotions, certain qualities of WWE 2K23 have begun to deteriorate and leave a lot to be desired. The BIGGEST flaw I've uncovered is with the online servers, particularly as it pertains to the Community Creations feature with Online. Trying to upload logos to the Community Creations Image Uploader website, only to be sitting here over an hour later and still can't download the logos I upload is ridiculous. Not to mention, trying to surf the Community Creations downloads tab, only to find that MAYBE half of the creations will actually load onto screen.

Now, I want to gripe on the MyFaction mode. I'll be honest, I have nothing positive to say about this mode. I've never cared for games that play like this mode does, it's just not for me. However, MyFaction has certain unlockable features that WOULD hypothetically make this game infinitely more playable, as they add in more and more unlockables as the games lifespan extends. The problem comes in when you realize these unlockables are exclusive to MyFaction, the only way to access them beyond the mode is to cut corners and mod the game. 2K really needs to consider making MyFaction unlockables accessible throughout the rest of the game in future installations.

To summarize, this is 2K/Visual Concepts second attempt at a WWE2K entry. 2K24 will be Attempt #3 to get it right. I'm cautiously optimistic, as someone who has played these games since I was in elementary school.",1705804149,1705804149,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

All I can say is I really enjoy revisiting a wrestling game and seeing some of the old superstars I used to enjoy playing as like RVD, The Rock and Eddie Guerrero and love to download creations from the community, they've done an amazing job allowing me to relive that nostalgia from old games.

You cannot actually change the custom match tables without encountering bugs. For example, try setting random title matches on weekly shows with a low percentage: that makes it so there are title shots happen EVERY WEEK. Some characters, no matter their ranking and their popularity, get matches every week. The rivalry system gets old and repetitive very quickly.

If you are like me and wanted to play solely MyRise mode for some relaxed wrestling gameplay, don't buy this. This mode has forced objectives in way too many matches.

Both story modes are really good, GM mode is improved over last year, showcase is always fun to go through and the Wargames match is a nice addition that I hope gets elimination added.

However the online community creations is way too slow. It takes over a minute to open and 30 seconds per page to load so browsing through multiple pages is just way too frustrating. Since I usually download a lot of content for Universe mode and GM mode I gave up and went back to 2K22.

Then they banned mod support. I don't care for online matches or their boring microtransaction-heavy MyFaction I just want mods to add more interesting content.

The most enjoyable parts of the game are Universe Mode where you get to make your own entire customizable realm of WWE including fully editable weekly shows with custom rosters. Without all of the DLC characters, it isn't really that fun. The game is also very limiting when it comes to writing an actual storyline using Universe Mode for your feuds. With this type of game, every single little detail should be customizable. 2K really likes to lock a lot of cool additions behind DLC price gates and makes us shill out as much as EA does with Sims 4 packs. So many older versions of the WWE series of games have better features and better running games. Please reevaluate how you make these games and actually make a good game.

-finishing moves felt less satisfying because WWE 2K games are leaning towards realism
-I still play SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 and Here Comes the Pain through PS2 emulator from time to time, playing WWE 2K games just felt less satisfying when performing finisher moves or when it comes to bashing people in the head or slamming people to the ground
-online multiplayer servers are rubbish, only 1 out of 5 times where my games will loaded up before it gave me the ""server timeout, do you still want to continue the match with AI instead?""
-grappling moves just felt so random

WWE 2K23 are still a good game for today's standard. here's hoping that 2K will tone down the realism a bit in WWE 2K24, and try to capture the gameplay of the old Smackdown vs. Raw games and mix it with 2K flavors.",1704044118,1704047767,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There a tons of content within the game and I've been enjoying experiencing all the features. I'm sure there is more content than I will ever be able to get through. 
As I put more hours into the game learning the ropes, I'm finding there are some broken parts of the matches.

The first issue I've found is that I can't always make a tag when I'm physically in reach or my teammates (even stunned in the corner with 3 mates by me).

The second is that there are many times where a rope break would be possible but an option was not there. (Drew McIntyre's meaty leg was under a rope while being pinned).
I hope these issues do not reoccur too often, I'm still giving this game some hope but those two broken functions were quite frustrating to experience.

Bad is it is def. a polished 2k22.......I enjoy it, but it's def,  just a big rework/update. Same features. Also the ""I don't want a tutorial"" does not work. It will be like cool we have a veteran on our hands. And still make you suffer through stupid pop ups telling you how to play ruining match after match after match. I would not recommend this game as it has so so many bugs.

I keep playing this only because I paid for it and there is no competition for it. As patches have come out, this game has become WORSE with the bugs. They spend too much time on the PAY TO PLAY, My faction(garbage feature) and don't address issues like wrestlers arms disappearing or them having seizures, or the switching you to another wrestler in the middle of a match, they hide things inside this game to only be unlocked to play inside the pay to play My Faction. I will not buy another WWE2k game if they are going to keep wasting time and space on Micro transaction games. This product was last good around 2009. Last time effort was put into the game.

Another update.
   Since day 0 there has been a bug with tag team matches where you lose control of your own player randomly. There is another bug where in universe mode it fails to load matches and crashes the game. These are two examples of how bugs never get addressed, but micro transaction mode gets updated..........Will not buy the next one if it has this micro transaction mode in it again. The dev's care more about micro transactions than making the game you paid for working properly.

The mods were patched recently, you can't add anything except soundeditor (changes your music as custom music or sound effects). Like I didn't try to cheat. I just want to add mods for fun. Not to cheat.

The online service [b] SUCKS. [/b] I been waiting FOR 15 MINUTES to play against other player. One time I am playing against other player. I took a LOT DAMAGES and I can't reverse their cheesy moves.

The DLCs is just unlocking DLC characters and moves that you want. Only I like their DLC is Luke Gallows, Wade Barrett (Not Bad News Barrett or Nexus), and Bray Wyatt. But why is it 13 CAD EACH???

MyRise is boring to me. A Lock story is you are being a douchebag as you don't want him to be. Legacy? tbh I haven't beat it because I don't feel like I want to beat it due to the lock.

Showcase? Well its John Cena ofc but you are playing as John Cena's opponents and win the matches. Bruh (no cm punk ofc).

MyGM? It's fun but as longer you go. You will get bored easily (maybe).

MyUniverse? Same thing as before but you can play as Superstar.

MyFaction? Well It's similar with MyTeam from NBA2k Series. It's grindy game but I don't bother go there because I lost interest into it after couple weeks.

Only thing that keeps me to enjoy is a Play Matches. I can create my own story with my wrestlers. (sometimes I used them in myuniverse).

This is not a worth to play. The game will shut down if WWE 2k25 or 2k26 comes out. And you can't access to online and such. [b] WHY IS IT LIVE SERVICEABLE? [/b]

The counter prompts are off, not sure how they can continously do this, but least they keep that streak going right. In a game where countering is needed specially with the AI able to leap right to their feet with only a little stamina time after time, and recover swiftly when they don't auto jump to their feet. Not to mention being able to hit moves that you can't counter repeatedly, time after time. 

Like how hard is it to make sure your counter prompts are displaying at the appropriate time? Evidently impossible after all these years of making the same type of wrestling game they can't. Though once you get it down, or just keep getting lucky, the Y counter or triangle becomes fairly effective. Still won't help their autograbs, and moves where not even hitting the correct hold or attack button works. Which this is new to me, as not played a few of the WWE 2k games. not many I missed but evidently if they had this in the previous game I missed it.

The make an entrance is just blah, I prefer the older ones, which were more in depth, and easier to use then the current one is. It's hard to set things the way you want them as you really can't pause (or if you can I haven't found out how to after staring at the controls for several minutes at a time, looking for the way to pause it.) 

The faces are great they look like the wrestlers for the most part, the mouths and mouth sync is as wonky as ever, kiiiiinda scary ngl. Still it's an improvement over some of the others. The wrestling except for the above prompts showing up to late to actually counter the move with is rather enjoyable.

I do like the MyRise (haven't played anything else yet.) With interesting stories, still need to see if your choices actually matter, or if it's just the illusion of choice as in many other games. The fact I can play a female wrestler is great, with a good story, though not made it far I believe. 

Graphics are good, music is as ever fantastic. 

Button mashing for some things goes up at to slow of a pace, like I can kick out before a 1 count, but when they start dragging me to a corner and spose to press the B repeatedly it's not enough time, then of course it launches into a Y counter that the prompt ooooff course shows up to late to be useful. (yeah can you tell I'm annoyed by the lateness of the prompt). 

Overall a game to while away the hours, though the amount of frustration does build when you hit get into some types of matches. the more opponents there are either against you, or in a tag team the more frustration builds as you really have to stun everyone most times in order to get a pin.

-------------

The most important part, the wrestling combat was fluid and excellent. Physics collision interaction between the wrestlers and with environment was very good and better than ever. Keyword WAS, however after one of the recent patch updates it has broken the hit detection consistency. Hits often don't connect anymore. Connecting with hits during crucial moments no longer connect creating frustrating moments and due to this also making the animations look really bad. Irish whipping moves from rope rebounds by the AI see them just stand and bounce of each other instead of executing their moves. 

One on One matches with the AI is too easy even on the hardest difficulty but mix in a few more wrestlers into a match and things get a lot more interesting and chaotic. The AI feels like it makes better decisions. Matches have a lot more drama and all the action and mayhem feels organic and great. The stamina as the match goes on longer and through a lot of damage should have had a much bigger impact but instead the characters can move and pull off moves with as ease as when at the start of match.

The presentation and lighting look great. The low detail referee needs a serious improvement. It may be a small thing in comparison to the others features that need improvement & have greater priority but the flat low detailed referee model can be jarring especially when most of the time the referee is in a totally statue still position with hardly any animation to show natural movement. Furthermore the referee can be slow and take too long to find a correct spot to start a pin count and on other occasions can be in front of the action obstructing the player view.

The roster this year included has many wrestlers and arenas from attitude era and ruthless aggression. There is the return of the likes of Kurt Angle, Cactus Jack, Kane, Rikishi, The Hurricane and others.

The story mode, MYRISE is also a decent play through. The men's Lock story campaign though is weaker than the women's Legacy campaign. Legacy has a much better story line, better matches and better and more unlockable items than the Lock story mode. The Lock story was slow at the start and better after second chapter (small spoiler) but it takes you out of the ""WWE"" and when the character returns the story halts and finishes quickly with only a grind of matches to recruit wrestlers in between.

The Cena Showcase mode was a disappointment. There is no commentary in the matches or voice over from Cena just generic looping music, ruining immersion. Then there is long stretches of video footage within the gameplay instead of short to the point dramatic video moments like in previous Showcase modes that smoothly transitioned back to gameplay. The videos also have a lot of censored blurring due to permission and license that 2K or WWE did not want to pay for. It is a big let down especially if anyone has played 2K15 and 2K16 Showcase mode to be able to compare to.

Create A Wrestler is fantastic. Able to customize nearly every part with fine detail and control. Only body type could have done with more choice with sliders.

Online
---------

The online servers were totally broken when the game launched and it took awhile for 2K fix it but so far it has been working fine in just accessing the online mode itself. 

MyFaction which is the cynical MTX(microtransaction) P2W(pay2win) mode 2K wants to make money with and there are wrestlers that are locked only to that mode unnecessarily only with intention to make users play MyFaction and generate money through loot box card packs. It was interesting to see so many different characters are available to play and have been designed by the developers but not included to play with the roster in normal mode. 

MyFaction is understandably a grind to progress and while a decent set of cards can be earned through normal progression and by completing objectives, the currency and progression is designed so that paying money for packs that are loot boxes is the preferred method 2K wants you to unlock the best characters with best stats to progress and win. 

The MyFaction mode is further aggressive to try and push players to purchase the virtual currency and loot box packs through not only the cost value of cards and packs but if receiving a duplicate card from a reward, the player receives a measly amount of MFP(MyFaction Points) to compensate for the duplicate that doesn't correspond with it's value such as a duplicate of a high ranking card. There are events that are locked if a player does not have a specific set of cards with no way to earn and unlock through normal play so paying to have a chance of getting a card is required. This also plays into the FOMO(fear of missing out) content with events that are time limited. The P2W structure is further evident in the multiplayer side of MyFaction where people who paid for the best cards will have a big advantage so no one risks even playing online in MyFaction portion of that mode.

Conclusion
--------------

There are areas that are still weak with room for improvement or missing features in comparison to older games in the series. A few odd omissions with entrance customization's and still some bugs & glitches during gameplay. In Universe mode, there is one particular quirk noticed with the mode where matches appear as tag matches but when entering the match it always becomes a singles fight.

Overall a decent package, with a strong roster, many gameplay modes that can create genuine cool wrestling moments with chaos and momentum swings back and forth, and that is not even fully mentioning MyGM and Universe mode.

In its current state however with the hit detection that was good before but now broken through an update by the developers this game cannot be recommended until that important core feature of a wrestling fighting game is fixed to a better level of polish that did exist when the game originally was released.",1702760469,1702822306,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

  YES! YES! YES!

 It's pretty fun, and has improved off of 2K22 pretty well. However, they have removed some cool things from the last games, like fatigued pins, and being able to control direction of crawling away from your opponent, or towards the ropes, etc. Also, sometimes the game forces you to go out of the ring in random moments, and also there are much less opportunities to reverse moves. (Made especially annoying on legend difficulty.) As a last note, it's also kinda annoying that walking away from your opponent automatically makes you turn away from them.

MyGM is a fun game mode that takes a lot of strategy and thinking, and although it is not perfect, it is a huge improvement from 2K22's version. Myrise is fun, but I do kind of prefer the 2K22 version of it. But the big thing that makes the game shine the most is the community creations. So to end this review of the game, I would say this: be careful with how you close the game. I've had everything wiped twice now, so when you open the game, make sure you close it within the game itself; don't click alt + f4 or go to Steam and click the cancel launch button; it will most likely wipe your game.

First off, the graphics are pretty impressive. The wrestlers look realistic, and the arenas are detailed. It adds a level of immersion that makes you feel like you're right there in the ring. The entrances are spot-on, capturing the essence of each wrestler's personality.

The gameplay is intuitive, even for someone like me who doesn't spend hours gaming every day. The controls are easy to pick up, with simple button combinations for executing moves. The variety of moves and the responsiveness of the controls keep the matches exciting and dynamic.

One of the highlights for me was the roster. W2K23 boasts an extensive lineup of wrestlers from different eras, allowing you to recreate classic matchups or dream bouts between your favorite superstars. The character creation feature is also a fun addition, letting you personalize your own wrestler and bring them into the mix.

The career mode is engaging, offering a storyline that keeps you invested in your created wrestler's journey. It's a nice touch that adds depth to the overall gaming experience. The backstage segments and interactions with other wrestlers add a layer of authenticity to the career mode.

However, it's not all perfect. The load times between matches can be a bit on the long side, and I've encountered a few minor glitches here and there. Nothing game-breaking, but it's worth mentioning.

In terms of game modes, W2K23 has a good mix. From standard one-on-one matches to tag teams and Royal Rumble, there's plenty to keep you entertained. The addition of online multiplayer adds another dimension, allowing you to test your skills against players from around the world.

In conclusion, W2K23 is a solid addition to the wrestling game genre. It caters well to both hardcore fans and casual gamers like myself. With its impressive graphics, accessible gameplay, and diverse roster, it's a title that's sure to provide hours of entertainment for wrestling enthusiasts.",1700836875,1700836875,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

WWE 2K23 now offers smoother controls and a more responsive in-ring experience thanks to improved gameplay mechanics. The moves feel natural, and the updated submission system brings a fun new obstacle. The AI does, however, occasionally behave strangely, which takes away from the immersion.

WWE 2K23's roster is varied and offers a wide variety of both current and past WWE superstars. Players can now create distinctive personas thanks to the expanded character creation options. The visual presentation is impressive, featuring exquisite arenas and finely detailed character models that perfectly depict WWE events.

WWE 2K23 provides various game modes, including a career mode with gripping storylines and branching paths, are available to accommodate different player preferences. Some match types, however, may become repetitive over time due to a lack of innovation.

Even though the commentary is generally good, it could use more variety and lively dialogue to keep listeners interested throughout matches.

In conclusion, WWE 2K23 offers a satisfying wrestling experience thanks to its enhanced gameplay mechanics, varied roster, and stunning visuals.

WWE 2K23 marks a commendable return to form for 2K Games in the realm of wrestling titles, showing significant progress from the infamous WWE 2K20. While not flawless, this instalment takes substantial strides in the right direction, introducing new and returning game modes, a plethora of customisation options, and delivering mostly smooth gameplay. However, as of this review, the game is not without its share of issues.

Overall, I would cautiously recommend this game.

The Good:

Expanded Customisation: Building on its predecessor, WWE 2K23 offers an extensive array of customisation options, allowing players to tailor their experience to a remarkable degree.

Up-to-Date Roster: The game maintains a mostly current roster, ensuring that players can engage with their favourite wrestling personalities from the present era.

Impressive Graphics: WWE 2K23 boasts stellar graphics, immersing players in a visually striking wrestling universe that adds to the overall gaming experience.

Engaging Story Mode: The inclusion of a decent story mode adds depth to the single-player experience, offering narrative-driven content for those who enjoy a more immersive journey.

The Bad:

Online Woes Persist: Unfortunately, the online mode still grapples with connectivity issues, hindering the overall experience for those seeking competitive or cooperative play.

Bugs and Glitches Linger: Despite strides made from the previous installment, WWE 2K23 is not entirely free from bugs and glitches.

Attempted Removal of Modding Support: A notable drawback is their attempt of removing modding support, limiting the community's ability to enhance and extend the game's longevity through user-generated content.

Building upon the successes of WWE 2K22, WWE 2K23 showcases a what-could-be positive trajectory for the series. However, persistent online challenges, occasional technical hiccups, and concerns about DLC practices underscore that there's still work to be done. As 2K Games continues to refine its wrestling titles, there is hope for further improvement. Here's to hoping that the developers learn from both the successes and shortcomings of WWE 2K23, paving the way for an even more polished experience in future iterations.

Create your own custom shows, play dream matches and thanks to the community creations you can download wrestlers from the past and others who aren't in the WWE and put them in your roster.
The community is so excellent, people are constantly uploading wrestler's latest costumes and gear so you can keep everything up to date it's so cool.
Some community made wrestlers look kind of dodgy but other creators are so talented they often legit look like official models which could have shipped with the game.
Ever wanted to see CM Punk fight Seth Rollins or Brock Lesnar fight Hogan? You can do that.

One thing i wish they would add to these games is the option to customise entrance music with MP3's. It would be so easy to do especially on PC. I'm sure there was a wrestling game on the OG Xbox back in the day where you could do that.

Yet, I decided to pull the trigger and give the game a try. I have always enjoyed the older WWE games, especially the SVR series. However, I took a break from it due to the new direction the games were taking. It was not until last year I started to regain interest in the WWE games when I began hearing about the massive improvements to the 2K series. Now 2K23 is far from perfect, but it is heading back in the right direction. As someone who enjoys the storytelling aspect in games, I am really enjoying showcase mode and MyRise the most. To be able to play through John Cena's career, arguably one of the GOAT, is a really cool experience. In MyRise, you can create your own story, join factions, and become the ultimate champion. WWE 2K23 is a great wrestling game. I have not had this much fun from a WWE game since SVR.

I have no interest in MyFaction. What idiot is going to waste good time and money on something that is removed after 2 years? What is the point? Wasting money on rankings they reset every 2 years? Dumb, yet every time I log in, I have to connect to it and download something. Also, I was FORCED into doing the MyFaction tutorial where they made me select and form a male and female faction from a list of people I've never heard of—a gameplay element I don't want to use and I activity dislike.

CAW downloads are still garbage; you can't easily look for people, every page takes forever to load, and it crashes. You can't download some CAWs because people used locked items from this showcase. I don't like John Cena that much; he's an okay actor. Why do I need to play his dumb story to download CAW of Bob Backlund, who happens to be wearing some of Cena's shoes? I will spend the next 20 hours trying to figure out a way to make a playable Universe mode and kindly ignore all your other money-grubbing annoying bullshit. I better hurry up and download all the CAWs I can get cus the game will be shut down soon and the only thing making it playable removed.

Thanks for being the only people to make wrestling games, so I am forced to buy it if I want to play any wrestling. I hope you keep discounting these under $5 within a year. I'll keep buying it and not spending any more money on your micro-transactions.

(Old review)
After over 300 hours of messing around with 2k22, they ruined it at the end of the year. I can't download CAWs, and I don't enjoy trying to rebuild dozens of the old wrestlers I like from the past. So after fighting it for a while, I decided to download this.

While downloading, I watched someone play the MyRise for a bit, and it's horrible! Cheesy and only like 2 hours of non-gameplay story. Then when it finished downloading, I went into the CAWs, and there were tons of people missing that others had made in 2k22. None of the classic New Japan wrestlers were there, and some of the rings people made from the last game were missing. So I uninstalled it and requested a refund. I guess I'll wait until it goes on a bigger sale or just skip the games for a few years; maybe they will be able to afford to keep their games running for more than two years at a time in the future.",1698579333,1700463473,False,1,0,0.47784113883972168,0,True,False,False

Updated on 11/18/2023

They added a patch putting a block on mods and ridiculous rules of what you can and cant upload.  Like nothing from tv shows can be made and allowed.

They bring new models to the game and put them as MYFACTION only so you can't use them in single player modes which sucks because I would love to have lilly in tingle player especially after they shut off the servers next year in January which brings me to my next negative.

Now 2k is so quick to shut off servers to try to force your hand to buy the new addition.  They are shutting off WWE2k22 servers in beginning of Jan (Jan 4th I believe)  So this will be the same for 2K23 next year.

So you warn these cards in MYFACTION  for what you don't get the models in single player so when they shut off the servers you have nothing to show for your time and if you bought some packs you have nothing to show for your money as well.

I left NBA2k 3 years ago due to 2K's BS and this will be my last WWE2K.  It's no longer worth the money due to their low morals and crappy business practices.",1680243023,1700340813,False,3,0,0.515062451362609863,0,True,False,False

                                                    ****UPDATE****

Time for my updated review, so this game has been a big upgrade from 22 it looks better
load times are way faster, AI seems more responsive, the universe mode went through the most changes but it still has some problems like lack of match types and limitations in the creation suite honestly i think they should bring back the layer system because sometimes i wanna create a caw with a specific look 
but when i add both clothing it doesn't go the way i want because it puts one clothing under the wrong clothing part, and 2k needs to stop limiting entrances let me make a team of 4 superstars and have
a way to set up entrances for 4 people, overall its a great game but some of the limitations and things were removed make no sense.

                                                       -Pros
Looks great
advanced entrances
ai is better
universe mode's rivalry actions

                                                                       -cons
Creation suite limitations
not enough match types
females still cant bleed (seriously why?) 
lack of new cut scenes in universe (we need ones similar to my rise)
online still randomly lose connection

I love the feel of the game and how close to reality it feels, but that does not mean the game needs to cut off from the random OMG moments. The lights added backstage are a cool concept and should be expanded on further, which is very likely as stated in reviews. 
Improvements - 
More running reversals into finishers (for example - deep six and sister abigail can be hit if finisher is hit at the right time when the opponent is running)
Combo + Grapples. There are a lot of pacing issues faced by the game due grapple moves being one move only, then the player has to hit yet another grapple move and it breaks momentum and reduces the immersion. The execution should be more in the style of Northern Lights suplex and/or comeback move.
Fix the submission technique, button mashers are annoying.
Allow us to do changes to the in-game model.
My faction models should be transferrable to main game. Ban them from online
Better Ai for dragging and corner finishers. Its super annoying for a person who does that for content.
Make the game difficult or add more randomness
Rollout is a terrible system
Better tired finishers
And FIX online.
Universe mode needs a lot of detail work. Here are a few things which are very possible knowing the limitaions of the game-
Better UI
Better flow between the matches, which can be fixed by just adding a next button, cool transitions and promos. '
Best idea is mixing the MyGm as a concept.
Champions should feel like one. Adding commentary for how long they have been champions, game already calculates that so why not let Michael Cole exclaim it for certain superstars. Longest reigning champions, Best challenger and No. 1 contender match commentary.
Drafting (maybe...)

Edit because I want to put more thought into this, also excuse my English.
- Yes the game can be really fun if you play with family and friends, the controls are responsive and cleverly designed for newbies to just mash buttons. The game is fun and that's great. 

Now to the bad:
- Lets me start with the damn promo system, supposedly they remove it because it doesn't work at all with the 2k20 game (then make it work). I understand that the promo itself was not very good but it's a good way to build up the rivalry. I don't want Roman Reign and John Cena go head to head every week on smackdown, in 2k19 you they would book promo between the Manager and the wrestler and it's great why cant we have that back.

- Now to rivalry system, what the hell happened? thing used to be so dynamic in WWE 12, sure its not the best thing but it fun and exciting like you never know whats gonna happened next. What with this strict ass 1on1 Rivalry, and all the storyline are the same too, no heel no babyface everybody just trynna break others legs up. Pair that with the stupid enemies and alliance system they have and you will get the same feud repeating every year. Aso bring back story collection from 2K15 please.

- ""You know you can book them however you like right?"" Yess and I love that they let us do that but I just want to sit back and enjoy the show, if I want to book for my enjoyment I would play GM or better booking game out there.",1698397062,1699860840,False,55,6,0.723690450191497803,1,True,False,False

Pros:

1) Simple controls that are easy to pick up. You don't NEED to know some crazy button combos to be competent at the game.

2) A properly huge roster of characters to choose from that spans over decades of WWE. You may be a fan, a causal who remembers a couple of wrestlers or just pick someone who looks cool to you, there is a wrestler for everyone.

3) Pretty decent graphics for what it is.

Cons:

1) Reversals in fights can make each match last for quite some time. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but if you want snappy match-ups to allow for quick clashes and passing of controllers, this is probably not the game.

Featuring John Cena on the cover and as the Showcase star is a brilliant choice, and the MyRise storyline adds an extra layer of enjoyment. As a fan of FIFA's Ultimate Team, I find the MyFaction mode appealing, though it could benefit from more advanced gameplay and a marketplace.

-Game glitches and freezes
-Was expecting an updated create-a-finisher with more ways to create a finisher, but that feature was completely removed from the game
-No new match types, nor did they bring back some of the great match types such as slobber knocker matches
-No way to interfere in matches like how it happens in the show
-Some superstars still do their iconic taunts wrong (i.e. Roman Reign’s corner superman punch move has the same wrong taunt)
-Limited ways to perform a finisher(i.e. for the move “spear”, why can’t they make it both a corner finisher and a running finisher, instead of having user consume two finisher slots in create-a-moveset?
And the list of cons go on. Only the graphics feel updated. I think they might be doing this on purpose to have people buy their games every year, which I won’t be doing.

+improved lighting system that makes the game look even better if you have a PC capable of maxing out the settings (at low settings, it just looks like WWE 2k22 with heavier contrast)
+improvements in the eyes of the models  (the wrestlers don't look like goofy bug-eyed weirdos anymore). 
+there are also improvements in the wrestlers' hair, but it's on a case by case basis. e.g. long haired HHH's hair (you can unlock him on showcase) looks decent now compared to 2k22, but Bret Hart still looks like Buckwheat. The CAW hairs are still crap, though. I don't know if they're ever going to fix that.
+the window for reversals is shortened so you're going to really have to work at reversing moves now.

Other than that, it's still got the same problems as the previous iteration - including freakishly slow servers that make browsing the community creations 10 times longer (I was going to refund this game, but ended up blowing through the 2 hour window just by browsing the community creations. And it's not like I have slow internet - I finished downloading the game in an hour - and that's another disadvantage to this game. It's 80GB now, compared to WWE2K22's 55GB, while providing similar amounts of content.) 

Basically, get this game if you still don't have WWE 2K22. If you already have 2K22, this game is not worth the price even at 50% off. Wait for an even deeper discount (if it comes at all, 2K is stingy) or wait for 2K24 and see if it adds a lot more to warrant the price tag.",1698802859,1698981759,False,1,1,0.51327437162399292,0,True,False,False

The in-ring experience remains entertaining, with engaging matches and realistic animations. However, the game is marred by the presence of numerous bugs and technical issues, which can be frustrating and disruptive to the overall experience.

One notable drawback is the player career mode, which falls flat in terms of excitement and engagement. It lacks the depth and storytelling elements that could make it a compelling journey for players to experience. The potential for an immersive career mode is there, but WWE 2K23 fails to fully capitalize on it, leaving players longing for a more fulfilling single-player experience.

In conclusion, WWE 2K23 offers enjoyable wrestling gameplay, but its bugs and the underwhelming player career mode prevent it from reaching its full potential.

Being as that I have not watched in so long I have no idea who about 98% of who is on the roster. I played The Lock (male) career and it was ok as I really didn't like the story, so I switched the female My Rise and it has a much better story.

I have hit this wall and can no longer progress in the game. I could restart but I put about 22 hours of total gameplay into it and I am not prepared to do that. If I had known about this bug which I now have learned is very common, I never would have bough this game.  Spending some time researching a solution to this forever loading screen, it seems that there is none and it has been an issue for at least 6 months.

Basic game : 5 yes and golden buzzer 
-----------------------------------------

For MyFaction: No! No! No! No!  In case you don't understand, No is no 
If you are one of the top players please go ahead and enjoy it ~ 
If you are not, don't waste your money on this
1. NPCs' Signature moves damage is too high ~ also how to interrupt Signature Moves and Finisher Moves ? 
2.Also the cage mode: if you are fighting in the cage how can you see the cage bar in front of you ? 
3. Why does the referee always stand in front of you when you need to push ""Y"" or stand in the middle of the fight ?  
4. is there any way to turn off the auto lock-on ?  just bring on much more negative impact 
5. What is wrong with Proving Grounds Ch 1: Genesis Match 1 Legendary Noam Dar ? He is much stronger than Match 5 Legendary Ilja Dragunov, with an incredible counter rate, 50% chance you can't even use same combo twice, and this is just Match 1, i don't think this is a reasonable setting for a Ch1 Match 1 Bronze Card lv NPC ...  NPCs never feel tired
6. dodge notice, a very small yellow icon can be anywhere, sometimes above your head, sometimes below your groin, or somewhere else,  less than 0.5s how can you react?   
7. let's talking about live event:  3 giants ? seriously? also, purple lv Sumo vs golden lv player ? 
8. the react time is so F...in' short, how many fingers do you have ? And what is the point to smash the button ?  
This is not an upgraded AI but cheating!

WWE 2K23 is an absolute triumph in the world of professional wrestling video games, delivering an experience that's nothing short of electrifying. As a longtime fan of both the WWE and the gaming industry, I couldn't be more thrilled with what this installment brings to the table.

First and foremost, the graphics in WWE 2K23 are jaw-dropping. The attention to detail in the character models is impeccable, with each superstar looking more lifelike than ever before. From the sweat glistening on their brows to the way their gear shimmers under the arena lights, the visual fidelity in this game is top-notch. It's like having a ringside seat to all the action, and it's clear that the developers spared no expense in making sure every detail was just right.

But it's not just about looks; WWE 2K23 also packs a serious punch when it comes to gameplay. The controls are intuitive, making it easy for newcomers to jump right in while offering enough depth to keep veterans engaged. The new grappling system is a game-changer, adding an extra layer of strategy to each match. Whether you're locking in a submission hold or executing a high-flying move from the top rope, every action feels responsive and impactful.

One of the standout features of WWE 2K23 is the robust roster of superstars. With a mix of current talent, legends, and surprise appearances, there's no shortage of dream matchups to explore. The game's career mode is a true highlight, allowing players to create their own wrestler and guide them through the highs and lows of a WWE career. The storytelling in this mode is immersive, with plenty of twists and turns to keep you invested.

Online multiplayer is another area where WWE 2K23 shines. The matchmaking system is efficient, ensuring that you'll always find a challenging opponent. Whether you're teaming up with friends in tag team matches or going head-to-head in a no-holds-barred brawl, the online experience is a blast.

And let's not forget about the presentation. WWE 2K23 nails the atmosphere of a WWE event, from the raucous crowd reactions to the dynamic commentary that adds to the excitement. It's clear that the developers understand what makes WWE special, and they've captured that magic in the game.

In conclusion, WWE 2K23 is a must-have for wrestling fans and gamers alike. It combines stunning visuals, deep gameplay, an extensive roster, and an immersive career mode to create an unforgettable experience. Whether you're reliving classic rivalries or creating new ones, WWE 2K23 delivers the thrill of the squared circle like never before. Get ready to step into the ring and experience the excitement of WWE in a whole new way – this game is a slam dunk of entertainment!",1695482260,1695482260,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Showcase mode was a fun trip down memory lane through John Cenas career, although is probably the weakest mode due to little to no replay value and some very tedious objectives. Both my rise campaigns are a huge step up over 2K22, Both the lock and the legacy telling decent WWE TV style stories. My GM is fun to play around with (although as an achievement hunter it is a nightmare), and universe mode is still just okay. Most of my 184 hours has been spent in my faction however, which has a good variety of modes and a very addictive gameplay loop. 
My one real problem with it being that a lot of superstars and legends are locked behind packs, only having rare cards such as amethyst and diamond cards. Packs are a grind to earn, and makes it even more of a grind to get such wrestlers for my collection. This is quite disappointing, as i can't play as favourites such as HBK, Undertaker and Triple H... unless I drop nearly £100 of real money on packs, which feels very heavily incentivized... and kinda scummy.",1695345937,1695345937,True,1,0,0.515300989151000977,0,True,False,False

It was a really cool idea that I was excited for, but was executed very poorly. There's no commentary throughout the matches (although the royalty free music is actually kind of cool), the cutscenes are way too long, and the whole flow of the mode is a total mess; all of the matches are way out of chronological order for no reason. I'd say Cena's cutscenes recording the voiceover was cool, but it's painfully obvious that he's reading a piece of paper or teleprompter. Also, they obnoxiously blur out 90% of the faces and objects in the live action cutscenes for no good reason, unless there's something peculiar about referee Charles Robinson's face we should all know about.

This was also my first time trying the new combat system as I didn't play 2K22. I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, it feels more realistic and fun with more than one reversal type and the added combos. On the other, I feel pretty helpless when I lose the upper hand for even a second as there's no way for me to tell how to counter my opponent except for mashing the buttons, hoping they hit the move I'm trying to counter.

I give it a 7/10. It's a good game and worth a solid binge for universe mode alone, but I'll likely never play it again when a better one comes out down the road. The best WWE games are the ones you return to even after they become ""outdated"" (e.g. 2K19, 2K14, SvR '06-'11, HCTP, etc.).

TL;DR | Good, but not great. Get it on sale.

EDIT: I should have also mentioned that the roster is actually pretty great with no glaring omissions aside from Chris Jericho, but that's just the way it is with AEW being as big as it is these days. And the main pro of Cena's showcase is a list of unique and cool unlockables, but it still doesn't justify how mediocre the overall showcase experience was.",1695103051,1695158231,True,11,1,0.637651503086090088,0,True,False,False

Overpriced game, overpriced DLC, INCREDIBLY overpriced in-game purchases.

Multiplayer hardly works, and only on standard.. if you're trying to play MyFaction good luck,
I've sat in queue for hours and still haven't got one single match.

If you play online normal, people will DC if losing, they will use macros to spam buttons so you cannot get them to tapout or they will tap you out instantly.. super fun. The whole UI is a clunky mess, and laggy connections make the game unplayable for anyone outside your immediate region. 

It's a fun game, but things like.. if you shift-tab to open steam overlay mid-match for messages or anything else, it will swap your controls to keyboard-mouse and will not change to controller until you restart the match. In Online play, guess how fun it is to start a match and not be able to move. They pin you right away and you just screwed up a fatal 4way that took forever to fill up. Not making many friends that way.

No in game or even lobby chat..? Only voice..? How is this not MORE toxic and less efficient than being able to say things to strangers you're trying to coordinate with..? Just seems silly.

For a genre and sport that has always centered around multiplayer, how the hell do you screw that up?
All the extra gimmicks and shine they throw at you so you'll buy more stuff, instead of fixing all the dumb broken and blatant bugs that plague the game. gogo late stage capitalism. 

It's really, really disappointing. 

Hopefully they fix it up, but my guess is they'll soak up as much money as they can and then push out 2k24 with the same business model.

They spend $20-$40 million and years to make a game, and can't do it as well as indie studios..?

I know games are a business, but they are also art. Using them as pure vehicles to transfer money seems.. disgusting. I've been playing vids since ET on atari (dunno how I didn't walk away from games altogether), and nowadays it feels more and more like intentional betrayal, sitting around a boardroom table discussing not how they can help their customer base enjoy their product, but how they can squeeze more of your money away from you on a game that will be defunct soon (and essentially already is).

I wish there was a way to convince corporations that caring about their customers will actually increase their profits instead of a fast boost that leaves people disappointed and annoyed. 

I'll change this if the devs suddenly decide to give a shit about players and fixing bugs. 
What a motivation. I'll be here holding my breath. 

(side note, the forum mods for 2k23 are overzealous; i was trying to stop a fight happening in my thread and said 'we like to beat the shit out of each other, but lets keep it in game,' was immediately contacted by a mod talking down to me, 'you've been caught' using 'completely unnecessary language' and other such power-tripping nonsense. So heads up.)

Again, it is a super fun game, and I've met some fantastic people on here, and they DO get a lot right.. but for these prices, I'm not looking for 'okay.' This is supposed to be AAA quality, not beta. 

edit: only 1.7% of players have completed one single Proving Grounds Chapter (there is a few) with similar achievements under 5%, so that shows you how little of a MyFaction presence there is

EDIT: i put another 68 hours in since the review, played thru 4 new MyF pack releases, as well as a 6.8gb update that didn't do anything except add one pack of cards.

MyF is still broken, no one is ever on, and they are still charging for incredibly over-priced MyF items that you can only use in MyF, supposedly against other MyF players. 

Problem is, again, there are none. So there is no payoff, no reward, just grinding dumb fights over and over to get more packs to try to get the 'good' cards that are all duplicates of the same 10 wrestlers.

dumb. dumb. dumb. dumb. dumb.

Don't buy 2k24, don't support predatory and apathetic game developers.

Graphics and physics are incredible, but MyRise is like a ride on a train. It's linear as fuck and has a small handful of forks in the road, but the outcome of matches doesn't matter because the match will just restart if you didnt complete it how the game tells you to. 
There's 2 separate stories, ""The Lock"" takes place from a mans perspective and its very specific. You start off as an experienced wrestler taking his first steps into the WWE getting a huge push from corporate. You get the intercontinental title your very first match. It's interesting, sure, but I would much rather start off as a nobody rookie in the indie leagues. 
I forget what the other story option is called, but you start off as the daughter of a WWE Diva ""legend"" from the attitude era. Thing is im not interested in women's wrestling and less interested in playing as a female character so I'll pass. If I'd had know this prior to paying for the game, I would have passed on picking this game up, even on sale.

 the custom character is easier to made thus quite lot good quality custom model but the only down side is that most of the good custom made character from wwe 2k22 did not get transfered to 2k23, even tho both are the almost exactly game but some changes like every fifa games, which is for me a big big negative, there is plenty of good custom made character at 2k22 that somehow will be stuck there till the server is down, hughly disappointed but not the end of the world. 
universal mode has been greatly enhanced, with you able to adjust what will happen in the match with whoever is having rival mode on, so that pretty much it? it all the same, the ai automatically matching is still pretty bad, sometime it forgotten exactly what happened last week of the match and just play out like as if nothing happened.
gameplay tho, it way way better, same as 2k22 but like small miles of improvement, but not enough to justified  the pricing sometime.

you dun have to get this game for ur universal mode, you can just keep on playing wwe 2k22 as it very much the same games, but if u never bought 2k22, then get this one as it has pretty much the same price between 2k23 and  2k22 for some reason.",1693484585,1693484585,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Edit 8/30/23 - after all the patches, i have way less crashes and can actually play for hours at a time now. Still some things that were fixed in earlier patches get broken later and some of the fundamentals of the game are pretty annoying.  I dont like repeating the same matches over and over in universe mode and while sometimes the game picks 3rd party rivalry actions where one rival has a match with someone else, its not nearly enough.

Made by people who don't understand/like wrestling. Mediocre everywhere.

Universe mode - No run ins, boring repetitive, no match types 

GM Mode - Simple, boring, repetitive

Gameplay -  A hybrid of simulation and arcade. Doesn't work. Slow clunky

Roster - Good

Presenation/Graphics - Great.

Career mode - Terrible

Showcase - Boring and confusing goals. Low effort.

WWE 2k19 is a better simulation game. WWE 2k14 is a better arcade experience. This game is absolutely mediocre. Only reason to get it is because of limited options on PC",1693406181,1693406181,False,0,0,0.458715617656707764,0,True,False,False

The Cena showcase AMAZING. The transition from video feed, to in game cut scene to controlled gameplay was a masterpiece. 
The story is... there... kinda feels like the idea with 2K19 Buzz stuck around and we just capture the best hits. The choices are minor at best and don't even give the illusion that what i do matters. Couple of them do per storyline. 
For those who are unfamiliar you have a male story-line as the Lock, a seasoned wrestler from outside WWE making his debut. And the female story-line as LJ (or little Justine) an up and comer from a legendary wrestler bloodline Justine (2K's OC). 
The GM mode is fine. Some improvements but more of the same. Idk i have fun turning my brain off and getting my butt handed to me by NPCs.
The factions game mode is not for me. Great variety, 2Ks cash cow for micro-transactions that don't affect anything else in the game so it's fine. Huge variety of wrestlers to play in (mostly) the worst type of matches. 4v4s. (see below)

Gameplay:
More of the same. New counter system that feels.. weird.. not good or bad weird just weird. You have your typical press Y (i play on an xbox controller) to counter SOMETIMES. Other times press X or A or B. Combos and grapples require you to guess one of the three buttons whereas strikes or beginning of combos and finishers use Y. Timings for when to press seem weirdly timed and wrestlers tend to favor either light (X) combos and attacks or heavy (A) but will use the other one to remove the chance of always countering. Almost every 4th combo ends up being a throw (B) and the AI always uses a lot of those so its easy to predict them.
 
Now this will be a reenactment of me playing a game with tag or a manager on the opposing side: STOP TAKING CONTROL OF MY FREAKING CHARACTER GAME!!!!!! 
2v2s or more basically guarantee that you gotta win your current fight, knock off any other opponents and in the short window of stunned time you have to pin your original target. Personally i cheese it with submissions cause i find that system BORING. The AI doesn't protect you well enough to pin.

I stopped watching wresting as a whole quite some time ago, yet continued to play the games. And WWE2K23 has quickly became one of the best wwe games to date. The games itself is solid. with great mechanics, a great CAF system (also tons of new items after all these years like new tats ect ect.)

with all that being said do keep in mind, when they update, it gets buggy for a week or 2, tghe online is straight ASS, and the myrise story is cringe af.

BUT universe mode AND MYGM are awesome!!!! And The community to keep stocked with new wrestlers, arena, blets, ect.... is absolutely wonderful.

Update almost 200 Hr Still playing. If i put this much time in i cannot say i don't recommend. But if your looking for the online, DONT. in all that this time, i have not gotten ONE match where it didnt take 45 mins to load you in, just to be a laggy, garbage mess! Then you either get kicked or your opponent does. so its.... bad, MyFaction is... good, for being a greedy money scam, $99.99 for a 20 pic of cards.... to play solo matches against bots? FN WHAT! 
Noted* while it is great to have all these new fets. the amount of bugs is a bit high. Charging $69.99 a game, I EXPECT it to be perfect. nope. they just gonna patch the stupid stuff while slowly adding more and more bugs all and all its a decent game. but the fact we are in 2023, they charge us so much... why are these games so much worse off than old school games they couldn't update? PS2 and OG Xbox games came out 99% complete, what little bugs they had, remained. now they rush all these games out and they are only 37% complete. all in all its a good game.

Although new GM modes are more ""arcadey"" than the SvR iterations, they do a good job of scratching the itch. Currently I am invested in playing Universe mode and have been having a blast playing as my custom superstar! 
This game is NOT bug free however... there are glitches that get in the way such as in tag team matches occasionally when you tag your partner in you switch controls to them and are unable to switch back to the superstar you selected to play as... most glitches can just be worked around or restarting the match works about 85% of the time.

This was the first 2k WWE game I played and honestly it will be the last. I was so disappointed with my purchase. This game does have nice graphics (not sure about the faces, they look weird) probably would look better on a high end GPU. The story in myrise was horrible. Its short and character choices don't really matter in the long run of it. The AI and difficulty hurt the overall experience, making it such a chore to complete. If you make a mistake or get countered (which will happen when u least expected)  your AI opponent will mercilessly beat your ass until you break its momentum. AI opponent does have an advantage over you it can recover faster (without using resources), can counter anytime (no matter status), and gain a stupid amount of momentum really quick. Doesn't matter the difficulty you set it to once you lose control of the match its hard to get it back. Its a lot worse with multiple opponents in 3 ways and fatal 4 ways. Also if the AI puts you in a submission its game over. What I mean is, the submission bar drops so fast when trying to break the hold is like competing in a button mashing mini game with an opponent player using a turbo controller against you. It doesn't matter if you are full health once it holds you in a submission its over fast. It completely unforgivable how horribly unbalance the AI submission is. The only time I even managed to breakout (at full health mind you) was when my tag partner broke the hold just before I lost. Instead of having fun and enjoying myself, I get annoyed and frustrated with this game. I have only seen a few glitches mainly both showcase and universe mode would drop fps and then freeze the game. Glitched wrestlers arms would unhinge from the body and flail about like those inflatable tube men at car dealerships. Its down right funny and disturbing at the same time. Options are also limited in game, cant upload music for themes don't know why. I don't recommend this game to other players it was very disappointing.",1691145058,1691703960,False,5,1,0.522234857082366943,0,True,False,False

I can't attest to every mode in the game because I've never touched things like My Faction, but I've since uninstalled 2k22 since I don't see me ever going back after playing this one.

The roster is pretty stacked with a lot of my personal favorites unlocked through gameplay rather than having to be bought in DLC packs like last year. My Rise is muuuuuch more focused this time around with more cutscenes, a interesting unique story for both male and female characters, and most importantly: a clear indication of what is a main story progression, a side story, or just a challenge.

My GM is fantastic this time around with a ton more match types, triple threat & fatal fourways, the ability to end rivalries outside of PPVs, new power cards, a new 'shake-up' system, the ability to have up to four brands duke it out at once (either as NPCs or with friends), as well as a few other quality of life improvements that makes it way more fun to play.

The best part is that every update no longer requires you to download the entire game file again this year; something that is much appreciated. 

Still a shame that there's no way to add custom music without modding the game, and mixed-gender matches are still out.

Overall, though, this is a shockingly solid wrestling game for anyone who's a fan of the genre.",1691174463,1691174463,True,2,0,0.519541323184967041,0,True,False,False

I WAS WRONG! THIS IS GARBAGE.

The writing sucks, you're given ZERO freedom in the, and I quote ""MyRise"". It IS NOT MyRise, it's THEIR rise. As in their shitty, horribly acted douche of a character. It's HIS rise and you're choices amount to crap.

Not to mention the idotic 'Rubber band"" mechanic they seem to have implemented. Kicking someone's ass? Well too bad! Doesn't freakin' matter because with a body in the full red, that's effectively the worst it can get btw, and with zero HP, they will still kick out when pinned. Oh, did you go for submissions instead? Too bad, 'cause they're just not gonna tap. Then they'll get up quicker than you, and put you 'stunned' then win easy.

I GET SO ANGRY WHEN I AM PLAYING MYGM MODE WATCHING AI vs AI MATCHES. IN ALL THE MATCHES, THE AI LIKES TO SPEND THEIR TIME OUTSIDE OF THE RING, PROBABLY LIKE 3/4 OF TIME WHEN THEY NEED TO PIN/SUBMIT IN THE RING.

THEN THEY SOMEHOW DECIDED TO GET UP TO THE CELL AGAIN. 

People might ask why the hell I am watching AI vs AI match. By the way, I only watch matches in the Wrestlemania card. I just want to watch the matches I've been building up. Some superstars have their specialties in Hell in a Cell matches which made me to book it.

they are all slow paced, the stamina system slows the flow of the gameplay
thats what makes the 2k games get old fast
very fast
just stick to the early thq games
the payback system is a terrible version of the fighting style system from svr 08
most of them are useless and the ones that are useful should just be basic abilities for everyone just like in the later thq games
why does the payback system have to act like  a consumable even if you miss the attack?
why do i have to stand properly to be able to pick up weapons
why is it with the heavier weapons you can only throw them when your target is on the ground?
why cant i catch the weapons my opponents throw?
why is it so hard to throw your opponent off of the top of the hell in a cell?
why does the submission system not require skill or strategy?
why cant i attack my opponent while they are climbing up the ladders?
why cant i climb the ladders fast, why does he gotta take his time to  climb up?
even while standing still is the fastest way to do so but still annoying
why does everyone only like doing elimination ?
so tedious and long
exhasting
why does the dlc include wrestlers who should already be in the game?
why cant the dlc be free like in the thq games?
why do we have superstars locked in the myfaction mode?
why is it possible to run out of tables if you create ironman tables match?
why does it give the option to choose which type of elimination chamber even tho theres only one chamber 
why are the online servers so terrible?
why doesnt the online matchmaking have crossplay?
why doesnt the onilne servers allow me play online with a local friend of mine?
why why why?

So after playing the WWE 2k series, I didn't initially like the changes made in WWE 2k20 (the only game in the series I barely played). I didn't like WWE 2k22 at first either, the combos and animations didn't seem right but, I grew to like it as time went on. Now with WWE 2k23, I fully embraced the gameplay and enjoyed the game overall. The game reminds me a lot of the Smackdown vs Raw series in terms of gameplay, the controls might be different but, that mix of realism and wrestling arcade action is back. 

The roster is what I wanted, the best of the 80s, 90s and 00 for the most part. The John Cena showcase brought back a lot of WWE stars ruthless aggression stars that I am a fan of. Gameplay and roster is what matters the most to me and to me it delivered in that department. The base game roster is good enough for me but, I bought the deluxe addition anyways. 

I don't care for MyRise, I never liked it the career modes in WWE 2k games dating back to WWE 2k15. The storylines in modern WWE games are not enjoyable so I'm not interested and I won't try this one either so I won't factor that in to my review. 

The graphics look good overall but, they aren't going to impress you for a next gen game. The gameplay is improved from 2k22 slightly and it feels better. There are some occasional glitches but, it's not gamebreaking, My complaints with this game are minor ones. 

The online community has done a fantastic job with this game. Guys like ""WhatstheStatus"" are constantly putting out hidden contend from the games files and it essentially becomes DLC. For example, a 2005 Rey Mysterio wasn't in the game but, uploaded a customized younger Rey Mysterio model with 2005 Rey Mysterio's clothing and found some way of getting his hidden theme song to play with the proper commentary for Rey. It's pretty cool. The online community keeps this game going strong all year. 

I did run into an issue though, I was deleting a created wrestler I did not want and the game seemed to have froze because the game wouldn't move for minutes and it's not like this created wrestler was anything special either. All my data was gone and I had to restart which takes me to the showcase...

The Showcase with John Cena was okay but, the wrestler entrances are not included and it's also a requirement to beat to this mode in order to unlock all John Cena's attires. I already paid for the ""Supercharged"" DLC which unlocks almost everything but, beating the John Cena mode is still required. When all my data got corrupted for some strange reason, I had do it all again and it felt unnecessary since the Showcase is essentially just a long tutorial mode. 

Outside of that, the game has a solid roster. They FINALLY brought back three different version of Hulk Hogan. There a lot of fantasy matchups that can be made in this game and I really enjoy that. I casually watch wrestling these days but, I've continued to play the games and this one of the better ones I played in 20 years.",1690660560,1690660560,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The game has a very common bug, if you search ""WWE 2K23 slow motion issue"", the game lags massively when you're actually in the ring fighting. You know, 80% of the game!

From what I've read of other people's issues, the updates for the game actually made things worse for them. As well as corrupting save issues and lost characters/progression. 

My PC blows way past the specs as I've just had it all upgraded to play big games at max settings. 
I can run Skyrim with 200+ mods maxed, ARK at max, XCOM 2 200+ mods maxed, ARMA 3 modded all perfectly.

I know people play for different reasons, but I don't see myself buying another WWE2k game. I still have mixed feelings, and I am an unusual type of player. Let's make a list:

The good: 
Face animations are great, and are very interesting to watch during the match.
I like custom matches, options, and how statistics that once did nothing now do something interesting for non-played wrestlers.
There are still some good CAW options even though I wish there were more.
Matches are fun to watch.
Your mileage may vary, but I think this was better than PC versions of 2k16, 2k17, 2k18, 2k19, and 2k20. It has more good options, and you don't need to do as much to have a good spectator match.

The Bad:
Some things seem to have been removed that should have stayed in, and some things stayed in that should have been removed.
While face animations are good, many other animations seem to have issues, and the ai struggles to perform proper moves still, although it is not as bad as 2k20.
Like I said, morphs are good, and I prefer to have good options added instead of good options taken away.
Some issues have remained for the entire lifetime of this series: 

   KOs don't work right, and odd things like light attacks knock characters out, and there is no 10-count or 3 times lifting the arm, it is instant. 

   Submission holds still do not work right. There is no way to slip out of a submission hold or let it go. The only way that a wrestler breaks out of submission hold is to do an attack that works. This is not how WWE       works.

   I still don't like signature and finisher bars. This makes no sense, when really these are done when an    opponent is scripted as too weak to prevent you from doing them, not when you get a bar going to a     certain progress threshold.

Many good things have to be unlocked, and I hate this, and always have. I should not be prevented from downloading a CAW just because they want me to play a game mode that I don't like.",1690314204,1690356361,False,5,0,0.560121715068817139,0,True,False,False

Totally worthless trash game, Team mates just stand there getting beaten up when its a tag match they don't fight back.. then when you eventually get back up they switch to you then knock you down then switch back to your team that does not want to fight back, Completely trash of a game. These WWE games keep getting worse each year, GG Keep giving us crap games please so your company dies quicker.

MyFACTION is completely RIGGED on any difficulty you chose even on easy you will get dominated.

You can't switch targets until your animation is done which i find very game breaking,, You can't punch someone coming into the ring your guy hits an invisible wall and stumbles back.. You try to run and jump out of the way of someone jumping at you from top ropes... and they always manage to hit you even if you evade them completely...

There are minor improvements here and there that makes the gameplay so much better. To start, you have the new stamina and tired animations. It really adds depth and storytelling to the matches. Next, you also get smoother reversal and transition animation (no longer the leg sweep reversal over and over again). Graphics is a huge improvement while performance is better. CAWs having the new texture makes it on par with in game models and it looks good with the new sweat system (No longer having the plastic body with no sweat). AI is a huge improvement and no longer doing the same moves. 

All of the above are my favourite considering I only play Universe Mode majority of the time just like in 2K22. 

Only downside so far is the Showcase Mode which I understand why they didnt include commentary but man does it feel boring. I completed it very fast and it just feels like a chore to unlock all the bonus.

I remember being around for the abysmal launch of 2k19 and joining on the dogpile over its terrible quality control. 

I never thought I would ever pick up an actual wrestling game until this one--and, as a non-fan of professional wrestling, I can say with blunt honesty that I think I'm coming around. My Youtube history is now almost completely comprised of watching clips of WWF/WWE moments in history. I never got distracted from when in 1998, the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell in a Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.

Memes aside, this is a really solid entry for the franchise. Creating a Wrestler is really intuitive, but there are some nagging blemishes I wish could have been addressed--like, how you can't use mouse controls when trying to dye hair, and that dying hair isn't based on clumps but rather just painted completely over as an overlay. Other than that, the customization options are pretty stellar and I eventually found myself spending a lot of time in the mode.

MyRise is a pretty decent experience, where you create a wrestler and take them through two separate stories--The Lock, being the male pro wrestler who's already made waves in the industry and comes to WWE seeking a champion's belt; and The Legacy, the niece of a former legend who has to wade through the universe of Diva and female wrestlers all looking for their own big break. Story's a bit middling but the fact that it's even here as a mode is deeply appreciated.

I don't care about MyGM; I haven't delved too deep into it but it looks similar to the Madden/FIFA Ultimate Teams bullcrap and I'm not about that life. 

WWE Universe, though, I think is the biggest start of the game single player-wise. This is basically the mode where you take WWE's programming and make it your own--you control the show, you set up the matches, you simulate what happens. You can throw in your own custom line-up of wrestlers and even put them in their own shows separate from RAW, Smackdown, or NXT. Or, of course, you can set up an entire season of shows where you can control your own custom wrestler and have them compete against the greats, the legends, and even hall of famers. All culminating in Wrestlemania, the top championship title.

All in all, WWE 2k23 is a fantastic package with some flaws. It's likely going to be replaced as soon as 2k24 comes out, fine, but for right now this version of the series is pretty solid as a game and wrestling sim.",1689437137,1689437137,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I haven't watched WWE since I was a kid and I can say that I feel right at home with the matches and characters. The showcase mode is largely disappointing however. Being a John Cena fan when i was younger, I was really looking forward to going through his best moments as I remembered them. The excitement soon ends when actually playing the matches though. No commentary from cena or the announcers bring the overall experience down. Total freedom in the matches you play are very limited. You, the player go through multiple forced checkpoints until you get to live footage (with no commentary) and you repeat this until the match is done. Other than that the game feels great overall when it comes to visuals and the game-play. Possibly the most realistic Sport game rivaling even the likes of FIFA and the NBA 2k series. 

The game is another good improvement in the series and it looks like the developers have good momentum.

Turning off stage elements in the arena builder, re-ordering rankings in Universe mode, and choosing to delete the aforementioned images when you delete an object that uses them simply do not function. The latter is maddening because deleting images manually is a time consuming mess. It can honestly take hours to do. 

Of all the hours I have in the game, I've played three matches. And that counts the tutorial match. I hope you like menus because you're going to be spending a lot of time navigating menus and waiting for loading screens before and after each press of the button.

I bought this out of a feeling of nostaliga, I loved these games back on the PS2. I haven't kept up with WWE since then, but the game was on sale and I heard good things about the universe mode. I've found it frustrating just to get around the game... and the music and video presentation are just terrible. That bit has more to do with the modern WWE aesthetic than the quality of the game, but it bears mentioning. If you haven't followed the show, this game is going to give you a headache and cause eye-abetes with all the bright, flashing, random colors blowing out your retinas at all times.",1688956115,1688956115,False,0,0,0.46875,0,True,False,False

Graphics are serviceable but really bland and likenesses are off - like barely recognisable fan-created custom fighters in a lot of cases, especially the 'legends' and most of the women. I purchased this for a multiplayer session and we spent most of that laughing at how strange everyone looks. 

Most attempts to recreate atmosphere fall completely flat - your final finishing move for example ending in silence until a few seconds when the crowd and commentator realise you've won.

There are so many pointless limitations making it very confusing to understand what you can change, who you can do it to and where it carries over. 

Decent game-play in a one-on-one exhibitions and a giggle with tag, royal rumble and war modes - but other, single player modes, are so broken - spent 3 hours in Universe and had the same opponent in every fight. Tried again with another character - and same again. Apparently I managed to win a title - but i don't recall being part of that.

The actual grappling is pretty good and the exhibition modes are great but everything else is jank, purposely limiting or just really really dull. Maybe if this other rubbish just wasn't available and there was no pretence of customisation I'd have been much happier and just put up with the other issues.

However, the male MyRise story (""Career Mode"" if you're new to modern WWE games) is absolutely atrocious this year, in my opinion. Very early on, I won't spoil why, your character is kicked out of WWE and has to redeem himself by competing in fictional indie promotions against fictional wrestlers - basically, CAWs created by the developers. It's fun at first, and I won't spoil the ending, but the vast majority of MyRise is just playing against developer CAWs and low-tier midcarders like Noam Dar for hours on end with seemingly no purpose other than to spite WWE. It feels like an indie wrestling game that occasionally features WWE.

I recommend the game overall but if you play the 2K WWEs primarily for MyRise you're better off skipping this one.",1680908829,1687787620,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gaming isn't a job it's a hobby. Here we go: [1]. Almost the exact same roster as 2k22 aside from a hadful of new additions [Cody Rhodes is obviously in this edition, so far Bray Wyatt is MIA...]. But the roster is always what it is: A mix of the people who everyone loves, likes alot or wants to watch those ones beat on them more than some of the remaining roster types...No names, Jobbers if they prove to be that useful. Legends/icons of the WWF/WWE and have not set foot in a ring in years, have or still think they've got enough for one last run - to where? I wish I knew. But it's not to the main-event on the biggest stage of them all. My heroes are this age, it pains me to see them obviously hurting and beyond their expiration date by more than a couple years. Yeah I want these people when you start adding the filler and fluff content to make it look less idk less like a massive seasonal scam with a refreshed 2k Studios Logo and That Pro Wrestler of the currently supported edition with no guarantee the game will work during the year it's the most current title, and anything after that is 2kStudios Choice to deliver a finished playable product or whatever the state when they stop devoting even a barebones team to bug fixing and small updates to clean up code or fine tune a few minor gripes that look trash af so nobody can point to the mess that every 2k video game is by design. YES, 2k23 is in all ways an improved version of 2k22!!!! YEAH, for $120-130 a pop for the base game and all DLC/extras it SHOULD BE THOSE THINGS IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR DAY ONE RELEASE STATUS. Nobody wires and installs all the plumbing for a house that hasn't even been built. No other product or industry can put a partially completed, not-as-advertised product you can't even actually own or enjoy the illusion of doing so, it's a rental you must pay for, upfront, if you don't believe the item is what you were made to believe it to be , you are absolutely very unlikely to have a refund even considered beyond Steam's 2 hour countdown that's sped up to a cocaine-rabbit with 
 like a Cyberpunk 2077 Edgerunner using the Sandevistan deck mod. If you like 2k22 but want the finished version that's 97% playable? GET 2k23. Are you about fed up and looking for a way out of this hamster scam treadmill of diminishing hope and consumer rights being eliminated entirely? Yeah, I imagine we all are. But sometimes it's the closest  path back to the basic idea you paid to experience. And this is a difficult to simplify down to a yes buy or no don't waste the cash.   

*yes, Universe Mode is fixed
*myRise and MyFaction are not as sh*t as previous iterations
*MyGM is fine....It's much improved or nothing new depending if you are Pro or Con on this mode
*Load  Times ARE NOTICEABLY SHORTER and Less likely to hang
*Online multiplayer is not reliable and whatever they barely care
*Character creation tools are as per usual ++++
*Graphics seem less problematic
*Game save corruption bug STILL AN ACTUAL THING PEOPLE SAY IS HAPPENING....
*UI FEELS CLEANER AND MORE OR LESS IMPROVED
*Cody Rhodes is in the house so *shrug*


*VERDICT: Would recommend,but bedgrudgingly for a little longer while I put some hours into what is promising but with a caveat named 2KStudios....


P.S. I'd avoid the dlc until it's 70% off because as per industry standards it's junk ass no-one asked cuz no-one wanted it wrestlers and I'm starting a movement AGAINST expanded versions scam-the-consumer 9x every release ""Season"" I'm through, over it, fucking done with this system.

well in fact it does.. on one level, on others not so much. As it is a bit of a mirror of society. Including all the many lies in the business. But i digress.
WWE2K23 finally is a step upwards again, since a steady slope down for five years or longer. The newest version of WWE2K has quite acceptable graphics, a big roster and many small improvements, which makes the game finally fun to play again.
The Showcase is a nice enough change, in that you don´t have to always use the same person (Cena in that case), but can actually kick his ass. 
The MyRise let´s you choose between male and female superstar and their way to the top and both stories are quite entertaining, with even some options to choose from, how the story develops. Also you can use a pre generated Caw, something some players are happy about.
The match variety offers for the first time a War games match, which is nicely implemented and a wide range of other possible set ups, even including Tournaments etc.
Beside the graphics the animations were much improved in my oppinion, and many new are included.
The creating section is the most powerful up to date, you can create nearly everything on your own now. Which can be very time consuming of course. Good thing that they have improved also their online part, downloading (and finding the stuff) is quite stable and reasonable fast. Also online matches work quite well too. Even less understandable with this is, the year old limitation of 100 CAWs (and the seperate image limitation), which has no good reasoning at all anymore, except to annoy and limit players.

Universe and MyGM modes were also improved, where i have my second gripe though, why it doesn´t let you transfer created teams etc. through the modes. If you create Tag Teams in normal mode you have to repeat it for any other mode, which with the rising complexity of creation takes unnecessary long time.

Also WWE2K23 is still no bugfree experience, from crazy screen tears to whole pc crashes everything is possible. Still it makes a bit more stable impression.

Conclusio: Despite some old and unnecessary limitations, WWE2K23 is finally a step in the right direction. I can recommend it to nearly every wrestling game fan (despite a high price).

Preordered it, I would probably rate it 3/5. Probably not worth full price though unless you're a fan, or like these types of games. Doesn't feel much different from 2k22 really. Making a really tall person makes you handicap as well. Missing punches and grabs on those smaller than you at times. 

MyGM needs more titles and more matches as well. Otherwise this mode I think is pretty fine as is, not really any issues. 

Character customization is decent, but I think could be a lot better. Don't give me preset body types, let me make my own body completely head to toe. Also feel like there's not as many choices as there could be for attire.

MyRise needs a lot of work to it. I want to feel immersive, but hard to do with just script lines and matches are basically pre-determined for you. Get a belt then forced to lose it. Forced to play as both champs in a tag match, don't really get to feel like heel or face. 2K should go back and play No Mercy, Wrestlemania 2000, and the Smackdown series and get some real ideas. I want some free roam, be able to make rivalries happen, interfere in matches, get DQ if I want, and feel like I'm actually building my own reputation. 

MyFaction is just grinding, paying to get better stuff if you want to speed it up. Bugs out and loses all progress sometimes as well.

MyUniverse don't really play or have an interest in the online play. Personally don't see the appeal of it.",1686844057,1686844057,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With improved gameplay mechanics, enhanced visuals, and a wealth of content, this installment proves to be a solid addition to the series.

Visually, WWE 2K23 is a stunning spectacle. The character models are incredibly detailed, with lifelike representations of the wrestlers. The arenas, crowd reactions, and lighting effects add a sense of realism that further immerses players in the world of professional wrestling. The attention to detail is commendable and contributes to the overall authenticity of the game.

One of the most notable improvements in WWE 2K23 is the revamped gameplay mechanics. The controls feel more responsive and intuitive, allowing for smoother and more fluid in-ring action. The addition of new animations and move sets adds variety to the matches, making each encounter feel unique and exciting. Whether you're executing high-flying maneuvers or delivering bone-crushing slams, the gameplay mechanics offer a satisfying and enjoyable experience.

The game offers an extensive roster, featuring a mix of WWE superstars, legends, and NXT talents. The inclusion of current and past wrestling icons allows players to recreate dream matches and rivalries, adding an extra layer of nostalgia and excitement. The creation suite is also impressive, enabling players to design their own wrestlers, arenas, and championships, fostering creativity and personalization.

The single-player modes in WWE 2K23 provide a compelling experience. The career mode allows players to embark on a journey as a rising superstar, complete with branching storylines and character development. The Universe mode returns, offering a deep and customizable experience where players can shape their own wrestling universe with rivalries, championships, and unpredictable twists.

However, WWE 2K23 is not without its flaws. Some players have reported occasional glitches and bugs, though these issues are expected to be addressed through future updates and patches. Additionally, while the gameplay has improved, there may still be room for further refinement and balancing to ensure a more realistic and strategic wrestling experience.

In conclusion, WWE 2K23 is a commendable entry in the long-standing franchise. With its enhanced visuals, refined gameplay mechanics, and extensive content, it provides an engaging and immersive wrestling experience. Despite some minor imperfections, this installment successfully captures the essence of the WWE universe and delivers a satisfying gameplay experience that will keep fans entertained for hours on end.",1686816972,1686816972,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

and ruined the combat, so like...the entire game...great job! Why can I not punch somebody on the first step of the ladder? Why does my player character seem to not want to climb the ladder to try and not lose? Why can the AI counter any move they like whenever they like no matter how I set my balancing, No matter how much blood they've lost or how many concussions they've likely recieved in the span of 2 minute? Why can an AI that's had it's but whooped for 5 solid minutes get one lucky counter and pin a player with a fully green status for 3 seconds (no, no other moves just a counter and a pin)? Why are my counters only available every 15-30 seconds? why is the pick up object button RB and the set up object button A? it makes no intuitive sense and you can't change controller mapping. Why do I need to relearn how to play EVERY TIME they release another WWE game? Why do I have to have ""MyFaction"" shoved in my face every time I boot the game? Why do I pay 80$ just to have all the good Wrestlers locked, but wait you can pay even more to get the whole roster including legends. It has GM mode and a slightly better Universe mode than the last one, that's still not as good as 2K19. Why is there no preview button on entrance creation? I ask because these weren't f***king broken less than 4 years ago and they're still unable to make a game that even come close to matching something they released 4 yrs ago. 

It looks Marginally better graphically. Perhaps because it's the first time I'm able to play on Current gen settings. the framerate seems good but the game almost seems like it's moving to fast like an old vaudeville movie. I would take PS2 Graphics if the actual gameplay was fun.

Between gameplay that was tolerable but not great, the roster being outdated (not the fault of the devs but this game already feels insanely out of date), and now, for reasons, just deleting the shit I really enjoyed, I just don't have the motivation to go back and put in all that work to make the game fun again if 2k can just delete it again, as they've already proven they're willing to do.

It is 2k22 with war games and messed up hit and grapple detection, graphic glitching, animation cancelling, move input reading aka artificial difficulty, auto animations that move opponents away from you while your animations always leave you next to the opponents, that mixed with animation cancelling its like getting stuck in a 50/50 loop, disconnects and drops galore. For an online service that does not provide an online service is sketch to say the least. It has one of if not the best create a wrestler and keeps getting better, but it a has a bug that can corrupt/erase all your game data starting you at the tutorial of the game. For proof of these things watch or play this game on legendary difficulty. It does not even try to hide it there. The erase bug is not new. Its been around for a while. It does not matter early game but when you are 900 hrs in it hurts. Just look it up on youtube for that.
Riddled with corn and bans for people not posting corn while closing down appeal process. I am a long time wrestling game fan with 900 hours on 2k22 and 150 on 2k23 so on and so forth. You name it I have played it across multiple systems. Even things such as backyard wrestling and ultimate muscle. Just that type of fan. This is where i stop you have to answer with your wallet and stop hopping for change. 
Long are the Smackdown vs Raw days. They produce a game in less than a year to spend a year fixing that game, while keeping the monetized portion updated almost biweekly to rinse and repeat. If you believe them when they say it is two different teams and can not be universally updated, then why are the assets lock in the game file to my faction. In short that means the encrypted it so that it can not be move over by modding  to the general creation download. Some models in the game are literally from 2 games ago aka 2021. Copy paste take your money and waste. Just because someone says it is the best one as of yet. Meaning if the rest are a 4/10 this is a 4.1/10. I know you might disagree now but just wait ....

Additonal 25 Hour Update: Focus on Universe mode
Universe mode feels worse from earlier editions. Divisions for titles seldom meaning anything. There are no promos so the same match between rivals happens every week, a problem that was fixed long ago. Then managing shows involves menu hopping instead of one central hub. I had better experiences in the older games pre-WWE 2k20.

My verdict remains the same, buy if you haven't upgraded in years with an additional caution that Universe isn't as fluid as it could be. Universe still can be fulfilling if you don't mind some tedious management.

now some bad stuff:
Story is cheesy AF (its a wrestling game so its not bad stuff just funny) 
Some minor glitches but rare as in within my 60 hours of playing i've seen 3 or 5 minor floating and clipping issues 

My biggest gripe is that the universe mode compared to 2k15 feels weirder cant quite place it but it feels less natural and more randomized like before it felt like the game had a general plan of what its doing now it feels just completely random sometimes i get fatal four ways with wrestlers i've never fought with  or interacted with then i never see them again but i've only tried superstar universe mode next im going to do classic sandbox next!

TL:DR: since 2k15 (was the last one i've played) its amazing havent had a save corrupt yet so cant complain

On the up side:
-The menus load much faster than in 2k22.
-And the new skin textures do make CAWs look much more realistic, comparable to the in-game wrestlers.
-CAW entrances have had a few ""lost"" features make a return. It's nice to be able to edit the entrances in little chunks.

On the down side:
-While some characters look amazing, there are still a bunch that look like they've been rendered on a PS3.
-Why isn't there a feature in these games that allows you to port over your CAWs from the previous game?
-Numerous moves that were in the previous game have been removed.
-The menus are still really clunky, with numerous features hard to find and navigate to.
-Several features to change graphics settings seem to be completely broken or missing.
-Entrances still have bugs. Props that shouldn't be there, are. Props that should be there, aren't.
-Pyro doesn't seem to work for the most part.
-Lighting gets superceded by other entrance choices.
-There still that stupid MyFaction card game sh!t. And (like in 2k22) it's the first thing that pops up after the opening trailer.
-The Deletion Utility crashes me when I try to delete downloaded content from Community Creations.
-Where the F is the creation of custom tag teams and their entrances?!!?
-After almost a month trapped with permanent slow-motion, I've figured out the slow motion issue. Check to see if your computer Display Settings>Advanced Settings>Refresh Rate is set to 60.

Dived into it on legendary difficulty as its personally the best way to get into it if your familiar with the controls. Game can get hard but its one of those things that kept me invested, loved the grind I went through to get my guy up to max stats on his journey, sometimes feeling like a god compared to my opponents but the side curves kept me going, like suddenly your facing 2 on 1, or 3 on 1, or its a submission match, often having to beat the opponent beyond the Safety guidelines i'm sure WWE has, its simple but effective. Got me interested in the other 'my rise' story, will check it out and update review if I remember. 

Recommend if you like WWE and or just want a simple yet, complex fighting game.

By far the worst crime this terrible game has is the lack of customisation music. The stock music is garbage, uninspiring generic clown music. If you want music you actually like then you have to download some potentially risky program and then jump there a bunch of hoops to get something you actually want to hear. If you are unlikely like me and many others you wont have some .dlls needed for the program to work and you can either go get them or just give up in frustration like I did. Why the F*ck do they not allow customisation? So they can sell you more entrance music of course. 

The career mode is very formulaic with very few options and few you get are not really meaningful. Universe mode is quite boring and any rivalries you get are just random and without any sort of cause. The cut scenes are all very generic and shallow with zero narrative to anything. I've had the championship for several in game months and not once has there been a defence or an even an ability for me to cause a defence with the curate menu. 

Some of the mechanics of the game are ok but I really hate the timed button crap, its frustratingly unpredictable and doesn't match the movements of the people for the most part so its not like you constantly get caught off guard. The damn icons move around constantly, they also change size so you often don't even see them until its too late. 

During tag matches you have to go knock your opponents partner off the apron before you go for a pin because they ALWAYS get in and  interrupt before you useless partner can get in and stop them, even if do the pin in your own corner.  The ring is ridiculously small, it looks like one of those cheap rings independents use.

Didn't try the showcase mode because WTF would I want more Cena? After 10+ years of him being rammed down our throats, not interested in hearing, seeing or playing as him.

I started playing even MyFaction but they are not releasing the FREE content (Token Markets) for it even after 2+ months of launch.

This is deterring me from playing the game anymore (no new content) and may even stay away from this publisher.

Been playing for an additional 200+hrs, and have yet to experience save data issues again. just to be safe I've been backing up my saves in two seperate folders just in case, and everything's been fine! Still a major bummer though
BIG EDIT DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME: About 60HRS of game time after this review (194+hrs total) my save data got corrupted after a random game crash while loading a match. THEN a few days later just a few hours ago from righting this review I decide to start rebuilding my save. I played most of the Showcase Mode, adjusted the sliders, and began downloading CAWs from the Community Creations. While attempting to download a CAW of Tegan Nox the game crashes. Upon rebooting the game, I get the message that my save data has been corrupted yet again. another 4hrs down the drain. I have uninstalled the game and WILL NOT be playing this again until I hear of significant improvements to stability and the overall experience. Really turns me off from every spending money on a 2K title ever again. Absolute NO learning from past mistakes with this dev team it seems in some regards. 

First off, To give this game a rating for me, on a scale of 1-10 not using .5s I would give WWE 2K23 a 9/10.
I put about 136 hrs into this game in the first 2 weeks of it's release and have done almost everything there is to do for a decent amount of time to have come to a pretty solid conclusion. All-in-all, if you're wondering if this game is good than the answer in my opinion is YES! Easily the best WWE game with 2K in the title, and probably the best one since the first few SvRs on the PS2.

Before I go into each game mode available and break everything down, I'm gonna do pros and cons!
Pros:

-Very good overall gameplay and match quality
-Best match commentary ever seen in a WWE game
-Has the most robust sliders and options for tailor the gameplay to go exactly how you want such as:
      -Your usual Player and AI difficulty sliders that have always been in the games for years
      -New Sliders to adjust the difficulty of the Pin and Submission Mini-Games
      -New individual AI Sliders for every superstar in game or custom creation to control how often the wrestler will decide to do 
        specific move types, use their paybacks, and use other techniques when they are being controlled by the AI
-GREAT visuals (arenas, characters, lighting, etc)
-Good variety of deep game modes to sink your teeth into
      -Showcase Mode (a series of around 15 matches following the career of WWE Legend John Cena)
      -MyUniverse (a sandbox game mode where you can create your shows with your very own roster of superstars, tag 
        teams, champions, and so forth, and play through the never ending calendar of WWE programming. You can play it 
        like the sandbox it started as or select one superstar to play as throughout the years and see what rivalries you can 
        spark, and what championships you can win)
      -MyRise (this games version of the classic Season Mode where you can take any custom created superstar through the 
        usual WWE story-line process. Two paths are available to play; your male superstar's path ""The Lock"" and your 
        women's superstar's path The Legacy.)
      -MyGM (game mode where you take on the mantle of General Manager of your choice of 5 different brands(RAW, 
        SmackDown, WCW, NXT, & NXT 2.0) and go up against 1-3 other AI or Human controlled competing General 
        Managers and draft your rosters, book your shows, and battle for the most fans and money)
      -The Creation Suite of modes such as: Create a Superstar, Create an Arena, Create a Championship, Create a MITB 
       Briefcase, Create an Entrance, Create a Move-Set, Create a Match-Type, and Create a Show.
-Deep Roster of most of the major players in today's WWE programming
-A brand new match type for the series with the 3v3 and 4v4 War Games Match.
-The BEST Creation Suite out of any WWE game ever
-Cross-Platform Community Creations is back from last years game, meaning we can still upload, share, and download other 
  people's creations to use and customize in out own games.

Cons:
-The game is still pretty buggy like the last years game (2K22)
-Infrequent but random game freezes and crashes in areas where it probably shouldn't
-Lack of a deep Legends roster for those interested(I'm not so much)
-Still missing match type from passed games that fans have been begging for for years like: Special Guest Referee, 
 Casket/Buried Alive Match, Ambulance Match, and some more.
-Online Servers are abysmal. game crashes mid online matches and other activities. Upon loading the game there's seemingly a 50/50 chance of seeing an error message telling you the game failed to connect the online features. When that message does occur there is no way to connect to the servers besides closing the game entirely to reload the game and hope to whatever god or deity you believe in that it works. If it does work and you do connect however, in matches or in any other online mode you are still likely to disconnect. If you manage to not disconnect, but decide to go into an offline mode upon attempting to return to online after playing in the offline modes you will get that same message from before, telling you that an error occurred, and the game was unable to connect to the online services. Once again forcing you to close the game, and re-open in hopes to get connected again.
-MyFaction Mode. The mode itself is fine I guess; minus the micro-transactions. Oh yeah, and also minus all the hidden alternate attires/costumes for wrestlers that all LOCKED behind this game mode where you are very limited in as to what game modes/match types you can play. It's stupid and a clear ploy to get people to play the mode and spend money on purchasable in-game currency to buy packs of characters to use only in the MyFaction mode, in hopes that you unlock the action figure John Cena character(among many other alternate looks for superstars) that are un-playable anywhere else. 2K claim something along the lines that these costumes/attires are locked behind MyFaction because it's too much work to port them into other game modes outside of MyFaction due to limitations. Which is just preposterous. 

OKAY! I THINK** that wraps up my Pros and Cons portion of the review. I'm going to add a more in-depth breakdown of all the main game modes and give my thoughts on those, but that will be edited into my review probably in the next few days. I'm going to sleep now.",1679914322,1683440914,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics - 8/10 
Lost points because - The time period was mid 2000s and Fight Night by EA had boxers sweat visible, realtime facial damage detailed and visible, bleeding detailed and visible - these are just 3 points as an example. Many more around crowd, clothes, weapons etc.

Gameplay - 7/10 
Stuck between sim and arcade. Random FPS drops. Occasional glitches. Undeveloped AI and incomplete pathfinding where they can't go get a weapon at times and get stuck while trying to do, can't exit in elimination chamber and royal rumble, no realism when it comes to fatigue or injury demonstration etc.

Content - 5/10 
WCW content absent. ECW content absent. Prior iterations did way better in this area. 2K needs to learn and if it s a WWE problem then they need to find a way to convince. Irrespective their product will be rated as such by those who want that content. Many matches previously present in game now missing. Simple stuff like special referee is absent. Creation options not back to 100% as the benchmark has existed in the license franchise. This is 2023 and why can't we have Survivor Series 5 vs 5?

Replayability - 8/10 
Thanks to community creations which means the developers and the publishers get a free ride on this rating. GM mode can better and ore detailed. Essentially a half baked release. 

Originality/Newness - 3/10 
Wargames. Other points are just borrowed from previous iterations. 

The good 
Game works sometimes and doesn't cost $1000

The bad 
Missing match types and characters that must be present in base game are offered as season pass. 

The ugly 
Bugs. Game breaking bugs. Glitches. Game breaking graphical glitches. Limited game modes like GM mode which are under developed and released as if a prototype. Lot of content in terms of arenas, images, names and terms, WCW, ECW content and related commentary is completely missing. Why should we shell $100 and be happy with such a product year after year when you refuse to increment the offering substantially over collective previous iterations. MyFaction pay to win and collect exclusive attires etc is a very poor concept. This is not a mobile game. 

Should you buy? - Compared to previous iterations and other titles 
No, not if you own the classic titles in the series and don't care about these graphics. Else get it on sale and make a list of all great community creations for more fun.",1683373560,1683373560,False,6,1,0.530453622341156006,0,True,False,False

The control scheme is excellent but the controls are unresponsive and stiff.  The stamina system is a great idea implemented horribly wrong.  Currently, the stamina system they have built into the game is completely unrealistic and kills the immersion by a huge margin.  The wrestler's get fatigued too quickly and slow down too fast.  It really disrupts the pace of the action and kills any momentum you were building with long attack sequences.  After about 3 or 4 minutes of action, the wrestlers are often too exhausted to run and if they are too exhausted to run then they are too exhausted to perform any running attacks or aerial moves.  That totally sucks.  And so the action almost comes to a halt when you can no longer run at your opponent.  Although, the animations look really good when they are tired and flailing about.  MyRise is a big disappointment because the writing is terribly cringe and your characters journey through the WWE universe is largely pointless and uninspiring.  Just bad writing through and through for both male and female MyRise stories.  MyGm is a huge disappoint and not worth the time.....same goes for MyFaction.  

Overall, the game gets a score of 6 out of 10.  The crazy thing is that 2K22 has far more engaging and memorable wrestling action than 2K23!!!  It's mainly because there is no stamina system to slow down the action in that game and 2K22 has much better superstar entrances.  Becky Lynch's entrance has been modified heavily to be less inspiring, and Ric Flair's entrance is crap compared to his entrance in 2K22, and many other wrestler's from the previous game have better entrances than they do in the new version of the game.  WTF, 2K!!?!?  A few of the fan favorite wrestlers have been dropped completely for no good reason.  For instance, I know that the IIconics were released from the WWE but that's no reason to remove them entirely from the game.  Bret Hart, Macho Man, and British Bulldog have uninspiring entrances as well.  The character model for Bret Hart doesn't even look like him in the slightest.  

Overall, the unresponsive controls and the minimal upgrades to the various game modes isn't enough to warrant a $60 price tag and 2K knows this.  The best advice for any wrestling fan is to ignore this installment and wait a few years for 2K25 to come out.  These incremental improvements to the game aren't nearly enough to warrant a purchase at this time.  Another thing I just found out is that Vince McMahon isn't impressed with 2K23 either.",1679059572,1682990622,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had a blast the first few weeks that this game has been out. I loved the Showcase Mode, ""The Lock"" MyRise mode and the Community Creation Suite. However the bugs and flaws in ""The Legacy"" MyRise and in Universe Mode really killed the experience for me.

Since the Smackdown VS. RAW 2011, Universe Mode was my favourite pass time in these games (besides Road to Wrestlemania). It's the one mode I always play for hours on end, but the 2k version of this mode is a shell of its former self. This version may have new features but is somehow more buggy than any other year prior. Title Matches not happening despite you or the A.I. booking them, Match Cards changing without input and Superstar Mode being a buggy mess to name the big ones.

Now I'm not someone who cares for modern GM Mode, hence no mention of it here. And I thought MyFaction is a waste of time.

For ""The Legacy"" MyRise, I only have two concerns. One minor and one game breaking. First, the Voice Actress for the Women's Superstar is very annoying but I can easily look past it. I don't doubt she is a talented individual but this is not her best work. Now for the game breaker, you can't progress past the side quest with Bianca. (For those who don't know what I'm referring to, you and Bianca fight over Company Merch rights and profits.) Once that arc wraps up, you're just stuck in the medical room. Nothing available. (Before people ask, yes I checked the Notifications and Social Media Feed in the UI. I did this one last before I had the next story mission).

I really wanted to give this a positive rating, but the more I play this entry the less I feel obligated to come back. I keep finding more quirks about this game that hinders the overall experience.",1682802338,1682802338,False,2,0,0.474333077669143677,0,True,False,False

That said, my save was corrupted and I lost 10hrs of gameplay. Now the game won't save at all and I'm trying an uninstall/reinstall.

Bottom-line:
If your game corrupts saves and won't create a new one, it's not ready for release.
Give this game at least six months and/or get it discounted during a steam sale...

Edit/Update:
I resolved the corrupted save issue on my install and recreated my CAWs again.
The game is still fun, but having to set up a save file backup schedule is pretty BS.

Just in case another reader has the same issue:
1. Turn off Steam Cloud saves for 2K23 (you'll have to back up your own save files)
2. Exit Steam. 
3. Browse to your Steam userdata folder 
    Example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\[steam profile id]
4. Rename, move, or delete the 1942660 folder.
5. Open Steam & launch 2K23 to create a new save.
6. Start from scratch again.",1682366654,1682454762,False,96,5,0.84507983922958374,0,True,False,False

Both MyRyse story are rich and you just don't want them to stop but it actually feel like more real
The Universe mode is quite the same as last year, you can play with the rivalry like having to put someone injured for weeks and month
The showcase mode is really not made for me but it is okay to be honnest.
The graphics are nice and the gameplay is way smoother and the entrance creation is really the best thing you could have done for a WWE game.

It is worth the 80$

The last one I have ever owned is WWE 13 for the WII, and did not buy any of the WWE 2K games until this one. I heard a lot of good things and honestly there's a lot here for you money. From two different MyRise Stories, to the John Cena Showcase, to Universe mode which is as always is either the most boring or funniest mode in the game because you can practically book whatever you want in that mode. To the the return of my personal favorite mode MyGM mode. Which takes you behind the scenes and shows you what running a show is like. Which is awesome.  Now for the rankings:

1.) Roster- which outside of the small nitpicks I have which is not including certain legendary wrestlers like Ric Flair or the Road Warriors, I think it deserves a lot of credit for what it does have, Its at the very least a 7 out of 10, due to the amount of wrestlers you have access to outside of creation and unlockables.

2.) Gameplay- For me this is the most important aspect of this game how do playing matches actually feel. Well to me they play great. They are fun, loose and easily can suck you in for hours. Especially when the game makes it feel like a real wrestling match is going on. One complaint that I have is it gets very techincal very fast and it feels a little to complicated for what this game is but in all game play is a 7 out of 10

3.) Content- As mentioned above there is a load to do in this game, you have traditional play now, two separate stories, showcase and two modes where you can become head Booker. Lets go through each mode. Play now is as excellent as you would want it to be. Play whatever match type you want and play with whoever you want, where you want. MyRise, has a ton to it, however the boring side matches can feel a little repetitive at times. I am not all the way through my play through of those stories but so far I have enjoyed their concepts.  Showcase, is a fun side mode for players, its actually surprisingly immersive mode. It takes you from match to match and even does cut-scenes and shows you what happens in the actual matches from that era and then flows back to the matches.  Next up is GM mode and Universe mode, I lump these together because they are very similar while also remaining different. Universe mode is where you put yourself not just as GM but as owner of WWE and can set up everything. GM Mode is more restricted but allows you to be in control of contracts, feuds and so much more to the point it feels like you are more involved with the show. So in short this to me is a ton of fun fruitful content to sink into without going into MyFaction(ultimate team but with wrestlers) in that vein Id say its a solid 8 out of 10 when it comes to the content in Game

Final Verdict: WWE 2K23 is worth every dime you want to spend on it, whether you wait for it go on sale or not. There is plenty of content, an a amazing creation suite and fun game play all over the place. However it has issues with a roster that feels empty without certain legends some parts of the content loop in the modes feeling either tedious or boring. It has a lot here that it kinda overwhelms the negative. For me its a solid 7.5 to an 8 out of 10.",1681790929,1681790929,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I won't say no because I believe that with 2K22 they had a fire lit under them to prove they aren't completely incompetent at producing a decent game and making the experience feel fresh and fun.
With 2K23 it feels like a slight upgrade but I have noticed a few creeping old bugs slipping back in and still room for improvement and polish.
There are some characters that feel unique and handle in a special way that is refreshing in a sea of wrestling games whereby all the roster handles far too similar with just variants of move animations, to have characters that have handling that makes them move and flow differently from others is the way forward, that way matches don't feel like cookie cutter matches with the only differences being visual but how speed can help or hinder differently dependant on who you face.
Matches between two behemoths smashing each other in a slow short powerful hoss match or the flips and high risk dives of cruiserweights in a fast paced adrenaline rush match and everything between feels like things are heading in the right direction, It can feel arcadey but at the same time you can pace things out for a more simulation style, I feel there is a good balance here of both which satisfied a wider audience.
There is much room for improvement in many ways, backstage needs some attention in this regard, there's a reason Here Comes the Pain gets a lot of love, the wild and wacky side of things is not something to shy away from, it is a game afterall and if someone prefers to play things more serious then that option is already there to just not take things to the sublime and keep it in the ring.
More freedom is needed in the options, I feel there could be more trust in the player to take responsibility when it comes to creating matches, even if the options chosen don't make sense to the devs, don't mother us, we are capable of deciding if we want to play a 2 out of 3 steel cage escape only with KO's on and first blood option on, let US decide, if we mess up making a stupid stipulation match or rules that don't gel then that is on us, we don't need hand holding restrictions.
I could go on forever on simple changes that would make things more fun that remain in the realistic realms of the available resources and the limitations or restrictions of the engine but why bother, the customer is always wrong it would seem when it comes to the blind spot of developers, not restricted to any one company.
The presentation is crisp and straight forward, the menus intuitive enough and load times seem to be improved this year for us impatient types.
I do wish for the Universe to receive some real love, sure you can throw in a few animations now, but it still feels restricted and neglected, I long ago found the Universe mode which should be the bread and butter foundation of the WWE games to be a lost cause, shame really, I fear this is because it provides no cashcow to milk unlike the my faction mode, I long gave up trying to fight against games taking the nosedive to greed modes burying the rest of the game, it would seem given the earnings of EA's ultimate team that its a losing battle, all we can hope for now is that there will be some sort of natural progression of companies splitting their groups into two camps, one that works on keeping games offline and single.local multiplayer friendly and fresh and the other half can dance around in the dark gambling and squeezing the customers wallet side of things.

Oh the game, yeah its still got enough to keep you going, if you're a casual player that just wants a game to pick up and have a blast with you should have enough here but maybe when it hits half price or something, the my faction is fun to play but if you don't intend on spending cash then expect a very very unsatisfying grind for what will likely be hours to earn enough for a pack of cards that will be eaten up as duplicates (conveniently) of jobbers and mid carders, don't expect any decent rosters here unless you have money to burn.

Bugs are becoming a bit frequent again, is two years going to have to be the norm? I fear the games are going to become stagnant and buggy moving forward again if the yearly releases become ""how can we milk the my faction suckers"" direction.",1681640811,1681640811,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The place where this game shines in IMO is the creations, whether its characters, entrances, titles, shows, etc this game is by far the best in a long while, plus community is amazing at creating your favorite wrestlers around the world to play with, and updating attires for the in game wrestlers as well.

So 8.7468888887/10



In all seriousness, this game truly is fantastic.  I've had NO issues with this game whatsoever and I mod songs into the game for themes/background music with zero issues, no crashes.  The weird bug where if you have a universe mode full of community creations essentially softlocking the game is gone from 2k22.  The magnetic ropes from 2k20 and 2k22 (while dialed down not quite there) are done.  This game is what 2k20 and 2k22 was DESPERATELY trying to be.  If you go through the games I own, you'll see I very much am a fan of the WWE 2K series.  I can EASSSSSILY say they knocked it out of the park with 2K23!!!  They even FINALLY removed that arbitrary 20 downloads per 24hr period lockout!!  2K23 is the game I've been waiting for since seeing the direction they were going post 2K19, I can download to my hearts content, the universe mode (both single and classic mode) are fantastic and they're finally truly fixed.  The John Cena showcase is pretty good!  You're always the guy beating Cena!!!!  I'm so glad they went in that direction instead of you playing as Superman himself, it means they understand the fans would rather beat on him then play as him.  And I'm glad John was cool enough and open enough to talk about these matches and what they meant to him, that behind the curtain look that WWE has been providing it's fans for a while now is always awesome.

The graphics are better than 2K20 and 2K22, but they're not otherworldly, you'll know what to expect if you've played the recent entries.  7.5/10

Gameplay is fantastic, aside from barbed wire matches, casket match, and inferno match, 2k23 has every match type, including WARGAMES.  OHH!!  They kept the combo system from 2K22!  I was really hoping they would and they did.  If you played 2K22 and are familiar with the combo system, you'll know exactly what to do.  WWE 2K23 is essentially a working and improved 2K22 and I'm 1000% here for it.  Still no more OMG Moments, I don't know why that was removed but most of those moves have been incorporated into normal moves.  The 5 star system is still around, it's exactly as it's been no real changes there.  From what I've experienced multi-man matches can still be a bit of a cluster-F at times but the AI has been improved enough that it doesn't happen all that often.  The overly aggressive AI trying to attack while you were in the middle of a move, negating your move in an unblockable fashion has been turned WAYYYYYYYYY down.  It does still happen, but it's a 2/10 if it was cranked to a 10/10 before.  The AI does pretty much what you see on tv, everyone kinda goes to the outside and 2 people are in the ring and people kinda fight their way in and out of the spotlight and when everyones beat to snot you get the cover after cover stuff.  

My Rise, I haven't played the female character yet but the male character Lock is pretty good.  You join a faction but it doesn't go well, you get fired and work the indies for a while before working your way back into the WWE and trying to get to the top.  That's about as much as I can tell you without spoilers. I will say this though, the character dialogue is still terrible, but the road you travel is really cool.

Universe mode is where it's at for me, because I don't like having random matches that don't mean anything, I want to develop rivalries and see where the story goes and who wins/loses and that's what Universe mode is.  Classic mode is exactly what you played as in previous entries, where you not only book 100% of the shows but you play the matches as well, and Single is where you follow the career path of 1 wrestler and can't change.  

For me this is a 10/10.  This is better than WWF No Mercy, WCW nWo Revenge, all the N64 wrestling games that are touted as the best ever.

[h1] Looks similar to WWE2K22 but WWE2K23 is Better [/h1]

[b]Pros[/b]
-New superstars
-Improved CAS models (looks like in-game models)
- They added realistic blood and sweat you can clearly see how those react during the match.
-Added extra new matches and more features to GM mode
-Improved Universe mode
-You can choose to decide which path to take in Universe mode and see the cutscenes accordingly
-Good My Rise 
-Pin system is good on this one
-Added a Balancing system for matches
- I have yet to see any poor in-game models except for Becky Lynch ( they picked the wrong attire and makeup for her)
- I have never encountered any bugs yet
-Crashes stopped after the latest patch 

[b]Cons[/b]
- Showcase mode is something i don't care about (it locks unlockable behind it so I have to play, but it's not for me)
-Community creation is the best feature but connects rarely and has network issues.
-Some models can be found outdated 

other than that I think it was a very polished and smooth experience. I really loved the game

Aren't we supposed to be improving things???      I've had the game crash multiple times during character customizations.

It needs more modes like Special referee and other special matches, but the real reason why I changed from recommending it to don't it's cuz the game is half of what it said that it offers. What I mean is that servers roughly work in PC, and for what I had read it was the same in 2k22 so it doesn't look like 2k wants to fix anything. Modes like multiplayer, MyFaction, Community Creations and more are useless and have to reset the game like 3 or 4 times until it lets you play, and Always kicks you out after a while, so no, I don't recommend this game until they don't fix the servers, paying what the game costs for half of the content that it should have is a definitive NO.
If u don't really care about community creations, playing online, playing MyFaction and just want to play MyRise, Showcase and Exhibition matchs, then of course go for it!

1) Have friends down to play

Fun game I will admit. I'm very skeptical on 2k sports game because it usually is a big upgrade or downgrade,
They have not concocted a formula to making perfect games. So for this game the visuals look a lot better than 22.
The customization is fairly nice. A lot of innovative minds if you just  wanna download customs.
THE GM MODE IS SOOOOOO MUCH BETTER! Even has made it 4 player co-op.

Here comes the parts I don't like personally.
1) The frames can stutter alot
2) CANNOT FIND A PLAYER TO FIGHT. When i do the connection will not hold (go figure wwe 2k)
3) I did not like the showcase. I rather play John Cena himself. It was cool to player others Like Edge Rvd. 
4) The my rise is a two split versions, so the focus on the stories were split. Didn't like either of them. It just didn't feel intuitive.

The gameplay is fluid and fun to play, and we PC players finally, FINALLY get the next-gen version (if you have a strong enough GPU). 

My only gripe so far is that we have locked 30fps entrances, changing the action cam setting doesn't change that. However, it does affect the cuts in the middle of the match (for example finishers) so those will be in 60fps. 

The MyRISE mode is great and truly tailored for wrestling fans, this is the best wrestling career mode I've played in a long time (Both The Lock and The Legacy), but 2K, just please let us have more ""choice"" and endings next year. Yes, there are branching paths in MyRISE, but you have only one ending in the Lock, despite the branching paths. The storytelling is great, however, and I felt fully immersed. I loved it.

As per usual, the customization options are AMAZING. You can literally create anyone.

Graphics are beautiful, it truly feels like you're actually watching WWE.

Online is something I won't touch on. I'm not an online player. However, I will say, it does take some time for community creations to load up, but I think that's normal.

Overall a 8.9/10 from me. Best wrestling game we've had in years, 2K22 laid a strong foundation, and 2K23 just continues to build up from it. Hoping 2K24 takes it further.

I really want to give this game a ""Thumbs Up"" and a positive review. However, at every opportunity where I began to have fun I encounter some kind of issue/crash. With the final straw being a game breaking glitch in ""My Rise"" mode where the only solution is to completely restart the game. With the game in this current state I simply cannot recommend it, at least for PC and or Steamdeck.

When It comes to the combat and presentation in WWE 2k23 it's awesome. At least when it works, if you're not caught in infinite loading screen, a permanent black screen, or your game doesn't crash in the middle of a match, or in my case have a glitch completely break your story progression in the ""My Rise"" mode. The ""Showcase"" mode with John Cena is engaging and awesome and really shines and was enjoyable to me while I played it. ""My Rise"" mode up until it's demise was a fun experience and interesting enjoy story lines and voice acting that I didn't feel insulted playing it and even looked forward to my next match and story mission.

Unfortunately, there are branching paths in ""My Rise"" mode and one of them is a path where you can team with Randy Orton optionally in a faction - if you do this and you're playing on a imported created wrestler you're locked into a scenario where you must complete a tedious button prompt to advance the storyline. Unfortunately, you cannot no matter what you do get this to work despite doing the right command if you are on a imported created wrestler. There are threads on the internet dating back since the release over 3 weeks ago and numerous previous patches where this has been happening and gone unfixed. The only solution to this problem and game breaking glitch is to completely start over or avoid this path and hope it doesn't happen on other potential story line paths in the game. It's a shame because without these bugs you have a great game and one of the best wrestling games in years.

I really hope future patches can fix up this game so I can update my review as It's enjoyable.... when it works... which is... not as much as it should.",1680471303,1680471303,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't know how else to say it. This game has the best storymode of a sports game I've ever played.

WWE 2k23 starts off by choosing between ""The Legacy"" and ""The Lock"". The Legacy is about a second-generation wrestler that has to live up to the expectations of having already been growing up in the business. ""The Lock"" is about an already-established wrestler that has to make it through the WWE ""superstar making machine"".

By the time of writing this review, I've fully completed ""The Legacy"" - and it was an incredible experience. Voice-acting and the actual story is genuinely really good. You're also faced with a surprising amount of choices. I think there's 3 major decisions, and the rest are somewhat minor - but the ""minor"" decisions still has a short-term impact, such as your next opponents or whether you come off as a face or heel. All these minor decisions all come together in a honestly beautifully done way towards the end. Especially the last two matches are absolutely incredible.

Where WWE2k23 becomes truly great for me, is that the new combat system have hit a perfect balance for me. I'm a veteran, and on the hardest difficulty the latter matches organically created a lot of situations commonly seen in actual matches. You truly feel like you become a good wrestler by the end of the game.

Finally, I need to reiterate that The Legacy' story is really strong. Especially Molly Holly & Justine' voiceacting and roles in the story is written just right. It feels real, genuine - and that's probably because it kind of is. Any long-term fan in the landscape would recognize a lot of story-elements from actual events.

I'm playing through The Lock atm. which surprised me that I'd even care to do - but that's how good this game is. Might do a proper review then.",1679088051,1680364000,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While this game does say “unsupported” and “unverified” for the Steam Deck, I would like to inform you that this game runs properly and smoothly— well in certain aspects it does. Playing select matches with multiple wrestlers in the ring, the game does take a bit of a performance hit, though it is still playable. Running this game at its highest graphical fidelity also causes frames to drop and draining on your battery. The fans on the Deck will start to kick and you’ll see your battery drop. At medium settings, this game is just as good and probably the best way to play. 

Overall: Playable, 7 out of 10.

Is it better than WWE2k22 on Steam Deck?
Yes and you don’t need to be offline to play this game. You can play online and run the game without it crashing.

As time goes on with the game, I will continue to update this review to ensure you guys are getting the best experience or making a safe choice/decision so you can enjoy your purchase.

It has added a lot of great features, like the control of AI behaviour and making the universe mode more fun for those playing that.

WWE 2K23 isn't much different which is absolutely a good thing because the actually wrestling portion of the game is super fun. Of course the main changes here that you'd want to see as your main content, the changes you pay for since 2k22 and 2k23 are mostly the same. John Cena Showcase mode which is pretty good, It's longer than the Rey Mysterio Showcase but It's not quite as good since John Cena doesn't talk about his matches during the clips like Rey did in 2K22. MyRise is probably the biggest change and honestly It's so much better than the MyRise in 2K22, even though Showcase is a tiny bit worse(It's still good) MyRise went from an unbearable slog to an actual interesting story mode. Character creation is a bit better, Load times are WAY faster all over the game and all the game modes I haven't mentioned are still good. Is It worth purchasing at full price? I say it's a cautionary yes, while you'll definitely get your money's worth out of the game and the game IS extremely fun. I would still say weigh your options before purchase.

The button prompt for the reversal doesn't show up when it should for certain moves and attacks to defend. Also the Submission system is a little wonky to. The AI can escape a submission move fairly easy even when they are really injured. like most of the time i t feels like 95% of the time they escape. You just have to get lucky to win it i guess.

Slight improvements to MyGM and creations, how ever creations mode is prone to crash very often. Just like in WWE 2K22 there are wrestlers and unique models locked behind MyFaction. Showcase mode is quite fun, this time you play as the opponent in all the matches with the goal to defeat the many different versions of John Cena. WWE Universe mode is the exact same as WWE 2K22, but with more crashes. The servers are non-existent in this game. The game has a 90% to give you a server error on launch, and the only way to reconnect is to exit the game completely. When the servers do work, you have 5 minutes to play on the server before it gives another server error. Because of this there are only 2-3 online matches a day and those players and you won't stay connected long. 2K needs a reality check, this will be my last WWE wrestling game unless it's made by another studio, 2K has not learn their lesson with the failure of 2K20 and are repeating their terrible old habits. If anyone is interested in playing the game, wait for a sale and buy the normal edition with the season pass separate. I guarantee you won't use the Icon Edition's content, especially the MyFaction content because you won't be able to connect to it to use the content.

However, once you play for a while, it becomes clear that many of the systems from last year have grown in depth and interactivity. The new kick out system is a lot of fun and makes it possible for even the unlikeliest of false finishes to take place. They double down on this kick out system by adding a ""sweet spot"" on the kick out meter that not only allows you to escape the pin fall attempt, but to reverse it into one of your own. Universe mode is perhaps the biggest improvement over last year. For each match in a rivalry, you can select from dozens of possible events that could take place to further the story. These are not guaranteed however, because your opponent also gets to pick how these events may unfold. Which selection is ultimately used is decided by the digital equivalent of a coin flip. Even if you win the coin flip, it is still possible that events will not go your way. For example, if you choose to attack your opponent with a steel chair after the match, losing said match will result in your opponent turning that chair against you. The player agency offered in this year's Universe mode is exactly the kind of creative freedom I've always wanted. Additional changes include, but are not limited to, weapon taunts, the ability to assign springboard moves as finishers or signatures and impressively up-to-date character models and animations. Sami Zayn had only turned against the Bloodline a month or so before this game launched, yet the character model had his updated shirt with duct tape over the word ""Uso."" Other character models are less contemporary. Austin Theory, for example, still has his much maligned selfie gimmick and is rated in the lower 80s. His current push isn't taken into account at all. Still, these are minor complaints, considering older WWE2K games used to freeze time at the previous WrestleMania and try to reflect the state of WWE at that time. The fact that even some things are updated here is a leg up over previous iterations. I felt some buyer's remorse when I first booted up this game. It felt like the same game with a new title. A few dozen hours of playtime quickly changed my mind though and I'm very happy with this year's edition of the WWE 2K franchise.",1679758927,1679758927,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I did some research & saw that this was happening to people in 2k22, which means they just didn't care to bother to truly play test this to make sure it doesn't happen. All they did was pay Ytbers to promote the very few new features from the game. I've never had as much of a technical issue w/ these games before EXCEPT for 2k20...and it's sad I'm talking/feeling comparisons to that POS game. This game is just a slightly upgraded version of 2k22 & but somehow feels worse imo. Still has almost the exact same issues & glitches & bugs as 2k22. I don't hate the hybrid fighting/wrestling game controls, but they overall don't make sense since alot of the moves in the game can be assigned as both heavy & light attacks so you can't truly gauge what button to press to parry.  The rivalry system is Universe mode, is nice but some of the descriptions for the ""rivalry actions"" don't fully explain enough what or who will be doing the action. But that's the only attention that mode got. MyGM just feels like a more toxic version of Mario Party now, designed to make you hate your friends for screwing you over, it doesn't help w/ the card system & giving someone like Xavier Woods the most OP GM card in the whole mode. All they added was 1 match type, and a few new features but other than that, it's still not as great as it's been hyped to be. These games for years now have had the pattern of taking one step forward & five steps backwards & I think I'm officially over it. If this doesn't get patched them I'm officially requesting a refund & it better be granted b/c it's just criminal at that once again, 2k pulled some shit like this.

The after season draft sucks (you really just gonna leave me with 3 superstars and let all other, well rested and super popular, superstars get yonked by other brands?) 2008 covered it better IMO (other braands got to steal 3 of your superstars while you could shield some from getting stealed iirc). And something special for RR, SS, MITB and WM would be most appreciated (as 2008 used to have).[b]Universe mode[/b] underwent some good changes. Superstar mode actually makes some sence in this one (still can't change divisions by any means tho - even ttho you can change brands with no problem).[b]MyRise[/b] seems cool too. The UI is similar to last year's while story is seems better crafted (rather than just leaving you with nothing randomly clicking through storylines).Gameplay-wise it feels bit odd. Not sure why. I could've played (with good success rate) any WWE games on Legend difficulty (since 2008 - even the last one where they changed controls - for a worse imo) but something is off in this one. Maybe reversals changed? More rock-paper-scissors based reversals? Or maybe I'm just imagining things. Either way - can't play on Legend no more :P.[b]MyFaction[/b] mode, to my disappointment, is still in the game, still crazy grind (even worse than before actually) and is still part of achievements. They 'improved' it. This time you actually have a reason to grind it/spend money, cause there is an on-line mode. And that on-line mode is the exact reason why you (or me at very least) won't get 100% achievements. Win 100 online matches?! I managed to join ONE match. It was laggy and then we got disconnected.

Much more variety in match styles and variants (although a trios tag would have been nice), midcard titles, new power cards and a larger variety of GMs and shows to run all make MyGM much more enjoyable compared to WWE 2K22.

Outside of MyGM, the CAW system is probably the best I've seen in a 2K game yet. If you're sick of waiting for Fight Forever, the community has you covered with tons of AEW stars modeled in the CAW feature that look and play great. War Games makes it's debut here and it's a very fun match-type perfect for experimenting with different team and opponent combos for some chaotic fun.

This game is so clunky. Previous installments were clunky, but 2K23 feels especially bad. Moves constantly miss because your opponent is seemingly always just far away enough for your strikes and grapples to not connect consistently, or sometimes they will barely connect and do weird animations. I don't know what makes my wrestler or opponent on the outside throw themselves into the announce table and take a bump, but there's always something weird happening with the animations because the wrestlers and objects (weapons, ring, ringside area) are so finicky when they interact with each other. (trying to move around or do much of anything with tables, weapon shots are still slow and wonky looking, sometimes items stop you in place or the referee can't figure out how to move them)

Opponents don't stay down long enough to accomplish much of anything without being ""stunned"", but that takes some time to do. And because the controls/environments are so clunky I often feel I'm scrambling to do a move under the just so conditions before my opponent is out of position and on offense (again). This is especially evident in showcase mode, where you're constantly tasked with specific moves and objectives. The fight for particular objectives was always outweighing any ""fun"" about the mode itself. Then I unlocked bonus showcase mode, which is where another of my issues comes in. 

Without giving spoilers, that entire ""mode"" is just poor game design. It's incredibly lame/overdone memes mixed in with a by design, ultra difficult set of matches. But the things that are done there are so visually off putting  and create unfair difficulty with the overpumped AI. It wants to laugh at you as much as it wants to punish you, and that creates an inherently not fun situation. They took one of my favorite things about last year, and just made it worse in near every possible way. 

Would love to talk about MyFaction, since I paid for this game, but can't access the servers. So there's multiplayer and an entire other mode down. They probably locked the faction trophies behind a pay wall again this year anyway so maybe I didn't miss out.

MyRise is a joke. Other than the storyline content being bland on its own, it's so far been pretty linear and hand holdy. I don't feel any consequence for winning or losing because the game is just going to force me into the next uninteresting scenario until I've checked off every generic ""WWE superstar goal"" or done every offbeat ""request"" for the fictional NPCs. (Also they made this NPC rewards thing ridiculous, I had an overall 81 by my 5th or so match, 2nd week into the mode)

What foundation 2K has with this series, in my opinion is not very good. They seem to be more concerned with adding gimmicks and cash grabs than finding a formula for improvement and sticking to it. They may be trying to do too much extra than what they can handle each year. I don't know, but it feels to me like they just don't care. Makes me sad because I've enjoyed these games a long time. Hopefully some day 2K can hand the reigns off to a more invested or better equipped company.

Update - was able to enter the myfaction menu. It will usually allow a ""login"" but if I try to do anything but Faction wars, I get error coded and told the servers can't be reached. Then I can't access any online features until I restart the game. So I can't grow my team, and the 4v4 tag AI is worse than last year. Near impossible to get an uninterrupted pin/submission on either side. 2K and whoever developed 4V4 in this game should be ashamed.",1679241607,1679381456,False,2,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

- The final match of the showcase had an issue where it cut to my opponent winning as soon as the entrances had completed. Also the opponent was not wearing the correct outfit, workaround was to quit and restart the match
- When playing the Universe mode as a superstar sometimes the match labels were incorrect, e.g. it would display as a tag team match then on the next screen it would be a singles match but my tag team partner was my manager. 
- When playing the Universe mode as a superstar there was occasionally an issue where I could not seek a championship match, the game would simply crash. On restarting Universe mode with a different superstar this did not happen.
- The game doesn't seem to like unconventional monitor setups - if I connected my PC to a second/ external monitor the game would not launch properly with an error message suggesting there was no display to connect to.

Having said all of this, the game delivers on many fronts. The presentation is excellent, the breadth of the roster is great, the showcase mode was really enjoyable and there are a couple of fun surprises in there. In many ways the game is exactly what I hoped it would be.

My main gripes with this game though is that the overall gameplay feels incredibly janky and unrealistic. The ""instant recovery"" system is the epitome of jank in this game. There's zero reason why someone should be able to get hit with multiple finishers and instantly get up just because their signature meter is full enough. It completely ruins the flow of the match and can put your opponent in a position to win simply because they pressed a single button before you pinned them. I get that 2K23 is supposed to be more arcadey than 2K19 was, but the matches flow terribly and the jankiness of the gameplay can be rage inducing. At the very least 2K needs to make people stay down longer. I'd say a good 75% of the time your opponent will just get up right away no matter how long the match has been going unless you hit a strong move. And even if you hit a strong move, there's a chance they'll just use instant recovery and get up anyways.

In my opinion, if you're looking for a wrestling simulator 2K23 simply isn't it. Buy or stick with 2K19.

But as for positives, 2K23 looks great and is a huge step up from 2K19. A lot of the models are impressively spot on and you can tell 2K put a lot of work into making this game look great. But as I said before, the gameplay is incredibly janky and it takes away from the fun of the game. You can't really have a realistic match in this game because of how janky the gameplay is.

The game's been enjoyable so far, but at times it becomes a chore to play simply because of how difficult it is to have a semi-realistic match. Half the time it doesn't even seem like you're doing damage to your opponent because they just no sell it.

So TL;DR:
- If you want a wrestling sim, buy or stick with 2K19 and skip this game.
- If you just want a wrestling game in general, sure go for it.
- If you want a wrestling jankfest that rivals the PS2 games in terms of jankiness, absolutely buy 2K23.",1679097215,1679288926,True,0,0,0.512610793113708496,0,True,False,False

It's a lot better optimized, but not a lot has changed. In fact this years MyRise is pretty lackluster. That's not to say its bad arcs its just underwhelming last years story arc was a bit more engaging.

Customization seems to have taken a few more strides in the right direction however the UI/implementation could be a bit better: for example like other iterations: you're myrise character is unique to the mode: you cannot use you're created myrise character in other game modes without creating a new/duplicate character. Wouldn't be a huge deal if they offered some kind of import/export or copy/paste to add your My Rise characters to the ""roster"".

I feel like the entrance customization is awaiting some patchwork too: firework sounds aren't entirely lining up with your timing of pyros etc. Jukebox songs aren't included in this current patch but plans to add it in the future sort of thing.

But it's all still getting better and better with each iteration since the great debacle of 2k20. If GM mode is local multiplayer I just kind of wish it was ""across steam/xbox/playstation"" network multiplayer too I think that would be a fun mode to play with friends ""competitive gms""

Its an improvement on 2K22, graphics are stunning the game play is very fluid and seems to out top 2k22. GM mode got a decent amount of time spent on upgrading the mode since last year. I was never a big GM mode guy but this one has me interested in playing that mode more often then I normally would have. i have noticed very small glitches 2 times but i'm sure within a month after the release world wide a patch update will fix those small problems. Community creations is much faster loading and downloading then last year, and have not experienced any crashes. I also downloaded the game on my steam deck and have not had one single problem, i have not ran any proton versions just normal windows and the game runs smooth on the deck as well. Not one crash with 45 hrs on PC and not one crash on roughly 5-6 hrs on the steam deck! very surprised, overall GREAT game and big improvement from last years!

Universe Mode: Is slightly improved from last year. You can set up rivalries with attached cut scenes to a certain plot, so you have ... somewhat... more freedom to do what you want. If you disable the auto rivalry you will have more freedom to make changes the way you want without the game throwing in random wrestlers to fill in the rivalry. So far all of the changes I made within universe have stayed saved with changes only being seen in matches that do not have rivalries attached to it. I have not tested with CAS added to the universe yet. It's a good improvement but it's still lacking.

Last year I had a major issue with universe mode constantly resetting my changes, so this year, so far, all good with that.

MyGM: You can have up to 4 GMs either all human or with 3 CPU users. You can add mid tier titles the same way you could add tag team titles like last year, so same set-up with that. You can NOT change the championship designs like you can with universe mode. Aside from the usual shows they now added WCW and NXT 2.0 as shows to play in. Wrestlers are more prone to getting upset if they're not happy with how things are going and will threaten to either demand more money or quit the show.  Those are the changes I've seen so far in the mode.

MyFaction: Don't really care about the mode as well as the others.

You will have to unlock other wrestlers within the other two game modes with the Cena mode and My Rise even if you purchased to unlock everything. 

My Verdict is 6/10. It's just slightly improved from last year with better lighting. The game has crashed on me a few times already, but each time it did was in online trying to download CAS and not during gaming.

As someone who has played almost every wwe game on existence, from Wrestlemania 2000 to Smackdown Vs Raw. 
Wwe2K23 has lived up to its hype. The graphics have proven to be the best thing about this game along with the revamped combo system, Improved AI fighting, brought back some fan favorite modes. 

I managed to Pre Order and play early so here is my review on my time playing since. 

Pros:

Graphics: Amazing. the lighting system gave the entrances the perfect touch.

MyRise: Upon writing this review I have recently finished my first run on MyRise as “The Lock” and what a wild experience it has been. The storyline was great although sometimes it does tend to drag, but when reaching a new chapter and being able to change the way the story goes with your choices makes a massive difference. Choosing between factions and paying the price afterwards gets you excited to see what’s next on your rise for the top. 

Universe: I have no dove into Universe much but the time I did spend on it I did enjoy choosing my specific superstar and going through universe that way. Very excited to see what’s to come. 

Myfaction: (will update when I decide to actually try it)

MyGM: also have not dove into. Will try soon. 

Cons:

A few cons I have ran into while only playing on the steam deck has been the performance when playing 6-8 players. So War Games is a hard miss to enjoy and play online. 

I have noticed crashing when only trying to create entrance videos so those who edit and make their custom titantrons will be unable to. 

Sometimes characters eyes go missing or pitche black during cutscenes and entrances. They come and go. I played all of MyRise dealing with an eyeless Shawn Michaels… almost.. like the real thing. 

Anyways that’s my review, the game is immensely fun and I recommend to try online and beat up your friends or randoms :)

the lower the better but 50 seems to be a sweet spot for me at least as going lower has diminishing returns for a very few FPS. if you don't care about audience you can set this to 0.

unfortunately a poorly optimized game for PC. cut scenes run fine but gameplay plays in slow motion. i am well above recommended specs on my $8,000 PC and am running at 60 fps on in game benchmark. even when lowering all graphics to lowest setting still all matches play in slow motion. all this might have something to do with the fact that i run a NIVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card rather then a AMD i'm not certain. whatever the case its a bad PC game. i would recommend it on consoles though if they don't have this issue.

The only negative thing I have to say about this game is the GM Mode. Every wrestler should be able to be drafted or be able to be picked after the draft. Same goes with the lack of matches on your card, sure you can have 5 matches on it, but if you have a lot of wrestlers, you can't use all of them whenever you want to do it. Same goes that you can't have a title match for the fatal-4-Ways and triple threat matches.

Let me start off by saying this....it is an improvement from 2k22 not going to take away from that.....The showcase mode with John Cena was amazing and I actually enjoyed it. I am not a fan of Cena, but the Showcase was the best by far. I enjoyed it and would happily play it again....The graphics, animations, lighting/smoke and the moves seem way more realistically smooth....the MyRise got a revamp with actual voice acting through and through...the Universe mode has been entertaining and fun.....with a few upgrades...again I cannot stress this improvement...the freakin GAMEPLAY is amazingly smooth and realistic as seen on tv and I think that's a massive improvement...the CAW's look so much better and just like the in-game wrestlers...

THE CON'S...
The blood is not realistic...looks like smeared crayon on the wrestlers face....it doesn't leak onto the wrestlers like previous SVR games...seems more forced like a ""there you got it not stfu and enjoy it..."" but they half ass it...
You still CANNOT do diving finishers off of ladders, cage, and other means other than the top rope....You cannot get create or ""extreme"" with weapons other than the ladder and table...there are no options to get creative as far as putting a chair on top of your opponent and doing a move like that...or doing all of RVD's chair stuff with other people other than RVD....the Custom Matches need to have an option for 6 man HIAC and War Games to have an elimination rules to allow more creativity and in depth matches....
The created entrances...you cannot change the view (camera angle) to fit certain point in your entrance without changing the entire thing...so often times...your pyro goes off and you cannot see it because the camera is all jacked up....if you do change the camera angle you are so far away the entrance just looks.....odd like you're in the nose bleed section...
I wish they would bring back the face paint wear and tear....
If i find anymore pro's and con's ill add them to here later...
the MYFACTION to me...its a waste of time and a wasted mode....but again...that's just me...

The Good:

Customization looks more realistic than last game. I felt like in the last game there was only one decent looking face for both genders and the rest looked kinda horrifying, but in this game, it's very possible to have a decent looking character with many different faces. There are a few more options but it's pretty much the same stuff from 2k22.

Lots of entrances and movesets, though the Kofi Kingston trombone, as always, will definitely not line up with your character's mouth and you just need to accept that reality. You can customize teams, and teams will not fight each other in Royal Rumbles unless they are the only ones left at the end. If they're waiting for someone else to show up, they'll just taunt. That's nice.

Lots of characters to unlock with in-game currency got through playing other modes (but not My Rise, for some reason). They come with new moves, entrances, and victory animations, so they're worth picking up. I'd personally recommend getting Andre the Giant and Undertaker early, since there are few base game characters that sort of slowly lumber into the stage and you might want that in your characters.

My Rise has an actual plot this time instead of just being a bunch of random occurances. I'm not sure if it has an end yet, but it feels a lot more focused than last time where you just kind of... did things and made your numbers uselessly go up.

War Games is crazy but fun. It's nice to see them playing with new match layouts, I'd like to see some that maybe aren't as possible in real life in the future, like shrinking arenas, referee soccer, or something else. Give the game some spice that only games can have.

Fanny is back!!! I know nobody cares but me but she's the real OG. I like the mission with her where you just do mocap and some studio guy gives bored commentary instead of having a referee. Solid setting

The Bad:

NPCs talking look so ugly, and this is very apparent in the female My Rise storyline where the aunt character's mouth opens way bigger than it should, and she looks like some freaky dinosaur when she talks. 

Teeth default to this weird grey color that looks really unnatural when you see it in the arena, so you need to customize teeth color. Eyes do the same, so you also need to make sure the whites of everyone's eyes look correct. 2k22 had better teeth by default, but the eyes were the same.

Mixed fights are reserved for very special modes, so it's not worth diversifying your custom characters. You pick men or women and stick with it, or limit the amount of fight combinations you have. 

The game starts to really struggle when customizing fat characters, especially when more than one character is on screen. I had multiple crashes on one 500 pound character, and the game really chugged when changing her outfit. Understandably, a game about buff men punching each other might not be playtested for the morbidly obese, but I'd like my morbidly obese character to try on several shirts before I commit, dang it.

The pay for cards modes are still very much front and center, and as before, they're an eyesore in a game that really focuses on pushing less fun modes over its more creative options. I'd pay for a DLC customization expansion with more generic stuff, but I'm not paying for more wrestler cards that I resolutely refuse to use.

The game, like launch 2k22, is unequipped to handle a wireless controller plugged into a computer. Your menuing will be fine, but your character will stand still in fights. This can be resolved by unplugging it, but after last year, one might assume that they'd have the fix ready on day one instead of waiting to fix it once again.

The ""every time John Cena lost"" mode is cool in theory, but in practice, you're in control of different characters each time, fighting the same boss. It's kind of a bad game design decision to make every single boss fight the same guy, and makes that mode drag a bit, which sucks because it was like half of their marketing for this game. If Soul Calibur did this for a story mode, I'd quit the story mode. Gotta diversify the fights, and I'd rather lose as John Cena than win against John Cena many, many times.

It runs well on PC, it's packed with content, and the flow of matches is balanced (i.e. you get some hits, your opponent gets some hits) so it just feels right. There's very little lag to speak of when using the character creator now as well, so it's not like pulling teeth creating even a simple character. 

However, it has jank, for sure. Biggest pain so far is probably most multi-person matches. 2v2 tag is fine, but anymore than that gets very annoying to win. Relating to this, the MyFaction 4v4 matches are just awful and near-impossible to win via pinfall (tip: go for submission). 

Some of the MyFaction AI matches are unnecessarily difficult; basically you have to both win the match and do enough objectives during the match to actually win and claim a reward. In a 3v3 tag match on Legendary difficulty, this equates to getting 5 out of 6 objectives per person, which can take anywhere between 10 to 25 minutes depending on how the AI was balanced for that particular match (in some cases, they counter around 1 in 3 attacks).

But overall, very good game. If you've been snoozing on the franchise because of some lacklustre additions in the past, this is the one to pick it up again.

A lot of refinement of little details this time around that rounds out last year's solid foundation. Simple things like taker rolling his eyes and sticking his tongue out during a pin. There's a lot of little nuance improvements like that.

Graphics are noticeably better and videos don't do it justice. CAWs (if you don't make a monster lol) are indistinguishable from IRL wrestlers. Like truly impressive stuff here. Still no ability to fine tune the body morph, like last year - BUT advanced entrance creation is back with timed pyro etc.

Universe has a really cool new feature where each person in a rivalry has different ""stipulations"" that happen such as loser leaves town, or injuring the opponent, even mutual respect or fighting spirit moments. A dice roll happens before each match that determines which opponents stipulation occurs and the stips evolve over the course of the timeline. This essentially makes heels feel more like heels and vice versa. Also gives me a reason to want to play each weekly show instead of just simulating until a PPV.  Great addition IMO.

War Games. That's it, thats the paragraph. War Games. Its fucking lit.

Sound design is great, I still muted the menu songs pretty quickly though.

MyFaction has multi-player now, making it function more closely to a Madden Ultimate Team kinda thing. It's fun, I dig it.

Online servers are BETTER but still not good. Less input lag during online matches but still so many disconnects. Might be fixed in time.

I thought I'd hate the Cena showcase but it was fire. Didn't take itself too seriously, and completing it grants Super Cena's invisible model. Funny, fun and unlocks a whole host of people I'm glad to see in the game again (shout out bald Orton from 09 with the punt kick).

All in all, it feels like a love letter to wrestling games and an all around improvement from 2k22. Icon edition was well worth it (to me, being a ruthless aggression fan).

The MyRise mode has two really great careers to do (male and female) and it's even more in depth this year and super fun so far. The Showcase mode is also really good just like it was last year. In Terms of bugs I haven't actually ran into any yet, but I have noticed that (as of launch) whenever I perform a move on my opponent that initiates a special camera angle it tends to lag my framerate a bit, but when the camera goes back to the normal ""side view"" the frames come back. Hopefully that will get fixed soon since it's a pretty small problem. I Also think the soundtrack is pretty good this year too! 2K22 had some amazing songs too (Happy Song -BMTH, Protect Ya Neck -WuTang Clan, Typhoons -Royal Blood, Heartless -The Weeknd), and this year we've got some really cool artists on hear as well (Metallica, Bullet For My Valentine, Post Malone Ft. Travis Scott & Ozzy Ozbourne, Red Hot Chilli Peppers) However this year I did disable a couple songs, those being the spanish rap songs that I didn't really dig all that much. Overall I'd give the game an 8.5/10 so far! It's really fun and I can't wait to hop into the other modes that I enjoyed a lot in 2K22, and even try out the multiplayer a bit.

Most people didn't like 2K20 because of the bugs and lightning which made faces look worse than they actually were, however it did have more features than 2K22 which fixed the bugs but cut some content. Now I see those cut options like custom entrances, mixed gender stables and others back for this year.

I also didn't experience any major bugs for the first 20 hours and counting. There can still be some visual ones like custom hair dye not appearing during entrances then working as normal during the match.

This can be my imagination, but crowd chants and commentary seem more appropriate and well timed. The commentary seems to have more triggers which is good for the timing I mentioned, but it creates moments where it's cut short due to a new move you or the opponent is doing.

Stamina is there however it's hidden and you only notice it when your wrestler has a blue wheel above their head which is getting depleted with each move, you only have to stop for a couple of seconds or do a taunt to get it back up so it very rarely gets in the way.

There was an effort made for the moves to line up better, especially jumping from the top rope, this works great most of the time. I'm just having trouble with jumping moves that target a specific body part like the head. I made my CAW finisher one such move and it often doesn't connect then refunds the finisher charge back. One time the ref was standing next to the opponent and got hit instead and I died laughing. The move is basically jump and land on the head of the opponent with your ass so the ref getting sat on his head while standing up is pure gold :D

When going through My Rise (story mode) you can change the face of your CAW completely which I really like, however the body type as well as height and weight still can't be changed once you create the wrestler for the first time so make sure you get this right.

Overall I would call this a straight up upgrade to 2K22 and I was crazy enough to buy the Icon Edition. The price on that is honestly way too high. Don't be crazy like me, type in Google WWE 2K23 DLC and you can see a list of all the planned DLC for this game. If you like it, get the Deluxe Edition for the season pass. If not, get the standard one.

If you are looking for a completely different game compared to 2K22 skip this, it's the same game with more polish, some new features and some returning features from older games. This is too long already, but you can check online and find a list of the new features if you want.

Not a complete pole-vault up a flight of stairs like 2k22 was over 2k20, but a reasonable improvement nonetheless.

Fighting feels more responsive,

Character creation feels more fluid (doesn't freeze as much or as long),

This is purely subjective, but this year's menu music choices are much better. (If I never hear ""Survival"" by Eminem again it'll be too soon),

Having a lot more options for AI interactions is great. Percentage chance to use weapons, top rope moves, etc.

Seeing War Games added as a match type is exciting, but I feel like most of the marketing was so hyper-focused on it that people have overlooked all of the other positive changes in this year's edition.

A more fleshed-out version of GM Mode is always good news to me. It's become one of my favorite minigames in the franchise. It almost makes me wish that WWE would produce a stand-alone WWE: General Manager game that really goes ham with the concept.

It's better than WWE 2K22, definitely. 2K is moving more and more in the right direction.

What definitely needs to be improved:
GM mode needs to remove the class system!!!
Still doesn't go online (but Steam Remote Play with up to 4 players).

Still missing match types like:
-Special Referee
-Inferno Match
-2vs2vs2vs2
-3vs3vs3vs3
-5-Man Tag
-Slobber Knocker (would be cool)

Backstage they need to flesh out, they put some animations in, but are by and large the same (on the car)..flesh out Backstage, let's drive around etc. like they did back then!

Weapon Taunts - needs to be expanded and a bit more realistic - take your time and put love and detail into little things, it will be worth it.

When announcing you see it's a picture with a bit of animation, which then changes to another picture with cheering - very poorly done.

A What If mode would be absolutely awesome, gladly also start a fan call with ideas or takes you fans on board.

What is already good:
-gameplay 

Overall 7.8/10

[h1]Deutsch[/h1]

Es ist besser als WWE 2K22, auf jeden Fall. 2K geht immer mehr in die richtige Richtung.

Was unbedingt verbessert werden muss:
GM Modus muss das Klassensystem entfernen!!
Geht immer noch nicht online (dafür aber Steam Remote Play mit bis zu 4 Spielern)

Es fehlen immer noch Match-Typen wie z.B:
-Special Referee
-Inferno Match
-2vs2vs2vs2
-3vs3vs3vs3
-5-Man Tag
-Slobber Knocker (wäre cool)

Backstage müssen sie noch weiter ausarbeiten, sie haben ein paar Animationen reingemacht, sind aber im Großen und Ganzen die gleichen (am Auto)..Baut Backstage aus, lasst uns rumfahren etc. wie damals!

Weapon Taunts - muss ausgebaut werden und etwas realistischer - nimmt Euch die Zeit und steckt Liebe und Detail in Kleinigkeiten, das wird sich lohnen.

Beim ankündigen sieht man, dass es ein Bild ist mit ein bisschen Animationen, was dann zu einem anderen Bild mit Jubel wechselt - sehr schlecht gemacht.

Ein What If Modus wäre absolut geil, gerne auch einen Fanaufruf starten mit Ideen oder nimmt Euch Fans mit ins Boot.

1. The fact you have a logic system, but every wrestler wrestles the same unless I personally go in and fix it. It's not my job to make your game, the Fire Pro devs, when adding logic systems to their games, always make sure that the wrestlers in the game should wrestle sort of how they do, maybe not perfectly, but they do use their own logic systems when creating defaults for the games. It's not my job to fix your game.

2. The reversal system seems absolutely borked compared to how it was last year. I've noticed times where I'm unable to reverse anything at all for long stretches of matches, which basically guarantees a loss. This is more likely to happen the higher the difficulty is too. Meanwhile, the AI is able to reverse everything and will reverse everything. There's a difference between making things harder and making things cheap. But this is a flaw with the series as a whole.

3. The whole ""MyFaction is worked on by a smaller team, so we can't import the characters in from it"" is such an excuse. It's not like the model system is different in that mode to every other mode. Why is it so hard to import character parts?

4.I miss getting a bunch of new indie moves every year, with again no promised ""New Moves Pack"" this year, you only added like 2-3 moves not used by wrestlers within the WWE. This hampers CAW creation. What is the reason why you've stopped doing it? Is it too expensive to rent the Mocap studio for more time?

5. Some of the tron placements in classic arenas are completely wrong. The smackdown fist arena has the tron playing in the entryway when it should be playing on the screens next to the fist. Then again, that was an issue in the Create An Arena when you tried to use the Fist arena there too. It's a minor detail, I know, but it looks wrong and it bothers me.

Note, this negative review doesn't mean I'm not having fun. I just wanted to point out the absolute laziness of the devs, which is part of a problem with the entire games industry and ""sports"" genre as a whole (They see these games as sports games, which is why they give the least amount of effort, they think they have the Madden demographic, but they don't realize that Wrestling fans are their own breed). Beyond these little ticks, I am having a good amount of fun. But please, either go back and patch this sort of stuff or fix it in the next game. Just because you think people will buy this game yearly because they feel obligated to, doesn't mean they will stick around. The minor details absolutely matter.

Edit: Because ""HOW DARE I ASK FOR AUTHENTICITY"" I'm going to bring up more small issues that bother me.

-Wrestlers go for pins and subs way too much, especially on harder difficulties

-The ""balancing"" section barely changes jack

-It seems that almost all of them have the Achilles Lock for their standing submission. More wrestlers use it than not and that makes no sense since a submission like that should really be for more technical guys

-The personality system created for previous games seems to have gone out the window and they are just words in profiles 

I'm allowed to care about details. Getting mad at me because I'm judging a game as a game and not as a secular religion that you consume yearly like some Maddendrone isn't going to change my mind.
Judge your video games harsher. Actually give a shit.",1679025797,1679070871,False,412,23,0.80999290943145752,16,True,False,False

The online seems to always be unavailable. Restarting the game usually fixes this untill it happens again. 

Booking title matches in GM mode have to be single matches, for some reason they dont allow 3 or 4 way title matches. Also in GM mode the match types are very restricted, and the AI GM is OP again. 

Playing matches seems to be much smoother in this game than past ones. Controls feel more responsive.

The MyFaction mode reminds me of Madden. Sorry, that's not to say I don't like it, but it is what it is.

To me it really seems the gameplay is easier. So keep that in mind if you like to be challenged.

Overall I've been enjoying the game quite a bit. The online not working properly is annoying but aside from that and the few issues I mentioned above, it's a solid game. I've only had one crash in my playtime and it was while trying to do something online. I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY OTHER BUGS! I know some people have had issues but I personally have not seen any. 

For reference, Im running the game on max settings with the following specs - 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-12400F   2.50 GHz, 16.0 GB (15.8 GB usable) Ram, Nvidia Geforce RTX 3060, Win 11.

As someone who is stuck in the 80's, 90's and early 2000's eras of wrestling I wish there was an option for more Legends DLC packs. I would gladly throw my money at them, but I get it. Licencing issues are always a thing when it comes to wrestling games.

Key highlights for me personally: 

- The graphics are a nice step up especially maxed out at 4K. 
- Lighting improvements are tenfold over last year
- Loading times are quite nice with stock wrestlers (Have not loaded up a ton of CAW's yet, 
so there is a bit of concern over this much like last year) 
- Universe is as good as ever. 
- It's been running flawlessly on the Steam Deck with medium settings without going into

1. the game has become much faster in terms of downloads, I can not compare with the previous part with WWE2K22, but after playing all the previous parts since WWE2K15 and compared to them, the game is much better
2. On the technical side, there were almost no problems. 1 time the game hung, the task manager helped and dealt with it and the connection with the game server is often lost, writes a connection error. compared to WWE2K20, which was very problematic at the start, everything here is not even bad
3. For me, the new control system is debatable, personally, I could not immediately get used to it, the game itself has become much more dynamic and faster, and this cannot but rejoice
Summing up, I see a positive trend in the development of the series, but there are little things that are not critical, but still, for example, is it really difficult to implement the display of 2 or more titles on a wrestler upon release, especially since this has already been implemented in one or several parts of a series",1679036245,1679036245,True,6,0,0.556892335414886475,4,True,False,False

1. AI has been improvised and much smarter
2. Varieties of moveset (finisher, etc.)
3. Cody Rhodes lol
4. John Cena showcase (I really love Basic Thuganomics theme song lol)
5. War Games
6. A lot of Superstar and Legends
7. Match is now much enjoyable seems the AI is much smarter
8. New MyRISE 
9. Improvised Universe Mode
10. Showcase mode is enjoyable
11. You can Import your custom superstar to MyRISE 
12. New Payback mechanic

What I hate about this Game:
1. You can't use Cody Rhodes Entrance Music as your character music (maybe it's only exclusive for him)
2. You can't edit Cody Rhodes entrance or you'll lose his entrance music forever
3. When you download Cody Rhodes' attire from Community Creation and you're using it, you'll not hear his entrance music unless you're using Cody Rhodes Original attire (I'm sorry 2K games but Cody Rhodes' original attire in this game just meh)
4. No double title match for Universe mode? (I actually don't know, I haven't try it yet)
5. Seems like PC version is old gen (I actually don't know either PC version of this game old gen or current gen but as long as the gameplay is the same, I'm okay with that)
6. Austin Theory model is outdated (no full beard)
7. No new hairstyle for Seth Rollins 
8. No new animation for Seth Rollins' Curb Stomp
9. Upcoming DLC sounds meh in my opinion

I'll give it 8.9/10

Should you buy it?
Depends If you're a wrestling fan you should buy it or you can wait for the discount.

However the game builds on the already good foundation of 2K22 and improves a lot of things. Graphics are better, especially the player models and caws. Advanced entrance creation is back. Load times are a bit quicker everywhere, but still present in most menus. Animations and transitions between moves look more smooth. AI vs AI matches also are better. GM mode had various improvements but there are still things left to be desired. For example, they added triple threat and fatal 4 way to GM mode, but for some reason you can't have title matches in those match types. Maybe they will fix this in an upcoming patch hopefully. 

If you enjoyed 2K22 and want a roster update and overall improved game and don't mind the cost, I'd say it's worth it. It's probably the best WWE game since 2K took ownership of the brand.
