and after 6 years of game play the devs 
if you can call them devs still have done nothing about the cheating chinese players in the game,
they the devs think by either selling or giving these chinese players cheats 
and letting them get away with using them all this time
because they the devs seem to think 
that the chinese players keep the game alive with the ammount on servers
will make the game look good.
but beleive me all it has done is ruin the game for the honest players
and after 1 or 2 months the people leave the game because the chinese cheaters just dominate because of there aimbots and every other cheat they use and get away with, because the devs will not do any thing to them
even with reporting them with vidio evidence of them auto firing l96 and and every other gun in the game
and shooting into the air and killing every animale and person on the map erea
is funny,
all the devs care about are numbers on the servers and they think serverss like the australian server will die without the chinese cheateers on there
which is just BS,
these socalled devs do nothing to help the honest players just look after the 90% chinese cheaters and 8% russian cheaters and the other2% of cheaters will be banned but not chinese or russians,
this game is not a good game to play for any person who hates cheaters like myself and many others
so don,t bother with this game untill these socalled devs wake the f--k up and do the right thing and hardware ban these cheating chinese and russian players 1st,
we have lost over the 6 years 100s of players because they the socalled devs never ban the cheating chinese and russain players that are all through the server,
mainly on the australian server. and to the devs im not in any of the russian or chinese clans 
im an australian an 1 of many of the honest players that have shown you and reeported to you cheater like LBT1 ,LBT11, FREDOM ,LI9HT ,SNIPERK,Aouy,Raskas,nolimit and 100s more i can name and shame
on the australian server,these perthetice chinese cheaters are just ruined the game for 100s of players.
time for you socalled devs to wake up and get rid of these pest for good.
they can 1 shot anyone with shotguns rpg at 300 and 900 yards in the head any ware on the maps.

If you want to use brain power, you can make yourself efficient, but you don't need to do that to have fun here. It's still in alpha, and has been for about 4 years now, but the team is making a lot of improvements over time.

Obvious down-sides are a lack of content outside of a handful of bosses and PvP, but every game runs into that. The worst part about the game is that you will run into cheaters on every server you play. You can even point out steam accounts made explicitly to play WTLO by their profile pictures.

My experience with co-op has been a lot of obviously non-US players taking up valuable space on the US servers. I'll hop in and see the server is 19% - 30% full, and nobody speaks English.

The game is not very pay-to-win, either. You can buy things with real money, but you're just saving yourself some time because you can really only buy guns and ammo, and there's nothing you can buy in the cash shop that you can't obtain in-game. They just have fancy colors to show that you didn't try as hard as anyone else. Like an emblem of support for the game. 
You can, however, pay for premium for minor exp and drop-rate bonuses. I've played with and without, and the difference is barely noticeable. As it should be.

This is a a real case of expectations vs reality. 

The Reality:      this game is missing a lot of things, it has bugs and it has no real direction. It is essentially an unfinished project. There are a lot of shotty bits of half finished things sprinkled here and there.

 *BUT*

This game carries so many of the things that make stalker great, which is what this is, an attempt at making a stalker mmo. It has the great atmosphere, the exploration, and a sense of constant mystery. 

It shares many of its gameplay elements with its single player counter part, whilst also carrying over a mountain of jank. If you can look past said jank you will find a delightful stalker game that is best enjoyed with a friend.

A lot of people in the reviews have real gripes based around the game and the fact is its no triple A game that is life changing.  A lot of elements of it are mediocre at best, but when all is said and done, its the closest quality to a real stalker mmo that we have right now so if thats what you are looking for this is your best bet.

Dopo oltre 250 ore di gioco non posso che consigliare vivamente Will To Live Online a chi vuole provare un MMO post-apocalittico che non metta al centro il dover uccidere senza motivo altri esseri umani. Il gioco è sostanzioso ed anche se alcune quest possono sembrare ripetitive (quelle giornaliere, non quelle legate alla trama) in realtà il tempo viene speso con interesse e il mondo di gioco è davvero affascinante. WTL è una piccola gemma, ed è uno di quei titoli a cui, anche dopo tanto tempo, si ritorna di tanto in tanto con piacere.

Maybe the developers could bring some identification and individual stuff into the game like Clan Tags to individualize the Clans which could be shown at the players Boxes or at Faction Armor like the Faction Tag.
Eventually make it possible to show which languages the players are able to speak with little Country flags or something, which are shown at the players box too.

This is WTLO in a nutshell.  

The game itself offers a relaxing endeavor into the radioactive wasteland.  Mutated animals, anomalies, and roaming bandits await you (after your mind-numbing 20 minute run to get to them).   There are portals that can help you around the vast world.  However, some of them shoot you 100's of feet into the air, and you land in a heap, only to be spawned back at the previous safe zone.  Nothing about WTLO is quick, except death.  For me, the toil of smacking rocks in a dark cave for literal hours to unearth precious metals needed for armor, is somehow fulfilling and worth the time.  Its a great break from the ultra competitive shooters that are common place. 

 PVP can be frustrating, as players that are vastly more powerful than you, can kill you in an instant.  There is somewhat of a code towards new players, ""don't fire unless fired upon"".  Although, its not always upheld, its been mostly that way for my time in the zone.

Understand again, nothing about this game is quick.  But for me, its been a rewarding experience.

Join a clan as soon as your able. Strength in numbers,  and do some research on the class you wish to play; they vary vastly.

I'm in a usa1 server and half of the server are great on each side of the faction has been really good they know them and have been very supportive to low levs i really like exploring and doing quests more than the pvp canyon because just adventuring around is amazing however the pvp i admit is really not great theres no sec chance if you get shot in the back.(Back Armour would be nice with all classes) the main probs and i hope the devs take notice at this is the level exploit with the engineer shields seeing a level and clan level go up in the matter of 2 hours is crazy. (please tackle that down)
Im all about the adventure and new location but a 2nd massive one with all sorts of events would be fun.


i used to hate this game because the pvp was very horrible but as of late seeing new places i havent seen when i was playing is was really incredible.

i cant wait to do a decent review on this game as i will be doing for the company i work for i just hope more solo stuff and solo bosses would be nice XD.

keep up the great work!

As for the the mutant AI, they can be intelligent depending on the creature. At the start you get rats and dogs that are stupid and just run straight at you. However when you encounter your first STALKER like mutant, it is a small but sneaky one. 

It also has the hunger and thirst system you find in STALKER, along with stamina that is affected by weight, and it has a bleeding mechanic with bandages to stop it, and health kits to heal. So quite representative of STALKER's survival elements as well.

Yes it has some of the repetative errands quests, but it also has the kind you'd find in STALKER games.

As for PVP you can turn it on or off provided you are in a safe zone, and this has a 2 hour cool down so you can't just abuse it and harass people which is good. I avoid PVP because this has pay to win and hackers.

As for people complaining about the graphics? They need to get a reality check and realise that you don't need GREAT graphics to enjoy a game lmao. Fkn sad.

The games translation is much better than when I originally reviewed the game. It's still not perfect, however it makes a lot more sense now.

Will to Live Online is an attempt to make an online version of S.T.A.L.K.E.R with pointlessly enforced PvP even on PvE only servers, especially at most wealthy locations, whilst extremely lacking in environment (mobs & anomalies) gameplay. IMO, wait for 1.0 release and hope that devs will turn it into something decent and not another Battle Royale game with ""special"" theme.

[h1]Anomalies[/h1]
Instead of implementing proper anomaly research/avoidance/adaptation gameplay from early levels (which is whole point of STALKER-like environment), anomalies were made into nuisance at very best that just annoys you when you want to auto-run in certain direction.

Anomaly gameplay should be interesting and rewarding. For example: if somebody managed evade anomaly, or temporary disabled it by triggering & etc - they should be rewarded with Experience and Money. Managed to gather data on anomaly? Even more Experience and Monetary reward. Managed to extract artifact from anomaly and disable it for good? Perfect? Best experience and monetary reward.

It also should be progressive as well. It should follow ""the deeper into forest, the stronger guerillas are"" principle: near starting location anomalies should be mild and less rewarding, whilst anomalies found in high level locations should be difficult, but just as rewarding.

[h1]Environment[/h1]
Mobs are plainly stupid and the only thing changes with weapon is amount of damaged you can chug out, before reloading. Armor only changes amount of damage you can tank nothing else. Why not make mobs agro range dependent on your weapon (how much noise & flash it makes) and armor (visible spectrum for monster or not and from what range)? Is it so difficult to make environment gameplay more interesting?

[b]Armors[/b] and their components (not only plates) should define how much noise you make, when you walk, how visible your spectrum (color + armor material should define it) is for monsters, how much scent you leave, while passing by. Many other features could be implemented for armor being something more than just damage buffer.

[b]Weapons[/b] and their attachments should define how much noise your weapon will make, when shooting mobs, how big exhaust flash is after firing and how much smoke/scent it leave after shooting. All this should affect will your attack provoke mob and if yes, will mob be able to find you, or will it just zip around like headless fly in search of aggressor.

[b]Ammunition[/b] right now is realistic, but plain and lame. C'mon developers, we're in a zone that has anomalies, monsters and a lot of other weird things. Why not make bullets containing boar bio-material that will make monster go frenzy and attack other monsters? Why not make bullets containing lizard bio-material that will poison mobs? Bullets containing fire spider bio-material that will set enemies on fire? Bullets with bio-material that will sun enemies? Bullets that contain a couple of different bio-materials? Bullets made from artifacts? Why not try to make game more interesting?

[b]Mobs[/b] shouldn't be stupid as well, they should react to the player based on armor, weapon and ammo player used against them. Hunting mobs should be rewarding in terms of gameplay and in terms of earned rewards. Stop spawning mobs blindly near players. Increase location where mobs can be found: why tie all fire spiders to the Dead Forest? It makes no sense. Allow players to use their skills to properly skin, butcher and harvest enemies. Headshoted mob from the eye? Good, you can get intact skin, but brain will be unharvestable. Killed it by shooting torso? Forget about getting organs and skin will be damaged, but resources form head will be in top condition.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Will to Live Online could be so much more: it easily could've become soul successor of S.T.A.L.K.E.R game series, whilst surpassing it. And yet it is far from it. It is an attempt to milk starved S.T.A.L.K.E.R (and similar theme) fans, whilst providing a sorry excuse of an environment gameplay with pointless grind and forced PvP gameplay, where it isn't even needed. As I said in the beginning: don't waste your time, wait for 1.0 release and hope that devs won't turn it into another Battle Royale, but with S.T.A.L.K.E.R theme.",1594364159,1594365515,False,1,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,True

-  nagan (worse than your pistol)

I've yet to be shot on sight, but I'm only level 9 at the moment, but so far the game is a fantastic addition to Stalker-like games.

Plus it actually runs and isn't that buggy. X-ray engine's habit of relying on vodka and prayer are nowhere to be found here, as this game's engine is freakin' Unreal.

This games added some quality content and I personally think it deserves a larger player base than it has. It's now become F2P, the amount of content added after the time of initial release has expanded the games horizons. There's no pay 2 win aspect and they're honest developers. For a survival game with a really nice story, great map layout and detailed character that you can personalise with attributes/cosmetics and it being FREE it worth a couple of hours of your time at least to try. Granted the first few hours can be hard for a learning curve but once you're past that and exploring, you're really going to enjoy the content.

I have always wanted a mmo rpg post apocalyptic game and this is the best one i have ever seen but it has a few quirks.

You can't shoot very far, My server was very empty and you can go from empty wastes to weeping angles like mirerlurks the kill you in 2 hits. but after that every other quirk i can overlook.

So if you want a great game then you buy this!


(edit) Fixed not being able to shoot far, now instead of nobody on a server there are quite a few and i still hate the watchers.

(another edit) I loved this game for a long time until i reached a point where i felt the only way to progress was to grind. this is not the only problem though, if you travel to a far off location like many of my mates had done and die you pretty much have one choice, spend literal hours trying to get back because the stamina regeneration is on par with MOLASSES when on low health (when you die you respawn on low health). Most quests underpay you so you normally have to do higher quests than you should which makes the problem so much worse. The final nail in the coffin which made literaly everything else i said before make so much more sense is only one word... microtransation... the game wasn't grindy because of lack a of content, it was because you gotta pay to progress and a normal pace. I want to love this game, i whole wholeheartedly do but COME ON. i'm gonna take a break from this game and someone wake me up when one of these issues get fixed.

ANOTHER EDIT (for the love of god why do i keep doing this)
this time there's good a bad +some mixed
The good: Very nice ui changes and a ton of quality of life changes and more people are playing (il go into this in the mixed)
The bad: missions still underpay, lower level players still get stuck if they go too far out and die, microtrasnaction..., leveling is still slow as high hell, the sometimes absurded level requirements on gear, still takes forever to travel the map normally.
The Mixed:
The game is free... holy shit, i love this and hate this with a passion. Firstly people like me pay for the game, given in a broken state (it's still early access so i do understand and forgive then), then have microtrasnaction shoved down our throats,THEN  game goes free and all were given and some skins you can still buy. BUT the more ironic part of the skins \are that people can't use them because you have to be lv 10 to even equip them (because the players still level like their walking through molasses). the only really good thing is that more people are playing (but still holy shit)
Ps
Please for the love of god fix some of this shit, but you know what? i have an idea. Make leveling, money making faster and spend a month of two adding more weapons with higher lv caps so that people actually have something to progress in this contentless wastland.

They say that in order to simulate what a commander experiences on the battlefield, one must blindfold themselves during a chess match. In a similar fashion, this game is comparable to that in the way the controls for your character handle. Did you want your Player Character to sprint to avoid an attack or gain the edge in combat? Well that is too bad because sometimes that will not happen. Are you an unfortunate soul that happened to pick up the TOZ-34 Over/Under shotgun and wanted to reload in combat? Well that is also too bad because your character will sometimes pause to consider the moral repercussions of wanting to defend oneself so they will either reload blanks or outright refuse the input command. 
I hope you like pulling aggro through walls from mobs because that is going to be happening a lot. With one second being looting a room and the next being filled with instant regret as a gaggle-fuck of deviants start to flood your now closed-off sodomy chamber; this game truly has it all. Do you like stray dogs in packs? How about land crabs? Boars? Good, because it's a run-down third world petting zoo infested with aids outside the starting town and you are the snack that only ankle-bites back. Did I mention the krokodil and petrol huffing bandits that infest a few areas? They didn't eat enough bullets to gain resistance in their early life, so a few at a time are not a problem. The issue lies in the fact that in the areas they do reside in, their numbers rival that of a small army so shooting one will anger the hornets nest. And once the nest is awakened may the gods help you against their unpredictable and broken pathing as they get stuck on trees while firing wildly. 
If I had list positives for the game though, I would probably say that the ambient noise is fairly nice and that I like the rats. 

oh and if you also stare directly down on a female player model you can see boobies i like that feature

If you want something for free that's not this but equally if not more enjoyable; try visiting your local city's dark alley.

Another area would be the XP system, i have played probably 5 or 6 days now, multiple hours each day, and just reached a lvl 7 which is the minimum lvl to actually get a decent rifle.

Any critiques I have can easily be corrected by official launch. That is not to say there are no critiques, or that they don't hold any weight, but that should impact the severity of my issues.

To start, the game has been through a lot. As a proud member of USA-1, even just that server has been through a lot. An initial player boom, followed by a slow drain has left many of the servers a little dry, without players. I won't call this a dead game, because it isn't. We are starting to see a comeback of players, and I think that is great. However, I will say attendance is rather inconsistent.

The game has great mechanics, decent lore and expansive quests that, whilst very similar, aid in the initial exploration of the entire map. Quests down to the dead forest, the Exclusion Zone, the canyon and tunnels, and swamp are rather common, and provide incentive to explore and make the map your own. The areas of the map vary from beautiful to very much sore on the eyes, and that variation paints a vivid visual picture of what the post-apocalyptic world has come to. 

The game is constantly getting fixed. There is an official discord you can join the devs in, and can report issues there, or, there is an IN GAME system for reporting bugs and suggesting improvements. The devs are very responsive, and work hard on making the game something the community and themselves can be proud of. 

As I write this, the game is not polished. Shooting mechanics get reworked a lot, fundamental mechanics like radiation and damage get reworked a lot, so for early access, you have to be adaptable. But the entire core community is quite flexible, and work with the devs often to ensure that everything is polished. The game has a lot of promise, and I am excited to see what direction the devs are going to take it. 

Bottom line, I absolutely recommend.",1564250723,1564250723,True,7,1,0.598540186882019043,0,True,False,True

707010,53346932,76561198419060863,157,21,210,0,210,1562156343,"okay for a early access game its okay, but right now you will be very very bored within about 3 hours, the only quests you get are fetch and clear area quests, and Kinda ruin the experiance for newer players. its a very atmospheric game as well, and the enviroments are really intriguing and fun to explore, and are very much like the Stalker Series, which is pretty obviously where the game gets a lot of its inspiration from. my other issue with the game is that it forces you to limit your exploration, as there is basically nothing you can get as a low level charachter to help you increase your protection or damage output untill about level 7, and it takes a fairly long time to level up as well, its taken me about 3-4 hours alone to just get to level 4 and im still using all of the starter equipment, like the makarov. this is frustrating to say the least, as your only other options at this point are a shotgun and a pistol. and there no armour you can have either at this level. I understand that it is only early on in its development, but this really really needs some new content for new players, and I cant really see myself playing this too much untill they do, as otherwise they have done a fairly good job at recreating a world a lot like stalker, the gun mechanics are fairly good, and the sounds in this game are also great, and even play into how you locate and identify things really well. 

visually the game is pretty meh, the original stalker games run a lot more smooth, look a lot better, are on an old ukrainien made game engine, and still look better than this, and I also only really get about 35-38 fps at most at any given time with an average of about 30, which isnt that great considering the original stalker games in 2007-9, look a lot better and I also get about 60-70 frames on those games, in the most intense sections such as the red forest for example, this is pretty shocking considering its developed on the Unreal engine which is a really solid base to build a game from. if my GTX 750 Ti (i know its out of date) can run other games at a solid 60fps that are gorgous like the metro games, and bioshock infinite to name a few, than this really needs to pick it up in the graphics department.

the dialogues pretty funny, I dont mind, it, in fact I prefer it the way it is, where the actors speak in russian and the the text is in english, as its more immersive to the world, however the only downside to this is that the translations are probably some of the worst I have ever seen in a video game, they are okay but sometimes you will notice that paragraphs of text just make litterally no sense at certain points, fortunately youll be able to understand the more important information, for quests but theres no oscar awards being handed to this game for good voice actors.

aditionally, which I cant tell if it is the games fault or me, but I either cant seem to ever find anyone who is down to talk, or can communicate well enough with me. it doesnt help the text to chat system is very overly complex, and has so many different options I never know which one to use when I want to talk to someone. 

Exploration in the game is hampered by the different enemies in the game, now im all for higher leveled areas being off limits but, some of the enemies in this game do rely on pretty bulshitery tactics, such as watchers, who will be basically invisible untill they are close enough and then before you know it 4 of them raid you and your dead, most of the time the low level ones are easy enough to handle, but the jump from level 1 to 6 is massive, they basically become invincible, and because im a low level charachter I have no access to anything to help me keep that at bay, such as better armour, better weapons or anything, apart from spamming the heal key in my hotbar you are basically better off just not bothering because your guarenteed to die. Ive also noticed when you drop stuff at death, its usually not the stuff you actually want back, like ammo, or medical items, it just destroys those instantly and when you end up dying having to go back to your stuff just to find that it was all useless junk.

Overall this game has a lot of strong elements to it, and I like the way its portrayed for the most part, I just think its no where near enough ready to be put on sale for any large amount of money, and I would probably avoid this game untill they update it personally, as they also seem to sell skins already in the game? to me it always baffles me when game studios realease external DLC to the game, such as skins for example, before they have even finished the base game, ARK Survival evolved did this, and its not really fair on the people who invest into the game during its early stages, as they would rather you finished the game that they paid for than start begging for money off some idiots credit card?

give it time hopefully it gets better and it will be worth the time investment to play it.",1562157747,1562157747,False,5,0,0.516576468944549561,0,True,False,True

only downside is the beginning of the game as you got no armors until later on, and the starting makarov can only kill dogs and rats really (nagant revolver is next what can kill more but is slow to reload) another thing is the xp required to lvl up but long as one does missions, it should be fine

I am not brave enough to give an ""early access"" game goods and bads since bads are actually meant to be reported and fixed or remade. So, let's start.

Positive (What makes the game worth playing):
-One of its own genre, an MMOFPS based on a post-apocalyptic world with a really familiar design.
-Unreal Engine 4, which means whatever it has now, it can be improved to a wide range of posibilites as features in time.
-Good amount of servers based on the regions, so that you can choose your ping and language preferences.
-Pretty well made representation of a post-apocalyptic world, just like in any related Russian literature of inspiration.
-Well-constructed netcode, weapon ballistics, pricelists, item lists, map design (in terms of choosing areas and their sizes).

Negative (What is needed to be improved):
-Movements of mobs (rats, dogs, etc.): They have good reactions to world like standing up, looking around, roaming etc. However, sometimes it looks like they are sliding instead of walking (an imbalance between move speed and walking animations). Also, when they are shot, they should be knocked back or show a reaction of pain (as animation), otherwise it looks like player is shooting a statue attacking him.
-Hitmarkers: I know for a big amount of players hit markers makes the game quite easy etc. However, it is a good idea to introduce the feature as an option for those who want it.
-GUI needs to be improved significantly: Menus, inventory, equipment slots, market menus, etc. They are good and simple, yes, but they look outdated (similar to the games of 90s).
-Quest Log: Being able to ""Set Active"" more than a single quest is a must. Otherwise, player finds himself going back to base million times for each quest just because he was not aware of the quests active in the same area.
-Optimization: The developers are actually working on optimization, I have been playing the game just for some days and I see a quite improvement in the frame rate already. However, it should be improved much more, because game engine clearly supports it. So that, players with low systems can actually get a higher frame rate. And for an MMOFPS, this should be the case, instead of maxing out the graphics for a little but rich audience.
-Bugs and Crashes: I did not witness many of them, the most critical one is that sometimes when you interact with a door, the loading screen pops up and goes away and nothing happens, you stay in the same map. To fix it, you need to disconnect from server and reconnect. Rarely, you randomly lose connection to the server and thrown into the main menu.
-Character Movement: When some other keys are pressed during action, you can't use ""Shift"" again to sprint. You need to stop moving and everything, than walk again and press Shift again so that he sprints. Shift should be a more dominant key that works and doesn't conflict with any other key or action. Other thing is that, there are little walls, barriers, etc. that can easily be jumped on but can't. A little bit of parkour is always nice for a player in infected world.
-Lights: Flashlights are too bright, they literally paint everything to white and you can barely see something when it is on. They should be almost half way less bright and a bit more wider range in the screen.

Please consider the game is in it's Alpha, yet. This means that developers are actually getting feedbacks and working on many things to improve the gameplay and the design. I honestly see a really valuable project going on here, but it is naturally taking time for a group of developers to fix and rearrange. I recommend everyone to play the game, advertise it if you can (because it is a bit hard to be seen around as much as I observed), give feedbacks anytime. And a request from high-level players, please try to make detailed and updated guides in English language. Hope to see you in the game.",1560073693,1560073693,True,71,3,0.808926939964294434,4,True,False,True

The graphics are beautiful. What you see in the screenshots really is what you get in the game. Everything is as detailed as marketed.

The user interface is also nice. Alone, it's nothing special. It's not super ugly but it's really not pretty, either. Frankly, being able to change its look would be cool, but as it is, it's fine. The magic of it all is that virtually every aspect of it is customizable. You can toggle everything, turn it off or on. Don't want a hotbar cluttering the bottom of your screen? Just get rid of it. Feel like enjoying the view? Just Thanos Snap all your UI for a moment. The problem with the UI is the spelling and grammar. To put it shortly, the English is very broken, but it's sometimes entertaining

The story is... awkward. I haven't gotten too far in game, but from what the intro cutscene has presented to me, it is nothing amazing. It feels generic, but it leaves some questions to be answered, which is how you get the ball rolling. The cutscene tries to explain a bunch of game mechanics with crappy excuses. For example, when you die, you are sent back to a safe place. This is explained like, ""Yeah, they researched teleportation but for some reason it only works on the very injured."" It feels like a cop-out, but at least it's something.

Weapons are a mixed bag. The low level guns feel like pellet shooters. Considering all you are issued is a PM and a knife, your options are to shoot a rat to death with BBs or try to get up close and stab it, but risk losing a fifth of your health per rat. Not fun. I suppose guns could be worse. 

Movement is good. Could it be better? Yes, but this is fine. It's about as fun to move here as it is in Fallout. Take that as you will.

Optimization is phenomenal! On a basic rig I can easily surpass 60 frames on super double-ultra maximum deluxe settings. Audio is crisp and perfect.

Overall, it's nice. If the devs stay on track, this'll blossom into something beautiful. All I'm saying is that a free weekend wouldn't hurt.",1543023920,1558061264,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Wrong. Will to live Online is nothing more than your bottom of the barrel walk over here, kill this, come back MMO storyline that you've been accustomed to.

Instead, I've spent hours doing nothing grinding out experience points and money so I can get decent items from vendors. Yes. This game has a leveling system. 

Will To Live Online is nothing more than an MMO with light RPG elements wearing a S.T.A.L.K.E.R skin. And that's Dissappointing... Still gonna play it though cause it's as close to an online S.T.A.L.K.E.R feel i'm gonna get.",1533180349,1547080552,False,0,0,0.466618806123733521,2,True,False,True

The game takes heavy influence from S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow of Chernobyl. With a Russian wasteland, mutants, player waking up with Amnesia and anomalies scattered across the map.
The game looks nice, there are varying enemies, most with different characteristics.

You decide between 4 classes of Hunter, Engineer, Miner and Military which all have different stats and different specialization in different weapons (Hunter works best with hunting/sniper rifles and pistols).

The game has a bigger looting system which comes from other games where  you can harvest plants, dead enemies and such to gather items which you can sell or craft with.

However, the game falls flat on one thing: Speed
The game is severely slow in pace. Mostly because of the fact that items require a specific level to use. Example: The first decent hunting rifle you can get for the Hunter can only be used at level 7. I've played 12 hours and I've only reached level 6 so far. This slow speed isn't like most RPG games, it is much much slower. Especially since the only good xp you can get is from the quests which are mostly just fetch quests. Run 3 miles, get this, then come back here. How fun!
And it doesn't help that different parts of the map are cut into different pieces, so entering them requires you to step into portals which are the game's loading mechanic, which also take [b]at least 1 minute[/b] to load (on Core i7-7700, Nvdia GTX 1060 6GB and 16GB DDR4 Ram).

The other problem goes back to the usage of items I hinted. Since every gear item (clothes and weapons) require a specific level, you can barely get your hands on anything good. There are no human enemies such as bandits to fight (maybe [b]some[/b] on the other side of the map) so you can never pick up weapons from a dead enemy. All the weapons you need can only be bought at the store which are freaking expensive. You need around 1,800 coins to get the first torso armor available and yet, quests only give you around 200 coins and selling loot such as mushrooms grant you from 1-20 (with 20 being a rare mushroom) so getting good gear can be a pain. And when you gather enough money to get one you do not meet the required level. Which is why I spent my whole time using a sawed off shotgun as a Hunter. Basically the opposite weapon I should be using.
And also because there is a store, weapons are limited in variety. The store's wall is full of awesome weapons that don't exist in the store itself.
If we saw some human enemies that dropped weapons that would be much more fun rather than to having to grind for every gun you want to find (I also have not been able to loot any weapons from the map). In STALKER, you could pickup whatever weapon your human enemy had, so there wasn't really that big problem of not having a good gun.

When I first got the game I really enjoyed it and thought I could spend some serious hours in it. But as time passed (and not that much time actually) the game became repetitive and boring. Mostly because you are sent into the same area 3 different times for 3 different quests (which cannot all be given at once because it's the same NPC telling you to go there).
I tried grinding money to at least have enough money for when I reach the required level of items but the grinding also became boring. Yes, I know grinding is repetitive and boring but I remember spending hours grinding in Fallen Earth and other games without getting too tired and actually enjoying the money I made. While here it's not one bit fun and the money you get for selling them is close to minimum wage.
After the 12 hours I spent in this game I quit and deleted the game simply because it felt too boring to go to the hub, take a quest, go fetch that quest and then come back to the hub, for a majority of the game. Yes, there are two camps on the map that can give you quests but they are faction based and getting to them requires you to have at least some good level.
Unlike S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow of Chernobyl where you would have to proceed to new areas each level with new base and camps to settle in for the while, WIll to Live offers 1 major camp (which will count as your main camp for a very very long time) and two small faction based camps for further out.


My experience doesn't cover everything the game has the offer but it shares with you the reason why I quit the game. I'm sure there are lots of better Online RPG games for you to play out there with MUCH more content to offer.


Also, for the frosting on the cake; the English in this game is just pathetic! From loading screen tips to character dialogs and item descriptions. They all look like they had been written by a 12 year old Russian kid who is trying his best to communicate in English and is failing miserably.

Pro:
little S.T.A.L.K.E.R feeling (PDA looks very similar, Map Icons looks like Stalker, nature try to be similar, anomalys also similar)
nice little story telling at the beginning
Cons:
Quests guidance is crap. Some quests have no markers.
PDA is controls is anying (press ""J"" for journal but it opens the last open ""tab"" on your PDA, but not the journal)
Quest goal are boring.
Animals and Enemies respawn in one second. (you're in a ""big"" town, killing tones of stupied rats... you're reloading and all enemies are back on the same spot as you killed them before. WTF?)

Its nice and simple and has light RPG elements but doesn't make you scream for more like Fallout 4 did in contrast to Fallout New Vegan, and the multiplayer is stable unlike Fallout 69 Leet Leet Skeet Skeet. The level based progression is quick enough to keep a 17 year old with ADHD like me invested but not overwhelm my more normie paced brother with new things and new instructions. The bugs I've encountered are nowhere near game breaking and usually range from, ""alright you lil' furry fuck where'd you go"" to, ""This NPC really just killed me in 1 bullet"".  

Firstly my complaints: NPCs in PVP servers are too strong, and same goes for guards. Making their termination nearly impossible without high level gear I assume [because im a mere level 9]. And before the respawn rate of many enemies was just obsurd but it seems to have lowered so that doesn't mugh count. Item variety is pretty low, it is certainly servicable but having a few more guns or pieces of relatively crappy armor to begin with doesn't hurt- especially if you'd be able to pick it up from low level enemies like in many other RPGs. Lastly, this game doesn't take full advantage of it's RPG elements [as far as I know]. Having a begining section that actively displays the importance of your reputation meter or stats like in Fallout NV would be amazeballs but it would take a good amount of time and planning, so really it feels more like a missed opportunity rather than an actual flaw. But the good stuff is good: Server stability is really good. Dialogue with NPCs isn't painful. Enemies can have larger health pools the higher level they are but are still killable and make sense- like a level 5 rat only taking 2 more bullets to kill than a leel 2 or 3 rat. Gunplay is good and doesn't feel sluggish. Most items retain actual value whether it be sellable for a good amount of Tokems [the in game money] or end up being suplies. It looks good even at it's lowest settings. Runs well on a used $750 laptop. Has a story if you want to follow one but doesn't shove it up your rectum looking for your last meal. And because its near the holidays the devs gave everybody free stuff gatherable in the starting hub and its really nice.

Its worth your time, and worth the money, even though im a total cheapo and bought it on sale.

Recomendations for the game to implement [in case the devs are looking]:
-Make each character like you more based on how much stuff you do for them, this can lead to shortcuts in quests like the gun merchant selling you vodka for a heavy discount instead of base price on the quest where you gather 10 bottles of vodka, or the doctor giving you 1 free heal every 3 completed quests.
-Slightly more variety in low level gear.
-Add benefits to certain tasks based on your stats. Such as higher melee damaged based on strength, or faster gathering speed for another stat.
-Take more advantage of the RPG elements!!!

Either way, this game is good as it is now and good with pals, but is chalk full of potential. I give it a thumbs up.",1545715017,1545715017,True,5,2,0.547456264495849609,0,True,False,True

Which isn't to say it's bad, far from it. I'd say it's the most feature and content complete STALKER clone there is, and by far the most fun to play besides the actual STALKER games. Obviously it's not as great as those classics but if you're really, REALLY fiending for a new hit of STALKER (like me), this will help with the shakes.

Be aware it's in early access, doesn't have the best translation, and enemies have levels which can result in you getting your ass kicked hard if you try to go too far too quickly. Far, Far better than sZone-online and actually features the open-world promised in Survarium.

FEATURES:

Ironsights! Bullet Drop! Armor Penetration! Shooting feels pretty good in this game, complete with a shooting range to experiment with.
PvE with PvP being opt-in. A couple locations can be conquered by PvP factions, encouraging a couple regular battlegrounds.
Character classes with unique skill trees and weapon proficiencies. Female characters are possible.
Respectable weapon selection with several types of ammo possible per weapon
Varied armor and equipment including armor plates.
Location based armor and damage - boots help against rats, vests help against bullets.
4 different armor location slots and 4 additional equipment (high-level stat boost) slots.
Anomalies! But no bolts. You have to keep your eyes and ears open.
No Fast Travel is implemented but you can find anomalies that function like portals. Just make sure you're facing the right way...
A diverse mix of weird mutant creatures that get stronger the more players they kill. Don't feed the crabs, please.
The knife is actually pretty useful which is quite nice and a great money saver.
A few AI human enemies/bandits whose guns are WAY more deadly than any animal claws.

attempted to get a miner up but looking back on the lvl 25 hunter and how long it takes to get to that point, and the lack of any good end game content, and the worse community iv seen in forums out side of vermintide lol.

pros = its not miscreatted. it has a friends list, it has maps, it has level ups and some forms of progression

cons = illegible quest logs, very little to no in game info on other aspects like armor piercing is very importent to most mobs, no faction information and once you join one are serverly punished and have your game made artifically harder due to less storage and stops you can use across the map, and the main con is the few fan boi's on the forums, if it weren't for the latter i wouldn't of even made this review but since they wish to be dick heads about it i will cast a shadow on there so called beloved game.

My playtime have gone into multiply characters (you can have 4 on the same server, one for each classes). When you reach a level that match your classes best weapon there are no other things to grind for really except more skill points. And if you are motivated enough to reach the game's current max level (35) you are in for some serious grind!
More challenging areas and monster must into be introduced into the game if they want to keep the player base which is kind of low right now. The 0.52 update will come with new contents like new areas and monsters and interesting mechanics.

Gunplay
Some guns feel better then others, but I'm satisfied.

Sounds
The gun sounds are a real down point for me. Some sounds nice though, others feel awful. Atmosphere sounds are good.

Music
The music match the atmosphere.

Graphics
Well, nothing fancy. And some areas need to get some care (fells flat and empty). The desert is awful for example. The bunker feels better.

AI
Monster are kind of stupid except some bosses that have a couple of extra things up their sleeve. But monsters in general only run at you as soon as you start to shoot at them. If you are chased by a bear with a low level character you are screwed. Nothing you can do about it. I would like some kind of mechanic that you can choose to run from battle.

Gear
Some guns all classes can use, other are class specific. Bosses drop guns with some modifications on them. But there are not really many to choose from. 
Same goes with armor. Not very many to choose from. And there are no more pants and shoes after level 10, and monsters that bite in that region does alot of damage even if you are level 35 :)

Quests
Nothing to bother about if you into story. And it's hard to understand the english even if they are working on translating.
It come to a point where the game lacks quests to get experience. It feels alittle empty by that point.

PvP
You have some options here. You can choose to play in a PvE server, or you can choose to play on a PvP where you can choose to toggle between PvE and PvP up until level 20.
It doesn't take much to kill someone, but it really depends on what gear you are wearing and what level, gun and ammo your opponent use. If you get shoot by a level 15 players and you are level 30 they will probobly not do much damage and you can locate them and take them down fast.
The EU-1 server is not very PvP oriented right now, but sometimes I feel like to go out and try to snipe some from the other faction.

Faction war
From level 16 you can choose faction. But be prepered to be killed on sight from the other faction. There are some benefits like selling loot for more money and some extra gear when you are high level enough. And it adds another dímension to the game to always look out for enemies before they spot you.
The 0.52 update come with a new faction mechanic that I can't review here.

Gameplay
Well I enjoy play the game, and I like to have players around me. Which can I trust and which can I expect a bullet between my eyes from? The game become the adventure you choose it to be. It's kind of a game of it's own. An MMO with FPS with guns and stuff. If you into shooters and STALKER vibe you will like this. But as said before the game lacks content to keep more casual players interested. I keep playing because I don't have other games right now.

- Raid monsters ******(mini bosses. Those are fun, but reward point system is all jacked up.)

- Fierce confrontation of fractions and clans (Gay as Fk. You can walk around in PvE mode all day long and nobody can do anything to you. Also people like to steal your stashes and theres nothing you can do to them to stop them. This one sucks the biggest ballz)

- Role-playing model: play for class, close to you in gameplay. Each class has its own outfit and equipment****(The most retarded thing ever. They need to get rid of this BS. but it is what it is....i guess)

707010,45717551,76561198005479940,0,10,19625,0,2230,1576943438,"I've just picked this game up and I'd like to give it a honest review.

To be honest, when I first launched the game, I wasn't expecting much, given it's an indie with a very small $14.99 price tag. And boy was I wrong! Considering I am a big Metro / S.T.A.L.K.E.R. fan,  from the first moments of gameplay, I felt right at home.

Firstl of all, as someone who's been to the Ukraine before, I immediately admired the authenticity of post-Soviet era surroundings.

Gameplay felt good and graphics were pretty. Well, almost pretty. The character models and animations looked pretty crappy and unpolished and character creation seemed pretty bad. However, given this game is in its Alpha state, I have good hopes for the developers to introduce better models, animations and a more feature-rich character creator. 

Allow me to go more in depth and start with the pros.

At first, I thought there was WAY too much grind involved to level, earn tokens and skill points. Yes, there is a skill point system in the game. This system allows you to invest skill points in different aspects of your character, such as combat boosts, XP boosts, tech, etc. There is also a stat system (kind of resembling the EvE Online character attributes), which allows you to redistribute your character's stats as you see fit for your current task(s).

Running around for a few hours doing mushroom and rat quests seemed extremely boring in the first few hours into the game. However, all of this boredom ceased to exist when I met a higher level player and they gave me some excellent tips. Following those tips made the game lots more fun and enjoyable! I enjoyed scavenging and the crafting system, which allowed me to make a few thousand tokens in a few hours by scavenginng materials and crafting items that players use and then selling  those items to players via the in-game auction. You can sell mostly anything you loot or craft there to make coin.

Next, the high-level player I mentioned earlier told me about the two factions, how they PvP each other, the tactics involved, and etc. This game is ZERO pay2win, which means that if your group/faction wants something, you must prepare and have different classes on the field ready to rock. After following said player around for a bit, I was able to witness it for myself, and I can't wait to get to endgame!

The game map seemed endless, even in its current iteration. We've ran around on foot forever! There's LOTS of places to go to, things to do and stuff to kill and loot. The game even has proper dungeons, mines, underground labs and military installations which require a solid group to take. Much like in most MMO these days.

The monsters were tough. You really need to watch your health, ammo and food/water supply in this game or they will kill you in a heartbeat. Also, be careful making noise or killing a mob that's located somewhat close to a pack of mobs of the same kind. It will call in reinforcements and if you aren't out of there by the time they arrive, you better be prepared to fight.

Now, onto the cons.

The UI is somewhat spartan and dull.

The combat system seemed nice. However, shooting a monster doesn't so anything besides show you a damage number, until it dies. Sure enough, it's a thing in most modern MMOs, but it would be nice to have the target twitch or animate when you shoot it in a leg or torso, for example. That would make this game truly stand out, in my opinion.

The monster AI in this game can be easily bugged. For example, shooting mobs even from a slightly elevated position such as from the top of an automobile makes them run around wondering how to get to you. Dogs and stuff like this should be able to jump on top easily and attack you there, yet they do not.

Finally, English translation in Will To Live Online is somewhere between the Google-translate and high-school English level. In fact, I think they Google-translated the game first, and then had a high-school English student correct the words that made absolutely no sense. Guys, you can seriously just ask me and I will properly translate it for you. I'm fluent in both Russian and English ;)

In conclusion, I'll give this game a solid 8/10 in its current iteration, taking into account the pros and cons I've mentioned in this review. This game very closely resembles S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and somehow even Fallen Earth, but with modern graphics.

P.S. I dare you to play this in a dark room, when it's night time in the game world, with Gamma settings adjusted to your environment and while wearing your headphones. A few times I got the crap scared out of me when a mob jumped me in an abandoned house. Resident Evil, anyone?",1541753911,1541754651,True,16,0,0.676274895668029785,2,True,False,True

Update. Ok i put in some more hours and the early levels feel better now at least up to level 12... but then the quests suddenly are in areas where you meet level 20+ monsters all over the place and you basicly got no chance because your weapons don't even hurt them... i am at level 14 but had to stop because the game turned into a respawn simulator...

The game is just too boring and it's not just the walking simulator part. It feels like everything in this game is designed to waste your time as much as possible. I had enough when I got to the mining part of the game. Valuable ores are extremely rare and most of the time I don't even get any loot from them. I'll check back to this game in maybe a year and see if it got better because it has potential. Right now it's not worth playing.

Hard to decide if I can recommend this game or not. I'll go with Yes for now because the game is not too expensive. 
[b]Pros:[/b]
(˚▽˚)☞ Fun, STALKER style environment
(˚▽˚)☞ Haven't really found any bugs so far
(˚▽˚)☞ Better graphics than I expected and the game runs perfectly.
(˚▽˚)☞ Gameplay is fun when you are not just running for the quest area or back to town. Some teleport system would be nice (ie guide NPC takes you somewhere for currency)
[b]Cons:[/b]
(ಥ_ಥ)☞ Too much running. Like waaaaay too much. Simply just playing the game is boring. I watch youtube or stream on my second monitor and it's somewhat acceptable like this. Since the weight you can carry is limited and the backpack isn't too big either so you have to run a lot from quest area to town and back there.
[strike](ಥ_ಥ)☞ There are PvP and PvE servers and you can't change between them with the same character. PvP servers are a pain for progressing if someone with better gear is camping the quest area. Also if someone kills you, you can start your 20 minute running all over again. PvP works fine by the way from what I've experienced before moving to PvE server.[/strike] They came up with a great solution for this problem. Now you can switch between PvP and PvE mode in safe areas. 
(ಥ_ಥ)☞ You can't really tell if some are good for anything or you can sell it. Items should have better description, if it has no use it could say ""I can sell it for money"" or something. 

[strike] ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Overall it's a fine game for it's price. If you liked STALKER you'll probably like it for a while then get bored of the running. It's Early Access so I have hopes they'll figure out something to make it more enjoyable.[/strike]",1534068920,1538333507,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

Pros -
* Decent graphics (Unreal engine)
* Smooth gunplay
* Inspired by the Stalker franchise
* Large play area with a lot of content for this early on
* Responsive and active Developers
* Not a single bug in 23hrs of play
* Good community
* Only early days yet
* Australian server at launch
* A steal at this price

Cons - 
* Classes need a rework (planned)
* Russian to english translation will leave you scrathing your head more than once

If you're a S.T.A.K.L.E.R fan you'll feel right at home. Unfortunately the devs made a change that has a lot of pushback from the community. They made a PvP toggle button so you can't be targeted by players. It took away a lot of the thrill of survival, and breaks the immersion, in my opinion. I hope to see this feature removed and return the PvP server back to an open pvp world. Despite this major blunder, this is honestly one of the better early access games I've ever played. Once you get past the agonizing mushroom quests at the start of the game it takes off and doesn't stop pumping with heartpounding goodness. Get out of here stalker memes.

Strong points:

Surivial (Was better before PvP toggle button.)
Atmosphere
Large free-roam open world. In Soviet Russia, you do as you please.
Hair-raising anomalies (Traps)
Helpful Community. You're not on the top of the food chain anymore boys and girls.
Microphone compatible helps add to the immersion. (Was better before PvP toggle button.)

Things that need improvment:

Glitchs. The game has many bugs that need to be fixed. They won't effect a new player's experience.
Improve textures on anomalies to make them stick out more. I'm talking about the tornado one; that thing is BS.
Monster variety (Rats for days)
Honestly, remove the PvP toggle button on the PvP servers. I can understand having it on the PVE servers, where people don't want to fight each other, but people who wanted PvP are getting a kick in the nuts. Please do not cater to people who complain about being PKed on a PvP server. They knew what they were doing when they made a character on PvP.

Original review (month ago):I really love this game. It is in Alpha now but for an alpha it plays really nice. Some bugs here and there but nothing huge. 

The community is small but friendly and one of the best I know, even on pvp servers. In my first 3-4 hours playing I had voice chats with many people from different countries.

I did have quite a bit of fun until about level 8, and then the game starts to show what it really is... a quest driven, super grindy walking simulator.  I totally understand it's still in ea alpha, but the core gameplay becomes extremely shallow and somewhat boring after level 10-12.

Don't get me wrong.. this game will wow you for the first few days.. then after randomly dying to invisible whirlwinds that chase you, having to walk from one end of the map to the other for a little bit of xp and money, and the complete lack of things to do besides kill stuff... it just wears on you... and one day the /sigh happens when you load it up.

Pros: 
Great community. Even on pvp servers! I never got shot at once...
The graphics are pretty decent.
Having different classes to play.
Giant world to explore.
Quests actually make you read and stop holding your hand after a bit.

Cons
The grind is real, and completely out of hand. They should of thought this through better.
Quests, and the distance you have to travel for the little amount of exp. gets really annoying.
Random invisible killer whirlwinds....
The story line is generic. I actually read it until about level 7. After that it was just click click click.
The classes need to have more differences, balance, and should be more unique.
Did I mention the grind?  It sucks....
Massive population drop since the release.

I'm a diehard fan of survival games.. and this one absolutely wow'd me, until I realized what it was at the core and then it didn't.   If it's on sale, it may be worth a buy... but in it's current state, you will get bored by level 12.  
Nearly everybody that I've ran across has responded with ""Grindin"" when I asked what's going on... and that pretty much sums the game up.

If you enjoy the grind... go for it.  If not, wait and see what they do with the game and save your money.  I really hope it doesn't completely die like Next Day, because it has potential to be something cool if they come up with better ideas that retain the playerbase.

what do i take with me and how much of it or should i take the risk or not

it is pretty much stalker online it doesnt look as cool as lost alpha ofc 

but it runs very well the performence is smooth in every situation

After seeing the negative reviews for this game and having played it myself, I felt the need to leave a small review. I'm not a reviewer, persay, but I am very critical of the games that I play and am not easily pleased. It takes something worth while to keep my attention.

At $8.99, this game is a steal. I recently bought it full price and I have no animosity about missing the $8.99 sale, because to me, it's worth every penny of the full pridce. It is very content heavy, for an EA game and runs very well for me, on an AMD FX-8350, RX-480, 4GB, 8GGBDDR3, WIN 10 64 BIT. It literally runs flawlessly, at a steady 65FPS. I, personally, have not experienced any bugs. The developers are very active. Yes, there are alot of fetch quests, but if you activate all quests, that you can, before you set out, you can do many quests together and not do all of the running around, returning to places over and over. You'll still have to return, but with lower frequency. 

If you are a fan of STALKER, know what EA actually means, want to support a fun game and good developers, don't hesitate and certainly don't listen to reviewers that obviously don't have a damn clue about what an EA game is.

Oh, it's worth noting that there are currently people working on correcting the translations. People are making a big deal out of the translations and recommending Google translator. They have obviously never used Google translator. If you do, you get the translations as they are in the game. They probably DID use Google translate and that's why it's bad, ATM. You won't have any problems understanding what your quest is. It works, but like I said, there are several people working on fixing it.

As others have stated, this is, by FAR, the best online STALKER clone around. It's lightyears ahead of any of the other STALKER clones. I've tried them all and this is hands down the one to play.",1534635684,1534659476,True,23,0,0.6737709641456604,0,True,False,True

+Servers, Very good connection I haven't had any lag at all '15-25 ping on EU"", also you can choose between Pvp & Pve servers, really fun to run into other players in this MMORPG post-apocalyptic world & team up against tougher enemies.

+/-Decent graphics, Somewhat 'outdated' S.t.a.l.k.e.r-graphics that gives such a nostalgia trip, which is a good thing! 
[h1]Picture[/h1]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1482944014

+Good sound, I like the echo that the guns make and hearing it in the distance when players/enemies fight. They could add a little more bass to the sounds for more impact in my opinion. And the ambient sound/music are similar to s.t.a.l.k.e.r = WIN!

+Good performance, gtx 1070 - i7 6700k - 16gb ram - SSD disk, Avg fps 100 with all on Epic settings.

+Crafting, Nice & simple crafting system, very straightforward and easy to understand.

+NPC & Anomalies/Paranormal/Radiation, good balance on the enemy levels, they will challange you and you need to be on your toes so you don't f***k up and die, also don't take on to many of them or you WILL die!
There are small tornadoes that will mess you up, and some kind of black holes that can teleport you to random locations so keep an eye out for them!
There's different anomalies that are moving around so watch out! And as always STAY AWAY from radiation zones.

+Weapons has a nice kick/recoil to them & feels good to shoot, there's different types of ammo/stats & you also need to maintain your weapons-durability & repair/refill & buy ammo. (You get money from quests & you can sell loot to NPC's)
[h1]Picture[/h1]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1484815878

+Animations & Movement, Weapons/players & NPC's have very solid animations, there's no clunky gameplay when you move around in the world, everything is very smooth and well designed.

+Good survival/game mechanics with a good balance on everything (Food/Drink/Bleeding/Poisoning/Diseases)
[h1]Picture[/h1]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1482126398

+World & map has a nice layout, fun to explore.

+Quest, good quests that makes you wanna explore more of the world!
*The text/subtitles can be messed up but HEY it's an early-access game*

+/-Character customization, there's a decent amount of customization when you create your own character, but more to choose from when it comes to outfits/armor etc.

+Leveling system is very nice, reminds me of Fallouts character progression +++!

Update: So I now have about 21 hours spent in this game and feel like my opinion may have changed. In this game, you can grind for hours and hours, upgrading your equipment and skills, and still get one shot by another player who is higher level than you. The armor you spent money on? Useless. The gun you spent money on? Might as well be shooting paintballs at these higher level ""gods"". And the sad thing is, these players get the joy of killing you over, and over again, forcing you to not do that quest you were planning on doing, simply because they are higher level than you and they have nothing better to do. You have no recourse other than to give up - because despite having weapons you spent time and money on purchasing - they're useless. I'm fine with PVP in a game like this - but at least make it skill based to some degree and allow people to defend themselves. The game is currently in a state where higher level players grief lower level players and it's going to result in a dead, empty game unless something is done about it. 

In addition, the servers recently went down for almost an entire day. There was no warning and no comment from the devs. I expect down time with an early access game but it is my personal opinion that the devs should communicate this to the playerbase or at least let us know whats going on; at the end of the day we spent money on a product and it's the right thing to do. 

The game has great potential for STALKER fans. I just can't recommend it in it's current state and I hope the devs address the glaring issues currently present in the game and their lack of communication.

Update 2: Yep. This game is awful and I'm leaving it until something is done to balance it out. High level players just camp areas they know they can find lower level players attempting to get XP and shoot them over and over. Absolutely no consequences for griefing and as a result you're basically insentivised to do so. This game will be dead by the end of the year I predict so no point sinking time in it. The developer's solution to people leaving the game is put it on sale rather then fix the issues.

After just one play session, this game has already shown its charm and what it has to offer. 

[b]Pros:[/b]
- Pretty solid old school questing style
- Dangerous combat.
- Hardcore in the weapons sense. Has real guns with proper ammo designation.
- Audio such as guns is nice, but next to no ambient sounds as of now.
- Community is really great. Without even leaving the starting area, I met up with two random guys and started running together and figuring out the game together. - You can group up with people so yes you can brave the wilderness with friends. 
- The extremely hilarious translation from Russian to English. For some reason, they try to use as many buzz words and figures of speech as possible, but it rarely ever makes sense. If you just read everything in a russian accent, its hilarious. I hope they never change it. It adds so much charm to the game.
- Graphics are decent. I run a 1060ftw+ and I get round 70ish fps on maxed out settings. Its run on Unreal Engine 4. It seems pretty optimized.
- Its super cheap. I bought it on sale for $8.99 and I think I got a steal. Id pay $25 for this game no problem.
- PvP is pretty mature from what I've experienced. Since you barely drop anything upon death, PvP is rarely problem. It might not even be worth wasting your ammo/meds on it because you usually need to get some quests done. The hardcore-ness of the game helps a lot in this regard. For the impatient, they will not leave the starting area without getting bored.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Hit registration. For instance, when rats stand up on their hind legs, their hit box does not follow them. A lot of the enemies are super quick and small, so this makes hit registration a glaring issue, but far from game breaking. Just something to keep in mind.
- The world feels kinda dead, but the framework for the future has room for a sprawling STALKER/Fallout vibe.
- Weird random loot drops upon death. When you die, you drop a seemingly completely random loot amount. Could be anything. Even questing materials.
- Kinda grindy. If you dont like doing basic things for an extended amount of time, this game is not for you. Its not an action thriller. Think more of Runescape mixed with Fallout, only with basicallt no meaningful storyline


All-in-all, this game is definitely promising. At 4 hrs played, I can see myself playing this game a decent bit.

Dev has added:
[list]
[*]New mobs, including hostile human NPCs
[*]Mob balance changes
[*]New weapons for all classes
[*]Faction-specific gear (there was not a lot of incentive to join factions before, this helps fix that problem).
[*]Repeatable quests (particularly helpful for mid-game players lvls 13 - 16ish)
[*]Periodic bonus loot and XP on weekends
[/list]

Devs are definitely on the right track. For 100 hours I'd say it was worth $15 USD!

[i]Original Review[/i]:

I'm going to call this game a ""diamond in the rough"" - 

A variety of enemies (some with different attacks) but all use essentially the same AI - charge and attack.

Generally-nice looking maps (there are multiple for different locations, location interiors, etc.), however the main map you traverse to get to said locations feels fairly empty, with the exception of mob spawns and some plant life you can collect for cooking.

Oh yeah, you can cook! Buy a PDA module full of basic recipes and you can make steak from mutant meats, tea, distilled water, and omlettes if you manage to find and kill the rare chicken!

Something that sets this game apart from other post-apocalypse titles is a mining career - you can go to a coal/mineral mine on the map, buy a pickaxe, and dig for useful minerals, coal, etc. which can then be smelted into useful ingots. Haven't tried it yet but I look forward to giving it a go.

There are four classes: Miner, Hunter, Assault, and Engineer.
Miners are presumably the best for mining.
Hunters can use sniper rifles.
Assault are the bread-and-butter combat class.
Engineers can use demolition explosives. 

Each class has it's own stats and uses but I've only played Hunter so far. 

There are two factions you can join: Confederation and Black Sunset (ie, bandits).

[h1]If you are a [i]S.T.A.L.K.E.R.[/i] fan looking for something to fill the CHEEKI BREEKI-shaped hole in your heart:[/h1]

This is not a [i]S.T.A.L.K.E.R.[/i] clone but it feels close enough to the real thing. Think of it being multiplayer [i]S.T.A.L.K.E.R.[/i] but watered down while much better than [i]Survarium[/i]. There are a variety of guns (including the classic sawed-off and TOZ-34), different pieces of suits you can wear (ie, you no longer have one suit like the SEVA, you have headgear, chestpiece, pants and boots IIRC), and the atmosphere in some places reflects that of [i]S.T.A.L.K.E.R.[/i]'s nicely. There are anomalies, believe it or not, which can damage you just like [i]S.T.A.L.K.E.R.[/i], however these are generally very rarely found unless you visit more specific locations. There are also apparently artifacts you can loot from places but I haven't gotten any quests detailing how this works, nor have I stumbled across any thus-far. 

Dev is not a native english speaker but he speaks enough to understand questions on the Steam forum and answer them. Seems to pretty frequently interact/answer questions on the forums too. Game has been out less than two weeks and has already had its first update, with a couple patches/hotfixes on top.

There are other things the game has (skill trees, higher-tier enemies, bosses, etc.) but I haven't been able to seriously get into those yet. For $15, I'd definitely say the game is worth trying.",1524065881,1533691681,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,True

Pros
-Huge map
-Games hard
-Realistic crafting

Now the cons list might be a but longer, the game is in EA and I espect some of this will change in patches.

Cons
-Weight limit (With 2 guns, 75 ammo for both, 2-3 food/water I was over 50% of my weight limit. After looting 3 monsters I was over weight. It gets better with levels but after 10 hours I only hit level 7 and was still having a weight issue.)

-Quests (Bland burning cursade quests. Go kill 15 boars 30 min of walking, go get 15 boar meat 30 mins of walking, go get boar hide. This also goes back to the 1st con. I couldn't even carry 15 boar hides.)

-Resources (Rare and hard to see. It seems like large sections of the map are bare of lootable items. can take well over an hour to find firewood)

-ANOMALYS (I'm not sure what the point of them are beside to kill you. Their very hard to avoid sometimes. 1/4 of my play time is walking back to my death loot. only to be killed by the same thing not knowing what hit me. After walking back for the 5th time I saw this tornado. Fast, quite, large aoe. cutting thru this town.)

-Monster variety, respawn times (too fast), bullet sponges, damage. They all need adjusted,

In the current state, Its playable. Better with 2 people. Can only recommend to the most die hard survival fans. Its EA, and if your a survival fan. You know all about EA survival.",1533302488,1533302514,True,0,0,0.495495498180389404,0,True,False,True

Pros:
+Only 15 euro price.
+Dev team work on this game alot.
+Really big open world for Alfa.
+For stalker fan it can be really Welcoming game.
+Crafting (for example not all Armor plates can be bought  from NPC=Live ingame economy between players)

Negatives:
-At now is there something over 100 quests (Dev work on new so this will soon change for sure)
-Game need in overall more content but as Alfa its have really good start.


So in the end i for sure Recommend this game,for people who like post-apocalyptic games,with open world PVP/PVE.

For 15 euro price its really good buy.

At now have 56h in game and for sure will play much more.

Edit:
Also forget to say alot players will give it up on start,most because they will find it as boring,to make this clear in most game is start boring :P just dont give it up because first quests are maked for player to get little in game in overall from my perspective,they are in first town inside where is not PVP but after few Q you will start do Quest outside where is PVP.


Edit 2:
At now have 212 hours in game, and will be still more for sure :D

Must say again Dev team really work hard on this game and put updates and tuns of hotfixs really fast.

In overall dev team reply to all post what i saw overtime react on all bug reports and listening game community really alot.(Never saw any other dev team talk so much with players from their game,and i played alot Early access games)

Community in this game seems slowly grow up whats is really good.
But still will recomend if you want play PVP use servers 1 (EU 1,US 1....)

Still in most players are here friendly even if both of them are from opossite factions but soon have be in game ""Faction war: roadblocks capture"" so after it will be more pvp focused in overall and will be reason to fight.(Most pvp is now at low lv only when new players fight, higger lv players dont have reason kill small lv but from time to time its happend)",1527605142,1532606957,True,25,1,0.635506391525268555,9,True,False,True

GOOD
different unique anomalies 
multiplayer
crafting
Seperate levelable weapon stats (the more you use an item the better you get)

BAD
Every thing is based on player level. This is vindictive of early MMOs and forces your progress. This is a very bad thing. Not everyone has the same skill level on FPS games. There are some VERY BAD reasons for doing it by level. i noticed as you level, lower level mobs give you less and less loot. So if you dont startigize your money you can find yourself stuck in an area at a higher level with weaker guns or armor without a good place to grind for mob loot to sell for money. People have complained about the min level to use a new weapon or armor, you can grind mob kills instead of turning in quests to slowly gain XP so you cn sell mob loot to get ahead but this is a very lengthy process. You also can't ""get ahead early"". In other words, you cant save your money to try to get alot better weapon to give you a better advantage if you dont meet its level requirement.
The rats and dogs in the beginning are way too difficult, the starter area is to teach you game play and get you a few levels, here you may die quite often if your not careful.
Seperate levelable weapon stats are not earned at a good pace. With 35 hours on record between 2 different characters, i have yet to even hit 3% in any weapon stat. I also believe the higher your level the less it adds to your persentage for killing a mob. 
crafting... well not general crafting but smelting metal... what a pain!!! its not too hard to harvest what you need, however, they only have one furnace you can use witha max of 5 items you can out in the queue and it takes 1 minute to craft 1 iron bar. The time is too little for you to really run around to do anything while waiting for the bars to finish yet its too long to really stand there bored waiting for them to finish. If you have a good run ans want craft the 25+ bars you carried out at the time, expect about 1/3 to 1/2 of your food and wter meter to be gone.They really need to shorten the timer to about 20 seconds max.
No mail system implemented yet and no shared storage between your players. One of my characters uses a shotgun which i buy alot of ammo for yet my other character has over 200 shells i can't give to my first player. 

i do recommend this game if your a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. fan. Things are more spread out than in any of the origional games and you will do alot of running. So if you have plenty of time to kill. I acyually like the bad translation to  english, feels more like i am in actual russia.

I couldn't make it past the first couple of ""gathering"" missions, as the mushrooms i was supposed to collect, would not spawn at all. It's like there is a system implemented that lowers the spawn rate of what ever you need to collect at that moment. 
It soon changed its spawn rate again to accomodate another mission, where I had to collect a different set of mushrooms (how original, devs). 
Enemies respawn within 3 seconds, so you cannot clear an area to loot it properly, starter enemies do a laughable high damage so you have to spend every cent you earn on healing items. 
There are not enough options to change your controls and settings in game.
The game need UI optimizations, basic optimization, quest overhaul, basic QA and not rely on Early Access to do all the testing. It also needs heavy rebalance, as it really doesn't seem that the developers have ever played their own game.

Don't get me wrong, WTLO in itself is a good game. The loot systems isn't the greatest and can take a while to get what you need, but it works. Harvesting, looting ruins, exploring and having the occasional shootout is also fun (talking about when I stopped being friendly and KoS everyone.) The game looks good, runs well and has frequent updates - 3 months on.

The one reason why I would not recommend this game is due to the community. It is by far too locked down by a select few individuals and there are no efforts to wrestle the grip away from said players control - ALTHOUGH, I have met a handful of random PK'ers that made up for it.

When I started out 2 months ago it seemed quite different. Over time it has just gotten worse and worse. and it really makes the whole experience frustrating and unenjoyable. You used to be able to mill about, murder randomly and screech into the mic with a bunch of other like minded people doing the same without too much of an issue. The people you'd come across, more often than not, didn't treat the game like some sort of IRL diplomacy hand holding game where you had to pretend to act like a retail or fast food employee being nice to customers. Of course you'd get the occasional blue-pilled nice guy, but it generally wasn't that bad.

Unfortunately, now it is a much different story. 99/100 people that still play this will exclude you from the community if you even troll or step out of line an inch compared to their ""irl morals."" They will also tell all their friends over their private DIscord communities. I've watched re-streams and had spies in these Discords listening to them erect rules and regulations VS players like me, every play session. The trend at the moment is to greet you, tell you the ""rules"" of their area (don't ""glitch"" mobs / take turns farming spiders / only certain clans can farm here at X hour."") wait for you to comply or play your own way (alphas do what they want, not what some normie with a wife says to do.), then they get their entire slave-base of players to monitor the area and step in front of you so the turret nearby kills you. Many players scream about following the ""rules"" and then ""enforce"" them straight after. For the record I am one of the few hostile KoS troll players in the game, but it gets very wearing after a while of stream sniping anyone broadcasting when everyone starts being a human shield / bodyguard and uses ESP hacks to ""protect"" the girl gamers.

Yes, I expect normies to white knight girls, streamers, and anyone that runs a Discord, but I don't expect every server to do it, 24/7. It's not fun. I cannot imagine how seasoned gamers will even begin to escape reality with this game - you simply do not have enough free time to murder every single normie and show them the arts of enjoying a video game, instead of pretending that you should treat other players nicely and hold their hands. The game was designed to shoot at other players and take their stuff while mic spamming lulzy words, not pretend they're working as a tendie chef being ""nice"" and ""following da rules."" I've seen plenty of hardcore trolls and gamers get dishearted cause of all the normalcy that the community enforces and quit to play more toxic games. WTLO is a ""pure PvP CoD shooter w/ MMO elements"" yet so many players think it's a ""second life"" where if someone ganks you they ""report"" you for ""trolling."" I like to play games and have fun, and WTLO was... once upon a time. Just not anymore.

There is no penalty for clanning up with 30 dudes and being super-social, nice, uplifting, beta-bois. This is a major flaw within a game like this. You can run around helping new players, gifting, escorting, and assisting as much as you like, along with interacting with other humans like they worked at a retail store or fast food joint, and nothing interesting or rememorable will ever happen. Rack up millions of tokens cause everyone that follows arbitrary rules to the clan leaders can free farm without griefers or people war-ing for grind spots cause everyone's tip-toe'ing around their feels, too afraid and timid to actually shoot other players who aren't labeled the server villains. The player base has forgotten their natural instincts and think the way they need to act IRL is the same in a video game. Just because of the way I play WTLO doesn't mean I lose all sense of decency in real life, but there's no reason to treat other players like I do in sales making 6-figures yet 99% of the players do and it is incredibly sad that they don't know how to properly play a video game.

There is a reason the community on WTLO is shrinking. It needs to be addressed as WTLO is a good game... without 99% of the other normies.

People who read this review can tell me to ""git social"" as much as they like, or whatever uplifting advice you have stored up your dad-like persona, but at the end of the day there comes a point where the lack of toxicity becomes too cringe and it's just not fun... welcome to Will To Live Online.

It's a shame I cannot recommend this game as it is up there with being one of my favorires. The community has just sucked out any chance of fun for me. 

I'm not against the idea of WTLO (Including teaming, raids on bosses, fighting mobs on a rotation or grinding with friends etc etc.) I'm solely talking about the players and how they interact with others.

For example there are some jokes applied in conversations where the NPC is trying to have a laugh but it is completly lost in translation and makes the conversation flip from telling you about something important, to saying your a noob in 1 second, then the NPC laughs and goes back to telling you something different, like how his family died.

707010,43040203,76561198155153451,0,13,251,0,251,1530323688,"Quick Overview: If you're expecting a DayZ-style open world sandbox, you'll be somewhat disappointed. The easiest way to explain this is a cross between S.T.A.L.K.E.R (aesthetic, sounds, night/day, style of enemies),  7 Days to Die (food, thirst, and crafting) with War Z (combat and gun mechanics), and the original Nether (safe zones, designated pvp areas, world bosses). There is some open-world looting, boss spawns (you're going to want friends), and a ton of quests. 

Pros:
-Currency system. Easy to understand, tradeable between friends, quests give an appropriate amount of coin, etc. Everything from sell prices on looted items to purchase prices on guns/ammo/armor feels well balanced. 
-UI system. Not cluttered or clunky. Somewhat outdated (The dialogue boxes look like they're from RS2007), but overall not a huge issue. Info tab is a huge help.
-Map markers for questing is great. Extremely helpful early on when you don't know the map very well.
-Questing is incredibly rewarding and decently amusing. I've had fun so far.
-Tons of ammo types, guns, melee weapons. Decent amount of armor. 
-Hunger and Thirst are easily curable once you get enough coin. Dont forsee this ever being a real issue tbh. 
-PvE combat has a decent variety in the early game. I didn't feel like I was killing too many of the same type of things for the quests. 
-PvP combat is fun, although the penalty/reward system is interesting. I've honestly shot more people than I've been shot at (which I guess makes me an asshole). 
-Class system is great. More classes would be awesome. 
-Fantastic map size. Its legit huge.

Cons:
-All of the quests are fetch quests. Kill 10x rats and collect fur. Bring it back to a dude. Then go kill 10x boar and bring back blood. Bring back to a dude. 
-H*ck those mushroom quests. Tiny ass mushrooms in tall ass grass. They're impossible to find. I dont want to spend another 1,5 hours looking for red, white, and brown musrooms. No thank you. 
-Instanced areas make the game feel less open world and more Stalker-ish? Its not a huge issue since the map is gigantic, but its still strange to me. 
-PvP at boss spawns. I know this is part of the game, but its difficult to balance. Newer players are going to struggle hardcore getting gear with this current system. Going after a boss for an automatic weapon drop is less fun when two people are camping in the woods nearby with SVDs killing everyone trying to fight the boss. And, since bosses are the only way to get certian types of weapons, it makes for a sad afternoon. 
- Leveling up system can be a bit confusing and takes a lot of getting used to. 
-Shooting people and killing them only drops partial loot, not all? (Or dying in PvE, its the same) Not a big fan of this. Its a randomized algorithm. You could drop 50 bullets and nothing else, or it could be 2 steaks, a copper wire, and 1 bullet. 
-No vehicles to travel the map, so enjoy walking. 
-Weight system could use a re-work. You go from being able to sprint -> only walking with no stamina regen -> walking so slow you're willing to die to be able to move again. WTB weight limit increases.

Overall, its a decent game with a ton of potential. I'd give it a 6.5/10 right now. Content does drop off late game, since there are only about 100 quests overall. ""Surviving"" becomes less and less of a difficutly.

The game does lack content, and it may wipe before full release, but I do not regret putting time into this. It's a one very special game. The greatness of it is found with other players, the interactions, the bandits, the RPers, and the occassional meme-lord. 

You will have unique experiences you can say you never had in another title. The game is relatively slower than other games to update and patch, but it is a fun game reguardless. I want this game to succeed. 

For american players, just letting you know, this is a russian game, and some of the translations can be a bit off. 

If you ever need info don't look aimlessly for articles and posts, because there are none, the info found can only be discovered by talking to other players, communication with the community is key.

At the start i didn't find it much intresting but once i put few hours into the game i started liking it. I am gonna list my thoughts in Pro's and Con's.
These thoughts are just from my perspective.

Pro's :
1. I like the concept of the game in a post apocalyptic you hunt that too with guns, gather resources, craft things.
2. Game play is smooth i didnt find any lag. Graphics might not be top notch but they are decent.
3. Devs are working on frequent updates, bug fixes and new contents (I am eagerly waiting in 0.51 Update).
4. Map is very big for a alpha stage early access game. It takes more than 30min to go from one end to other end of the map.

Con's :
1. After putting decent hours in the game it becomes too grindy. Not much to do other keep hunting and making money.
2. This is one of my main 2 concerns. Walking distance is too long. Introducing vechiles or some teleport future will solve this.
3. This is my second concern. I dont speak russian but i still play in russian server because it has more population than anyother server. Population in english speaking server is very less if it has decent population i would have played in it. Most of the times other players in russian seerver are good they mind thier own bussiness and respect others. But few people are too unfriendly for example 2 days ago i was farming Big Sand spiders in Black sunset there was this guy who kept wantedly coming in between my gun fire and spider to get killed and then the tower kills me and put 10min cooldown on me. He did this few times and even used foul language then i had to close the game. I dont mind pvp or players killing me as i am playing pvp server but taking advantage of the system and playing dirty tricks thats discouraging. Anyways this is not game issue but players but i hope devs do something about these kind of situations.

Over all this a decent game and i dont regret buying. Remember this is a game which is in alpha stage so having some what less content and bugs is part of development.

The difficulty and scarceness of wealth in order to progress simulates the feel of a post-apocalyptic world as it should. 
The progression that is needed to level up is the feeling of an old school vanilla-WoW realm because of the contested areas that are populated by other areas in order to level up providing a sense of danger and need of comrades.

As you progress in the game, you make the decision of teaming up with other players that you like and will keep tabs on people who you despise on your server and that's what makes this game unique, the dramatic events that unfold to give yourself a hitlist on players.

The guns and class system is really interesting and encourages diversity amongst different players and is also still in development. (snipers, riflemen, engineers, and miners pretty much) (Skins like gloss, matte, and camoflauge in different colors is a neat aspect to the end game part of obtaning your high level weapons)

END GAME (quick summary): You join Black Sunset or Confederation at level 16 (which will be a rigorous journey to get to without help) and basically utilize every person's class strength to have ""wars"" against the opposing faction. Wars will start when one side will decide to venture into enemy territory to attempt to reap benefits vice versa and alot of trash talk and fun will happen because of the giant discord list of people you hate will finally show up on the battlefield for you to seek revenge, defend your territory, and back up trash talk that you've accumulated from hate towards your enemies on the server. Will to live is a unique MMO-styled open world pvp game that has sooo much potential. The devs seem to care about the balance and nature of how the game is played and I've enjoyed my experience for $15. Running everywhere just sucks.

-GUN PLAY. Gun play sort of lacks. There aren't too many weapons available, and nothing besides your Makorav pistol you start out with once you go through some of the starting quests. I would recommend sticking with it until you're high enough to buy a rifle and some armor. Pistol ammo is much cheaper and definately better compared to a shotgun or another pistol.

Hitboxes seem a bit off. I was playing on the NA server with 35 ping, I encountered my shots no registering quite frequently, which in turn made me put more rounds into the NPC, essentially costing me much more than I should have. I wasn't sure if this was a serversided issue, or a game engine issue. It was random when it did this and my ping never fluctuated.

The weapons feel well made, they just lack detail and there isn't much differentials in the weapons choices, which is OK since it's still in a Alpha. I hope they add more weapons in the future.

They have a decent assortment of grenades and claymores to knives.


-PLAYER BASE. The player base fluctuates randomly. At times the game will be dead, not a single soul around. Other times its quite populated with groups and players forming teams and having fun.

I have noticed with the safezone area, that some people camp them for people to come out. I found it annoying when I'll I had was a Makarov, getting tailed and then murdered.

Since it's still in an early stage of developement, I hope that this issue would be addressed.



-MAP SIZE. The map is pretty big compared to similar games currently on Steam and on the market. Majority of your time will be running around and walking, it can be very boring traveling from one side to the other. I hope they implement a fast travel or even add vehicles to try and cope with this issue. It takes around 15-20 minutes to get from main spawn to the desert.


-QUESTS. If you like doing the ""go kill that and retrieve this"" quests, you'll love this. Most of the game is built around questing, at the beginning its your best option to level up and gain money. This game is no doubt a grind, so it might throw some people off playing it. It look me around 7 hours to get to level 8, and around $8000 tokens. With the majority of the time questing. 

There's no real lore in the quests, and I feel its sort of dull and empty when it came to them. I found that to be the biggest issue.


-RANDOM ANOMALIES. There's these orbs that float around and can kill you or cause damage to you, especially if you don't have Vodka or anti-radiation pills. Stay away from them until you learn how to catch these things. Don't even go near the Tornadoes until you are around level 8. You will be one shotted by them and potentially losing some of your items.

I don't really get the lore about having all these different things randomly popping up, they seem to follow a path. The only thing is bad is them spawning ontop or really close to you.


-GLITCHES/BUGS. I've encountered farming for plants, they seem to respawn or regenerate after I've moved 15-30 feet and looked away from them. I'm not sure if this is a server error or game design flaw. Though you can't make much money off of it.


-GAMEWORLD. The game world feels sort of empty and dull, besides random NPCs, notibly the giant rats, stray dogs, and giant boars, there's not much to do besides questing. Most places are derilect and lack a sense of purpose other than being abandoned small towns.

Adding wandering travelers or survivers would be cool, maybe having roaming patrols or small towns where there are traders to trade at would be nice. It's an incredible annoyance to be over incumbered and having to drop items because you are 20+ miles away from a trader or safe zone.

-GRAPHICS. The game feels really polished, and detailed when it came to the textures. I can't say much of this, but for an Alpha, it's looking great.

-CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION. I wish there was more customization given, but for an alpha it's pretty reasonable. You can buy an assortment of armors and clothing in the trader shops, so gearing up its much more simple compared to other games. 



-ENDING.

I feel that this can be a great game with much potential if the dev team keeps working on the game. In the coming months, this could make or break the game.",1528466275,1528466275,True,2,0,0.51171875,0,True,False,True

If you buy it today, June 1 2018, you will find a game with some game breaking flaws, primarily the PvP the moment you leave the starting zone, such that you simply cannot continue to play the game. 

THAT BEING SAID:

This game has so much potential, and it's already doing so much right. Whoever is doing the artwork/animations is truly talented. You're running through a barebones russian city, ala Player Unknown or DayZ, textures are bland, and then suddenly you run into an absolutely stunning art-deco mural that looks real to life. Huh? The ""story"" video in the beginning is only slightly lower in quality than what I would expect from a AAA title from Bethesda ala Fallout. 

I really hope the devs figure out how they want the safezones/PvP to work. Level 3-4 and getting endlessly griefed by insta-death level 10 players with no way to stop it (one exit to quest area, moment you leave bubble you're dead. Like you don't even hear or see the shots, just instant wormhole screen). 

I have high hopes that this game will add more content in the future, and clean up the content it has now. 
Basically, the core gameplay is there, just extremely unpolished. Strangely, it's the small details that really stand out like the art. It's constantly teasing at a much more polished asset pack that's lurking around the corner.

Imagine playing player unknown, where sometimes textures aren't loading, and you're getting stuck in door frames, but then you suddenly pull up a perfectly functioning 3d city map from The Division. There are custom assets in this game that are far more polished than the rest, and it's leaving me very hopeful for what's to come.",1528030204,1528030204,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Play the ""story"" and an animated comic fills you in on the premise of the  world.

You begin in a small village with seven quest givers that send you on missions and relay more of the story. 
The game is voiced in Russian and the subtitles are harder to understand sometimes but funny most of the time.
Ive played 30 hours and explored most of the map on the PvE USA server, Hvent ran out of things to do yet but have read some forums that complain of not enough to keep you busy.

The game begins defaulted lower settings, if your machine can handle it max out the settings and it looks really good- lots of grass and tree detail. 

It is in ALPHA stage now but the Devs are active they seem to update regularly. They even put a bug reporting key in game to contact them directly. 

On performance: It is rock solid. On all the USA servers i get between 10 and 30 ping connected. I even played on the Moscow server and was getting a 67 solid ping. I am impressed. 

The movement is responcive, quick and snappy. The servers right now support 250 players at once with 500 in the future. 

I have a lvl 10 character on the USA PvE  server and the Devs are going to impliment Clans and Clan warfare so a limited PvP willl be possible.

I also have a lvl 3 character on the USA 2 PvP server and so far it seems playable, the player killing doesn't run rampant I have been outside the safe area with other players and not instakilled yet. The way the game is built doesn't promote bambi slayers to run amok. 
When you die you drop random items from your inventory and you always keep your weapons, so the ability to totally cripple your target is small, I personally hope this stays as it is as the game grows.

The crafting aspect seems to be gather these resources and it builds: this. The game doesn't have player built structures or vehicles yet but who knows what is planned... The website is in Russian and I can't get it to translate for some reason....

I can tell the Devs believe in they game they have built and want to create fun and play not just revinue. I would gladly donate more money to the Devs to aide the vision of ""Will to Live Online""

The asking price of 14.99 is a steal and completely worth what you get now and as the Deva add content the price gets even better. 

If you have wanted a game to stick by as it grows and enjoy the game style you may just enjoy this title!!! 
I have bought Triple A titals and haven't been impressed by the game as I have been with this one, so if you got 14.99 burning a hole in your Steam Wallet give it a try!!

* UPDATE*
I have logged 105.5 hours and haven't been bored yet!! I have found some people to run around with and leveled my main vharacter to 13 and continue to be suprised.

The more I play this undersold gem the more I find I like. I discovered two more maps I didn't know about and more things to shoot and loot.

I have also found more monster types than I knew about and learned by talking to one of the players that I have yet to see one of the mini bosses; a giant bear!! According to them it is quite a challange.

I also got the Dev's page translated from Russian to English and found the list of  things they wish to add it includes:

A single shot grande launcher and silencers -that are ready, just not added into the game yet.

Three new map areas.
New craftable items.
More guns.
A weather system
And more!!

My library is large and  this is quickly becoming one of my favorite games.

I'll be on the USA Pve and PvP servers as MrGrAnD and GrAnD look me up if you have questions I;ll be happy to help if I can.

Most of the early access games when come out they are so shit that eventually will die if the devs won't put effort in it , like Miscreated when it came out years ago it was shit or Rust or Subsistence .....so many games but Will To Live came with full force.

So when this game came out i looked at it and i was like damn that's the online S.T.A.L.K.E.R we all needed so i bought it since i'm a fan of S.T.A.L.K.E.R series.

- The graphics are pretty good on max settings but i play on Medium to have better performance since i don't have a rich dad to buy me a monster PC gotta work for my money but still way more optimized than ""Over Rated PUBG"".
- It's a MMO RPG (like S.T.A.L.K.E.R) so there are a bunch of quests to do which will end after a while but it will provide you with a good amount of in-game currency and XP but the Devs gonna add more quest(the early access edition is only 1,2 months old).
- And Of course like all the other Survival MMO RPGs there is grinding ; Grinding for money , Grinding for XP and Grinding for resources and quest.
- So if you don't like Grinding you probably don't wanna play any Survival MMO RPGs not only Will To Live.
- The enemies are challenging and their levels and difficultiness is perfectly balanced.
- It's really enjoyable playing this game with friends.
- There are boss fights and those are hard and challenging with great rewards and XP.
- A good variety of monsters to kill.
- The Map is huge and there is a lot of areas to explore which it makes it really interesting.
- I'm pretty sure this game will run way better with an SSD you will have some loading problems it may take 3 minutes to load into the main map but with SSD probably a few secs.
- It never crashed on my system (i always play on a 2 years old gaming laptop) so you shouldn't have crashing problems.
That should be it , Enjoy The Game And i HIGHLY RECOMMEND it.

The game itself is poorly coded, enemy pathing is basic at best, the unreal 4 logo on the bootup is a slap in the face to anyone who's played/made games of the sort. It feels and looks like its been done on Unreal 2.


The weapon mechanics are poor, the aiming and shooting clunky, broken and boring quest system coupled with a dying population make it a no go - Do not fall for the hordes of 3 paragraph reviews here. The game after all is made by Ukrainians.

There are many broken glitches/bugs in the game, loosing loot while moving stacks, NPC's not spouting quests they should, enemies just ""appearing"" on top of you. Mostly if not the PvP is also severly one sided. A lvl 25 (which i can assure are the majority of active players now) can 1 shot you with a pistol from a mile away, where as even by some means you managed to get a weapon you would only be able to do 1 or so damage.

Think a lvl 110 in World of Warcraft vs a lvl 45 - even by that comparrasion, its making it sound light.

The devs also cannot take constructive critisicm, I asked many times about bugs/character problems/movement/enemy problems and was simply blocked by them. A somewhat head under the blanket response by the devs.

As a disclaimer:
it -is- early access. Missing features, content, bugs... So don't buy it if you don't want to see the game expand as it happens, or do buy it and support the devs. 

Gameplay is a little clunky in that guns don't feel like a AAA shooter, but I'm sure that will be improved. 
There are questlines ranging from collecting plants, hunting animals, or even finding lost items.

I have 5.4 hour in game as of writing this, so I don't know everything or how the higher level content feels like...
But I have certainly played long enough to recognize a potential gem among pebbles.

Its only 15 U.S. dollars. w/e it is in other countries I do not know but my guess would be on par.
Will you get your moneys worth? How many potential hours could be spent playing this game?
If you don't like it within a short time there are returns...

TL;DR Its fun if u like stalker but in an mmo setting with localization of the server for damn near every location in the world, from Japan and New Zealand to USA and Europe

Pros;
Gunplay sounds and feels awesome, you feel the weight of the shot and it sounds like an actual gun when fired
Map is large and full of content to do
Community is fun to play with and against
PvP is rewarding and doesnt completely fuck when you die (some item/ammo at random is dropped and you get to keep the weapons you had equip)
Silly russian to english translation, that im sure they will rework, hell i'd be willing to rewrite the NPC logs to be more coherent and actually make sense
A story that they are very clearly working on and putting more effort into with each patch
A dev team that actually updates the game and punishes cheaters (if they are not so transparent about why cheaters get banned is a little upsetting but its their game and their rules so deal with it)
Great servers, there seems to be to many of em to pick from
4 Classes to choose from that operate completely different but compliment each other to a great extent
Good Character custimization
15 bucks? its a STEAL for the sheer amount of content this game has and will continue to have.
Its just been released and the popularity of this game is GROWING not FALLING
Just cause its so damn important ill say this again, The devs do not tolerate cheating of any type and ban cheating all the time (look at other reviews of cheaters shit talking the game; and when a dev/mod had something to add to the conversation they shat all over them and said ""looks like they do not like transparency"", but clearly the devs do if u look at how frequent the updates come and how content rich they are, but do not want to give away the details of the anticheat because you know its an ANTICHEAT system)

Cons:
Memory leak, gotta restart every couple of hours to maximize them frames
Optimization issues, if there is to much going on (a lot of ai fighting and player fighting) you will dip in frames unless you have a amazing system
Graphics are not the greatest for textures of buildings (guns look great)
The translation can be wonky sometimes and be misleading on quests, but the community 9 times out of 10 will help you if you have a question.
Graphically speaking, its dated all around (2010-2014 graphics)
Some consern that its a retextured Stalker Online, but its still vastly different in its own way.

Quick Review:

I don't know how to describe it.. It has shity mediocre graphic.. It has mundane repedetive fetch quest.. it has a slow grind to progression.. Yet The world got me hooked.. The feeling that anyone can kill me at any time.. Yet that they don't... A system that allows for freedom but made benefits to not just Kill anyone and all on sight..  I think If your a fan of the Stalker games.. Then you must give this a go..  But... If your easy to lose interest in grind.. Repedetiv combat.. And fetch quest.. then this is not for you. 

Full Review: 

I feel now with 70 Hours in the game I can make a review. Game has allot of stalker Feel to it.. A fan of S.T.A.L.K.E.R games will notice it instantly.. Game has fun gunplay.. It's simple but ok.. PVE is well, all i can say is they are trying.. Some enemies spit acide, some knock you down. some cripple your movement some knock you back.. They all got them small simple mechanics to them that makes it not completly braindead. I got allot of hours out of this. And I feel It was worth it.. Problem Now is that Im lvl 18.. At lvl 13 There was no more quest currently avaible in the game.. So since then It's been a total Monster grind.. And the PVE is not interest enough to make it fun.. PVP is really fun.. But the game punishes PK people allot.. Not just with big safe zones protected by Machine auto AIMbot turrets that kill people.. With a long distance to add.. But also by showing your name in the chat to who you killed.. Meaning just a bunch of kills and your name is marked by the community for extermination. And it happens that some people get so much heat they forced to make new characters.. And with the grind.. That is not fun..  

There's allot of wasted effort aswell.. There's no friend list or blacklist to keep track of people you like or dislike that you wish to kill or play with..  There's a pvp arena nobody uses and people abuse it to teleport around betwen safe zones. There's really no variation to quest other then kill that or go collect that or this many of that item..  Fetch quest.. 

What made the game for me was how it was community run.. People protected people and acted as guards and police. People try to robb people to get more items then just kill them and hope for a good drop.. People run the market and prices..  Still it falls short late game as there's no real reason to to do anything.. when you grinded materials for good armor and guns.. And your high lvl. There's no point anymore.. Either you see youself turn mad from grinding mobs.. or you become insane and PK everyone and get marked as a bad guy which no one likes then..  There's a whole lot of problems with system and management.. No real balance to it all. No clan function either..  I just feel a huge lack of content.. Sure 70 hours.. but It would probedly taken me 30 hours if i did not do so much pointless exploration. 

It's a 6/10 for me now..  I think with time.. this will be a great game.. but as of now.. If you hate grind.. then stay far away from this game. 

Putting down a youtube video of a guy that Deserves cred for he's excellent explenation of this game.. Awesome man..

--------------------------------------------
Let me start off by saying I believe this is worth every penny you pay for it. It runs great, has a great atmosphere and the community is developing into something finally. I have paid way more for other early access games, this one has a great price tag.  
Pro- They pump out updates about once a week and they are constantly adding new features to the list of things they are going to be adding.
Pro- The gameplay is fun and exciting, when not running to a mission or zone. There are quite a lot of mechanics in this 
game that can be developed into something very fun and competitive. 
Pro- Great dev team that tries to communicate with its audience even though they don't speak their native language. (they translate a lot of stuff for us and you know it, don't judge their translations unless you can read and write English and Russian. (If you can, message the devs, I bet you could land a job.)
This game is VERY EARLY ACCESS.  You have the chance to provide feedback and suggestions at this point because the game is so fresh and new, they don't even consider it close to being finished yet (and thats a good thing). 
That being said, here are the cons atm.
Con- Walking for 10 minutes at a time can get boring, we honestly could use motorbikes, or something to travel around a little faster, especially with the ever expanding map that is already quite large.
Con- There is a lack of content right now but that is only due to the fact that this game is in Alpha and is being produced as this teams first release. 
Con- The map can feel a bit empty at times, but like I said. They are adding more monsters, weapons, ect.",1524669183,1524669183,True,0,0,0.48827749490737915,0,True,False,True

The game don't have a month since it was released to steam, and it have really good comments and others are really poor and unfocused, why? because this is a ""starting game"" like warframe when it came out, how about now? Warframe is something else, this game have that potential, a lot of it, at least in my opinion. 

I have fun in this game like i didn't had in a longtime, why? because when you need to get into a house, full of hungry dogs and there's not a single car to jump to, that's adrenaline right there, is not a grinding game (i hate grinding, when i play, i want to play, not to work), yeah, you need money (tokens) but you can find them doing quest or going to a place and kill mobs to sell their pieces, but you don't need to be there the whole day, and there's so much to explore, the map is HUGE and there's a lot to explore caves, dungeons, bunkers, and another map i'm too noob to go, the history so far (i',m lvl 10) is different from the stalker or the Szone, i have played both of them, this game in my opinion, needs more anomalies, one feeling i hate and love from stalker or the Szone, was to watch my every step.

About the mods, we have normal ones and bosses, they have weak spots and abilities.

I like the weapon system, you can improve your guns with attachments and there are different types of bullets, plus the sounds of the guns, is great.

About graphics, i play in epic mode and the game looks great, is not a ""the witcher 3"" engine or a ""kingdom come deliverance"" engine, but it really makes the point of the environment and the enemies, and i know this will be improved, it doesn't affect the gameplay not even a bit.

There's a lot to improve, but this game have a great potential and that's what i really like of it, the different ways this can be an awesome game with a lot of ways to be played and even more ways to have fun with it.

We need to give it a chance, i'm sure it won't let you down.

The PVP is too irrelevant. When you kill someone (if ever because the community is nice) YOU GET NOTHING FROM IT.

What the hell are the factions even for. I'm almost level 10 and know nothing about them.

Made one of each class, did a handful of quests and was not particularly impessed. Clearly this is a game in development, so I'm not too critical of elements that are clearly placeholders...

The shooting seemed a little more polished and I had no issues with hit detection or the fps mechanics in general.

The starting zone is incredibly boring. There are some quests with multiple paragraphs of dialogue that I'm NEVER going to read, voice acted in Russian... ultimately sending me to fetch water from a well, or top compete with other new players to hunt the eight rats wandering the starting zone. Not a very engaging experience for me.

If you're the kind of person who can push past what I imagine is probably a rough 3-5 hours of introductory/establishing gameplay to break through to the experience that is leaving this game with positive reviews, then I imagine you'll have a grand time. Especially with friends, because apparently this game can be quite unforgiving in later stages.

However, if you're solo. Or expecting any sort of a refined, or deep mmofps experience. Or if you're jaded like me, this game is a definite No go.

This game is really ""ruined"" by its MMO aspects + the community. Like typical survival games, unless you know one another, random players dont like to work together. So it isn't uncommon to have people just constantly mass murdering you. There doesn't seem to be much of a punishment for it. Its a bit frustrating to be killed by higher level players because...why? There's really no benefit to killing lower level players and the punishment is apparently low enough that it doesn't matter.

Its also a bit grindy. The main ways of getting gear is grinding and crafting. So if you're expecting to exploring old ruins in search of items, yeah isn't going to happen for a good first portion of the game. Instead, you'll find yourself killing wildlife with a crappy pistol so that you can actually use a fun gun/gear. I would much rather explore than grind. I've got plenty of MMOs to play if I want to grind for crap. 

So it is a STALKER in essence, but it is ruined by the mass murdering PvP style where nobody cares + grindy game. 

Overall, in terms of video gaming as a whole, I'd give this a solid 5/10. It's fun to a certain degree and the foundation is good, but is ruined by trying to be MMO like and have a low PvP cost. For a survival game...you don't really feel the need to work with other players to survive.

I have only put in about 11 hours at the point, as it takes about this amount of time before any issues become immediately apparent. 
- The game is a very slow burn and seems to have a vast amount of content- from quests, upgrades, mobs and areas to uncover and explore.
-There are servers for everyone, and English speaking players....although the NPC's in game speak full blown Russian.

- Things in this world called ""anomalies"" exist in the world. These often look like a strange gas leaks and when standing in them, will kill you pretty much immediately. This would be fine as you only need to stay away from these things in order to progress. However there are different kinds of these anomalies that take the form of a minor dust storm. These seem to follow you and make no noise...meaning that you can be enjoying your time exploring and investigating when suddenly you are one tapped but a light breeze that sneaks up behind you.
This can be expecially frustrating if you have to travel a long way back to the quest zone.

- This is a minor gripe, however the English text translations in the NPC text are fairly poor at times. Often enough its fine, but sometimes the information that is lost in translation can make a quest trickier than it needs to be.

My ping is good, normally around 30-40. The game runs smooth and doesn't look that bad compared to other early access games.

There's a good variety of weapons to choose from and different classes as well, I haven't tried the other classes yet apart from hunter, but I expect that each class has different stats. There's a lot of possiblity for this to be a pretty decent s.t.a.l.k.e.r/metro type mmo.

I don't want to bash the game in anyway since it's so early since it came out, but the two things that I think they could improve is the loading time and just the general grammar in the game, but I am guessing that the dev(s) are maybe not from an english country. 

After that just start making more content because this game has a lot of potiental, even as the state of the game now, the pricetag isn't that bad.

It's basically a STALKER-Style MMO, which sounds weird but magically works pretty good. The atmosphere is very similar.

About the game itself all i can say is even the first enemies that are rats can fuck you up and the atmosphere is great, really feels like stalker.

-Character progression is painfully slow, but the familiar STALKER game loop is present; stock-up, explore, kill, loot, and return to base.

-Mob AI is lackluster, they can be aggroed through walls. It takes a very long time before you start encountering different enemy types.

-Crafting is subpar; cooking recipes and smelting. I hope they expand upon this in the future.  

-The fetch quests based on RNG looting can be frustrating at times.  

-Gunplay is passable, tight controls. I like the fact it’s an FPS game and you can see your feet.

-The map is good size, 30knm2 (according to dev). The environments show STALKER influence.

-The performance is tolerable, hopefully more optimizations is to come.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
 
This is an interesting game with some good potential. The game is very similar to games like: Nether, WarZ. What makes this game different is it has a Stalker feel, there is anomalies and mutants in the game due to the radiation. You complete quests to gain money and experience to buy better equipment.
 
[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list] 
[*]Great theme.
[*]Great Coop potential.
[*]Runs fairly well.

[*]Graphic leave a little to be desired.
[*]Pvp could get old if there are some bad clans in the servers.

Yes, some of the early quests are quite dull, i.e. ""go here collect this"" type of standard mmo faire. The graphics are not particularly dazzling either, but it does run surprisingly smoothly for a game at this stage in it's development. There is some graphical stutter when you leave the starting city but I found restarting the game seemed to fix it, plus the devs are working on a permanent fix. Actually, on that point, the devs do seem really active and very receptive to feedback which is never a bad thing.

The character and monster models are fine, nothing special, but perfectly functional. The animation isn't too bad either, certainly better than some other early access titles in the same genre. It has some neat sound effects too. The map seems pretty big from what I can make out but I have only explored about 10% of it so far. There are loading screens however, so it's not a seamless open world. 

Be warned though, you are going to experience some quite jarring dialogue in the quest text as it's been translated from It's native Russian language, probably by Babelfish, but this is really only a minor gripe and you do get used to it pretty quickly. 

How would I describe it? That is actually quite tough but it's like a strange hybrid of Stalker, Tarkov, Defiance, Fallout, The Division and your standard xp based loot gathering mmo. It seems to have plenty of content for the price, I've played for about 4 hours and I've only just left the starting zone, and if the devs are true to their word, a lot more content is yet to come in future patches.

I was fairly sceptical going into this game as I've had my fingers burnt by so many early access survival games, but this one has been a breath or fresh air.

As die hard fan of the series I was kinda weary about picking this game up because of how many times I've been burned before by other games trying to go for the same thing. Ex: SZone, Survarium, Nether, to name a few. In my opinion this game succeeds where those games failed. To create an online version of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 

Good things currently about the game.  
- Runs extremely well, ultra settings at 1440p with 125% res scaling I hold around 90fps average when out safe zones/towns, roughly 65fps in them. Little to no stuttering. 
- Atmosphere and ambient sound is stellar, feels like I am back in Clears Skies or Call of Pripyat.
- Servers, so far they are running really well, no disconnects, no hiccups, my ping hangs around 14ms. 
- PVP and PVE servers, I am currently on a PVE server since I care more about exploring the world but I will make a PVP character later on. 
- Map size from what I can tell is quite large, with different zones to load into. (Can't wait to explore!)
- Doesn't take long to earn currency and level up enough to get decent gear to start exploring.
- Game doesn't hold your hand once you leave the starting area, expect to die if you are not careful. 
- Missions once you get out of the starter area are enjoyable and make you explore. 
- Night time is a blast, very limited visability even with flashlight. 

Neutral things currently in the game that need some work/tweaking. 
- Graphics are not horrible but they are not ground breaking either. Hopefully as game progresses we can get a bit of a graphical bump.
- Gunfire (I assume is placeholder for now) all sounds the same at the moment.
- Gunplay is a little lackluster but will deal with for now. 
- Animations are a tad lacking but passable for now. 
- Game is currently only availble in Russian/English, the npc chat is kinda funny atm because it's not properly translated over to english so not really worth reading unless you want to have a chuckle, but the main important things currently are in proper english, menus/interface/resources.  

Not so good things about the game. 
- Weight limit needs to be improved a little bit, you can increase it by a bit once you get leveled, but currently to low to really be able to gather resources or carry enough food and water and ammo for a long journey. 
- Starter missions are a bit of a bore. 

Overall I have been enjoying the game a lot and I was surprised at the level of content and polish this game currently offers for being just a few days in early access. If the devs keep adding content and improving the game from here then I feel we are in for a awesome game once it is finished.

This reminded me a lot of the Stalker series not only because of the atmosphere, but the sounds. Literally. Some of the noises in the game are ripped from Stalker, like the wild dog noises when they howl and bite. Not a complaint, rather just an amusing factor.

Pros: 

Great Atmosphere and world to explore.

Does a pretty good job at introducing you to the game and its mechanics / trade system. 

Graphics arent terrible for a reletivly cheap game.

Community has its quirks but the majority are helpful and happy to lend advice.

You can feel the potential in store for this game. If developed correctly, I think this can be very successful.

Now for the cons:

I only have one, but it is pretty major in my opinion. Keep in mind, I am well aware of the early access status of the game but I feel like it is important to touch on this aspect. There are times in-game where it will stutter like crazy. Not just frames or connectivity issues, like the world completely stops and starts again over and over extremely quickly. I've noticed it when I was playing for an extended period in areas with more players. It makes it unplayable at times and I hope this is high on their priorities update wise.

Things I would add in the future:

PvE servers for Europe and USA, not just Moscow.
Abiltiy to use different characters in different servers through connected regions. i.e. PvP character can go to a PvE server and keep stats and gear, the catch is it has to be in the same region. 

Other than that, it works well. This isnt even an issue for some, but it is an issue nontheless. Its worth it when on sale.",1522996759,1522997127,True,12,0,0.557815909385681152,0,True,False,True

For some reason most of the initial weapons have if not the same, very similar firing sound, like a sawed off has same sound as a makarov (really ? xD)
Mobs attack mechanics can be a bit clonky, like if they get very close to you you have to spin around to find the bastard.
AI is a bit  meh but should improve overtime.

In conclusion I give it a positive review as the game is in a good state comparing to what it costs, its a way better deal than other similiar games.",1522958521,1522958521,True,25,1,0.66065216064453125,2,True,False,True

It's basically Fallen Earth (the F2P MMORPG), but with better graphics and a better combat.",1522955588,1522955588,True,12,1,0.594428956508636475,1,True,False,True
