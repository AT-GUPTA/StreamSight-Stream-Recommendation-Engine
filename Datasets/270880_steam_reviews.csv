This is a result of not only the many game options, but also due to the selection of mod offerings. For example, if you just want a casual game to travel around you can have driving assists on, fines disabled, and automatic parking of trailers at your destination. This way it is not too stressful. Or you could have it to be where money is easy to make, but the challange comes from turning all the driving assists off and letting the driving itself be the challange. Then there is the way I play, with driving assists on, but economy mod to make earning money a lot more difficult while keeping fines. This makes the challange really be all about the money and puts me in a situation where one mistake during a drive could cause me to loose money as the expenses will be more than I was paid. Wheras the base game pays you enough money that even with a couple fines or a crash you can still gain money from a delivery. 

There is no real wrong way to play and the game understands that. It does require mods and the like to be the same for multipler which is fine, but the versitility is what makes it great. 

Other great aspects of the game have been discussed elsewhere, but I just wanted to focus on how much I love the fact that difficulty is up to the player, which, in turn, makes it more fun. I love it when games let me decide where my challange comes from, and I love that challange being the money making and balancing, while I have no interest in having real life physics applying to my load or realistic braking. I am fine with having to park trailer myself, but none of that fluids in tanks shifting while driving stuff.

I forgot that this is meant to be a game review and not a story, so pardon me for the detour. In the end, if you want a game that is truly chill, relaxing, and an unexpected joy, play American Truck Simulator. I promise that you wont regret it.",1708588061,1708588061,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

(graphics are bad! download a mod. biome's are empty! need mods so it isn't lifeless. basic simple truck upgrades like rims??? need a mod, or spend 5$ on a tire pack. but hey if you want a valentines livery for these lonely weirdo's playing, they got that) as for the die hard fans, for the most part are toxic and some weirdo's who spent more money on an in house steering wheel pedal setup instead of their mazda 3 or mortgage. this is bananas. the reason i have the hours i do is because my friend and i used to play it here and there doing long hauls, gets to a point we both fall asleep out of boredom. no animal life, no deer or elk running across the roads, just some road blockages that piss you off more than anything, you end up driving on the shoulder so you don't get to your delivery late. no snow, no seasons, cant chain up tires, cant even pop the hood to see the engines goddammit. euro truck is worse thank god i had some common sense at that point. childhood connection roots deep in this game as i grew up playing 18wheels of steel... this is the reskinned brother like MJ, and still the same fing liveries from however many years ago. mods can only fix so much. every few players who purchase these stupid dlc's are paying for an all inclusive trip to mexico for the lazy devs. don't feed into it! don't buy the dlc's! i have tried and tried again but this is not it unless you are a 50yrold lonely man who never got their class 1 trying to still live out that dream. real talk, buy snowrunner that is a real trucking game. watch this review get taken down.

Things have certainly come a LONG way since Bus Driver. Lol! 
I'm usually disappointed by driving games with unrealistic roads, signs and markings etc. That definitely does not apply to American Truck Simulator. Even when I come across something odd that appears to be a mistake, I just check google streetview of the actual location and quickly discover, nope. That 'mistake' actually exists in the real location, and the game has faithfully copied it. I'm used to driving on the left, but that has not been an issue to me at all. I've even learnt of some interesting locations and attractions via the simulation that I had not known about before. So it's also been quite educational and shall be helpful if I ever get around to visiting the USA myself. Although I'd have to adjust to the time and distances being much greater in real life than they are in the game. :)",1708336873,1708336873,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When you released the game, I would like the traffic at that time, because now the truck is driving parallel in the inner lane, so it is not good, because it does not help the traffic, rather it slows it down.

Can't believe this game has been out there for at least 8 years and they don't even have alt or ctl combo key mappings.

NOTE: Steam refused refund because of 2 hour time limit.
I thought I had a day to try to get this to work. Never tried a refund before. 

I've purchased over $2000.00 worth of software from Steam over the years and this is the first time I couldn't get something to work.
Well that's what happens when there's no REGULATION in the industry.

Remember if you can't get this monstrosity to work in an hour and a half STOP trying and get your refund!!!! DO NOT BUY any DLC unless you can get the main program working.

It's like the game was written for a $400.00 piece of hardware and nothing else.

1. I have two thrustmaster 1600 joysticks. Each has like 14 buttons and I'm not allowed to manually shift gears unless I have this $400.00 H-Shifter

2. I've driven truck over the road several years in my youth. I've never seen where air pressure is low when you have no damage unless you forget to hook up your hoses. These must be trucks built in Russia with very bad air compressors when they run out of air after pressing the brake twice.

3. Whether I'm steering with joystick or MS controller the steering is way over kill like no one ever balanced the tires. Very similar to the retarded spaceship steering in Starfield. Rubber band like is the best way I can describe it. You can never do just a small amount of correction.

4. Even went to the point of uninstalling all Logitech software with no success. Keyboard simply refuses to work with two thrustmasters. Who knows maybe it's still the Steam controller software. Maybe it's NVidia. Maybe it's Logitech. Maybe it's Microsoft....yada yada yada.

5. After doing a lot of reading on the net even people who buy the $400.00 unit still have problems.

4. Had to constantly start game over many times. Never got past first tutorial run. Whenever I'd try to change something the $300,000 brand new truck would always run out of air. Or get locked in reverse because of some confusion between the old keyboard setting and the new joystick ""wizard"" setting.

Unfortunate. I've read a lot of good things about this game. All I can suggest is pay the $10.00 sale price, DON'T buy any DLC until you  try it on your computer if it doesn't work chalk it off as loss. Don't waste any time trying to configure it unless you already have the $400.00 H-Shifter wooooooo. REMEMBER you only have 1 1/2 hours to get this monstrosity to work.

All I got for $35.00 was a red face and high blood pressure.",1707745826,1707882195,False,0,1,0.434782594442367554,0,True,False,False

This game is like an escape from reality, I just put on some black metal and drive, it's soooooooo relaxing. I added a bunch of mods to the game and use reshade to make the game look pretty hot. This game really was not designed to be an open world racing sim, but I just speed around in a lambo, the physics are funny as fuck because of this. I have the g29 racing wheel and a button box, works flawlessly.

Even with a ton of mods, I don't think I've ever encountered any kind of game breaking bug. The game is not ugly, but it doesn't use ultra complex shaders so it's extremely stable, even at high resolutions and with upscaling. Low end systems can run this, and high end systems can add graphics mods if desired. I love this game so much.

I've purchased every state dlc (which are reasonably priced), because the game is THAT FUN. and I've also bought Euro Truck Simulator 2 and all the area DLC's as well.

DEER THE GAME HAS DEER THAT RUN ACROSS THE ROAD IN FRONT OF YOU, HOW COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

CONS: YOU CANT RUN OVER THE DEER AND SMASH THEM INTO PIECES LIKE YOU DO IN REAL LIFE.......... CRUSIN USA LET YOU 30 YEARS AGO. but it was cows not deer.
ROAD KILL, game needs it, needs more animals.... Needs vultures eating the roadkill also, maybe able to drive into them also smashing those, feathers flying and all. THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME IN THE USA. NO SEMI TRUCK IS GANNA SWERVE FOR SOME BIRDS EATING ROADKILL. Maybe let the airhorns scare the birds off so you can warn them before you smash them also, giving the HORNS more ability and function in the game.
Police do not pull you over when traffic infractions / tickets happen. They have the siren working as sound effects but no animation of the cop behind you, waiting for you to STOP and approach your vehicle and cite you, maybe too many tickets you can get your truck impounded for x amount of time forcing you to use your other babies you created that just sit in garages....
The sky, needs major overhaul with all the colors the come in real life, so far i see dark blue light blue thats it.
Let user low boy trailers be able to haul special transports..... i want to use my trailer with modded strobe lights...... COME ON.... not the boring trailer.
Let other trucks in the game driving around randomly have parts on them such as strobes neons roof attachments, wind breakers, etc...... its pretty weird that im the only truck in the game that has strobe lights and all the million other trucks in my game that drive around are all vanilla bone stock no extras...... COME ON.... bring us to life already.
And for the last, it would be nice to see the fleet drivers you hire driving your trucks on the map, with little blimps, and when you come within a maybe 10 miles of them you will see them appear in game or something. This is possible, chances of all your fleet being on the same highway would be slim to none so it would never cause lag issues like ALL of you assume.

Your driver is a picture
You have no visible hands
You can never leave the cabin
You need to sleep, but not eat
Your company drivers are pictures
You can not put your company name on your trucks
And you never see your company trucks on the road
You can not hire who you like when you like, as the driver pool rotate
You can not buy what you want when you want, as it is level locked
All the trucks are old. Even the ""new"" trucks are NOS (new old stock)
You can not drive a rigid, dump, box car or pick up trucks
There are no exhaust smoke, visible damage or dirt
You ALWAYS get stopped at customs
The GPS is in dire need of updating
The economy is broken
Weight limits are broken
Physics are very broken
The AI is severely broken and the list goes on and on and on.

The game is in many ways a joke, but it does have some redeeming features, so the negativity is actually for the greedy developers that really are a joke and not the game itself.

The base game is as bare bones as possible so they can sell a DLC for every little thing, such as a flag in your window, a paint job, new tires, complete Steam achievements and of course a new map. 

ETS 2 have 4 complete and 2 partial countries out of the 44 that is Europe in the base game.
The rest is only available if you give them your credit card.
ATS only have 3 of the 50 states and every DLC for a state / country cost more than the game
It does not help that there are over 100 of them available for both games, and every time they get less content and worse quality.
Or when the Ukraine war started they heavily promoted the Ukrainian skin pack, and put the Heart of Russia DLC that was scheduled to come on indefinite hold.
It does not help that there are no real life brands in the game to avoid paying for copyrights, but there are real life advertisements, since SCS get paid to put them in either.
Or that every state / country are made from the same copy / pasted roads, buildings and scenery, rearranged to look more similar to what ever place they are making, with some newly made street signs and a couple of non copyrighted landmarks before they call it a day
Or that the most famous landmarks such as the Eiffel tower are missing.

""Those landmarks are not included by design. It was a hard decision, made as a result of due to discussing that case in details in past, especially while creating previous DLC Vive La France, where as you may notice, there is Eiffel Tower not included.
As the game includes ""Truck"" in the name, we made the decision, to show the city from truck driver perspective. Trucks are not allowed to enter city centers, and mentioned landmarks are neither super high nor located on the hills, to be visible from industrial areas. So that they are not visible in the game."" piotr  [developer] Posted: 6 Dec, 2017

If that is true, why is it only copyrighted landmarks that are not included ?

SCS is NOT a small indie company either as some like you to believe. 
They have 400 employees and had over 50 million USD in assets and 13 million USD in net income in 2019.
They are just another greedy company that even EA would be proud of.


However 

Even though it is not a simulator, you can drive for hours upon hours without interruptions.
That part is absolutely superb.
It also serves as a good base for mods, and there are a lot of insanely talented mod makers out there making it a great driving game instead of some mediocre money grabbing machine.

So if you want a American Truck Driving game with events and fun and keeps you wanting come back this is definitely the game you should get you won't have any regrets about it.

I would score this 98/100

Only issues I've experienced is the shifting. When using manual it seems to never work right.

Also the 'red light' violation is very inconsistent. I can come to a complete stop and turn right on red 75% of the time but that other 25% of the time is frustrating. Lastly the 'collision penalty' infuriates me when its cause by the A.I..

 You can buy garages, upgrade them to accommodate more trucks, buy trucks and trailers, hire drivers. Rinse and repeat. Sooner or later, during or after each trip you take, you'll be banking so much $$$ you can buy/upgrade a garage or two, fill it it with brand new trucks and trailers, hire the drivers, and still have money to burn. 
 Then came the mods:
There are a sh*t ton of mods in the workshop, ranging from paint jobs to engines, transmissions, sounds, weather, and even realism mods. Yes, there are xp and $$$ mods as well.
 The bad/ downside: (I do understand they need to make money,but...)
They will nickle and dime you for just about everything. So it's best to wait for when there is a steam sale before picking up the desired dlc's. Sales happen often, so make sure you check out the bundled options on the sale page. 
 I also wish they would come out with a map pack that had multiple new states, instead of just one at a time. Such as a midwest map pack, east coast, the 'south'. Based off the size of the states on the upper east coast, I can see them releasing multiple states as one pack in this situation.

Right now most of events require you to visit unique city in one of the states for each of your deliveries. And if you like me, dropping into the game once in a month or so just to relax a bit, you probably wont be able to complete those stupid events because there is NO IN-GAME WAY TO track the cities you already delivered to.  

""Akchually, tfere is a wfay, kjust withit khe web-site""-

What website? Am I playing a browser game or what? Are you going to force me to use external resource to track my progress? Those events are happening in ATS, a game that you launch from Steam, I couldnt be bothered to pull up a browser because of dev's unwillingless to make an in-game tracker of some sort. 

But okay, maybe im bit lazy, maybe I just eat it up and track my progress by looking at the log on my WoT profile...

It only shows last 25 contracts you completed. Thats it. 

Go pull up a notepad or something, ctrl f the cities you already completed and cross them off the list.

Whats that? You are not playing English version and you cant recognise names of the citries at a glance? You dont even know what cities belongs to each state because WoT doesnt show it for some reason? What are you, not living in US or something, why you are even playing AMERICAN simulator?

And another thing - since later states are pretty small I found myself in pretty stupid situation where most of the cities are marked as visited since I drive trought towns anyway. I have no way to track my progress via WoT because it only shows several last deliveries which are flooded with christmas contracts and just random deliveres I decided to do. This leaves me with no way to finish said event in time because Ill need to check EACH INDIVIDUAL CITY IN KANSAS by delivering a cargo from it and seeing if the game recongised it as unique delivery or not. Thats such disrespect for player's time that Im not ever going to be bothered to complete any events until some sort of tracking is implemented.

Supposedly, it is always the first sentence that matters if you manage to get the reader interested and if they read the review. I hope I succeeded, because I didn't make up my love for this game for myself at all.

I've been getting together to write this review for a very, very, very, very long time. There are so many things I want to write here that I don't know if I can do it. It will probably be very chaotic, but what the heck.

If you are reading this review, then:
1) You love ATS as much as I do and as much as thousands of other people do, and you want to read what others have to say about it;
2) You are thinking about buying this game, but don't know if it's worth it;
3) You want to know how ATS compares to ETS and what the differences are;
4) You just want to read reviews.
And I will be happy to try to address all points here! :-)

Everyone who is at least a little bit in the world of simulators and who has at least once interacted with Euro Truck Simulator 2 or heard of SCS has probably heard of ATS. It is the little brother of ETS. Younger and... better (this is important: in my opinion).

The game allows us to take on the role of a truck driver and tour American states. As a driver, we perform orders and earn money. After earning enough cash, we have the opportunity to buy our truck, spruce it up in our own way, hire workers and perform more orders.
But what, in my opinion, makes the game so very special? CLIMATE! A climate that even pours out of the monitor screen.
Driving along the European routes in Euro Truck Simulator 2, I felt a sense of weariness and boredom as the twentieth minute passed and I drove along the same highway and looked at the same sights for twenty minutes only to enter one of the European cities, which, however, did not resemble a city, as it was a maximum of three cross streets and a few buildings.
You can feel the progress in ATS. You can feel that it is a new game. You can feel that SCS has put a lot of effort into this game. You can feel that the developers wanted changes and those changes were delivered to us.
There is no question of getting tired of the views.A great influence is the fact that the states are compared to any country in ETS 2.So once we drive through deserts, go downhill, pass villages, then enter a forest, drive out across the ocean to enter a city (and by ""cities"" I mean a big, impressive city - colorful, full of banners, exits, streets, stores, buildings and cars) - zero time for boredom and weariness! Outside the cities, too, are full of scattered details and tidbits. The maps are not empty, they are not monotonous.


The game premiered on February 2, 2016 and did not have an easy start or an easy life. At the very beginning we received only two states. After some time, another one was added. In addition, the blackness was poured over by the fact that the map was very small. It was only after about a year that it was scaled up and got bigger. However, these stumbling blocks and shortcomings were necessary to get down to patching the game as soon as possible. And it has succeeded!.

As of today, the game offers 13 states California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Montana,Wyoming, Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. Another Nebraska, Arkansas,Missouri will be added
In the couple of years since its release, the game has received a lot of content, SCS Software has grown, and work on the game has accelerated.

ATS also beats ETS in the fact that it is fresher. Euro Truck Simulator 2 came out in 2012 and has a lot of places on the map that have been untouched, outdated, even ugly since then. ATS has no such places. There is nothing to improve in it. As I mentioned earlier, the maps are full of details. They are beautiful. And incredibly atmospheric!

The game also uses an improved proprietary SCS engine. This means that it is prettier and richer in detail than its European brother. What also follows is improved performance.

So much for the technicalities and differences between the two games.
If you are looking for a game where you can relax, forget about your problems or just calm down - this is the perfect title! Just choose an assignment, sit back and enjoy the views. You can drive in silence or turn on your favorite music and drive, drive, drive along the sunset.

You can also turn on one of the radio stations. For example, the one created by the community. The community is one of the greatest features of both games. In addition to the radio stations, the community watches over the modification of the multiplayer and the expansion of the maps. Unlike many, many games the community is really great and not to join us is a shame! :-)

ATS is my favorite game. It allows me to relax, calm down, feel like I'm in America, catch a glimpse of the culture, the sights, feel that vibe.

And this is just the beginning of the adventure! SCS has plans to complete the map with all states. Can't wait for that moment! :-) So if you've been wondering if it's worth it to start playing after such a long time, the answer is probably one:Yes! The real adventure is just beginning!

For gam I recommend a steering wheel. Logitech/29/g920. Impressions and sensations unearthly.also you can play. Keyboard + mouse 

The review should also end with something. Personally, I do not play multiplayer, but if you would like to have a friend with whom you can talk about the game, the next states that will appear in the game, share impressions, share a screen shot, loosely talk or just ask about the game itself - send me an invitation. I'll accept anyone!

I hope my review has convinced you that it's worth giving this game a chance and falling in love with it, getting behind the wheel of an American truck, accepting an assignment and setting off into the unknown. The beautiful unknown. And discover the yet undiscovered.",1627762475,1706798958,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

And I have read though all the other reviews of it crashing things not working ect. well here is the bottom line the game engine they use is complete and utter trash and nothing they do to ""Improve"" it  will ever make any better . what they should do is scrape  prism3D and move , transfer the game over to a good game engine like unreal engine 5 or unity  that would be a massive improvement to start with and then start with making it truly real to life if they want to call this a simulation . I have played this for around 2 to 2 and half years and I completely agree with the complainants and negative reviews this has been given .I have experienced al the same issues 
I can not recommend this game because of the above as soon as the devs ever decide to actually change to a real game engine instead of a sorry excuse for a game engine and really make what they are saying it a ""simulator"" they this review will stay this way . if they fix the above mentioned I will edit my review.",1706403651,1706404385,False,0,0,0.458333343267440796,0,True,False,False

Although I did it because the majority of my traffic offenses were due to bad AI drivers slamming into the back of me or not yielding at on ramps and causing collisions, so look out for that.",1706291264,1706291264,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

When there's one day here, and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind

Where the brave are free and lovers soar

To break down the garden gate

From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights

Developed by SCS Software, the game offers a highly realistic driving experience with attention to detail in truck design and road environments.

Players begin their journey as truckers, starting with a basic truck and gradually building their empire by completing deliveries, earning money, and upgrading their vehicles. The game's attention to realism extends to its road network, weather conditions, and day-night cycles, providing a true-to-life experience.

One of the standout features is the meticulously recreated landscapes, including iconic American landmarks and cities. The game's graphics contribute to the immersive atmosphere, enhancing the sense of exploration as players traverse diverse terrains.

The variety of cargo and the dynamic economy add depth to the gameplay, offering challenges and opportunities for strategic decision-making. Moreover, the inclusion of a multiplayer mode allows players to connect with friends or fellow truckers in a cooperative online environment.

American Truck Simulator strikes a balance between realism and entertainment, making it a must-play for simulation enthusiasts and those seeking a unique journey across the vast landscapes of the United States.",1700943121,1705957930,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[quote=TLDR]Haul lumber through dusty backroads, dodge scales like a coyote in chicken coop, and squeeze every penny from those fuel-gobblin' hogs. Earn your stripes and watch your bank account swell like a busted dam. Soon you'll be rollin' in a monster rig, a palace on wheels with more pizzazz than a Vegas showgirl. Customise that beast like a tattoo parlor, make it purr like a kitten, and watch other truckers gawk as you rumble past.[/quote]

American Truck Simulator (ATS), from the masterminds at SCS Software, is more than just a driving game; it's an immersive odyssey across the majestic American highways, where you wield the reins of an 18-wheeled behemoth. From the sun-kissed shores of California to the endless plains of Kansas, ATS lets you live the trucker's dream behind the wheel of iconic American rigs like Peterbilt, Kenworth, and Mack.

Compared to its European counterpart, Euro Truck Simulator 2, ATS boasts a more laid-back vibe. It's all about savouring the scenery and the rhythmic rumble of your engine as you conquer mile after mile of asphalt. ATS specialises in epic journeys, where you haul diverse cargo across vast stretches of the American landscape. Buckle up for cross-country treks that test your endurance and reward you with breathtaking vistas.

[b]Gameplay and Mechanics[/b]

You kick off with just a basic truck, and each delivery is a step towards your big dream. It's not just about steering a truck from point A to B; it's about nurturing your very own business from the ground up. Every successful job means more cash in your pocket, paving the way for upgrades, new trucks, and eventually, a fleet under your command.

But what really sets this game apart is its devotion to realism. Driving isn't just pressing buttons; it's about feeling the road. Each truck has its own personality, its handling quirks. The weight of your cargo isn't just a number – it's a tangible presence that affects how you drive. It's about getting the hang of shifting gears like a pro, mastering the art of air brakes, and handling every twist and turn with finesse.

The control setup is pretty flexible. Whether you're a casual gamer using a keyboard and mouse, or a true enthusiast with a steering wheel and pedal rig, the game adapts to your style. And if you're into head-tracking for that extra bit of realism, the game’s got you covered. Using an Xbox controller combined with a webcam for head-tracking? That's a neat and cheap setup that strikes a balance between casual and immersive gameplay.

And then there's the business management side of things. It's like playing two games in one. On one hand, you're the driver, and on the other, you're the boss. Taking out loans, buying trucks, hiring drivers – it's a slow but satisfying journey to becoming a tycoon of the trucking world. The economic aspect is not just tacked on; it's a well-thought-out system that mirrors the gradual climb from a lone driver to a business magnate. It's a game that rewards patience, strategy, and a love for the open road.

[b]Graphics and Sound[/b]

American Truck Simulator really is a love letter to the open road. It's like they've taken the essence of the American landscape and packed it into your screen. As you drive through the game, it's the little things that catch your eye – the way a city skyline looks at dusk, how a landmark is just perfectly placed. It's all about the details here, and they've nailed it.

Sure, it might not be flexing the latest, cutting-edge graphics, but honestly, it doesn't need to. It's more about how the game feels. The landscapes and cityscapes have this authentic vibe that pulls you in. Even though you might spot a rough edge here and there, or a spot that's not as polished, it's easy to overlook because the overall experience is so engaging.

And then there's the weather. It's not just eye candy. When the rain starts pouring down or the fog rolls in, you feel it. It changes how you drive, adds a layer of challenge, and cranks up the realism a notch.

Each truck has its own distinct engine growl that changes with the engine type, what you're hauling, and even the way you're driving. It's those ambient sounds – the whoosh of the wind or the patter of rain– that really round out the experience. And if you're into mods, you can amp up these sounds even more. They've thought of everything to make you feel like you're right there, in the driver's seat, cruising down an American highway.

[b]Customisation[/b]

Customising your truck in this game isn't just a feature, it's an art form. It's like your truck is a blank canvas, and you're the artist. You can get really nitty-gritty with it, fine-tuning everything from the engine right down to the paint job. It's all about expressing yourself, showing off your unique style as you hit the road.

Picture this: you're scrolling through a rainbow of colours and designs, picking out that perfect look. You've got everything from classic solid colours to flashy metallic finishes, and some designs that are straight out of a trucker's dream. And it's not just about the exterior. Inside the cab, you can deck it out with your favourite gadgets, maybe hang a couple of cool trinkets, or set up a laptop for those long hauls.

Lighting? Oh, it's a game-changer. Throw on some LED strips or powerful spotlights on the roof, and your truck becomes this majestic beast gliding through the night. And headlights aren't just for show – they're practical too, helping you cut through foggy mornings or heavy rain.

Under the hood, it gets even more exciting. Boost your engine for speed, better handling of heavy loads, or just to save on fuel. Tweak the transmission for different terrains, finding that sweet spot between power and efficiency. And the chassis? That's where you fine-tune your truck's agility and stability, making sure it's fit for whatever cargo you're hauling.

And we're not done yet. Wheels, tires, hubcaps, exhausts, grills, light bars... the list goes on. Whether you're going for rugged, sleek, or downright flashy, there's something for every taste. It's not just a truck; it's your personal statement on wheels.

[b]Content and Modding[/b]

The modding scene really brings this game to life, and with Steam Workshop in the mix, it's like a never-ending treasure trove of cool stuff. Imagine being able to tweak and twist your gameplay with thousands of mods – it's like giving your game a personal touch with new maps, trucks, addons and more.

The devs are also continually rolling out DLCs that keep things fresh. Every DLC drop is like a mini celebration, bringing in new areas to explore, different types of cargo and trailers, and even snazzy paint jobs for your rig. The expansion packs are more than just extra miles to cover; they bring in little slices of the real world, like the local traffic rules, different road types, architecture, and even a certain space port in Texas. It's all about making you feel like you're really there.

What's cool is that the base map isn't left behind – it gets its own facelifts, keeping up with the new shiny stuff. And the older DLCs? They're getting makeovers too, so they're just as awesome as the new ones. The game keeps evolving, so keep your eyes peeled for the latest updates and new areas to explore. It's all part of making your virtual trucking world richer and more immersive.

[b]Overall[/b]

ATS really hits the sweet spot for a wide range of players. It's like a chameleon in the gaming world – it can be this chill, almost zen-like experience where you're just cruising through breathtaking landscapes, soaking in the sights of American countryside and cities. For players who just want to unwind and take a leisurely drive across scenic routes, ATS is a perfect escape.",1695269160,1705123900,True,5,0,0.543859660625457764,0,True,False,False

General Aviation allows up to 4 Medical Exceptions if you demonstrate you can control an aircraft.

  There are scenic views (not great graphics but alright) like you would expect, but it seems like so many little things pop up to just stress you out it's kind of ridiculous.  Like the re-routing.  I have no idea who programmed that but I could think of a lot of things I'd like to say about them.  If you don't constantly watch the map even when there aren't supposed to be any deviations in your course then it will likely decide to randomly re-route you.  We're not talking google maps where it will generally find a somewhat reasonable alternative route.  We're talking being re-routed around the entire state in a circle and you going far down that road before you realize.  Literally adding 3-4x the length to your journey.  Then you get frustrated, make some mistakes, take damage you can't fix (trailer damage is unfixable) so they'd have you doing 45mph in a loop around the entire state of Nevada.

Single player is great, the game is relaxing and aesthetically pleasing I did like the in game music but inevitably switched to Spotify to listen to my music. I started out playing with Mouse and Keyboard (hated it). I Have a PS5 so I decided to use my PS5 controller, I myself tweaked the settings just slightly on sensitivity but overall out of the gate the settings were near perfect. After a little playing around on single player I added some mods to see what has come around. I myself like the most realistic settings possible and the Mods didn't disappoint. Not only a real feel cabin suspension wise but an overhaul to the graphics and the economy really change the game. At this point I decided to make a ""Hard"" Profile and an online ""no mods"" Profile. If you want to use Mods I suggest making 2 profiles

Online is great of course you have kids and people who just want to go as fast as possible into you and the wall but overall after hosting my own session I have been able to do thousands of miles in Convoys with other players. My only suggestions for anyone hosting, manage your server well or the high Latency people will inevitably cause Lag and you to hit a truck that was 300ft in front them under you. Overall the online stability I think needs a little more improvement as I found Myself keeping Latency for my server under 60 for the best results with a max of 7 people. Overall for Online its great and allot of middle aged crowd is nice.

DLC's/Game Layout. I do have a complaint, although it may be more realistic that certain cargo ships for more money per mile than others some of the ""cool"" or crazy cargo is low paying for transportation and kinda diverts your attention to what pays best for the first 100 or so hours of game play. My suggestion would be a little bit of a change once in a while in cargo types and looks having different Per mile gains to keep the interest in taking different types of loads and not just what pays best.

My Absolute biggest wish is for more trucks to be added or more customization for my personal preference Freightliner.

The Game feels pretty much the same as Eurotruck simulator for the most part. My one qualm with this game that I still have from my initial run is that some of the parking spaces are absolutely absurd. This was something I hated and made a point of in my first review and this has not be fixed. there are some parking spots in places that are so awful it's near impossible to park and for that i'm docking this 2 points. That being said the rest of the game plays well and it's equally as good as Eurotruck sim. One other small thing that I personally dislike is the very boxy hoods on the Freightliner trucks. They stick out too far and obstruct too much of the view. However that's just the style of the truck that I'm hating on. I will save that hate for my review of Freightliner trucks. JK. 

Review: 8/10 The game is good but some of the trailer parking spots are in tight spaces, so tight it's near impossible to park in them with an enormous truck. ",1534220349,1704618021,False,0,3,0.400251001119613647,0,True,False,False

Beyond the graphics the simulation ends. It is just another sh**y video game. Full of tricks, deceptions, lies and illusion. This was the easy thing to do,. They didn't put much effort into research to make the game a realistic trucking experience, with real word trucking headaches.
But it is a fun game, as you can see, I have been playing it for many hours. This is my first review of it. I curse it, I love it, I hate it, I love it.

7/25/23 I haven't played this game much lately. I have all the garages, trucks and drivers. All the states. I don't like OTR driving that much, but I did it enough to make millions and millions of dollars.
So what now? I have nothing to spend my money on. I took a vacation, if you will, and let my drivers make me rich, while I drove around and found the rest of the recruitment agencies.

I hated night time driving, they made it really hard at first, but it seemed to get easier as time went on. Don't know why.

12/15/23 I now have Kansas and Oklahoma, I'll buy the garages, I like to stop and fuel and sleep in my garages, but not the trucks. I have lots of male drivers and all the female drivers. Not going to buy more trucks till they get more female drivers. I am a guy, I'm just partial to women. I have discovered all the recruitment agencies, no women available.
I have over 500 million $, nothing to spend it on.

1/6/24 I have all this money. It would be nice if I could buy the ""Truck Works"" garages. Maybe get a truck dealership franchise, that would be cool. Buy or build a string of truck stops.",1684520647,1704567570,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

The routes are obviously very condensed but hit key points within the respective states. Lots of trucks,trailers, and different load outs! There are several frustrating parts of the game that hopefully SCS can fix. The AI traffic literally almost stops when merging on or off the highway or making turns. When the highways reduce from two lanes to one the traffic comes to a screeching halt. When there is highway construction, or highway incidents the traffic stops. The AI traffic needs work and needs to be smoother. The next complaint is the traffic lights, a gamer literally spends more time at empty stop light intersections than one does going down the road.

The game would be perfect if you could turn as fast as you want, but to do that you would have to change your driving settings everytime you go from city to highway driving. Im not going to set my settings everytime, so you set them in the middle and suffer lack of turning speed is both city and highway turning. It makes it hard to drive fast illegally.

Released by SCS Software, ATS offers a realistic and immersive trucking experience. Here's a breakdown of the game's strengths and weaknesses:

The Good:

1. Realistic Driving Experience:
   ATS excels in delivering a lifelike driving experience. The attention to detail in truck mechanics, road layouts, and traffic behavior contributes to an immersive simulation that feels authentic.

2. Stunning Visuals:
   The game boasts impressive graphics, showcasing the beauty of America's landscapes. From the sunsets over the Nevada desert to the rain-soaked roads in Washington, ATS captures the essence of each region with stunning visuals.

3. Expansive Map:
   The game features a vast map, with additional DLCs expanding the virtual representation of the United States. This extensive road network provides players with countless hours of exploration and varied routes for transporting goods.

4. Realistic Economy System:
   ATS incorporates a detailed economic system where players manage their own trucking business. From purchasing and upgrading trucks to hiring drivers, the game offers a comprehensive business simulation that adds depth to the overall experience.

5. Modding Community:
   The active modding community enhances the game by introducing new trucks, trailers, and map expansions. This not only extends the lifespan of ATS but also provides players with an array of customization options.

The Bad:

1. Limited Variety in Missions:
   Despite the realism in driving, the missions can become repetitive over time. The tasks mainly revolve around delivering goods from one point to another, lacking the variety seen in other simulation games.

2. AI Traffic Behavior:
   The behavior of AI-controlled vehicles can be erratic at times. Unpredictable movements and occasional traffic jams can break the immersion and result in frustrating situations for players.

3. Resource Intensive:
   ATS demands a relatively powerful PC to run smoothly, and players with lower-end systems may face performance issues. Optimization could be improved to cater to a wider audience.

4. Limited Multiplayer Features:
   While ATS introduced a multiplayer mode, its features are somewhat limited compared to its single-player counterpart. More robust multiplayer options could enhance the social aspect of trucking across America.

Conclusion:

Alright, buckle up, you magnificent road warriors, 'cause American Truck Simulator is here to turn your mundane commute into a trucking extravaganza that's more addictive than grandma's secret cookie stash. Strap in tight, 'cause we're about to roll through the highways of hilarity!

First things first, this game is like therapy for your inner trucker, without the overpriced couch. The attention to detail is so spot-on that I half expected a virtual CB radio to start crackling with trucker lingo and a GPS to nag me about missing the exit. I've never had so much joy navigating a digital vehicle through the virtual streets of America – and I've played Mario Kart on a banana peel.

The sheer joy of cruising down endless roads, watching the sunrise over the Rockies, and trying not to knock over every mailbox in sight is enough to make even the most hardcore gamers reconsider their life choices. The realism is mind-blowing, and I never thought I'd say this, but maneuvering an 18-wheeler through tight spaces is oddly satisfying – like threading a needle with a sledgehammer. American Truck Simulator has turned me into a virtual trucking legend, and I haven't even scratched the surface of the DLCs yet. Just remember, folks, this game is more addictive than caffeine and way better for your heart than a triple-shot espresso. Get ready to roll, laugh, and maybe curse a bit when you realize you've taken the wrong exit for the umpteenth time – but hey, that's just part of the chaotic charm. Happy truckin'! 🚚💨",1704352412,1704352412,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Don’t expect a 1:1 US highway rendition, it is a cleverly designed and compressed map of virtual major highways, cities and notable landmarks in an ever expanding DLC statewide expansion. On the surface it sounds incredibly boring, sitting in a drivers cab travelling from Point A to Point B, literally for hours delivering cargo for a your virtual trucking company. 

But from my perspective, the satisfaction is with the exploration of a uniquely created vast map. Some of the longer Point A to Point B routes can easily take an hour of your time.

Throw in some of the built in Internet radio streams and the time just melts away. The day and night cycles create some absolutely captivating dusk and dawn scenes. The environmental and skybox color palette is spot on, whether it’s the lonely deserts of the south west or the busy north western pacific region. The built in photo studio helps capture any mesmerizing moments you encounter whilst on your virtual cargo delivery journeys.

Let’s talk about the trade-offs. The cities are cleverly designed to give the impression they are bigger than they actually are. It’s deliberate, like a movie set with landmark and building props. Likewise with some of the blocked roads, they are deliberately created to create the impression of a larger world. 

I’ve traveled many of the highways and visited the places outlined in ATS, the developers have made a tremendous effort to capture the atmosphere, culture and industries of the different locations with their models and assets. 

Given the sheer scale of the map, one would expect some copy and paste. Honestly though, subconsciously whilst driving you rarely see it, almost everything appears unique in the ATS world. I can’t judge the accuracy of the trucks, since I don’t have daily exposure to them. However, the artistic assets for road markings, signage, locations, lighting gantries, barriers and vehicles are spot on for each state. I’ve dabbled in gaming asset development, I can tell a tremendous amount of hard work has gone into getting it feeling right and working right. Example, alleviating distant scenery pop-up etc. by using other closer visual assets to obscure distant transition or the curvature of the road obscuring localized scenery pop-up.   
SCS Software has created a very impressive piece of PC gaming software that highlights unique artistic creativity, landmark/route trade-offs and a jigsaw mentality in trying to seamlessly bring it all together as you traverse each of the currently available US states with their DLC. 

Give it a try, stick with it, you won’t be disappointed.",1704166584,1704166584,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They are practically the same game though, the only real difference is the landscape and available trucks. Gameplay loop between the two is identical. 

Anyway, it is a game about driving trucks, and managing your trucking company. If it were only one of those things then it wouldn't be as fun.
I get satisfaction from managing a trucking business, this passively makes money in the background. You hire drivers and buy trucks which go around the country making you money.
I then get even more satisifaction from actually just driving the truck around. It is very relaxing, and really exactly what you would expect. This is the main gameplay loop. You take a transport job in a town that will send you to another town. As you progress, the types of goods you transport change, the distance increases, and you make more money. Starting out you just move smalls trailers short distances, which will probably only take you a few minutes in real life. Eventually you will be hauling massive heavy trailers very long distances which can take well up to an hour or more in real time.  

If you don't enjoy taking road trips, or don't get any enjoyment from being on a highway, then you won't like this game. It is an expensive game too, with the mass amounts of DLC now available.",1704102737,1704102737,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game isn't just a simulator; it's a rollercoaster ride in a 40-ton steel behemoth. You see, it's not every day you get to commandeer those mammoth trucks you play leapfrog with on the highway (a friendly wave here, a less-than-friendly honk there - trucker life, am I right?).

Now, I've had my stint with European Truck Simulator, and it was a hoot, but American Truck Simulator hits closer to home. It's like a love letter to those iconic Big Rigs. Sadly, my little hometown didn't make the cut into the game. I guess we're just a blip on the map - too small for even the virtual world!

And oh, the truck weighing stations! As a regular Joe in a sedan, I've always wondered what mystical rituals transpire in those roadside temples. Spoiler alert: they just weigh trucks. Who knew?

But let's talk DLCs. If DLCs were a train, this one would stretch all the way to the Australian outback. They've got a DLC for every state. I mean, c'mon, at this rate, I'd need to grow extra fingers on my feet to count them all. It's like they're saying, ""Why bundle states when we can sell them one by one?"" Sure, it's cool to virtually visit your hometown or your favorite vacay spot, but my wallet's giving me the stink eye.

Don't get me wrong, you don't need all the DLCs to enjoy the game. But if you're a collector, brace yourself. Your piggy bank might start giving you the silent treatment.

In summary, American Truck Simulator is a delightful escapade into the world of trucking. It's where rubber meets the road, and your living room turns into the cab of a Peterbilt or Kenworth. Just be ready to navigate the labyrinth of DLCs - or not. Your call, trucker!",1696732851,1704091794,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Now you can, with this game. You start out just doing quick one off jobs and try to earn enough cash to get a loan and get your first rig. And then you keep running jobs on the market to upgrade that truck, or trade it in and get an even better one. Then you buy more garages so you can have even more trucks, and hire drivers to earn your trucking company even more cash. You can get sucked in for hours on hours on hours doing all of this.

The base game came with California and Nevada? And Arizona was free. The other states are DLC but all are so well done. The older states they have released will usually go on sale from 50-75% off when they run sales, and if you just get them to do the acheivement to just visit each city in every state, youll easily get your money's worth. 

This is a great game developer, so I would highly suggest this game. They have been constantly working on this and Euro Truck 2 for over a decade.

Now looks even better on ultrawide display with TrackIR and farming sim wheel and pedals.

[b]TrackIR: [/b]Once you dial in smoothness and speed in TrackIR, and adjust driver position in ATS with F4, the experience is very good. 

[b]My track IR settings:[/b]
* Speed: 3.5
* Smooth: 27
* Motion Adjustment Template: OneOne

[b]Farming sim wheel and pedals[/b]
These are not high quality, but do the job well. Because we can reduce the sensitivity of the brakes in the ATS settings, it's possible to get ""squishy"" brakes even out of these cheap pedals. Same with gas pedal. I set it so the brakes feel slightly sluggish and the gas nice and loose to avoid twitchy acceleration. The pedals feel more realistic after making these adjustments. 

[h3]Wishlist[/h3] 

* Different machinery to operate on-site after delivery.  Cranes, forklifts, control panels, something not difficult but fun. 
* Increased scale would be nice, maybe even 1:1 similar to MS flight sim. 
* A fully open world instead of those barriers, so perhaps procedural generated to increase areas to travel.  I prefer more realistic, bigger distances and time scales. Real time, with option to speed up and skip ahead.",1509816053,1703764558,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

""At the terminal(ok I made it there and understand that), once you have selected your desired parking spot(how do I do that?) you may choose an easier alternate spot(ok but like how do I do that turtorial?)  If you get into any trouble,(so far the only trouble I've had is the tutorial itself) you may choose to complete the delivery automatically.(Great suggestion.  You know what'd be better? IF YOU TOLD ME HOW TO DO THAT INSTEAD.)

A rectangular area will be highlighted(I'm assuming that is the bouncing trailer symbol that doesn't do anything when you park your trailer in it) and marked in the route advisor(random golf flag far off from where it actually wants you to go) as the place to park the trailer.(doesn't do anything unless it is your truck cab.  Not the trailer)  When the trailer is properly positioned,(wtf does that even mean?) a message will appear asking you to detach it.(Had the trailer fully covering the trailer icon.  Did absolutely nothing until I had the truck cab parked on the trailer icon.)""


I bought this game due to the great reviews and watching some limited amount of streamed content on Steam here.  Having played through the tutorial which was worthless and a few jobs I couldn't recommend this game.  There are really good parts marred by horrendously done nuances with no purpose other than to infuriate the player.  The GPS is worse than when GPS was first introduced on phones.  I can never tell where it or when it wants me to turn.  I've always wondered how people drive off a cliff following GPS but if it was the GPS from American Truck Simulator it now makes complete sense.

The visuals are really good.  Great work there.  

Sound fits the theme and is good for what it does.

Driving is laughably bad.  You know those racing games where you can do 200 miles per hour and stay perfectly in the lines?  This system is so poorly designed doing 60 on the freeway and I'm a diagonal box covering my lane on any minor curve.  Really?  You can't even make a driving system that can manage the lines at 60 miles per hour?

Getting the jobs felt like a good system.  Then you have to use the GPS to get to the locations and that is a nightmare.

It seems like there is a bunch of good content up ahead but I don't know if I can stomach how bad accessing it is because of these other really bad systems.  Like white grids on gray asphalt to drop the trailer during a bright day.  Is that really easy to see?  That's the best you could come up with?  Really?

Lastly, I was also excited to play with family.  Bought 3 copies.  This may or may not be ATS fault.  It could be Steam. I am not sure.  We have played plenty of other games together but the entire time I was connecting and disconnecting from the convoy.  We never got through a proper game together.  I had to play solo.  We all play in the same house and the other 2 were just fine playing with each other.  So, again, this last part I have no idea why the convoy experience was bad in my singular case.  Take that for what it is.",1703739261,1703739261,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

this game is incredible, although i cannot tell you if it is better than its European brother, I can highly recommend this game in general.

Firstly, this game is $19.99 dollars, which is an unbelievably reasonable price for a game where you get to experience the thrill of driving a truck. Secondly, the name ""American Truck Simulator"" is super original and an overall brilliant take on a Steam name game. Thirdly, the graphics are amazing and completely worth the price. Secondly, the sensitivity is perfect, and the settings are extremely easy to maneuver, which is great. Next, there's just enough action to keep you engaged without being overwhelming. Thirdly, the options of customization allow you to choose between two genders, male and female, providing a simple and clear experience. This game is inclusive and respectful of diverse identities. Inclusion has led to a more harmonious gaming community, and it is the root of all joy. Plus, this game has a stellar reputation for being very affordable, which I already mentioned. And let me start on the driving mechanics. Firstly, you don't need to get out of your car, which is a brilliant upside. Oh, and did I mention that the characters are perfectly diverse, allowing you to express yourself freely? Plus, why would you play this game in real life when you can enjoy simulated adventures without any real-life risks? This game is realistic and exciting, as you experience the thrill of driving in a vehicle. Whenever you turn your steering wheel, it responds smoothly, providing a realistic and satisfying driving experience. And when you get stuck, you can call a tow truck to assist you, making the game more realistic and immersive. Did I mention that it takes just the right amount of time to get to your destination for fake game money? It makes perfect sense why you would enjoy driving in this engaging game for hours rather than engaging in the stresses of real life. Also, when you park, it takes just the right amount of time to actually park the vehicle, providing a realistic and challenging experience. You just make it realistic to provide a greater level of immersion for players, which means the owners of this game are attentive to player experience and value. The time it takes is perfect, everything is amazing, and the progress you make is absolutely satisfying. It takes just the right amount of time to refill gas, and it takes a reasonable amount of money to pay for the damage that you have made, so when you finally finish enjoying 90 minutes of your life and get to the end of the task that you have finished, you feel accomplished and successful. This is society nowadays, creating games for enjoyment and entertainment, giving the player a rewarding experience in return. So the money you spent on this game basically makes you happy and provides a guarantee of satisfaction for your money. I love this game so much, as it offers an immersive experience and is overall a fantastic game to spend your money on.

American Truck Simulator is pure road trip joy! The graphics are stunning, capturing America's beauty perfectly. Each truck is detailed, and customization options are a blast. Driving feels real, with challenging physics and dynamic weather.

The game's economy and progression kept me hooked. Starting small and climbing up the trucking ladder is satisfying. The regular updates and a supportive community make it even better.

The overall art and presentation of the game world (roads, landscapes, cities, buildings, monuments, businesses, etc.) are phenomenal, rich in details, and wonderfully beautiful. The trucks are amazing, almost perfect. 
But technical problems multiply, demonstrating the inability of SCS programmers to promote the evolution of the game's graphics engine and system basic functions, such as loading, reloading and saving, to keep up with hardware evolution. 
Why mandate new system requirements if they don't make proper use of them? High-spec hardware like PCIe 5.0 M.2 NVMe SSDs, high-end processors like Ryzen 7 7800X3D, graphics cards like RTX 4090 and lots of available super-fast RAM, make no difference since the game core is over 10 years old and unable to handle them and all the new features introduced in recent years. 
The game continues to stutter no matter how much you lower its configuration resources trying to alleviate the problem. 
I think SCS should partner with some specialized programming consultancy company to find a solution, as it has proven incapable of doing, by itself, the hard technical work required to keep the game relevant in today's highly competitive market. 
As it stands now, I regret all the money I spent on this game and will no longer put a dime on it, unless a drastic positive attitude change happens.
If they want to squeeze more money out of us gamers to pay for the new SCS office building, for example, they will have to perform much better and keep us happy with state-of-the-art programming techniques. The Labor of Love award no longer justifies this delay.

The driving is both relaxing and enjoyable. Cruising the open road in a big rig and listening to your favorite tunes while taking in all the magnificent views never gets old.

There are multiple truck models to choose from including plenty of truck and trailer customization options with paint jobs and accessories galore. The DLC's are not necessary to enjoy the game, but I still recommend them. The level of detail in different terrains, flora, and landmarks from state to state is rather impressive.

The developers, SCS Software, are among the best in the business. Their dedication to this project and the love they pour into each update shines through with flying colors. They update the community on a regular basis with details about what is going on with future game development. I honestly can't say enough good things about SCS Software.

I've not played ATS with a keyboard and mouse, but I can say that it plays well with a controller and even better with a wheel and pedals. So, again, this is an easy thumbs up for me and if you do decide to buy ATS, I hope you enjoy your time on the open road as much as I have.

American Truck Simulator is a game that transcends the boundaries of conventional gaming experiences, offering players a unique and immersive journey into the heartland of the United States. As an ardent fan of simulation games, I found myself captivated by the unparalleled realism and attention to detail that make American Truck Simulator a true gem in the genre.

One of the standout features of the game is its meticulously crafted world, faithfully recreating the diverse landscapes of America. From the majestic mountains of Colorado to the sun-soaked highways of California, every inch of the virtual terrain is a testament to the developers' commitment to authenticity. The attention to detail is so meticulous that driving through the various states feels like embarking on a genuine cross-country road trip.

The realism extends beyond the visuals, with an impressive array of licensed trucks that handle with precision and nuance. Each truck feels unique, capturing the essence of their real-world counterparts. The level of customization available, from tweaking engine performance to fine-tuning the aesthetics of your rig, adds a layer of personalization that enhances the overall gaming experience.

American Truck Simulator's commitment to realism also extends to its dynamic weather system and day-night cycle. Navigating through a snowstorm in the northern states or witnessing a breathtaking sunset while cruising through the desert creates an immersive atmosphere that draws players deeper into the game world.

The game's economy system is another aspect that sets it apart. Managing a virtual trucking business requires strategic thinking and careful planning. Balancing fuel costs, maintenance expenses, and delivery deadlines adds a layer of complexity that elevates American Truck Simulator beyond a mere driving simulation.

Beyond the solo experience, the multiplayer mode adds a social dimension to the game, allowing players to convoy with friends or other virtual truckers. The cooperative aspect of delivering cargo together creates a sense of camaraderie, turning the virtual highways into a bustling community of trucking enthusiasts.

Furthermore, the developers have shown a remarkable commitment to ongoing improvement and expansion. Regular updates and the introduction of new states ensure that the game remains fresh, keeping players engaged with a continuous stream of content.

In conclusion, American Truck Simulator is a triumph in the simulation genre. Its unparalleled realism, attention to detail, and commitment to an evolving gaming experience make it a standout title. Whether you're a trucking aficionado or a gamer looking for a unique and immersive journey, American Truck Simulator delivers an unforgettable and enjoyable ride across the vast landscapes of the United States.",1703488728,1703488728,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The trucks are well-developed, each with their unique quirks and personalities, making it easy to connect with them on a personal level. Each state you drive through is breathtakingly heartfelt, contributing to a experience that effortlessly tugs at the heartstrings.

The gameplay is both engaging and accessible, striking a perfect balance between challenge and enjoyment.

The soundtrack is a standout feature, perfectly complementing the emotional highs and lows of the journey. From uplifting melodies during moments of joy to gentle tunes that accompany reflective scenes, the music enhances the emotional impact of the adventure.

American Truck Simulator is more than just a game; it's a celebration of love, friendship, and the intricacies of human connections. It's a rare gem that manages to strike a balance between perfect gameplay mechanics and heartfelt, lifelong desire to drive a truck, leaving players with a warm glow that lingers long after the long haul is complete.

I really do love just sitting down, turning on the radio, and having a 5 hour session. There is truly nothing like this game, it is just so peaceful. But I can't recommend this to everyone. I feel like some people will get bored of this very easily, and it wouldn't be worth the money they spent. On the other hand, this game is so relaxing, and it is so much fun to go trucking with your friends! The DLC's are my one complaint. You have to pay almost $100 (growing cost wise every day) to get the USA. Also, if you buy some states, but you don't own the surrounding ones, it is impossible to drive there. You have to fast-travel.
Also the other truck drivers don't honk back at you when you beep them :(
Overall, I would recommend this to people who enjoy long, relaxing drives, but I don't recommend this to everyone.

Everybody knows it is as big as a world, it's made with fantastic attention to detail and with the latest lighting engine it looks better than anything demanding barely half of your PC's hardware power even if you forget to upgrade it for the last 10 years. It has a lot of trucks, trailers and loads for them so you will never be bored.

What else?

Everybody knows it has bugged speed limit that is prone to jump up and down without any proper signage causing police to charge you while you are not guilty. You will also be charged for every crash the AI car makes and who cares it's not your fault as you are probably guilty for driving in this game at the first place. 

The local AI is a legend in itself still doing strange things despite being 10 years in development and keeping the well-earned title 'Artificial Idiot'. It knows nothing about traffic rules, it yields when it should go and attacks you when it should stand still. It drives on red and stays on green, it can completely block the traffic on a 6-lane highway just to let a single car to pull out of a gas station. It is written by people who don't drive and the reason why almost nobody complains is the majority of players doesn't have a real life driving experience too.

Trucks galore is an illusion as at least half of them are unusable because of awful sound. I'm not talking aestetics, the engine noise contains very loud and unpleasant low frequency leftovers just physically unbearable to listen. How could anyone be so unprofessional? What went wrong? Deaf sound engineer? Maybe. Cheap headphones? Who knows. It is made as it was made by some chap within the small SCS team and nobody will return to revise it. 

SCS is a group of amateurs happened to be in their own niche making their niche product as good as they can. The game has more problems than many other titles and would probably fail if only there was at least one more contender... But there are none.

So.

Verdict: American Truck Simulator is the best truck simulator at the moment. Number one out of... one.

P.S. There're no truck enthusiasts in SCS so if you are this type of person be prepared for the worse: incorrect badging, fictional options, missing parts and of course made-up chassis with unrealistic wheelbases. Trucks are just toys here.",1597140844,1703187083,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One of the things I love about the game is the stunning scenery. The landscapes are beautifully designed, whether you're driving through busy cities or peaceful countryside. It's like taking a virtual road trip across the American states!

Another cool thing is the variety of trucks you can choose from. You've got different makes and models, each with its own unique features and handling. And if you're into customising, you'll have a blast personalising your trucks with cool paint jobs and accessories.

Now, let's talk about a few things to consider. Some players find the game play a bit repetitive since it mainly involves driving from one point to another. And while the AI of other vehicles on the road is decent, it could be more challenging to keep things exciting.

Lastly, some players have reported performance issues like frame rate drops or long loading times. It's something to keep in mind, but it doesn't take away from the overall fun.

Overall, American Truck Simulator is a fantastic game for trucking enthusiasts. It's immersive, visually stunning, and offers a great selection of trucks to choose from. Just be aware of the repetitive game play, but hey, if you're up for the open road adventure, give it a shot!

 On sale - YES
Full Price - Maybe.  It depends on if you want the DLC or not.  At the time of this review, I paid around $54.00 USD for the game along with every single DLC off of steam.  This is the on-sale price currently. 

The music is 5/10 with the ability to add your own tracks, so, it's not much of an issue.  [You can even add your favorite real life radio stations too!]

Graphics is about a 8/10 -- I had some issues at first with the gauges being blurry as all hell, but switching to Dx11 & installing a graphical mod fixed this issue. 

Gameplay is 10/10 at least for me.  It's super relaxing and fun to drive your own truck from state to state.  I just wish we could use ""Real Life Timers"" to match where we are in the world to make it feel more realistic.

Optional notes:  I wish we could have a companion on the side-seat.  Thus far, I haven't figured out a way besides mods.  I wanna get a doggo to join me!


Overall: 7/10 - While I had some issues in the beginning, they were easily fixed with some technical knowledge and a whole-hell of a lot of google searching.  This game is mod-compatible as well as steam workshop compatible AND [while the option is in beta... Remember, it's in BETA] VR compatible.

It has amazing scenery, the trucks are awesome, and there's a really great third party development community that keeps putting out new content, along with what SCS does. I've been playing it now for a few years, and how SCS just seems to always keep updating the game with new features and content (some free, some paid), I think other game developers should take a page out of their book. It's the game that just keeps on giving. 

If I had to pick things that I would say still need improvement, it would be the default truck sounds. They just don't do it for me. Thankfully there are some great sound mods out there that fill that void, I just wish it was default. And of course, AI traffic, while it's gotten better, could still use some tweaks. 

The only other thing I'd say is I wish the trucks weren't so clean shiny all the time. This is a small gripe I know. But in real life, trucks aren't always clean and shiny. I wish there was a little more wear and tear. But that doesn't stop the game from being enjoyable. And finally, a wish-list item would be more diverse weather with seasons. Snow in the northern parts of the map during winter and such. That would really complete the game to me.

Well, I asked an old truck driver
About life out on the road
If he does a lotta singing
When he's bringing in his load
If there's a pretty waitress crying for him
Every hundred miles
If he gets a lotta loving
If he has a lot of smiles
And I asked him if those trucking songs
Tell about a life like his
He said, ""If you want to know the truth about it
Here's the way it is
All I do is drive, drive, drive
Try to stay alive
And keep my mind on my load
Keep my eye upon the road
I got nothin' in common with any man
Who's home every day at five
All I do is drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive""
Well, we shared a cup of coffee
Then I had to warm it up
And his greasy fingers trembled
As he held onto the cup
And I said, don't you hear a lot of music
See a lot of sights
But if you'll tune into the Grand Ole Opry
Saturday night
I will dedicate you a trucking song
To which you can relate
He said, ""You just do the singing
And I'll do the driving mate
All I do is drive, drive, drive
Try to stay alive
And keep my mind on my load
Keep my eye upon the road
I got nothin' in common with any man

ATS is installed on my laptop, which I only use at work. I play that because:

- I grew up watching Hollywood movies so North America is my favorite setting.

- Sometimes I get so much downtime that I don't have any lectures at all and my coworkers find me at my desk and love to yap about their day for hours on end. ATS keeps me company enough that I don't have to devote a lot of processing power to play it like I would, say Call of Duty or Battlefield, and I still get to just enjoy watching the scenery when I'm tired of their bullshit.

ETS2 is installed at my PC at home. I play that because:

- I grew up watching Hollywood movies so I know virtually nothing about Europe and it's cool to discover it.

- My family has this ritual that they love to do a conference call after work and talk my ear off about something or the other for hours on end. ETS2 keeps me company enough that I don't have to devote a lot of processing power to play it like I would, say Call of Duty or Battlefield, and I still get to just enjoy watching the scenery when I'm tired of hearing whatever they're mouthing off about which is usually something I'm not even interested in.

BUT! While both games are based off the exact same engines, there are some differences that I personally have noticed and that's mainly that ETS2's economy is more difficult than ATS':

- Garages cost more in ETS2 than in ATS

- Trucks cost more in ETS2 than in ATS

- Payouts are shittier with all DLCs in ETS2 than in ATS without any DLCs (with the all skills maxed out in both games)

- Vehicle insurances are a thing in ATS and for a small one time fee, you're covered for all damage for life whereas in ETS2, you break the bank everytime some dumbass scratches your truck

- Employees are more likely to turn up empty handed in ETS2 than in ATS

- Employees have negligible to negative income in ETS2 than in ATS

Up to now, I feel that the ATS does not do as well as ETS, and overall it is good, but I have to give a bad review for a reason. Please read the following questions carefully.
For example, the No. 4 camera , in some high trucks, has a problem of seeing through the cabin model. The No. 6 camera and the No. 7 camera have the problem of very small engine sound. Some places have slit, you can directly see through of the map (ETS also found such a problem but I forgot where), 
I don't know why this problem has not been solved yet... I think ETS is doing very well.
 Why did the ATS leaves so many flaws?

玩了很多年，一直在玩欧卡，美卡玩了一阵子放下了，最近又下载下来继续玩，和欧卡的模式一样，但风格略有不同，还是很好玩的，
到现在都觉得美卡没有欧卡做的细致，总体来说不错但是我要给差评是有原因的请仔细阅读如下问题

比如4号摄像机镜头到在某些卡车穿模，6号摄像机和7号摄像机发动机声音特别小，，某些地图有漏缝，直接可以看到地图外面，虽然只是细细的一小条，但是看出来是建模拼接没拼好（欧卡也发现了这么个问题但是忘了哪里），不知道为什么这样的问题到现在这个版本还没解决...我觉得欧卡做的很好，美卡为什么留下这么多遗憾？

The attention to detail in this game is incredible and it truly makes you feel like you are a real truck driver on the open road.

The graphics in American Truck Simulator are stunning. The landscapes and cities are beautifully rendered and really give you a sense of the vastness and diversity of the American highways. Driving through different states and seeing different landscapes is always a new and exciting experience.

The gameplay is also very realistic. From following traffic laws to maneuvering your truck through tight spaces, every aspect of driving a truck is accurately represented in the game. I also appreciate the variety of realistic truck brands and customization options available.

One of my favorite features of this game is the ability to listen to your own music while driving. This really adds to the immersive experience and makes long drives more enjoyable. I also love the radio stations in the game that play real songs and have entertaining DJs.

The map in the game is constantly expanding, with new states and routes being added through updates. This keeps the game fresh and exciting, with endless possibilities for exploring and delivering cargo.

My only minor complaint is that the game can be a bit repetitive at times. Driving long distances can become monotonous, but this is a minor issue compared to all the positive aspects of the game.

Overall, I highly recommend American Truck Simulator to anyone who enjoys simulation games or has an interest in truck driving. It is a well-crafted, realistic, and immersive experience that will keep you entertained for hours on end.",1702764966,1702764966,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The trucks are almost infinitely customizable, even with just the base items that the game gives you, never mind the extra goodies from the STEAM workshop and other places found on the world wide web thingy. And there are lots of trucks to choose from even in the base game, again not to mention the workshop mods. 

You can tailor your driving experience too, simulating everything from traffic offenses to needing to sleep, to how your truck handles. The choices are almost overwhelming, and many I have just left in default. Suspension stiffness, parking brakes, voice navigation are just a few of the many choices.

The base game gives you California, and the first two DLC's, Arizona and New Mexico, are free (i think, it's been a while...), and other states are added at a fairly regular clip, at a decent price too. It's not quite real time simulation, a game day will roll by in a couple hours at most. As far as I can tell, the game is set in summer, for I have yet to see snow or anything like that, but who knows, maybe that will get added. It does rain however, but you can set the percent chance in the game settings, from ""Drought"" to ""Where's my ark?""

I bought this game for exclusive use in VR and i love it despite the pretty major flaws.

The things i really wish they would fix/add:

- Aliasing is REALLY bad in this, Some edges of objects look like strobe lights it's so bad. There needs to be a way to reduce aliasing more than it currently does. No other VR game of this quality has this problem. something CAN be done and it would make this game 100 x better in VR.

- VR implementation is very bare bones. Game runs in VR but that's about it. Everything else is done outside VR. I'd love a way to just perform simple actions in vr like turning my vehicle off and filling up gas. Even if it's menu based. Something where i wont have to raise my headset.

Outside of this the game is so good! You can toss on a podcast and play for hours and hours without even noticing.  It's hyper immersive as well. Sometimes you just catch yourself being fully immersed, like wait - I forgot im playing a game...It makes you forget what time it is.",1697165212,1702427768,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Of course, some people will say ""Why on earth should I drive from A to B?"" or ""There are much more exciting games than this!"".

Well, that may well be the case.
But I have to say that the game has a calming effect, especially if you just want to relax.
Just enjoy the scenery, good music, nice rigs... and voilà, a perfect day. 

The game is constantly being worked on to make it even better.
There are many places worth seeing in the game, for example famous buildings and national parks, which have a high recognition value.
Those who live in the USA, or in the states available in the game, will be able to confirm this.

Admittedly, for some time now, I've been discovering new things...
For example, every now and then the truck is spawned into another trailer, which causes you to be catapulted to the moon (fortunately, the moon has been available since the last update).
Of course, it is also possible that aliens try to abduct you, or that the moon's gravity is so strong that you are lifted upwards.
Of course, it can also happen that trailers and parked vehicles are spawned into each other and then blasted into space.

Maybe the bug will be fixed one fine day, or maybe not...
We may never know...

So, if you're looking for a good game and want to sit back and relax a little...

Well, this is the perfect game for you.

All you do is drive truck, drop off trailer, get money, customize truck after. That's it. That's the entire gameplay loop.

Well, I asked an old truck driver
About life out on the road
If he does a lotta singing
When he's bringing in his load
If there's a pretty waitress crying for him
Every hundred miles
If he gets a lotta loving
If he has a lot of smiles
And I asked him if those trucking songs
Tell about a life like his
He said, ""If you want to know the truth about it
Here's the way it is
All I do is drive, drive, drive
Try to stay alive
And keep my mind on my load
Keep my eye upon the road
I got nothin' in common with any man
Who's home every day at five
All I do is drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive""
Well, we shared a cup of coffee
Then I had to warm it up
And his greasy fingers trembled
As he held onto the cup
And I said, don't you hear a lot of music
See a lot of sights
But if you'll tune into the Grand Ole Opry
Saturday night
I will dedicate you a trucking song
To which you can relate
He said, ""You just do the singing
And I'll do the driving mate
All I do is drive, drive, drive
Try to stay alive
And keep my mind on my load
Keep my eye upon the road
I got nothin' in common with any man
Who's home every day at five
All I do is drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive
If I can get the fuel

BUT there are some minuses:
 - it's a simulator, yap. Exactly truck simulator. Do you understand? There is nothing about modeling a real transportation company. Forget it, It is not tycoon. But if you would like to take a look (a very easy look) to the job of the truckers - you're welcome. You can even reduce default 'time zipping' to be possible feel what is it a real about. It's routine, Routine work. But, happily, by default (and you can even expand it) the game have 'time zipping' So you don't need to drive a week to go from one map corner to another. Same with salaries. I don't believe that this earnings are 'event' earings. It looks more like 'month earnings at this route'.
 - the second question: I did. I played the games of the team that created ATS and ETS. The core part of team created a great game 'Dalnoboyshiki'. That game was much more about fun, of course... But it had several advantages against ATS/ETS. The first one - is damage model. If you broke you lighst there is no lighs. Quite realistic, yeah? The same was for other systems. Now they provided an update that bringed part of it to the ATS. That's quite great! Yeah! BUT in that game you was able to see at the truck scheme which part is broken. In ATS and ETS it's, unfortunatelly, wasn't implemented. The damage icon is a 'progress bar', nothing more.
 - and last thing that make me feel 'buttheart': messages. ""You want to sleep"", ""You ...."". Why this messages overflow the f..... map? Oh, I know, I did something bad, or some important message. It's ok. BUT WHY I CANNOT SEE THE F*****NG MAP???? How should I follow route?????

Actually, it takes the cake for most genres overall, and that is saying something as there are and have been a lot of great games for all the consoles over the years.  

If you are thinking of buying it, think no more.  Do it already.  And buy (to support this awesome game) the DLC.  It is all worth it.  Plus, what else would you rather spend some money on... this or Fortnite?  Yea.  Thought so.

The seasonal events such as 2023's vampire World Of Trucks plushie was a fun communal event to contribute to with the rewards being able to be used in both ATS and ETS.

 Don't get me wrong, BUT like (the marriage) it's got some issues.. The fine and traffic violation system is completely Fu**ed (unlike a marriage with a bad person where there is NO fu**ed going on). 

You WILL get fined for doing nothing wrong (like a wife blaming you for something you didnt do). Got a car that some npc rams into you on a merging lane when your in front of him YOU get the FINE. 

You got a another car that SPEEDs up to get past you on a merging lane and suddenly stops in the middle and it get swiped by your trailer's end corner YOU get the FINE. (much like getting slapped) you see the light turned green 50 feet before you get to the intersection and you just go through cause you know green means go! you get a traffic violation for running a red light on green.. 

Or you are in a turning lane (or doing something for your wife cause TOLD you) to turn left you got your blinker on then your light turns green you start to make your left turn (or go when your wife tells you to go) and you are hit with a fine (or slap) telling you that you ran a red light when it was green and not even yellow AGAIN your fault for following the rules of a wife (or a out of control fines system) don't see much difference between the 2) who wants nothing more than to make your life hard with no logic and (ESPECIALLY no REASONING) to it at all.

So you're sleepy and you're 10 miles from the drop off point and the game charge you 400 dollars when the game knows there is not resting area nearby YOU STILL get FINED. and like a demanding wife she will nag at you CONSTANTLY to get some sleep knowing again there are no places to sleep the gets mad when you can't sleep (which she knows). Unlike real life (in a truck you CAN pull out to the side of a the road) to the game wont left you for some reason.. I guess devs are scared their rest areas (like the wife) will be labeled useless so they both conspire to make it so you can't do some things that would be considered NORMAL.

You'er at a stop light and STOPPED and the car rear ends you. Guess what? YOU GET THE FINE. its like being married to a gold digger.. Nothing is ever good enough for this person or the FINES system. It feels like you are blamed for everything much like a person who wants attention OR money but she forgot she already drained you dry that month but makes you pay the fees anyway to her. 

I do think the game may make up fees if you don't get any in a long while (much like a wife expecting you to cheat then finds out there is no cheating so she makes something up and bashed our your tail light then claims you have a busted light). Its like trying to find out the mood your wife is in when she is yelling from the next room, and it leaves you wondering if you're betting off pretending to sleep or jumping out the window or taking the risk of answering afraid of what she might want this time. 

If your marriage (or game) sounds like this you are a victim! don't just sit silently and take the abuse from her (or the fine system) speak up and do something about it!  

P.S. don't buy flowers for this game they won't work.. Flowers might work on your wife for a day or 2 but not for this game! I'm willing to bet the game will fine you for the flowers if you did..

P.S.S. unlike a marriage you can turn off the finicky wife fines in the game options menu so playing the game now is less stressful than being married to a person with compromised values. Also you can turn off sleep.",1651960626,1701909653,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The premise is simple, pick up some cargo and take it somewhere. Graphics are slightly dated (it is an older game after all). Trucks look gorgeous, cars look OK, scenery is nice enough though some config file tweaking is required to reduce pop-in. The game is generous with money, which you can spend to buy more trucks, hire drivers, or bling out your current ride with various customization options. There is a ton of options to customize your gameplay experience too, from ""I want to drive a gigantic golf cart and not be punished for ramming cars off the road"" to ""I have a full virtual driving setup with a wheel, pedals and a shifter and want to feel as close to the real thing without needing a CDL"".

There are some issues of course:

- There is no damage modeling. You could drive into a concrete wall going 200 miles per hour and your truck would just bounce off and a message will inform you of how much damage you took, in percent.

- AI traffic can be brain-dead or irrationally aggressive, which results in crashes and fines (if you enable them that is).

- Upgrades (cosmetic and performance) are gated behind XP levels. While money is relatively easy to come by, XP gain can be a bit of a grind.

- Some trucks have a dizzying amount of customization options (i.e. Kenworth W900) while others barely have any, without resorting to mods.

All in all it's a solid game despite the issues, and the devs still support it and release new maps every so often (however, those aren't free).

The beauty of the Trucking Simulator games from SCS is you can play them in so many different ways.  Sometimes I just chill and play on a single monitor, sometimes I multi screen it, but my favorite way is to play with the QoL and realism mods on my VR headset.  It's just as fun with a xbox control as it is with a steering wheel.  You literally feel like you are driving down the road in a rig. 

The only negative things I can say are small.  When playing in vr it takes a little tweaking to get the Route Advisor out of the way. Also you can't read the signs unless you run your computer to death maxxing out the texture upscaling. 

Basic issues (more room for improvement) is Audio mixing.  The sounds are great just not balanced.  Second is the AI pathing.  The only reason i bring it up is that you get sooo immersed that it's kind of jarring when it happens.

I don't play much online so I can't say much for the community of this game. The graphics are excellent even though I'm playing on my laptop, the base game is more than enough to keep you busy, which is good because the DLCs that are sold make up for the other 90% of what this game could be. I do find it unfortunate that there are so many DLCs that end up surpassing the cost of the game by a longshot. I've played the base game for 50 hours and have started getting some of the DLCs, I just wish you got more for the initial price, rather than paying the cost of the game 4 more times to travel further east.

The actual customization of your trucks within this game is excellent. I wish they could add a few things but whats included is pretty impressive. The game lets you change just about anything you want on the truck. Don't like one style air horn? You have 5 more. Don't like those parking lights? You can change them too. Want more trailer lights? You got it. What do I wish they added? Just a little bit more. You can't have a long frame with a day cab on your Pete. Want a long nose? Never heard of it. Fiberglass fenders? You can get rid of your fenders, but you can't add them. Any type of aftermarket part? Only off the shelf dealer parts. I just wish the devs would look through a Berube's magazine and add the parts in there. There are so many more opportunities they aren't taking advantage of.

The truck selection that you can get is great, many models from multiple brands. Once again though, I just wish they'd add more. They added used trucks, but I wish they would add old trucks. Nothing would beat an 80's Mack Superliner or an old KW Needlenose. If they added a section to the used truck market for trucks like those I would be ecstatic. Building a fleet of new trucks is one thing, I just wish I could add a few pieces of old iron to my lineup. Most trucking companies don't start out with a brand new Pete, KW, or Mack, they start with something with miles already on it. Something older, mechanical, missing the push button auto trans, and with good rumble. I want something that takes 4 business days to go 30 mph. Something that looks cool as it pulls a way overweight low-bed down the highway that I know I don't have the brakes to stop. The Mack R series, a Superliner, a cab over KW, something with character. New trucks are cool, but I wish I had something older as well.

All in all, this game is great. 9/10 fr fr",1701713118,1701713118,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

So, to simply put, this game is wonderful. It does have its occasional crashes (usually only when updates come about, but they're usually fixed in decent of time on both the devs and modders end), but that could on the users end, more than likely. I love that this map keeps getting expanded on a periodic basis and hope that someday it will reach the east coast. The scenery is something of a wonder to look at. So incredibly relaxing to play this game. Only thing about this game, is it makes me wish the Devs also took on Long Distance Bus Simulation, which I think they could do with relative ease, albeit with certain mechanics changed and adding passenger AI, fare/ticket collection. I hope they do decide to tackle it at some point, if they have the chance and the resources to do it. 

But, as of now, they're doing a fantastic job with this as well as the ETS version.

The menus and user interface are easy to navigate and the tutorial was helpful. The graphics are good and with the 1.49 update, the night sky now has stars and the moon to add further immersion to the game. As a suggestion for a future update, the devs need to add a feature to where the semis get dirty over time to increase realism and game immersion. It's kind of weird that my semi would show up at a destination after a 1000+ mile trip and still look clean.   
The AI traffic in game can be wonky sometimes. An example would be when I pull out onto a road, it appeared that the AI cars didn't see a big semi pulling out onto the road and proceeded to hit me. Not once, but twice! Somehow, it was my fault and got charged for the accident. There was one time where there was a traffic jam caused by a semi trying to turn but a utility truck was in the semi's way. At first I thought I'd be stuck there, but the game had a humorous way of solving the traffic jam. It clipped the utility truck into the road while moving it back so that the semi could finish the turn. Then, the utility truck was put into the air, then back onto the road and traffic started moving again.
During game play, I noticed certain sections of road had weird changes in speed limits. One particular section, is a section on the north side just outside of Tonopah, NV where the speed limit goes from 25mph to 70mph for a brief time then down to 35mph. This isn't the only section of road that has these radical changes in speed limits though. 
All in all, I'd recommend this game to people who have or had aspirations to become a truck driver. It's fun and the AI traffic can be hilarious at times. However, there is one slight irritation with this game and that's the rest stop feature if you have the ""fatigue-O-meter"" turned on. Apparently, it's been a known problem for a hot minute. When you need to rest, you have to pull into a rest stop to attain rest. Unfortunately, there's no marker indicating where you can park your truck and rest. Markers for refueling, weigh station, repair shop, taking jobs, etc with a green marker for you drive into to give the prompt for refueling, vehicle inspections, etc. For some reason, there is no green location marker for resting at rest stops. You just drive to the spot according to your GPS and hope you get the prompt to rest. Unfortunately, I had multiple issues where I drive to the spot on the GPS and there's no prompt to rest to the point that I had to disable the ""fatigue-O-meter"".

You can visit so many cities and locations and some may seem very familiar to you if you live in one of those types of places.  I can't talk much on the weather update released with 1.49 but some Dynamic Weather would be AMAZING for this game.  Mods can be your best friend from the Workshop, there are so many selections and options of different things like chicken lights and strobes and different trailers. 

Be weary of 3rd party a.k.a. not mods from the steam workshop.  There are many great ones out there but there are many that are just bad websites. 

Anyways, you can truck via single player and enjoy all the trips solo, you can play TruckersMP with a bunch of people from all over the world and you can play in a Convoy with a friend that hosts it and you can all run the same mods and enjoy your custom trucks and trailers together.

This game is very playable on a controller but I would 1000% suggest a wheel and pedal setup!  Also, if you do get a wheel and pedal setup, the force feedback wheels like Logitech sells work great, you can adjust the settings to feel every pump in the road, you can adjust the stability of the truck/trailer you make driving more challenging.",1701469801,1701469801,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I come from a trucking family and have a background in Diesel Mechanics and this game scratches the itch to drive and customize trucks that I can't get anywhere else. 

The studio constantly updates the older game maps and is consistently releasing new maps (I can't wait till they get to the southeast). There are lots of great mods for newer trucks and plenty of old-school trucks and paint jobs. The progression of owning your own trucking company keeps this game fresh, with the ability to buy garages, hire drivers, and update their trucks, I have never had a time where I have had millions in the bank and ended up bored. Even if you take a break for a while you can almost always come back with the hopes of new updates, new cargo, and mods. The variety of trucks and customization open up a door for this game to take all your free time. I have 200 hours plus in this game and generally only get in a few hours a week of gaming.

The framerate in older areas or high density areas isn't that good on older cards, but overall your framerate will be above 30 90% of the time if you're using an older card such as a RX 580. IIRC I did see a devblog about possibly modifying the game engine to enable multithreading to help with performance. 

DLC - 90% of the skin DLCs I don't have, however I can say, that only playing the base game and not getting the state DLCs, you are missing out on longer drives that you could be taking, especially once this game crosses the Mississippi. However, I would argue that SCS does maybe overprice these DLCs, and they could maybe like, every 6 from the release of the DLC months drop like, a dollar off the DLCs to a minimum of $5, or maybe start bundling some of these more empty states such upcoming North and South Dakota.

Damage model - I do like that, for minor damage the transmission/engine damage have been unlinked from Cabin damage, so this allows you to bump into AIs more often without fear of loosing transmission gears, also, I do suggest within like your first hour of gameplay, just turn off traffic offenses and leave it off, the AI has bricks for brains and will just randomly bump into you, or get in your way, or turn into you. I have yet to get to permanent wear on my truck, I can only see this happening if I just drive more.

Stuff that should be added to the game

I would really like it to tell me if I have driven a specific route before. I'd like to know before taking a driving contract if I have already taken a double container with transformers from Carson City, NV to Havre, MT, that would be nice to know before driving it again.

I would also like for it to tell me what states my trailer combo is legal in, instead of telling me that the when I arrive to the garage screen that XYZ trailer isn't legal unless you stuff it into a garage in ABC state.

I'll edit this if I think of things to post, but these are my thoughts for now.

Buy the game, it's worth the relaxation especially if you have games like Whore Thunder (War Thunder)",1672976939,1701396850,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The constant updating and working on perfecting the overall experience is worth getting this game.  There is a constant flow of DLC and updates which shows the developers commitment to the game.  Unlike a lot of games, the DLC is reasonably priced and it does not feel like SCS is trying to take advantage of it's players.; unlike some companies. Plus - they listen to the players and give them what they want.  Along with an outstanding modding community this game is worth it for that alone.   

The game play itself is as close to real life as one can get.  With the bonus of it not having to be real life.  There are so many tweaks the game can be played however you wish. 

With the game always on sale it is worth the pick up.  However, it is worth full price.  It is costly with all the DLC but pick and choose.  With all the mods out there, I would recommend getting the maps first.  This will give you the most options for your trucking journeys.  

After that the heavy cargo and special transport which give extra things to carry and special missions which transporting things like massive helicopters and huge boats.

The rest is up to you and how you want to play the game.  Just get the game and play it, you won't be disappointed.",1701385193,1701385193,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have logged quite a few hours of endlessly staring at a screen learning how to move a truck in theory.. I was given the opportunity to try for my Class A Commercial Driver License through the company I work for.

Today, because of ATS, I passed my driving test almost flawlessly, and my backing techniques without a point. The moment I stepped into a truck in real life I felt fairly comfortable. Nervous at first, but I already had a strong grasp of how I needed to make my big rig move. I flew through my CDL courses with flying colors.

Once you have played the game long enough you notice there are a lot of things that are repetitive but with the additional new states that have been added at least the roads and scenery stay a bit fresh. They also add new trucks from time to time which has been great although I prefer sticking to my Western Star and make the lowly peons drive other things like Freightliner and such. My only real problems with the game are probably based more on licensing and such, things like damage. It would be nice if trucks experienced certain random failures or maybe you bought the perfect truck that has no issues for thousands and thousands of miles but it would be cool if you had the 'problem' truck occasionally or that due to your roughness in driving you wear out the transmission or maybe overloading overtaxed certain things. I also would still love to see my other trucks on the road maybe even carrying my logo like in games I played when I was younger (Hard Truck 2) and I would also rather invisible walls to some extent be removed. It would be nice if there were an easy way to have all roads mapped and scaled into the game so that we could drive on all of them and maybe 'drive to our real homes' for instance if we so choose. Imagine if somehow through online maps and overhead views they generated the roads and actual homes into the game. I just think that would be cool but I imagine way harder than meets the eye. Things like weather actually following real trends.

All in all though, positive experience and very, very playable and addicting, you can certainly lose track of time playing this game. I also want to note I only play without mods.

First off, The game is primarily keyboard and accessory accessible. (Wheel, HShift, Tobi) There are maps for controllers on Steam Overlay that unfortunately, habitually seem to be spontaneously switching between supported and non supported controls, this makes it very tedious as sometimes there is vibrations from the road and premapped layouts for the buttons, sometimes there is not, leaving you one day driving one way and another a completely different. (Sometimes my joysticks are detected and not just the buttons, so I can use the right stick as a camera and turn in a sort of 'chase-cam' mode, Other times, I am forced to awkwardly use my mouse to turn my camera while I am driving with the controller, it makes me think I should just use the keyboard sometimes as I wind up having to do half of the controls on it anyways since the mapping is sometimes just...not there...?) 

Now lets talk about things outside of the controls: 

Graphics :
6.9/10 The graphics are passable, Nothing Crazy, But cosmetics are cleanly identifiable and some of the backdrops/events are pretty well done.

Gameplay : 7.5/10
Traffic responds ""Okay"" in most instances, Or as you would expect them to for the most part. The setting/environment depending on location is Semi-Immersive. ( :^) ) The game seems, Small upon base edition/base collectors pack once you do an adequate amount of runs, however, there are frequent sales and picking up x4-6 maps for 12-18 isn't 'such' a bad deal and it opens up many alternate ""playstyles""/routes. The external DLC's for shipping/cargo are a unique twist on regular game play that open up a field of reliance that makes the game seem less at-your-own-pace/casual demand to the ""Regular"" type of runs. (Learning how to transport a Turn-Key House in one piece, Which roads are most efficient for lighter or heavier weights, Widths, How to carry them and what to use differently etc.) 

The game is fun with more people, I'd highly recommend it as a casual game to play with friends when you don't want to do something more demanding.

Physics/AI Reactions: 6.5/10

P1 : Momentum and breaking physics, as well as most of the basic driving physics are relatively well done. (From my PoV, Driving in Assisted Automatic instead of full.) However, there is much work to be done, I do not think moisture/rain effects or traction control are in a state that can be defined as actually ""Finished"" as they both unfortunately cause very similar reactions with little room for differentiation that makes displacement feel like it doesn't really 'matter' if it's raining or not/if you lose traction on one function as opposed to another excluding certain accessories. Gravel and loose terrain though visually different appear to also react like pavement/tarmac. 

P2: The AI Reactions and registration of penalty is, questionable. There are many circumstances when I am through a yellow light and get a red light violation, or am turning in the correct turn lane on a green arrow and crossing the stop line triggers the main lane lights. Speeding violations also require a longer window because when I hit a 40 from a 60-70 there's essentially no way for me to slow myself down excluding a full stop or brake lock should there be a cop on the road in adequate time, even with smaller trucks and tiny loads.  I am looking forward to a traffic update, the new events/road traffic spots are very cool but I come across ""a(i)ccidents"" that are not event based frequently where there are just 6-15 cars stopped in the middle of a freeway not moving for no apparent reason on both solo playthroughs and during Convoy's and it is EXTREMELY tedious to be going the speed limit on a freeway and then suddenly the traffic infront of you just stops and forces you to thread a near impossible needle and chance wrecking your truck/load or alternatively hope your parking brake and E brake stop you in time to not wreck your load anyways. 


Ultimate rating: 6.5/10 (B-) 

A good game, Just above the average enjoyment for a typically budgeted time sink. There will likely be consistent content until the completion of the game and the 48 or so of the 50 (Alaska/Hawaii being unlikely considering they are not mainland states) states are included (?) which potentially makes it something one could revisit from time to time.",1701371567,1701371567,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Sure there are more things that they could do with the game, like adding in the ability to drive smaller trucks and make deliveries like box trucks, flat beds, or even pickups but even without those things this game is amazing. I love sitting back and just driving, it is super relaxing. If you have a steering wheel that is the best, but if not then pick up a controller (PS4 of Xbox - get one at a pawn shop they are fairly cheap), it will make a world of difference even having a controller over the keyboard and mouse.

This game continues to grow and improve and simply continue to raise the bar on the this amazing truck driving simulator experience. This year they have released 2 more states and just announced the next one. SCS is clearly devoted to making ATS an amazing game that includes the whole of the USA.

The map is beautiful and you get 3 entire states in the beginning, but keep in mind that some roads are still blocked (I think you have to unlock them.) The game is so good quality but addictive. It could run on a NORMAL Windows laptop. 

At first it was hard the figure out the controls and how to set them but now I get it.

American Truck Simulator (ATS) is not just a game; it's a red, white, and blue symphony of trucking excellence that has made me appreciate the vastness of the American landscape. As someone who once struggled to pronounce ""Albuquerque,"" I can now confidently navigate its streets and many more.

The graphics are a testament to the beauty of the American terrain, from the deserts of Arizona to the evergreen forests of Oregon. I find myself marvelling at the landscapes as if I were on a cross-country road trip, minus the bathroom breaks.

The attention to detail is impeccable, capturing the essence of American trucks with an authenticity that makes me feel like I've joined the ranks of the nation's trucking elite. The sprawling highways, iconic landmarks, and diverse cities make each delivery feel like a patriotic mission – I'm not just hauling cargo; I'm delivering freedom.

The unintentional masterpieces continue in ATS, where my tire tracks have unintentionally outlined the contours of the Grand Canyon or formed an accidental tribute to the Statue of Liberty. Move over, GPS – I've got a paintbrush called a semi-truck.

The radio stations provide the perfect soundtrack to my American trucking adventure. Whether I'm rolling through the heartland to country tunes or cruising through the city lights with some good ol' rock and roll, ATS knows how to keep my wheels turning and my spirits high.

In conclusion, American Truck Simulator is more than a game; it's a celebration of the vast, diverse landscapes that make up this great nation. Thumbs up, pedal to the metal, and a tip of the trucker hat to the developers at SCS Software for creating a masterpiece that turned me into a star-spangled road warrior.",1464211951,1700909497,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But its actually a really fun job. I enjoy ATS because it allows me to enjoy the road without all the annoying hassles of driving IRL like worrying about traffic, following distances, waiting at stop lights, speed limits, etc. It's just pure driving joy with none of the headache. SCS has really poured a lot of labor into ATS since it released. Trucks feel very weighty, graphics are really pretty, sounds have improved considerably. Driving on the highway feels very tranquil, peaceful, and you just lose yourself. I have zero complaints with the game, I just hope they keep adding more and more states. Its a really deep rich game and I love making money and buying more trucks, coloring each one uniquely and investing in a driver that I keep forever. The game esseentially captures all that is great about trucking with none of the annoyances or stupid stuff. It does have all the ""simulation"" aspects for those of us who want to simulate, like weigh stations, tickets, fines, road rules etc. 

It's just freedom at its finest. I love it.

convoy can sometimes give you a heart attack and turn into a horror game like Outlast, when your partner's ghost truck suddenly appears in front of you, hit that rear and OH ITS A GHOST PHEW
Also not sure why but on the opposite side there can be some insane car/truck crashes, that one time the truck flipped over but I only noticed it in convoy. Keep it, it's entertaining 

My only real negative is the graphics, wish they fixed AA, in the distance it really looks bad. Seems there's a workaround with Nvidia cards but still not an easy in-game solution
And less pop-ins would be nice too

As an avid fan of the genre, I can confidently say that ATS has raised the bar to new heights, delivering an unparalleled trucking experience that combines realism, attention to detail, and sheer joy.

From the moment you hit the road in your meticulously recreated truck, the attention to detail is simply breathtaking. The landscapes of the United States are beautifully rendered, capturing the essence of each region with stunning accuracy. Whether you're navigating the bustling streets of Los Angeles, cruising through the vast deserts of Nevada, or winding your way through the majestic Rockies, every mile is a visual treat.

The realism extends beyond the visuals. The sound design in ATS is exceptional, with the hum of your engine, the rhythmic clunk of your gears, and the ambient sounds of the environment immersing you completely in the trucker's world. The attention to detail is so precise that you can almost feel the weight of your cargo as you navigate the highways and byways.

One of the standout features of ATS is its commitment to authenticity. The fleet of trucks available is a dream for enthusiasts, meticulously modeled after their real-world counterparts. The handling of each vehicle feels true to life, requiring a delicate balance of skill and precision to navigate the diverse terrains. The inclusion of realistic weather conditions and day-night cycles adds another layer of challenge and immersion, making each journey a unique experience.

The open-world design of American Truck Simulator is a triumph, offering a vast and interconnected network of roads and cities to explore. The sense of freedom is exhilarating, allowing players to chart their own course, take on different jobs, and build their trucking empire. The economy and progression systems are well-balanced, providing a satisfying sense of accomplishment as you upgrade your rig and expand your business.

The community support for ATS is another commendable aspect. The modding community has flourished, creating a wealth of additional content that enhances and expands upon the already rich gameplay. From new trucks and trailers to custom map expansions, the mods contribute to the longevity of the game and keep the experience fresh for veterans and newcomers alike.

In conclusion, American Truck Simulator is a triumph in the world of simulation gaming. Its commitment to realism, attention to detail, and the sheer joy of trucking make it a must-play for fans of the genre. Whether you're a seasoned truck simulator veteran or a newcomer looking for a unique and immersive gaming experience, ATS delivers on all fronts Also more so then any other quality above the devs always active!",1700837047,1700837047,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics aren't the best, but they are okay, and you get a ton of performance in return, so you get a playable experience even with a basic gpu such as the GTX 1050 mobile. It finally got an update that added bumps in the road as well, which is pretty nice. Also, a lot of the negative reviews for the game are about the game ""crashing"" as soon as they launch it.

SCS as a company is transparent to their players, and always open to feedback, and implementing things off of that feedback regularly. ATS and ETS2 are some of the only games where I will buy the DLC at full price purely because of the amount of hours I have in game, but also because I just want to support SCS themselves as much as I can. Major updates, although sporadic, are always well thought through, and comprehensive without breaking the game, or gameplay.
Additionally, there is a wealth of mods available for the game, both on the Steam workshop, and paid mods around the internet. Speaking of mods, SCS does not discourage the use of mods, and allows players to get their achievements whether mods are in use or not, which, honestly is a really nice touch. Outside of the standard game, you can play online, either with friends in the convoy mode, or by yourself by connecting your profile to World of Trucks (WoT). Furthermore, the whole community around the game is a wonderful group of people, and that can only be a testament to the wonderful folks at SCS and WoT.

TLDR
9.5/10 definitely recommend

(the .5 deduction is for the frame drops and stutters in ATS, which SCS are aware of, and have announced that they have actively been working to solve the problem, a mild annoyance for sure, but absolutely does not tarnish the game in its entirety)",1700793545,1700793545,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Mechanics are Amazing. And the trucks sound great.

This game gives you months and months of amusement! With new updates coming out every now and then.

Lots of DLCs to choose from as well!

Update: 24/11/2023 - I am back to review performance and other features, this game still runs well on older systems like mine. As well as that you can also take screenshots inside the game and change colour sliders and brightness sliders to adjust the look of images - its one amazing feature. 

One feature I am highly grateful of is the community events, there are many events for things like the games anniversary, sometimes the release of a new DLC pack, holidays such as Halloween.

It's nice, it has good graphics, the states are well made and the optimization is also good. This game allows you to tweak a lot of things to make it more of your likeness.

You can customize the trucks from inside to outside with a lot of options + third-party mods.
You can choose where you want to work and what kind of products you want to ship, buy different garages, and so on. You can even disable some simulation mechanics. There is a lot of configuration you can make out of the box in this game.

Also, you don't need a wheel and pedals to have fun in this game, you can have a great time with just a controller, It's greatly configured for that. The feeling might be better with a wheel setup though. But still, very good with just a controller or even with keyboard and mouse. I play with a controller and I always enjoy it.

Still unsure? Download the demo and test it by yourself. I also recommend watching a gameplay video without commentary so you can feel the game and make your own opinion on it.

Overall, It's very good for those looking for a relaxing driving game I also love that this game contains nice modding support which enhances the experience even more.",1669507464,1700780294,True,1,0,0.50519031286239624,0,True,False,False

Anyways, 
Coming from games like 18 Wheels of Steel American Long Haul, American Truck Simulator is a welcome modern take on the open roads of the United States. Attention to detail seems important to the developers for getting routes and landscapes just right. The driving experience feels authentic down to even getting cut off in traffic forcing you to brake to almost a standstill with a heavy load just before going up a hill with zero acceleration and the guy behind you honking because you're going 25 in an 80. Graphics seem very good, and although the animation of people and animals may not always look the smoothest it doesn't really matter when you're blowing passed them at 10mph over the speed limit with an 80,000 pound load. The handling of the truck feels very realistic. There are a few things that seem unrealistic, like speeding passed road blockers with police handling a traffic collision without any consequences, but it's either that or back track a few hundred miles for another route and I am not doing that. I do enjoy that the police aren't watching me like big brother and ready to pounce on me with infractions every second although I have had a few tickets. I actually feel like there is a lot of freedom on the open road to get your late shipments delivered on time which makes the realism of passing a cop and panic to slow down really hit home. Online radio streaming in game seems to be my favorite aspect, I don't know why I enjoy talk radio so much while driving cross country but it's wonderful. Versus 18 Wheels of Steel where you needed to add your own music to game files to make a playlist, which this game offers too but who has music files these days in the modern streaming world? I think some in game Spotify account link would make more sense, but then again on PC you can just play Spotify in the background anyway so! I don't know. The online steaming options are good and add a lot of immersion and help me stay up to date on current events and listening to real radio DJs chatting is a nice addition. Anyway, all in all I think this game is genuinely wonderful. As a forward deployed service member who misses home now and then, I'm looking forward to the rest of the United States added as DLC. I hope the developers continue to hone the details and add more content and destinations. Their dedicated research teams taking road trips in the US to help give feedback and realism to the game is a nice touch and frankly I am jealous of them having such a job. I hope every DLC purchase fuels the research teams to explore more states to be added into the game! Patiently waiting for Missouri, Iowa, and Illinois myself. My hopes are that long term goals include parts of Canada and Mexico but I will be happy if they don't give up on the rest of the mainland US. If parts of Canada could be added, then Alaska would have to be next! Ice Road Truckers DLC? What beautiful scenery. Other ideas I have include the ability to purchase cars to take road trips and sight see once you're a rich CEO of you're own business or the ability to walk around for more photo ops. But I'll quit dreaming. 

I want to encourage the ATS team to keep going! Don't give up on this project. I hope you find enough success in it to keep it going to add more and more! It's a great simulator. I find it to be the most addicting and relaxing game to play after a long day and gives me a taste of home. I'm excited to see how far this game can be taken. How many small towns and rural areas could be added to give more routes and short cuts? What other content can be added so the millions made in the trucking business can be used to continue gameplay to keep things interesting? 
It's a game worth playing and worth continuing development! I will happily support the team with every DLC purchase that gets released. It's worth it. I'm looking forward to my free CDL after playing this game for many hours.",1700764142,1700764142,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h3]Note:[/h3]
I've edited this review many times over the years. My initial review was at 843 hours. 1st edit at 1,738, 2+ years after release. 2nd edit at 2,495, 4+ years. 3rd edit at 3,120, few months ago. This is my 4th edit at 3,171, ~6 years after release. This'll likely be my final edit refining the review. It'll be long. Easily my favorite game & dev of all time. I wish to do them justice w/ this review.

[h3]The Devs[/h3]
First & foremost, I want to talk about SCS Software, the devs. SCS cares deeply about the community & their games. They listen to & interact w/ the community. They listen to feedback & act on it very often. Some feedback takes longer to act on than others, but the majority of reasonable feedback is heard & addressed. They steadily release new, quality content to keep the game fresh. In between content updates, there's hundreds of mods releasing, so you always have something new to try.

To this day, you'll see people complain there ""isn't enough content"" or they ""want new trucks or maps RIGHT NOW"". These people forget what happens when stuff is rushed. When care & quality are thrown away in favor of speed & quantity. Well... Look at all the AAA games & DLC coming out severely unfinished w/ many bugs, game-breaking issues, & complete lack of basic features. This is where SCS differs greatly & what makes them stand apart from AAA studios in many ways.

SCS creates quality content. They take their time w/ whatever they're working on. So much of what they add is completely free of charge too, including new trucks. E.g, a decent amount of content in updates for a map expansion launch, is free to all players. Updates for an expansion launch consist of more than just support for the expansion. Those updates add new companies (where applicable), cargoes, features, & improvements which are added to the base game. Even if you don't buy expansions, you're still getting new content, just from updates that accompany expansion launches. The only paid content after buying the base game are map expansions, paint jobs, occasional specialized cargo DLCs, vehicle tuning packs, & real-branded trailer DLCs. However, all content is always of quality & paid content reasonably priced.

It's noteworthy that SCS [i]NEVER[/i] gives release dates for any upcoming content until 1-2 weeks from the content's launch, when they're certain beyond doubt they'll make the date they give. This is another part of what makes SCS an incredible dev. SCS also has an impressive mastery over PR & hype. E.g, map expansions. Let's use Texas. At the time of writing (08/24/2022), Texas is still in development & was announced in March 2021 as one of the next expansions. However, SCS has steadily released blogposts showing off specific cities/areas, industries, & certain industry history. They're keeping us satiated & hyped by info drops & showing development. All the way until the expansion releases. Yes, some people will forever be unhappy & complain regardless. That'll never change, but at the end of the day they'll still be here, still buy DLC, & play the game.

All this & much more is why SCS is vastly different from the rest of the gaming industry. They're down-to-Earth, very interactive w/ their community, & care deeply & passionately about their games. For SCS, their games are a labor of love.

[h3]The Game[/h3]
I've spoken at length about the dev. Let's talk about the game now. The game is exactly what the title says. A sim about trucking in America. It's not an in-depth sim like Train Sim or Microsoft Flight Sim. It's much more relaxed. A casual sim.

Looking at the game, especially if you're not wildly interested in trucking, you might think ""How could trucking be fun or relaxing?"" You're not alone in that. Many people thought the same, but upon trying out the demo or buying the game, many were immediately drawn in. The majority of your time spent is driving. Put on some music or a podcast & you'll be surprised at how relaxing it can be. Passing beautiful vistas, landmarks, small towns, hearing the engine roar alongside your favorite music or podcast... It's such a great experience. I admit I've found myself nearly falling asleep or actually dozed off while playing w/ music on. It's just that relaxing at times.

The game scale is 1:20 IIRC, so you reach your destination in a much shorter time than IRL. Even w/ a map mod that adds the currently missing states, or if you're playing years later from when this is written & the lower 48 is complete. If you run a load from San Diego, CA up to Bangor, ME, it'd only be maybe a 3-5 hour session. Depending if you take breaks, stop to see some sights, or take a scenic route. It's still vastly shorter than IRL. That's part of the draw. From your truck cab as you drive, you can see so much of the US in such a short amount of time & at any moment in your trip, you can park up, save & quit for a while, & come back later if a long haul is getting to be too much. Can't do that IRL.

Regarding performance/stability, the game's extremely stable in a vanilla state (Mods will obviously begin to interfere w/ performance/stability in varying degrees). The way SCS handles updates is phenomenal. S'far as I can remember, SCS has always released major updates to a Public Beta first. Anyone who owns the game can access the Public Betas if they wish to. W/ Public Beta's, there's almost never any game-breaking bugs when the update officially releases to the stable branch. This is due in part b/c they patch the bugs DURING the Betas, instead of compiling a list & doing it after it's released. You don't see many other studios do this. Even those that do something similar don't compare to the level of success SCS' Public Betas have. I honestly can't recall a single time where a fatal bug made it out of Public Beta.

Regarding mod support, the game's extremely mod-friendly. It has a Steam Workshop w/ over 8,200 mods at the time of writing. There's also mods that can be found on various mod sites. They are generally referred to as 'local mods' since they're downloaded & installed ""locally"" to the game's Documents folder. Though I would highly recommend using an adblocker & a solid anti-virus. Some sites people host mods on can be sketchy w/ their ads. Usually though, most good mods you can find on various sites will also be on [url=https://forum.scssoft.com/]SCS' forum[/url] where they closely monitor mods posted there. Anything you find on their forum is a pretty safe bet. Just get a good adblock & AV, browse mod sites carefully, & you'll be fine. The game has a built-in Mod Manager for both Workshop & local mods, so there's basically no end to the potential of this game w/ modding so easily accessible.

Regarding multiplayer, if you're interested in the game but don't like singleplayer, no worries. The game has built-in 8-player multiplayer w/ AI traffic called Convoy Mode. Convoy offers mod support up-to 70 active mods. Both Steam Workshop & local mods. If 8 players is too low for you & you don't mind playing the game vanilla, then there's [url=https://truckersmp.com/]TruckersMP[/url]. TruckersMP is a multiplayer mod developed by a team of people that allows MMO-style online play in ATS & ETS2. They have servers that hold a couple thousand players at once. TruckersMP, while offering higher player counts, only supports a few very specific mods & doesn't have AI traffic (At the time of writing. I'll update this IF TMP adds AI traffic). Convoy & TruckersMP have their pros & cons. Both are great in their own ways.

[h1]Review Conclusion[/h1]
I hope you found this review helpful, insightful, & detailed. I absolutely love the game. It has captured my attention for nearly the past 7 years now, & will continue to do so for many years to come. I hope it does the same for you.

Even after all this time, I still find myself coming back to it when I need to unwind and escape from the stresses of everyday life.

One of the things that has kept me playing for so long is the addition of new states over the years. When I first started playing back in 2016, there were only a handful of states to explore. But now, with the addition of several new states, the game feels even more expansive and immersive than ever before.

The graphics improvements and the addition of new trucks have also made the game shine. The level of detail on the trucks is incredible, and it's clear that the developers put a lot of time and effort into making them look and feel as realistic as possible. In fact, I was so impressed with the game that I ended up purchasing a wheel and pedals set just so I could play it more realistically.

And let me tell you, the wheel and pedals set has made a huge difference. It's like I'm actually driving a truck, and it's made the game even more enjoyable than it already was. In fact, I think playing American Truck Simulator has even helped me learn to drive a real vehicle. When I went for my first driving lesson, I was already pretty good despite it being an entirely different vehicle, especially for it not being a combination vehicle.

All in all, I would highly recommend American Truck Simulator to anyone who is looking for a relaxing and enjoyable game to play. Even after 500+ hours of playtime, it's still one of my go-to games when I need to unwind, and with all the new states and improvements that have been added over the years, it's better than ever.

There is also a huge mod community and a Steam workshop for extras.  SCS interacts with the fans constantly and they stand by their product.

If you like driving games, then give this and ETS2 a try.  The difficulty can be adjusted to make parking the trailer a challenge or just let the AI do it and move on to the next load.  While deliveries are timed, the game is very relaxing and is a nice change of pace.  I personally use an Xbox 360 or Xbox One controller to play these.  There is embedded settings to set up the controls how you want them.

The screenshots and videos are accurate.  The world and the trucks are beautiful.

Solid 10/10 for me!  Besides Skyrim/Fallout, I've spent the most hours in ETS2/ATS :)

As someone who's spent countless hours on the virtual roads of ATS, I can confidently say that it offers an incredibly immersive and enjoyable experience.

First and foremost, the attention to detail in ATS is nothing short of astounding. The game's depiction of American landscapes, cities, and highways is remarkably realistic, making each journey feel like a real road trip across the United States. The graphics are stunning, and the day-night cycle and weather effects add depth to the visuals.

The truck models are beautifully rendered, and you can customize your rig to your heart's content, from the paint job to the cabin interior. The engine sounds are satisfyingly authentic, making you feel like you're actually behind the wheel of a big rig. The controls are intuitive and responsive, whether you prefer using a keyboard and mouse or a dedicated steering wheel setup.

One of ATS's standout features is its vast map, which covers various American states and keeps expanding with DLCs. Each state has its own unique charm and challenges, ensuring that no two trips are the same. The job market offers a wide variety of cargo types and destinations, allowing you to tailor your trucking career to your liking. You can choose to transport everything from heavy machinery to fragile goods.

The AI traffic and pedestrian behavior have improved significantly over time, making the roads feel more alive and dynamic. The traffic rules and regulations are faithfully simulated, adding an extra layer of realism. You'll need to obey speed limits, use your turn signals, and rest at regular intervals to avoid fatigue.

Multiplayer mode is another highlight of ATS, allowing you to team up with friends or other players for an even more enjoyable trucking experience. Convoys, competitions, and collaborative missions make multiplayer a great addition to the game.

Overall, American Truck Simulator is a meticulously crafted simulation game that offers a perfect blend of realism and fun. Whether you're a trucking enthusiast or just looking for a relaxing and immersive gaming experience, ATS has something to offer.

You haven't lived until you've gotten an articulated load up to 80+ MPH, swerved to avoid a construction zone, gone off the road, back onto the road, jacknifed into a pretzel, and clipped through the ground, falling into the void until you reload from last save.

This game is *NOT* glitchy, not even a little bit. Which makes my above experience all the more entertaining. Also, it auto-saves often enough that you're not really punished for screwing up that badly, which is nice and relaxing.

I bought ATS as it is called by players because I loved ETS2 and wanted to play an American Truck game, like the old 18 WoS days.  So far, I'm not disappointed by the game one bit.  

Yeah, you only get two trucks at the start, and I'm fine with that.  The reasoning for the lack of immediate content is actually a good one for once.  It is because rather than put fake brands in the game, SCS wants to get licenses first.  But, as said by Pavel Sebor himself, getting licenses from truck manufacurers that aren't used to being approached for licenses of their product is like the chicken vs egg debate.  So, they are going about it the right way at least.

On to the gameplay.  Those of you that are familiar with ETS2 will have no problem getting used to the ATS Gameplay.  There are a lot of new things to compliment to already very good base gameplay that I hope will be making it's way to ETS2 soon as well.  

Delivery Points are the biggest advancement in the gameplay system.  You can choose how difficult you want the delivery to be.  From a zero point quick drop to a 90 point drop that is so complex, even the most Veteran Driver will have a challenge are available for choosing.

Weigh Stations are new to the game.  You can be randomly chosen to go to the Scale House for Inspection.  It's an interesting feature, but a bit of a waste of time and ruins fuel economy.  Hopefully, SCS will be able to do something to give this feature more meaning.

After talking about weigh stations, we have no choice but to talk about the new police engine.  Now, the dreaded Rozzers are mobile and sneaky.  I got a Speeding Ticket for not being at 30 MPH right after the sign changed.  There needs to be a Reduced Speed Ahead sign, like in real life here in the States.

So, lets break it down to the Pros and Cons.

Pros

Familiar yet tweaked Gameplay
American Trucks
Nevada included 
Scenery that will blow your mind
Easter Eggs, yes, there a few, and no, I will not tell you what they are
No curves every 20 feet like ETS2


Cons

Only two states at the beginning
Only two trucks at the beginning,  Not really a con, but may put some people off
The UI is completely Copy/Paste.  Would have loved to see the Route Adviser remodeled.  Maybe next time.
Only 64-Bit
  

Having looked at the facts and played a long time, I can give a solid 9 out of 10.  This game is definitely worth a buy.  It's continued development is something I look forward to.


UPDATE:  W900 is out and it's not bad.  The sounds need a little tweaking still, but at least it's there.


UPDATE 2:  It's 2023 and ATS is light years ahead of where it was at last review update.  In the last seven years, ATS has went from an American-skinned ETS2 to a grand, yet still unfinished Epic of American trucking.  So much more content has been released over the years.  SCS has kept on improving both games, especially ATS.  Trucks, Trailers, and Maps all continue to get better with every update.  I'm over 6000 Hours in as of this update.  I see many more thousands of hours of game play ahead for me with ATS.  It's become beyond just a game.  It has become a reliable, old friend that I enjoy engaging with nearly every day, despite some of the frustrations it causes me from time to time.",1454761451,1700606128,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Surprisingly it is very relaxing and provides a steady challenge without being impossibly difficult.  It has also given me a greater appreciation of just how dumb car drivers can be when dealing with big rigs.
The constant updates are great and I look forward to each new area release and not coming from the US it helps me learn a bit more about the country, though it would be nice to have more detail about the states that you drive through in game and better markings in the map as due to the necessary time compression in the game (who would really want to drive in real time?  right?) you can skip through areas pretty quickly and not realise when you have crossed state borders.  The map also doesn't tell you which state you are in, which is not very helpful for those who don't really know the area.

The game may not have the best of the best graphics but it makes it up with having a great gameplay. Personally I always prefer gameplay over graphics, I mean a tree may look super realistic but I don't spend hours looking at it.
Some people may find that the game becomes boring after a while because all you sort of do is transport goods from point A to point B. I'm not gone argue with that because it is literally transporting goods and items from point A to point B, but for me it never got boring (atleast not yet), or maybe that's because I play it for several hours for several days and then I leave the game alone again for several days.

During 2023 we received several new expansions to the map (Oklahoma & Kansas) and I must say, the bigger the map becomes the better the game becomes.

American Truck Simulator is a follow up game based on the same game engine used by Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2).  ATS is in a very early state of development with a few states from which you can drive through as well as just a few licensed trucks to choose as your daily driver.  However as with many simulation style games, mods are what really makes the game shine.  

The vanilla game is very enjoyable in it's ""As-Is"" state.  But as you add mods and start re-skinning your truck to a look that fits your style.  The simulation feel will start to shine.  

Also as with many simulation style games it comes down to how you want to play the game.  There are many in-game options for this simulator that you can turn on and off to suit your style.  There are third parties who are creating add-ons that like many driving-style simulators will give that realistic feeling for driving.  An  SKRS-style shifter is one such add-on as well as button boxes to give that more in cabin feel an example is the A.S.P. box.  Add those 2 items with a steering/driving wheel with pedals and shifter and if you have the cash for one a gaming cockpit.  Now if you are like myself and currently on a limited budget the keyboard/joystick/game pad are more then enough for many hours of truck driving enjoyment. 

Latest updates and dlc to the game have added heavy hauls, double trailers and another state, New Mexico.

Special Transport and the addition of Oregon continues to expand the experience of the this game and adds more variety for your hauls.

Forest Machinery DLC and Washington state now completes the west coast and now we can keep our eyes open to the east.

Utah continues the ever expanding journey towards the east coast.  SCS also has added Volvo trucks.  This expands the game quite a bit and offers even more for the vanilla game.

Idaho continues the lower 48 expansion.

Colorado, Wyoming, Montana and the most anticipated state of Texas has been added as well putting the game map at the middle of the United States.

Also two new trucks join the line up and they are the International Lone Star and the Mack Anthem. 

Western Star truck 49x joins the line up.
November 2020 with the release of Colorado.  The map continues it's progression towards the east.

The Volvo VNL was recently added.

Convoy mode added to allow you and 7 friends to drive together and now mods are allowed with Convoy mode as well.

 My final thoughts on this game.  If you are looking to drive across the lower 48, this is quite a ways away before this will become a reality.  However if you have ever modded a game with a few mods this will take this game to a different level for many and be a welcomed addition to a driving enthusiasts gaming collection.",1479975704,1700592152,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They usually update their game and add a new DLCs. I dunno, how I coulda liked those DLCs, which I haven't bought yet. Now I've only a three DLCs for map: Washington, Oregon and Idaho. I really appreciate 'em. I started my acquaintance with ATS at 2019th when I was visiting at my aunt and husband of her daughter showed me the American Truck Simulator. I was 11 and I was dreaming to play ATS. It was awesome for me coz I like American trucks: they're big, angry and powerful! I also like American nature, particularly the palms in the California and spruces in the Washington. I know that trucks in the ETS 2 lot more powerful and nature of ETS 2 more various too with the all DLCs. But I don't like Euro trucks as well as I like American trucks. It's a matter of taste. I don't remember how many trucks's models being in this game, but I know, that that's a big amount. 
VIBE: It's not the most important aspect in a game such this. But if compare it with the ETS 2, vibe in the ATS and in the ETS 2 are different. It's a vibe of long highways, dangerous and narrow roads through the big mountains. It's dangerous particularly on the big American trucks! Ya can't compare soundtrack in the main menu in the American Truck Simulator and in the Euro Truck Simulator 2. It's a wonderful sound! 
PHYSICS: You can evaluate a physics in a simulator just if you know, how it happens in the real world. How can you understand, I haven't driven a real truck, particularly an American. That's why I can't evaluate the physics in the ATS. I let a real driver write about the ATSs physics in the comments. 
TUNING: I've heard any driver can tune their own car however want in the USA. And if it's truth, SCS made a realistic detail in its game. At least you have enough paint jobs to tune your truck to it looks like a normal truck even without any DLCs for paint jobs. But if ya wanna you can buy one DLC for your wish and tune your truck. ATS hasn't a big variety of customization of individual parts like the NFS Carbon but it has enough. Long story short tuning in the ATS is made qualitatively. 
MAP: Map and nature of the roads pretty various at this game. California is a long state with a long, straight highways and the palms. Washington is the small state which full of the mountains and spruces. Every state differs from the other states. It's great and I'mma buy the Utah and Colorado at the next summer. 
TRUCKS: Diversity of the trucks is a big. So, you can find a 7 truck manufacturers and 14 models(I found out this information in the internet, before I didn't know it)! It seems to me you will find your truck. For Instance, I like Mack Anthem. 
RPG: ATS is a RPG game to some extent. You can don't develop your company, buy hundreds of trucks without recruit your drivers, but you can if you want to. 
To sum up, I like ATS and periodically play to it. If you're looking for a game, which pretty easy to chill out or a game where you can see a beautiful American nature, American Truck Simulator is the game for you! 
Good luck on the roads!",1700572889,1700572889,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game also has lots of content to add to it too, nice map expansion DLCs so you can play with a bigger map than what's given from the start, add Cargo and Paintjob DLCs to add more character to the game and have fun, but it also has a bank system in here too where you get loans if you wish, i personally do not go for loans or those Infinite money mods because i like the feeling of grinding and working for what i want rather than just cheat and buy it.",1700534109,1700534109,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

NO, if you wish to explore all 48 states (I exclude Hawaii because its on an island LOL, you'd need connections with boating simulator or Aircraft simulator or even railroad simulator haha)

Frankly, they should just call this US Western Truck Simulator instead of AMERICAN Truck simulator since it only consists of all the states in the WESTERN US only and nothing in the Eastern or Central US. Worst more, it does not even consist of ALASKA and cross country like Crossing to Canada to get to Alaska and back. Pretty sad really.

The game is fun, but the lack of the other US states is just...disheartening. I want to drive in my  home state Alaska and St Louis Missouri or even Chicago, IL and Atlanta, GA or Jacksonville, FL.  Trust me, I'm a real trucker. 

Another disadvantage? It severely lacks on the training part. There is no trucking school or anything like teaching you to maneuver a trailer with cones and stuff.
