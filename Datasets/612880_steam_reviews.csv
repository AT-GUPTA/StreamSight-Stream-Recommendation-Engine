The master-class game engine leads to a game that runs beautifully, looks amazing, and never once hitched stuttered or got in my way. The story and characters are a joy…. Until a certain point. Unfortunately, this games downfall for me came as death by a thousand cuts. The New Order was a game that was carried by its excellent story. The New Colossus is one of the best shooters I’ve ever played but its goofy tone outstayed its welcome and soured the plot.

-This game and vram, I don't know what happened.  I've had to tool with settings so much to keep game running.  I don't have top of line system but I do have i5 11th gen, gtx 1650, 32 gb ram and am running game off of quality gen 4 nvme ssd (msi spatium 480).  I shouldn't have to play this game at ultra low with anti-aliasing off, and STILL get crashes and vram dump errors etc and non stop warnings about possible crashes.  When I play newer games with good graphics; Cyberpunk 2077, Doom eternal, Marvel's midnight suns, I have no issues, and some of those games I even play on medium settings!  Programmers here got lazy and didn't adequately program to make efficient use of vram, don't know why.  If you have gpu with at least 8gb vram you might not have issues at all but then again I've read stuff about better systems than mine having issues, so be forewarned...  

-a little improved over TNO is maneuverability, that is your ability to move around in combat, but this is still a significant issue in newest iterations of Wolfenstein generally.  You don't have ability to double-jump or grab onto ledges easily like in new Doom games.  Sometimes getting snagged on a piece of iron jutting out of ground can cost you a battle, pinning you down and making you a bullet sponge....


All that being said I'd still say it is more pleasure than pain, so try it out if you like great single player fps campaigns!

Getting one-shot at full health and armor, autosaving at the worst possible times, and enemies with pinpoint accuracy. 

The UI is awful too. No specific key to open the map screen, a basic map much worse than the ones provided in the previous game, and the constant notifications telling me redundant information. I already know when I've picked up a collectable, I don't want instructions on how a one-time gameplay mechanic works, and I definitely don't want to be reminded that I have unread tutorials.

And the skills in the last two games when you unlocked a skill it gave you a new ability, like the ability to throw knives, and the ability to store the heavy laser weapon in your inventory. Sure, it had things that were just stat boosts, but in the New Colossus? It's all stat increases. You don't earn any new skills, you just get to do more damage, store more axes, etc. Contraptions were a good idea, but even they were implemented poorly when it was decided ""hey, we'll just dump these in the one-off missions"".

NOTE: This is true, the Super Soldier Hammergewehr dudes have pinpoint accuracy too.

At this point ANY game that is like this and Doom Eternal (which is far worse) deserve to have trainers, which are godly saviours when it comes to crappy games like this as you get hit FAR too much.

Although after you get past that crapped up mission, you gain access to the Conwhateverthey're calleds which are massively useful, at least until you get to the last bit of the game.

Oh and William's grunt when he gets hit, especially way too much times, is one of the most annoying grunt sounds I've ever heard in a video game and this game has one of the worst flinch systems I've seen so far (worse than CoD's mind you) - instead of the flinching being based on the damage you take, it is based on how many times you get hit or both. So if you get hit by some machine gun dude too many times it will go all the way up, and if the flinch does affect aiming, your aiming will become worse.

This might be the last bit but anyways, the Ubergewehr cannot be obtained by ANY other means except from those Zerstorer ****ing ""im gonna make you flinch 100 times"" ***holes, the last level was the worst (although I think the Courtyard was allot worse) and I did not get the achievement for playing on the hardest difficulty. If this is because I picked Wyatt's timeline or used mods (I said MODS not TRAINERS) then that's honestly just BS.

Tthere is NO way I'm playing this game a 2nd time. As to people who got the Mein Leben achievement, they MUST've been cheating because going through like 12+ hours of a game is not possible. Lastly, which should've PROBABLY been an ability in previous games if you maxed out all your perks, you cannot carry - not at least ONE - heavy/super weapon.

Fun, gory and chaotic. Dual-wielding assault rifles, setting Nazis on fire and fighting an entire army was incredible, and the characters are quite unique and lovable.

I really wanted to like this game. I really did. The concept is off the wall and I can definitely tell that there is a great story to be had somewhere in there, but after roughly 4 hours of opening gameplay, I just could not get into any of it at all.

Terrible shooting mechanics. Laughably absurd dialogue between other characters and with himself (feels like something I would have written in junior high with a stoner kid from my algebra class). Seriously, it's so cringe inducing I've had to occasionally skip the videos because it's so painful. The story and characters also got more wacky, stupid, and cartoonish which I think will turn off those looking for a thoughtful storyline instead of just a violent one.

Few maps, poor level desighn, stupid side quests, lot of bugs, nothing new at gameplay. This game falls short in so many ways, but it's biggest failure for me is the story.",1707934217,1707934316,False,5,1,0.528917014598846436,0,True,False,False

But this does not take away from the game in my opinion, just adds to the growing lore. The interaction between BJ and Anya adds emotion and love to the character development.

Unfortunately the game play overall is just bad, glitched, unpolished.
You are always getting stuck on the environment in battles.  Heavy enemies powerslam you into walls making you a spectator until you reload the game.
Weapon selection is slow and often unresponsive and often leads to multi-tapping the key causing you to go through the agonizingly slow process of switching to dual wield.
There seem to be drastic swings in the difficulty.  One second enemies take 10 rounds, the next the same enemy takes 10 magazines.
You can get soft locked by trying to speed up tutorials when you follow the on screen instructions before the dialog explicitly tells you to do the action.

I'm sold on its eclectic story-telling, swinging between a character study of Blaskowicz and a critique of the metastatic white-supremacy in America, when its not reveling in, bloody, Nazisploitation grindhouse pulp. It's all over the place. It switches between solemn and crass so earnestly that the tonal incongruity is something to admire.

I'm not smart enough to speak on the representation of all the characters portrayed. I can see nuanced arguments for both sides of it being empowering, but also bordering on harmful. But, from my POV, it's all in service to berate Nazis and fascists and racists. And that is a safe position to have overall.

There's technical issues with the game, for sure. I wonder if it's as optimized as it could be. I had to upgrade my computer to play it reliably, which I can understand. But even then, it complains about low memory when I play on the second-highest graphical settings. And I have a graphics card that should've been top-of-the-line for the year 2017.

To make an attempt at being succinct, I think you should play this game. It's an oddity, especially for a triple-A game. But to keep you informed, here's a list of other issues I had, in case any are a deal breaker for you:

[list]
    [*]I wish the ""slow-mo"" for the weapon wheel wasn't behind a specific upgrade and its tech tree.
    [*]Trying to peek corners has this weird jittery effect for me.
    [*]Stealthing towards commanders is precipitously more difficult than the previous game.
    [*]Level design is sometimes too obtuse for my caveman brain. The New York levels are disorienting and the ""hint"" button just tells me the objective, nothing informative.
    [*]While mixing dual-wield combos sounds cool on paper, I actually would prefer not. It breaks the flow of combat and I accidentally bring up my left-hand options constantly. Again, why is ""weapon wheel slow-mo"" locked behind a tech tree?

Comparing to New Order/Old Blood: As far as gameplay goes, the only negative thing I can say (and this is arguable) is they changed what the mouse wheel does.  It no longer pops up a radial menu of weapons, and worse, the dual-wield options are not in there.  However this is because you can now wield different weapons in each hand.
The graphics are better, the gameplay is smoother, and you no longer have to cut shapes with the laser.  It's been ""upgraded"" to melt the entire thing you blast with it.
I don't want to give away any spoilers but this game's writing and plot are to say the least, phenomenal.  I've never had the pleasure in any other game of having my character in a gun fight from a wheelchair.  

This game is not for your children.  There are dismemberments and beheadings.  Oral sex pantomimes with victim heads, a whole lot of cursing, references to racism, etc.  How evil are the Germans?  They will send you to a camp if you're overweight and if you're gay, they will find out and ""correct"" you.  This game is an incredible FPS (apparently much better than its sequel) but it's not for anyone under the age of 21 in my opinion.  You'll be remembering this while you sleep.

Pros:
More gore
More weapons
...better locations(?)

Cons:

Stealth is useless, and near impossible if you choose the ramming enhancement

612880,156213139,76561198273266555,0,107,635,0,635,1705021379,"How can a game as simple as Wolfenstein be made into such a brooding, tiring, overcliched modern shooter uh? I swear everything I hated from the first one is back with a vengeance, and I don't know what to say. Honestly I don't. The game looks great and plays fine, but god dang man. Blaskowitz gotta be one of the worst modern videogame characters I've seen, along side the new Lara Croft. Really, he monologues al over the place and keeps dropping this cringe inducing f***** lines like ""Caroline, lend me your wings"" or other stupid s*** like that every single minute. The rest of the characters are equally terrible tho,

I gotta be honest, I didn't remember a single one of them from the previous game and they are back here so. Things happen to them. That's all I can say. Sometimes it matters, sometimes it just happens. One of them loses his arm, another gets hit, and really it never gets further than that, things happen, but not like you would care. Also they all talk loud, everybody is yelling all the time, and they all seem to have lost their minds. They are deranged and are so underdeveloped and monothematic that I just keep forgetting they even exist or even care about them. I specially love the part when they send a pregnant woman on a mission with your character, oh yeah you can expect so much more nonsense from this game that you'll be wondering what the hell whoever wrote this was thinking.

The story  has it moments. The bit where you meet H***** is really funny and kinda sorta gets close to the level of over the top comedy tone it should probably have had instead of still taking itself so seriously; I mean, whenever it's not interrupted with cloying cheesy sentimentality or nonsensical over the top developments that make little sense, specially if you undermine it with s***** over dramatic scenes. Blaskowitz keep flashbacking (yes they did) and the very first memory is one of his father, who happens to be a racist, antisemitic homophobic creep who, get this, forces you to shoot your own dog to prove a very silly point. It is so lazily written and on the nose that I kept asking myself what kind of awful trait would they come up with next. But breath easy, all other characters are equally cheap. And the gameplay, and this is my beef, feels like COD. So if you enjoyed COD or any other of the million tiring and unoriginal military shooters that have come out in the last 15 years then you're gonna have a blast I guess... or the previous installment in the series.

Honestly, I'm not a fan of this Machine Games version of the series. It's loud, it's stupid, it's annoying and it plays almost generically from time to time. The game looks great and it's well made to an extent but I can't go past the silly story, the awful writing, the terrible cardboard cutouts generic cliched nature of the characters. Thank f****** god this era of FPS is over. And Wolfenstein II might be the last of this kind, maybe an hybrid of sorts.

Now, I don't know if the developers were on a diet of spicy sauerkraut and wacky juice while creating this, but it's definitely a rollercoaster through an alternate history funhouse.

Firstly, let me address our disappointed comrade from China, who probably expected the same level of epicness as ""Wolfenstein: The New Order."" Mate, this sequel is like the unexpected spin-off of your favorite TV show—same universe, but with a questionable sense of humor.

Our Polish friend, ReVampiria, seems to have had a blast with BJ Blazkowicz's adventures, calling it a ""mixture of explosive chaos and depressive storytelling."" I mean, what more could you ask for in a game, right? And I'm totally with you on the ship obsession – ""Młot Ewy""? Someone has a thing for nautical drama.

Now, we've got a diverse set of reviews. From MrGoodAim's enthusiastic discovery of unconventional activities with Nazis (weird flex, but okay) to Bot Marsh confessing their personal preferences (thanks for sharing?). Oh, and let's not forget about brutal advice from brutpenta – don't be from Arizona. I wonder if that's the secret to surviving in this alternate history.

And then we have tubbz., who seems to think this sequel is like a DJ who can't follow up a banging first track. It's not terrible, just not the Nazi-thrashing party they were expecting. Sorry, tubbz., looks like the DJ dropped the beat.

To sum it up, ""Wolfenstein II: The Quirky Revolution"" is like a bag of mixed candies – some sweet moments, some jaw-dropping oddities, and a couple of questionable flavors. The narrative's a rollercoaster, characters are more caricature than serious business, and stealth mechanics are like trying to tiptoe through a minefield without a map.

Rating: 7.5/10 - A wild ride through Nazi land, but the twists and turns might make you question if you're still playing the same game.",1706916419,1706916419,True,8,1,0.571225881576538086,0,True,False,False

1. Unfortunately the dark nordic anti-utopian action thriller has transformed into a hollywood superhero farce with extremely annoying characters and ridiculous plot twists. 
2. The locations became larger, but harder to navigate and explore due to awful ingame map, which is small, doesn't have vertical layers and doesn't even have a hotkey like M. 
3. The collectible markers appear on the map randomly (instead of appearing after the silent officer elimination like it was in the New Order) and are completely not interesting to collect. 
4. The main storyline is rather short. Revisiting the locations for the side quests and ober-commando eliminations (kinda open-world feature) is too boring. 

What is still good:
1. Gameplay is still dynamic, bloody and fun overall. Though personally for me holding different gun types in different hands was highly inconvenient, we could have an option to set the same gun type for both hands by default.
2. Graphics are really good looking even after all these years. Though I didn't like that B.J. and Fergus looked younger, while being in their 50's.
3. The villains are still memorable nazi pigs, deserving every bullet shot in their limbs and every hatchet thrown in their faces. 
4. Mick Gordon's soundtrack still rocks.

In general I would give this game only 6.5/10, but still can recommend it for the franchise fans.",1706732535,1706732535,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Firstly, there's the obligatory Disney Marvel influence on storytelling. I'm so done with the quippy superficial one-liner dialogues, it's funny when RDJ does it, but that's about it. Some characters are honestly repulsive. Grace for one; why are modern writers incapable of writing strong female characters? There's so many (black) women in cinema that were properly written; strong motherly figures, that nurture and cherish. Instead the trend these days is to insult everybody, pretend you're one of the boys, be rough and masculine, blow smoke in your baby's face, nice... Caroline wasn't bad, if you had to have a female leader, then fine. But she dies at the start of the game and instead of BJ or Fergus or hell even Anya taking over command, you pick up this ""strong"" racist black female revolutionary who simply takes over Caroline's cabin and command. What the hell? Diversity isn't enough of a reason to swap out a character, guys. At least make us believe that this character is a worthy successor/leader. Knowing what came after The New Colossus, I guess in retrospect one could have seen the signs. Possibly even worse is Grace's husband. What an annoying wimp, so glad he died... Another part of the story which I utterly thought was eye-rollingly bad, was the part from BJ's childhood. It was so terribly forced and heavy handed; modern writers can't write turmoil without going straight for racism or sexism and oooh BJ had a black girlfriend and his daddy was angry, give me a fuckn break. There's ways to write this, but not like this. The story is set in world where the Nazis have taken over the world. It's all about racism already, do we have more than one subject to pull from?

Apart from these annoying characters and story lines, my main problems were with game stability. I've gotten a save corruption during the Roswell level, luckily I had one more save game from before the level started, otherwise I would have had to restart the game entirely. I was considering quitting the game, as I didn't want to replay the level, but I'm glad I did because the second part of the game was much better than the first. 

The movement system is also really lacking in this game for some reason. I had this glitch that would make me get stuck behind every single step in the game. I figured out (out of necessity) during the last level that that was related to V-sync... But it was an annoyance during the entire game. On top of that, I had to often jump while sneaking to get over these ledges, which I would follow with a quick crouch, to get back to stealth asap, which rather resulted in doing a ground slam, alerting everybody to my position. Great. Peaking behind corners was clunky and during the constructor training course I got stuck behind an indestructible wooden dummy for some reason.

Another problem I had was with audio. I didn't get any proper immersion from the sounds in this game, very bad bullet hit reception, sometimes no audible footsteps, etc... overall very lacking. And for that matter so was the damage system, I'd have preferred a bit better indication of the damage level, playing at the second to hardest difficulty setting, I was often running around with 10 hp, without realizing I had gotten hit that badly.

This said, the game still has plenty of excellent stuff, a lot of the characters luckily are fun, BJ is a bit one note, but quite solid. He was too weak too often I think, there's ways to do this properly, but he felt a bit too spineless too often unfortunately. Anya was a bit underused in this game. Toward the end she became more interesting, but I think BJ and Anya's relationship could have received a lot more love instead of his iffy backstory or all the Grace crap. General Engel was a bit underused as well, but considering she was more prominent in previous games, it's understandable. Of course we don't usually play these games back to back, so I wouldn't have minded her presence in this one. Especially because there was no other main bad guy in this game, Engel could have played a bigger part I feel. Hitler's appearance was truly wonderful, that entire sequence with the audition and the other actors really was a blast, brava! Raw and ridiculous and funny! Fergus was solid throughout the game. Sigrun, General Engel's fat daughter and former Nazi, was a bit of a cheap character, but she had a few good moments, I particularly liked her standing up to Grace, but that was more because of my hatred for Grace than my approval for Sigrun... Max Hass has a few good moments in this one as well and so does Set, but nothing to write home about.

The game assets were fantastic as per usual, I really dig the art direction, especially the Nazi brutalist architecture, the hangars, the trains, the fortresses, etc... I wasn't too big of a fan of all the rubble locations in this game, but luckily there was a lot of good to mix things up. I prefer old-school over scifi, but it's still a wonderfully designed world.

The shooting and the weapons was again top notch, though the audio mixing would have helped out here as well.

Overall there's a lot of issues with this game, particularly in game stability and story/character development, but I still really like this game. I will skip Young Blood and hope for a solid Wolfenstein 3, with less woke bullshit. All hail Wolfenstein

It is kind of the perfect first person shooter in my opinion, giving lots of different ways to handle situations, such as stealthily taking out nazis with an axe, or you could take the opposite approach and dual wield one of the most damaging weapons in the game tearing the soldiers to shreds. The game also offers a lot of improvisation with the grenades and heavy weapons. You can't keep heavy weapons in your inventory, so during battle you can pick up a devastatingly powerful laser beam gun and cut through the nazis with ease and satisfaction, but they are scarce and can't be carried up ladders or through levels.

The story also offers a lot as well. (No spoilers) going into this I was mainly appealed by the shooting of nazis, but also mildly interested in the story and see how the game twists the events of the second world war, and I was positively surprised by how invested I got. By the end of the first mission I was thinking that the story would be bland and terrible with terrible characters that only speak in one liners, but as I progressed the more depth I saw in them.

The areas which you fight through were really good and imaginative. I enjoyed clearing out the nazis from the U boat we had occupied. I found that the above ground areas that weren't radioactive like the town areas to be the highlights of the game, but I wish they were used more because I prefer to see the towns that have been totally taken over by nazis and seeing the nazis interact with the real world than fighting through an underground millitary base. I mainly bought the game because of the few screenshots on the store page that show the nazis in the town, thinking that I would have more access to that kind of area, and I don't mind that it is more focused on combat inside buildings, I just hope to see more in the towns.

There is like a ton of collectables that I didn't care for and extra missions to make this thing last longer.
I enjoyed the previous game, the writing was terrible but graphically it was impressive and the shooting was fun. So I decided to buy the second game and youngblood to have a brainless funny arcade experience in case I needed to release steam. 
Well, the art is gorgeous, full of detail, every nook and cranny beatifully detailed. Didn't have any crash or bug, collisions were ok, everything worked fine. Controls were intuitive. Sound was good, music wasn't great but worked  and the animation and acting was top notch. The gameplay is good but abuses the ""find the general"" mechanic, too much hide and seek, and the final boss was kind of lackluster compared to the first game. In easy mode the enemies were bullet sponges, even when they were only dreesed with jeans and a shirt and most of the time I was axing everybody. 
But the writing... There was little story in the first part, so the level of annoyance was little while you were enjoying your surroundings and the action. It was like a cheap 90's action movie, cheesy and unoriginal violent nonsense, but ok, you turned your brain off a few times and that's all. 
They decided that we needed very long cutscenes, real time interactions between your comrades, tons of boring memos and a big cast of characters. Everything is terribly written and themes like mental health, racism and diversity are introduced in a way so clumsy that kills any empathy you could have for the characters. You just want to kill the nazis and then all your comrades and finally suicide, so the new world could be a better place without this parade of violent terribly beings. Everybody acts like a teenage edgelord on drugs with little knowledge of reality, and sometimes it's difficult to realize who the fascists are in this game. It's sad how the good acting and visuals have been wasted with this terrible writing. Some people compares the game to the movie ""The thin red line"" because there is a cosmic junkie character(?), it was more ""the teen ret**ded lines"".  And next is Youngblood.

Overall feel can be described as ""If cringe was a game"". Imagine 'New Order' but as if it was a song. 'The New Colossus' would be sh1ttyfluted version. You still recognize original but it's just ""funny version"" of it. But at least game's sort of entertaining after all. Non-brainer as most Netflix movies. I don't know how to describe the game more. A rollercoaster. I won't be surprised if at some point game will start playing ""rapping for Jesus"" mid-fight.

You still fight nazis but now story turns into some GTA5 sh1t sometimes with quirky and dumb characters, cliche stoner jokes and just inappropriate jokes. By inappropriate i mean that it's not the best timing for them. And the more you play the more ridiculous story gets just like in GTA San Andreas. It gets more and more cartoony. So if you just abstract from the fact that you're playing 'Wolfenstein: The New Order' sequel you even might have fun with it. I even caught myself thinking that if you switch BJ with Duke Nukem, adapt story and setting, you'll get perfect 'Duke Nukem Forever' game, actually...

As for gameplay itself. I found it really exhausting.
B in the B.J. initials stands for 'b1tch', i guess. First 4-5 hours your health is capped by 50 HP and you die from 4-5 bullets with or without having armor. And it would be okay if enemies sometimes wouldn't come at you like they randomly spawn around and you die often. But, hey, we have quick save/load feature now. So you get annoyed by loading every 5 seconds during big fights.
Also using guns themselves feel awkward. You still can wield guns in both hands but switching is so clunky, slow, non-intuitive (first 'Call of Juarez' did it better) that you just don't enjoy fights. BJ runs so f-king fast you clip into everything and it really is distracting you. So in the end you just kill bots in a good ol' boring ""one by one"" way. Sometimes simply camping them like a little b1tch.
But even when you can get 100 hp and even 200 hp you still die like a b1tch taking slightly more hits before you die.
Graphics are actually good. Probably it's the best looking game based on Id Tech. But lighting works against you. Like in real life your eyes have to adapt to brightness change so when you fight in dark rooms or simply at night, shooting enemies becomes pure chore and torture just like in Crysis 3. Night goggles would be nice.
Game is definitely not a 'git gud' case. Mostly it's luck and big amount of ammo.

Wasted potential. Give it a go on a sale
=========================================
50% игроков прошли игру. Я проходил на сложности ""я воплощение смерти"", но оно того не стоило.
Общее ощущение можно описать как ""если бы cringe был игрой"". Представьте себе ""New Order"", но в виде песни. Так вот, ""The New Colossus"" - это версия от sh1ttyflute. Ты узнаешь оригинал, но это уже просто его ""смищная версия"". По крайней мере, игра в какой-то степени развлекает. Что-то вроде типичного фильма Netflix. Не знаю, как еще описать игру. Я не удивлюсь, если игра где-нибудь посреди боя начнет играть ""rapping for Jesus"".

Вы все еще бьетесь с нацистами, но теперь сюжет превращается в какую-то дичь из GTA5 с упоротыми и тупыми персонажами, клишированными шутками про укурков и просто с неуместными шутками. Под неуместными я подразумеваю то, что их втыкали будто бездумно чисто по приколу. И чем больше играешь, тем более нелепым становится сюжет, как в GTA San Andreas. Прямо мультики рисуй. Так что если абстрагироваться от того, что вы играете в продолжение ""Wolfenstein: The New Order"", вы даже сможете получить от нее удовольствие. Я даже подумал, что если поменять Би Джея на Дюк Нюкема, адаптировать сюжет и сеттинг, то получится отличная игра ""Duke Nukem Forever"", на самом деле...

Что до самого геймплея, то я очень устаю от него.
B в инициалах B.J. означает ""b1tch"", я полагаю. Первые 4-5 часов у тебя здоровье ограничено 50 HP, и ты мрешь от 4-5 пуль с броней или без. Так-то было бы терпимо, если иногда не выглядело так, словно враги рандомно спаунятся рядом с тобой. Порой уж очень внезапно вылезали. и я часто дох. Но теперь у нас есть  быстрое сохранения/загрузка. Так что теперь будешь беситься еще от частых загрузок  каждые 5 секунд во время больших боев.
Кроме того, само использование оружия кажется неудобным. По-прежнему можно держать оружие в обеих руках, но переключение настолько неуклюжее, медленное и неинтуитивное (в первой ""Call of Juarez"" это было сделано лучше/проще), что просто не кайфуешь от перестрелок. Би Джей так быстро носится, что цепляешься за все подряд и это отвлекает и бесит. Так что в итоге проще убивать всех старым добрым скучным способом ""по одному"". Иногда даже скатываешься в кемпинг, как последнее чмо.
Но даже когда ты ходишь с полными 100 хм и даже с 200 хп, то все равно дохнешь, как чмо. Просто теперь надо на пару попаданий больше.
Графика довольно неплохая. Я бы даже сказал, что это лучшая графика на базе Id Tech. Но освещение тут тебя подведет. Как и в реальной жизни, глаза адаптирутся к изменению яркости, поэтому, когда бьешься  в темных комнатах или просто ночью, стрельба по врагам становится чистым мучением и пыткой, как в Crysis 3. Ночные очки были бы кстати.
Игра определенно не зависит от опыта игрока. По большей части это удача и наличие большого кол-ва патронов.

the 2nd Entry of the Wolfenstein Reboot - the first one was already amazing, the 2nd one, i'd say, is basically more of the same, in a good way! although not as many cool POI's as in the first one, but that's kind of hard-to-top, the first one was very good afterall.

the Story is well-explained, eventhough many say the comedy doesn't fit very well, it does the job for me. the more serious scenes are hard-hitting aswell, gives you shivers in some scenes.

anything Gameplay related I don't have any complaints, great gunplay, music, weapon upgrades, etc.

the Performance is fantastic - a far-cry of what you see these days sadly, it runs on absoutely cranked settings on 3440x1440 Ultrawide like a champ, locked 144FPS, only a stutter when a new area loads, which is okay!

-frequent bugs and lag spikes
-AI far more A than I
-Frau Engel is very pushed to be worse than deathshead the entire game making her just weird
-way too many new characters for such a short story
-Side missions are essentially just ”go search for this thing” or ”kill this commander”
-the damn big robot
-Selling point is that moustasche man is in the game for like 10 minutes and then disappears
-the autosave saves like once every mission
-the regular bethesda bugs are there, saves crashing, long load times and terrible performance.

Here's a hint: it's the one group who killed more innocent people than the nazis.

I cannot begin to explain how obnoxious and preachy this game is. within the first hour, they kill of an enjoyable, ""strong woman"" character who still manages to fight despite her disability and replace her with the worlds bitchiest black woman, who spends the entire game (atleast, every single interaction I had in what I've played of this game) complaining about white people not solving her problems for her. whilst a group of white people do everything for her. To be fair, she does break this up with occasional one-liners so incredibly cringy it goes beyond funny or even ironic. although she never actually follows through on said one liners, preferring to stay in the safety of the sub moaning about white people.

furthermore, for the first half of the game, the main character is plagued with bad dreams about his father, who is quite possibly the worst written ""bad dad"" i've seen in any form of media. when you do finally kill the dad, it just feels like a self-insert fantasy from one of the devs who made the stand-in of their own irl dad comically evil as some absurd attempt to justify wanting to kill their own father. here's a list of some of the things the dad does:
-reports his jewish wife to the nazi occupiers because she bemoans him too much
-makes his son kill his own dog to get him to him ""man up""
-beats his son for making friends with a black kid
-almost every lines he says is punctuated with slurs just so you know he's a bad guy.
-etc, etc
At first, I was absolutely positive the depiction of the father was just an exaggerated version created by JBs mind as it slowly falls apart, but no. that would be too nuanced. the father literally is just the worst dad in history. except the one time he makes a good call to deal with his sons night-terrors but it's played off as some right-wing gun nut crap.

The complete and utter lack of self-awareness from the devs is simply the cherry on top of this white-saviour fantasy.
here are some other examples of ridiculous crap:
-the main character, usually depicted as being constantly worried about his partner, barely even protests when she goes off to fight despite her being heavily pregnant.
-Frau Engel, the main villain, whilst busy cutting off the head of the resistance leader, starts making fun of her own daughter for being fat. because just in case being the former head of a concentration camp wasn't evil enough, she also bullies plus-sized people *gasp*.
-upon the death of the resistance leader, she is replaced within a few days by the black woman, who literally nobody in the resistance has ever met before, who has spent the past decade hiding in a tower, doing basically nothing. this is despite there being dozens of other members of the resistance who are both exponentially more qualififed, and established within the group. this is met with absolutely zero complaint, and every character immediately shows total subservience, including Fergus, a scotsman noted for his bad temper, who is repeatedly called an englishman by this new-comer. in a game known for exaggerated characters, something that would irl get you punched is met with slight grumbling.

I will admit that, in a vacuum, the gameplay itself isn't bad, but this can't even be considered a compliment because it plays basically the same as the last game. this entry brings nothing good to the table, whatsoever. it's not even worth the 6 AUD it costs on sale rn, as i could just play the first game and listen to an AI generated black woman voice read off critical race theory literature whenever a cutscene pops up.",1704108885,1704109088,False,10,3,0.464633166790008545,0,True,False,False

Instead of following their signature gameplay of hard-hitting combat with Terror Billy like in New Order and Old Blood, Machine Games decided that it was a better idea to do a line of blow off a leftist college instructor's buttocks, then take a huge steaming dump on the Wolfenstein franchise.

The whole game is pointlessly racist with excrutiating cut-scene cringe that will land you in the hospital. There are no recognizable men in this game, BJ has been ruthlessly deconstructed from a Nazi slaying super commando into a weak wheelchair bound vegetable in the beginning then they constantly go into cut-scenes where he connects with his sensitive side with the females in his life and of course his dad is a racist charachiture of an abusive white father. This isn't BJ, it's a totally different character.

They should have stuck to making good gameplay consisting of shooting nazis, it's not that hard... instead they delivered absolute trash, the worst Wolfenstein I ever played, Machine Games have embraced mental illness.",1703824114,1703824114,False,4,3,0.371062010526657104,0,True,False,False

-Gunplay is very fun dual wielding firearms never gets old.
-Graphics look great on high settings 
-Pacing for missions feels right
-Killing Nazis from a wheel chair 10/10
-Level designs are well made and its fun to search for the hidden objects

The Bad
-Enemy AI doesn't seem to be that intelligent, they seem to just rush you and not utilize cover as much.
-The all white people are with the Nazis trope.
-Jabbing against male masculinity and pushing women as the saints for mankind. 

Overall I am enjoying the game and my playthrough regardless of the issues I listed above. The game is a steal when it is on sale but I wouldn't pay $59.99.",1703816941,1703816941,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In the crazy world of virtual mayhem, WTNC is your ticket to a strategic extravaganza that mimics real-world military shenanigans. We're not talking about your grandma's bingo night; this game's got more tactics than a chess grandmaster on steroids.

You want to be all sneaky and sly? Go for it. Prefer charging in like you've got a date with chaos? We got you covered, from shotguns to laser cannons – whatever floats your boat or blows it up. And the best part? Your perks, they're like your personal sidekicks, tailoring themselves to your playstyle. It's like having a buddy who knows all your moves before you make 'em.

But wait, there's more! Side missions turn your resistance HQ into a hive of activity. It's like the bustling market of rebellion. Explore, find hidden gems, and soak in the lore like a sponge in a rainstorm. This game isn't just a game; it's an experience – like going through a virtual boot camp for your senses.

The gun variety is poor, worse than the previous game. Your arsenal is also poorly balanced. The (upgraded) assault rifle is the best weapon by a wide margin in the majority of situations, and when it is not the best, it is still the second best. It is also very ammo efficient on top of having plentiful ammo, and is found very early.
Meanwhile, the pistol is less lethal than a placebo, and all other standard weapons are highly situational, with only very specific circumstances in which they outperform the assault rifle, while the heavy weapons cannot be kept forever and slow you down to a crawl, which is a death sentence. On top of that, weapon swap speed is very slow, and the weapon wheel is janky and not very responsive (at least with keyboard and mouse, I heard it was better with a controller). So if you are using a different weapon in a situation where it shines (typically, the shotgun in tight corridors, as that's basically the only other weapon that is sort of effective - when you can get close to enemies), and then find yourself outside of the situation in question (say, stepping out of the corridors into a wide hall with enemies shooting at you from afar), you will get wrecked while you spend 4-5 seconds pulling out another weapon. So since the assault rifle is, as stated, at least second best at all times, you find yourself simply using it 90% of the time, with the remaining 10% being when you begrugingly switch to something else during prolonged engagements because you ran out of ammo for the rifle.

4-5 seconds of getting wrecked might not sound like much, but you are actually very fragile, and this is more than enough time to get killed. The game also has poor feedback for damage taken, and sometimes (often) you just plain don't notice.. There were multiple times where I started a fight at full health+armor, and then died suddenly despite thinking I hadn't even been hit yet.

For some reason, the auto-pickup range is pathetic, you basically don't pick up anything automatically unless you actively walk on it. You end up having to spam E to manually pickup everything that's dropped. Not fun at the best of time, but in the middle of a heated firefight it can mean missing a useful ammo or armor pickup that's hidden under debris, or accidentaly picking up a heavy weapon which will instantly get you killed because now you are slowed down and it'll take several additional seconds before you can throw it away.
Strangely, the manual pickup range is pretty generous on the other hand, there were multiple times where I picked up items I had no idea were there because the prompt appeared anyway.

Enemies are very bullet-spongy and take a long time to go down (unless, again, you are using the assault rifle), so fight end up taking longer than they feel they should.

Story: The story of the first game (New Order), in my opinion, was better than this one. This one feels slightly forced and like the devs tried too hard to one-up the first game instead of letting it come naturally or building on it. It's still a good story - by no means is it bad - but don't expect it to top the first one.

Gameplay: The gameplay of this game takes what New Order had and massively improves on it. Graphics are a massive improvement, dual wielding is now mix and match (can have a shotgun in one hand and AR in the other, as opposed to only two ARs or two shotguns), new enemies types to take on, new gun types to use, ranged melee is more satisfying and can travel further, new armor upgrades allow for increased combat maneuverability in very interesting ways, takedowns are more variable and gruesome...just to name a few examples. Me personally, I love the way this one plays.

Now this is where the review takes a complete 180 degree turn (and don't let this dissuade you from playing, unless you're very intolerant/impatient or don't have a great pc)...the game is insanely buggy. I don't mean Skyrim buggy either, where most of the bugs are just funny or strange and can mostly be ignored. Every bug I have encountered in New Colossus has messed up the game in some way to where I had to restart from a previous checkpoint or restart the game entirely. At random points throughout the story, the game will just freeze, and the only way I have found to fix it is to ctrl + alt + del and end task. I've waited before for like 20 minutes and it never came back. I have an RTX 4070, i7 13th gen processor, and 32 GB RAM, so there shouldn't be any video/computing issues at all, but it happens at least once every half hour to an hour for me. Furthermore, assets in the game can become full-on obstacles, and you can't get over them unless you jump or change video settings. I'm talking like ridges on the floor that you can't step over or a tiny box that is impossible to walk, jump, or sneak over. It's almost like there are invisible barriers. Sometimes you can just jump them, but other times I've had to turn my video settings down a notch or two, or turn my FPS to 0 to get over them. Also, there are random chances through the story that an enemy (particularly the supersoldats) will become completely invincible; bullets go through them, explosive damage does nothing, and ramming into them with ramshackles is like throwing a feather at a concrete wall. The only way I have found to fix this issue is to reload a previous save or just run past them in parts where you can progress without killing all enemies, otherwise they'll just inevitably kill you. This last one has only happened once, but there was one instance where I was on an elevator moving to the next part of a level and all of a sudden my character just died while I was on full health. There were no enemies and I wasn't near anything that could cause damage, I was just standing in the open and my character all of a sudden dropped dead. I had to restart the previous part of the level I had just finished because of this.

I am able to look past the game-breaking bugs, as I really enjoy the series and the gameplay when it does work. However, I acknowledge that most people are completely turned off by issues like this, and that is why I left this review. If you are someone who can look past the bugs, I believe you will really enjoy the game as I have. If issues such as those I mentioned are deal-breakers for you or you think they will ruin your experience, don't waste your time, because there's no shortage of them at all.",1702872834,1702872834,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

New Colossus is not a dystopian thriller, it's an action sci-fi movie. The tone has completely changed.

Either all guns blazing, or try being stealthy, it's your call.

And you even get to hang out on your submarine between missions, and chat to your fellow rebels. All of which are fleshed out proper characters which you will grow to love.

The story is actually must better than I was expecting, and you get to see some interesting, highly detailed places. There are some ridiculous twists, but the game... knows that it's ridiculous.

At the very start of the game (I won't spoil anything from later on), you're a paraplegic in a wheelchair with a machine gun. It's silly, but has some remarkably touching moments, courtesy of the great voice acting and motion capture.

It also has some replay value, from a choice you make when you start a new game. Which makes for quite a different playthrough.

If you're looking for a single player FPS with a story that'll make you care about your NPC friends whilst making you laugh and still featuring some best of genre gunplay, I can't think of many better recent examples.

Better than the New Order that I played two months ago. Majority of things is very similar, e.g. gunplay, level design, perks, audio visual presentation... But what really stands out compared to the first game is story. It´s actually very well written!

I can see that it's important as a story introduction but after watching them a few times, being forced to watch the same thing over and over is just annoying.
The second problem with the cutscenes is, how much of the game is taken up by cutscenes instead of actual gameplay.
The gameplay looks impressive and is fun at first glance but feels unfinished. Combat is either jokingly easy or way too hard. 
The Enemy AI is really dumb and randomly looses track of you, even when using unsuppressed weapons. They only know duck and cover or run shoot.
Stealth is just as broken. Enemies spot you through walls and find bodies from halfway across the map. The Area 52 and Venus Oberkommando sections are very frustrating to play if you want to be stealthy.
The Story is kind of all over the place. Sometimes very dark and serious, sometimes so satirical and ridiculous that you can't take them serious. The scene with Blazkowicz and Anya arguing about how he is slowly dying and Super Spesh coming out of toilet and destroying the atmosphere is a perfect example of this.
I really tried to like this game but there are just too many annoying aspects.

It manages to do guns blazing, dual wielding and explosive combat alongside pretty good stealth, a bit of exploration and light RPG mechanics.

My only issues with the game are story and oddly enough, music related. I really like the story and characters, the cast introduced in The New Order is top notch to watch, but i do wish the story had a more satisfying ending. The one we have is very appropriate and not at all bad, but it's just a bit sudden and doesn't really end the game with a bang.

The OST is fantastic but the music volume is honestly too low, even when maxed out. Plus there's just 3 volume sliders, Master, Music and Dialogue, which is really stupid. You can either really enjoy the music and have everything else, SFX and voices, be deafened or vice versa. Maybe there's mods or guides online to change that, but the game doesn't revel as much in its music as DOOM does, which it absolutely should. Mick Gordon doesn't miss.

The side content is great, i like the collectibles and the readables really add to the world, but the assassination sidequests are too numerous and get kinda boring after a while.

And i don't recommend a very high difficulty if you're a guns blazing type of player, cuz you'll just get murdered before you even fully stand up out of cover.

For reference my Steam Deck has the normal GPU and CPU that it comes with the only thing Upgraded is the storage I have a 1TB SSD Storage Upgrade and Brand New Hall Effect Joysticks.


When playing Wolfenstein 2 The New Colossus on Steam Deck the game runs flawlessly at around 45 - 60 FPS up to Medium Settings there may be some dip in Quality if you set it to High or Very High but it should still run relatively well seeing as how it's a smaller aspect ratio.

The battery life on the Steam Deck when playing lasts usually 2.5 - 3.5 Hours depending on Settings used I typically set my settings to Medium and I have my Frame Limit set to 45 it doesn't make much difference at all setting it to 45 compared to 60 other than it just looks a little less smooth.

The default controller configuration for this game is perfect everything is easily accessible and easy to use it's a very familiar controller configuration that really any gamer can navigate.



The only downside I have with this game is that maybe I'm just inept with controllers but it does not feel smooth at all and I struggle with aiming sometimes so maybe it's just me but I feel like this game is BUILT to be played with ease on a regular desktop.



Overall this game is really good on both PC and the Steam Deck all I have issues with is using a controller cause I just suck with them but that's not really Steams fault at all.",1701837517,1701837517,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I grew up with Return to Castle: Wolfenstein and Enemy Territory. RTCW remains one of my all-time favourites and It's not just nostalgia - I replay it quite often and consider it a timeless FPS. I can't say the same about the MachineGames's Wolfenstein. 

[b]The whole Nu-Wolfenstein saga is extremely mid and The New Colossus is a waste of time:[/b] 
- The majority of the game consists of cutscenes.
- New characters are infuriating.
- The villains are comically evil (which was not the case with past Wolfenstein titles and it feels completely out of place) and barely relevant to the flat plot. 
- Level design reeks of wasted potential. Some of the locations at first glance are stunning but soon you are put in the same grey corridors, bombed-out buildings, and warehouses we have seen so many.
- Side missions are a joke and shouldn't be here.
- Worst story pacing I have seen so far. The gameplay gets interrupted by cutscenes quite often. There is almost zero world-building or anything different than shooting (in the same galleries or corridors), watching cutscenes, and repeating. There are a couple of difficulty spikes that happen out of the blue in which on higher difficulties you need to cheese the (atrocious) AI to progress.
- Almost zero enemy and weapons variety. Atrocious AI which simply doesn't work.

I'm just glad I bought the Nu-Wolfenstein saga bundle for dirt cheap. At least the next instalment in the series is better... right?",1701595382,1701595382,False,4,0,0.467812001705169678,0,True,False,False

But my biggest issue are the cut scenes. They were, in my opinion, long in The New Order, but I have replayed this game and during the cut scenes I wander off and feed the fish, play with the cat, eat, until the cut scene is finished. Anymore, I play up to a point and get bored and stop. If they gave me the option to wander around and explore while the  ""story"" is going on,  it would be ok. But, I am trapped. New Order was bad, but not quite as bad. The cut scenes are well done, and the voice acting is great. But if I want to watch a movie, I will either stream one or go to a theater.

When the game does let you play it is fun-although I felt like they recycled some of the ideas in New Order, particularly going to Venus instead of the Moon. You can stealth it or go in guns blazing. 

Overall, for an occasional or one or two time play through, great. I recommend getting it on sale. So I recommend it, I guess?",1701551386,1701551386,True,1,0,0.507692337036132813,0,True,False,False

After starting with Wolfenstein the Old Blood, I liked the game. Good pace, story, visuals and destructive weapons. A 8/10 game. Then I jumped to the sequel Wolfenstein: The New Order, and to my surprise that game was less fun than its prequel. But regardless, it was a blast. 

But then when I tried Wolfenstein 2 I felt it lost everything I liked about the past two games. The first criticism is that in this game you don't really feel like Agent Blazkowicz. It's more like a normal soldier. Level design is disappointing as hell; you're thrown into these small environments where it's really difficult to move around during combat without a soldier coming from behind. The only exception was the courtroom where you had the freedom to take cover, reload, run to another place and ambush them without always worrying about receiving a bullet.

The story is really...off. First, it starts great, but then it feels off. And the way the game ends, it feels...rushed. Add to that the music isn't as great as its predecessors with no moment where I felt like a total badass. I always felt helpless in this game, unlike past games. But all in all, this sequel is a disappointment.

""Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus"" stands as a testament to how video games can effectively blend gripping storytelling with exhilarating gameplay. Developed by MachineGames and published by Bethesda Softworks, this first-person shooter not only entertains but also provokes thought with its daring narrative.

Graphics and Audio:
The game boasts visually stunning graphics, with detailed environments and character models that bring its alternate-history 1960s America to life. Lighting and textures are employed masterfully, creating an immersive world that's both beautiful and haunting. The audio design is equally impressive, featuring a dynamic soundtrack that adapts to the action, and voice acting that delivers powerful performances, particularly Brian Bloom's portrayal of protagonist B.J. Blazkowicz.

Gameplay:
At its core, ""Wolfenstein II"" excels in its fast-paced, brutal combat. The gunplay is satisfying and varied, offering a wide range of weapons that can be upgraded to suit different playstyles. Stealth mechanics are also available, adding a layer of strategy for players who prefer a quieter approach. The game’s difficulty settings are well-tuned, catering to both newcomers and veterans of the genre.

Story and Characters:
Where ""Wolfenstein II"" truly shines is in its storytelling. The game tackles themes like fascism, resistance, and the human spirit with unexpected depth and nuance. The narrative is bold and often shocking, with moments that are both intensely personal and broadly political. The characters are well-developed, each with their own compelling backstories and motivations, making the player's journey through the game more engaging and emotional.

Performance and Technical Aspects:
On the technical front, ""Wolfenstein II"" runs smoothly on various platforms, with few reported issues regarding bugs or glitches. Load times are reasonable, and the game maintains a consistent frame rate, which is crucial for fast-paced action games.

Conclusion:
""Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus"" is a remarkable achievement in the realm of narrative-driven shooters. It combines thrilling gameplay with a powerful story and well-crafted characters. While its unflinching portrayal of dark themes might not be for everyone, it’s a game that pushes the boundaries of the medium and offers a deeply satisfying experience for those who engage with it.

[u]Good:[/u]

-The graphics still look really good.

-Replacing the knife from the previous games with a hatchet was a brilliant choice.

-Weapon upgrade system is an outright improvement. (Although having locking the pistol silencer behind it was a really dumb idea.)

-Dual wielding is also an improvement over the previous games. Unlike the previous games, in this game you can actually aim your shots without the camera suddenly getting a need to focus on the ceiling like it did in the previous games.

[u]Bad:[/u]

-The story is overall worse and less engaging than The New Order. Not only that, but the tonal whiplash present in The New Order is even worse here. In one scene a guy is having a conversation about how he's dying and how he won't see his kids grow up. And then in the same scene a guy comes out of a toilet breaking the emotional involvement I had in that scene. (Not helped by the same guy literally praising the toilet like a deity a bit before that.)

-World building which was excellent in The New Order isn't really here. The world of The New Order truly felt like a realistic authoritarian nightmare. The world here just feels like you're going from level to level.

-Characters. Some are good. Some are awful. And others aren't memorable.
Here are some examples. Fergus, I like the dude. He's fun and has some interesting character moments between him and his robotic arm. But Super Spesh is a pure annoyance, comedy relief character done poorly. But Grace is where the character writing goes out the window. The moment you save her and her group she immediately starts calling Eva's Hammer as ""Her boat."" Immediately starts being hostile with some beloved characters from the first game, mainly Fergus. And just starts bossing around everyone like she's the queen of the world. In a scene when you meet her, the game tries to portray her as sympathetic by her saying that she loves her baby. Problem? In that same scene she lights a cigarette while breastfeeding. I've literally no idea what the writers were thinking when making her character.

-Character agency. All of the old characters quickly get sidelined when the new ones are introduced. In The New Order, while at times over the top, the characters felt like people. BJ, Anna, Fergus, Klaus and Caroline all felt like people with their own thoughts and reasons for fighting back. Here, they might as well be dogs doing what others tell them. 

-The gameplay is...not as good. Commanders are heavily overused meaning that a run and gun play style isn't as viable while they are alive. But the stealth is the same half baked excuse present in The New Order/Old Blood. 

-Variety is also lacking. Yet again, in a timeline where Nazis conquered the world with mechs and Jewish wizard technology, we still have ""Dude with gun."" and ""Bigger dude with gun."" There's some robots too, but other than the robot dogs, the only difference is the health bar. 
The gun variety also suffers. The guns aren't all that unique and don't feel quite as punchy as in the previous games.

-The game is also a buggy mess. The game crashed a few times, the frame rate was also dipping for no reason and the ""The video driver has run out of dedicated memory. Your gameplay experience will be negatively affected"" error annoyed me to hell and back. What helped with the crashing and frame dips was setting the game to the High graphics preset, even though I could go higher, the game just didn't seem to like it. The errors persisted throughout the whole game, every time you boot up, every time you start/finish a level. Just awful.

-Some scenes were a bit much. Either cringe-worthy or trying to be mature about touchy topics and failing miserably. 
Certain scenes at the start and end of the game just feel like too much/overindulgent.

-Lack of boss fights. The game doesn't really have any boss fights, the only thing that is sort of a boss fight happens on the second to last level. Not really a big deal, just disappointing.

[u]In conclusion:[/u]
Overall, this is a game with a lot of issues. I got it on a sale and feel like I got my money's worth, but I cannot deny than some of the issues above soured my enjoyment. The game has some really awful writing, gameplay with a lot of the same issues from the previous games which are now amplified in this one + some new ones.  
If you're a fan of the Machine Games Wolfenstein games, get it. At least to see where the story goes.
Overall, it's a 6/10. A lot of missed potential.

VERY VIOLENT - LIKE SERIOUSLY.  NOT FOR CHILDREN - PROBABLY NOT FOR ANYONE WHO HAS HAD RECENT TRAUMA OR THOSE CANT SEPARATE REALITY FROM FANTASY.

+
Carries on with New Orders story fluidly - shoot sneak, bossfight.  

-
Unbearably melodramatic and 'right on' in places.  We are talking 'younglings' territory here. 

I secretly loved New Order.  I have always loved the 'what if'  sort of fiction along the lines of books like Fatherland.   

The cold but familiar world conjured in these two games is remarkable - ruined by two things:

1 Melodrama.  Oh God the melodrama.  

2 Reality in the real world where dictators are making a bigly, heads bashed bloody and tea poisoning comeback.  

The last isn't the games creators fault - just that when fiction starts becoming reality with so called leaders abusing their people and even just talking about destroying their 'opponents' (never mind actually doing it) it becomes off putting.  

The game is very linear but so well paced that I did not really care.  If William suddenly took an open world type of twist where he supported the Nazis and KKK, that would probably end the game right there.

Expect a few surprises - but not that surprising.  

It also pulls of a good trick in that a lot of the mechanics are familiar from the last game but it doesn't grind or seem like a con - the action is so well paced over all it's familiarity is snug jumper sort of familiar rather than didn't I already pay for this familiar.  

Play for the action and chilling setting - grit your teeth through the melodrama.",1701078788,1701078788,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

FPP - First Person Perspective
FPS - First Person Shooter
Doom clone - term that was used from '92 to '96 (release of Quake) that means the same as FPS, just doom was so groundbreaking that every other fps game was compared to it.

All of FPS are FPP, but not all FPP are FPS.The alternative being third-person perspective -- or TPP -- which, technically speaking, should include any game where you're looking at the character you're controlling from the outside, but which, in practice, is usually used to describe games with an over-the-shoulder ""follow cam"" (as opposed to ""isometric"", top-down, side-view, and probably others).

The FPS term wasn't widely used before release of Quake, before that they were all called ""Doom Clones"" or FPP. Doom was actually the first game that brought recognition to the FPS genre as something distinct (even though there are games that fit FPS description and predate doom about 19 years, Id themselves released at least 3 FPS games before doom - Hovertank 3D, Catacomb 3-D and Wolfenstein 3D)

So if you want to be specific use FPS, if for example you want to talk about System Shock or Deus Ex use FPP as they're mix of FPS and RPG. And all games that came after doom and before quake can be called doom clones (heretic, hexen, duke nukem 3d, shadow warrior e.t.c.)

There's also a subgenre of FPP that contains vehicular combat (i.e. descent series) that some consider to be FPS and some do not so in this case it's safer to use FPP.",1700916492,1700916492,True,0,0,0.395114898681640625,0,True,False,False

It's not a bad thing because now it became more fast paced than before and helluva fun if you asked me. It has a long prologue before you actually get the main game mechanics though. There are few memorable points in the game but not as much as TNO and TOB as a whole if compared. 

The hardest difficulty, not permadeath, was hard but not FRUSTRATINGLY HARD. I would love to try permadeath but I don't have time to waste it if I fail and have to start over and over again. Bethesda's game difficulty with permadeath has to be the most infuriating achievement ever but it's going to a shiny one in your collection for sure.

Story line is interesting and the characters for the most part keep the story moving.
The alternate time line may be objectionable for some people. Humanity has a history of extreme bigotry and atrocities as well as a history of great accomplishments and altruism. 

The game play in Colossus is buggy at times. Crash Dumps and issues with video memory seem to be the issues most people notice on PC. There are many posts on these issues but fixes recommended depending on PC hardware don’t always resolve these issues. I would have thought that Colossus being a later developed game would not have these issues. The graphics in Colossus are very good and allow many options to tweak settings but the video out of memory bug is absurd.

I had no problems running New Order and enjoyed that game more because the game interface was easier to manage. Colossus at least let’s you manually save games and New Order did not.
The missions are fun with puzzles to solve and areas to explore. The perks for BJ and the weapon upgrades help to move the story along.

For all older players the enigma machine can be frustrating. Pattern recognition can be a stumbling block for older players especially with a timer involved. First always save your game before using the enigma machine. That way you can reload the game so you don’t lose your code or back out of the machine before time runs out.  This suggestion may help or not. I found out through trial and error once you solved the first pattern look ahead and identify the next pattern let the timer run down not out before locking down the first pattern key. Repeat for each pattern. That way you are always anticipating and ready to enter the next pattern and not letting the timer bother you. You still may have to try several times to get all seven patterns done. Just keep practicing and don’t let it frustrate you.

Overall, I enjoyed the game even though a little off the wall with Decapitations and attaching heads to different species. This is Wolfenstein love it or hate it.

It's quite funny-you'll know that one of two major beefs with the game is the way BJ goes all existential in the cut scenes. Weel if you're hoping for a change, forget it. In [i]The New Colossus[/i]  he gets even more existential and there's a lot of in the beginning THAT YOU CAN'T SKIP. We get to learn about BJ's abusive father (who really is quite the piece of work) and his gentle loving mother. It turns out that BJ is [spoiler]half Jewish on his mother's side[/spoiler]. No wonder he and the Nazis have such animosity towards each other. No, I'm pretty sure the Nazis hate BJ because at this point he's probably killed the equivalent of the population of Leipzig in Nazi soldiers. And BJ hates the Nazis because . . . well they're [i]Nazis[/i] for starters . . . do you really need any more than that?

So what's good about the game? Well as always. you get to kill a f__kton of Nazis-[b][i]always[/i][/b] a plus in my book. That alone makes the game worth buying if it's on deep discount (and I did). You get to travel to interesting places like the radioactive ruins of New York City (instead of the ordinary ruins you normally see when visiting), and the Nazi equivalent of Area 51. You also get to liberate the good old US of A from under the Nazi Jackboot (it's got nails in the soul . . . er, I mean sole-ouch!) and travel to exotic [spoiler] Venus to kill the wretched puling, drooling pants-s___ting carcass that Hitler[/spoiler] has become.

What's bad about the game? Well apart from the existentialism and the unskippable scenes, there are areas in the first chapter that you cannot access until you get to further down the autobahn, meaning that you have to go back and replay those levels if you want to fully complete the level. That's not just annoying, it's bad game design.
There's also not a whole lot of humor in the game-I mean okay, I get it, Nazi tyranny, nailed jackboot on the throat of my beloved country, et hoc genus omne. There wouldn't seem to be a whole lot of humor in that situation, but I disagree. There's always room for funny, especially when you're making fun of Nazis. It's like [spoiler] The Donald[/spoiler], they just can't stand being made fun of. And as a wise man once said, ""If it can't stand being made fun of, it's probably not much good."" I mean look at [i]Wolfenstein:  The Old Blood[/i]. It's not really a laugh a minute, but there are some really funny points. Google [spoiler] Wolfenstein grammar Nazi[/spoiler] if you want a great example.

You also can't toggle the iron sights which is kind of a pain when you're trying to lean out from cover to send another Nazi to an extremely gory end-and from there to Hades presumably.

Lastly, just about all the background scenery has kind of a washed out look to it which I find annoying.

So in conclusion (assuming anybody ever actually reads this), it's definitely worth buying. Most of the DLC seems to be Dodo doodoo from what I've read in the reviews and overpriced Dodo doodoo at that.

29 hours of this game was simply agonizing. The single biggest problem this game faces is the gameplay loop. That is just open section with commanders who can summon other soldiers if you don't kill them soon enough, bossfights, smaller linear stealth or shooting sections, and cutscenes. The gameplay loop was so annoying that by the time I was in the mission where you were supposed to get the atom bomb into the bunker, I was painfully aware that the gameplay loop would be the same.

Another thing are the difficulties. I've been playing on Call me Terror-Billy, and this must be one of the most painfully unbalanced games I've ever played. There was NEVER a single time where I ran out of bullets for all my guns and was forced to smack my enemies with my bare hands, never a time where I was forced into stealth, never a time when the resources were scarce. But, on the other side, there were a lot of BULLSH*T moments where I got killed from one or two shots, even on full armor and health. 

The positive things about this game? The game is simply stunning-looking, the music and sound design damn near made me BUST at certain points, the shooting feels SO GOOD, the weapons' punch matches their beefy look, the level design is simply masterful, and the game itself is so well optimized that even my potato PC can run this game at High settings preset. 

Still, it's hard for me to recommend this game to anyone besides fans of the Bethesda's Wolfenstein and Doom games. There is nothing even remotely appealing for people who don't play FPS games in here. This game suffers from bad gameplay loop and unbalanced resource to combat difficulty ratio, but it also benefits from it's graphical design, sound design, funny writing, great story, and great level design. Therefore, if you don't mind a repetitive gameplay loop for nearly 30 hours, then go ahead.

What a missed opportunity. just played both for the first time, and The New Order completely blew me away and was just as good as I was hoping it would be when i first saw gameplay as a young lad. So hot off the tail of the previous game I hop into this one. And the disappointment started to set in almost immediately when they decided to retcon Bj's fond childhood memories of his father to make him a brutal racist for the plot, for character development and motivation right? and it unfortunately continued to go down from there on.  was worth the $7 i paid for it. still the best nazi shooting on the market, just not nearly as solid as the first two installments by a long long shot. so then its like why even buy the sequel if it's barely worth $7. Thew new Order was worth $60 when that came out no contest, and the old blood was worth that as well but wasn't even half the price.  someone on the art team must have had something against the artist for the first game because they changed every single main character to the point where they are unrecognizable and look and act like someone completely different, really just a bad redesign of a  good thing. oh, What's the point of introducing illuminati technology if we are just gonna skip all that and just forget about it and get right to bullying nazi fat women for being fat for like 5 cutscenes (or more) and then listen to bj- the guy who's been popularized by killing hitler, say stupid stuff like ""Her glory. It buckles me"" and yes it sounds just as cheesy and out of place in the game as you would imagine. the ending is lame and shows up way too soon. oh, and they broke object hit boxes and leaning around objects. like they just had it down perfectly and then threw it out the window. guns feel so much weaker than previous entries, sound effects aren't nearly as punchy.  but yeah still the best nazi shooter series of all time but this is one of the weaker entries. they just take you out of gray concrete corridors and put you in white metal ones, and give you a lame pandering story instead of a real gritty one.",1697007846,1697007846,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Hmm. Oh well, at least it turns out to be a fun shooter once you've got past that section. However, there is a caveat to this: for the first five or six hours you can only fight with a maximum of 50 health, and can only increase this temporarily with extra medkits and wait for a critical story section to recover the rest of your health. Prepare for a lot of scavenging, and in my case, quicksaving. 

Speaking of the story, the characters are still great, but the overarching plot has to be one of the most ""gamey"", implausible, and bombastic I've ever seen. Wait for your disbelief to peak when [spoiler]you encounter Hitler on Venus (a planet hot enough to melt lead) in the guise of a prospective actor[/spoiler]. 

It's still a brutal, entertaining shooter nonetheless, if one where the stealth is not so satisfying as in The New Order, because the more linear level design sometimes makes it very hard to eliminate the commanders first before getting past the common troops. Still, melee takedowns are very gleeful thanks to Blazkowicz viciously hacking them to death with a hatchet. 

I think I prefer The New Order, but if you like that game you can't really miss this one, especially if you find it in a sale like I did.

The ""New Order"" was amazing. The combat, dialogues, cut scenes and game play. All made very well for their first step in the subject.
Then they introduced the ""Old Blood"". It's short and only set in 2 places but it was a remarkable experience.

And now we have this abomination.
I was going to get and play youngblood after this but even finishing this was a torture for me and judging by the reviews it's probably worse than this mess anyway. 
I had 2 major problems with this game.
1. story
2. gameplay
Most people are going to hate me for saying this but this is what forced diversity looks like. Just look at the new order and see how they handled the diversity in their story. They added 1 black guy (2 if you make the wrong choice) he's kinda there, don't speak too much and slack off all the time like a real black stereotype would do. He's also in this game but they cranked up the stereotype valve too high he's now trying to bone every single white girl on the boat.
Now I'm going to talk about the second diversity hire. They killed one of the best character for dramatic effect and put her in her place to lead a boat full of rebels to kill KKK members in a universe owned by nazis, because of her grudge against whites. At least we can't call her racist because she has a brain damaged white husband who is definitely the father of her child. [spoiler]𝓬𝓾𝓬𝓴[/spoiler]
The game play wise it feels kinda off. Compared the previous games it looks like B.J. is now made out of biscuits and will break in pieces if a nazi look at him funny. I played both New Order and Old Blood on UBER difficulty with guns blazing didn't gave me a sweat. You can't do that in this game for some reason. Whenever I try run and gun in this game like I used to, I just die. Game forces you to play stealthy or like a coward behind a wall. Unless you play it on anything under UBER, then it becomes a walk in the park. It wasn't like that in older games. I know it's an upgraded engine which looks and plays better than old ones but what's with the bad enemy spawns, super accurate enemies, commanders in every room you enter calls for reinforcements after one another until you kill them. Oh also the famous crash dump error pups up randomly.

In conclusion, I had things I loved in this game less than things I found irritating. It's literally influenced by the SJW or other 𝖗𝖊𝖙𝖆𝖗𝖉𝖊𝖉 millennial cult. It fells well polished and also rushed at the same time. My advice don't even buy this. Get the previous games and play them, you won't miss a thing.",1572392583,1696432162,False,3,1,0.494726508855819702,1,True,False,False

After the success of The New Order,  many fans were wondering how a sequel can possibly live up to the excellent story and gameplay of the original. I myself had these fears going into playing The New Colossus. While the story is more goofy this time around, Wolfenstein 2 improves the gameplay of both The Old Blood and The New Order. It takes what fans loved about the first two, and kicks it up a few notches. I absolutely loved my time spent playing the game, and it was one of the most fun story-driven FPS games I've played. Is it over the top and too unrealistic at times? Yes. Does it constantly poke jokes and sometimes resorts to using toilet humor? Yes. But that's the entire point. It's both satire and parody, and Wolfenstein 2 delivers both in an astonishing and epic fashion. We get to explore more about the background of ""Terror Billy"", and how he faced many instances of physical and emotional abuse by his father. These aspects help us feel empathy and compassion for William, and better helps us understand his motives. While I preferred the more serious and gritty tone of The New Order, I can't help but feel Wolfenstein 2 is just as good. They are both vastly different, but in unique and interesting ways. Both hold a special place in my heart, and I recommend everyone to play all three of the modern Wolfenstein games. All three were absolutely amazing and worth every penny I spent on them. If you're looking to kick some nazi ass with a compelling and dark story, this game certainly delivers.

[h3]1[/h3]Terrible lazy level design (go from A to B and abrupt fade to black level transition). 

[h1]2[/h1]The game doesn't know if to focus on stealth or action, and let me tell you, if you go guns blazing (I mean you have this amazing akimbo guns in your power) you're gonna get melted really fast.
So you spent most of your time crouching spamming the ""grab"" key for health and pieces of armor from the level. You pump those numbers and for what? Some well placed shots and you are seeing red all over. Rinse and repeat.

[h1]3[/h1]Talking about level design, the art and presentation of some levels is really nice, you probably watched them they are all over the place on Youtube gameplays and Showcases. The very first level inside the Ubot, The Roswell: Downtown District, The confrontation with Mustache' piss boy aaaaand... what else? The very last level maybe? When you go outside the flying fortress to the big showdown and boss fight of the game. That get this. You can just skip all of it if you just run and grab the ladder at the other side. YUP.

[b]Note:[/b] It's not the only ""boss"" fight that you can do this, when you go to the ""occult"" facilities to steal some tech or whatever, this huge Mech appears and you go ""aaaww shiet, this it!"". All for what? Just hide a bit and run to the other end. My god, what a piece of vomit and terrible game design is that?. And before you start saying anything, imagine if Half-life, Doom (2016) or Eternal or whatever it's up your valley, had this mechanic in boss fights. ""Oh, no need to worry son. Boss too difficult? Just run over there to end this fight"". Abysmal. 

Going back to topic, the level design most of the time are short and uninspired. And when they do get your attention it's for brief very short moments. 

[h1]4[/h1]The story. Oh god, where to start. First of all if you played The New Order you will know that at the end of the game, Blazko' simple put, just dies. Finito. Finish. And all in all, it's was a well done send away for the character. Also, the way it's presented there's no way he will come out of that situation. 
But in here, (I guess the money making machine had to continue) you get the laziest bamboozle moment in cartoon story, when they strip all away and he gets rescued anyway, you know, because yeah. I get it, the show must go on, right? But at least do it in a way that it's believable and coherent. And not this BS that was made in 4 seconds in the lamest way possible.

[i]Anyway, that it's just the start. The story from there continues decent enough but soon enough you realize that the characters are always over the top (to try to get your attention: some ""Decapito""! Executions! Some shouting & Drama! Some old dude pissing himself and general morbid but lazy stuff) like Irene Engel that never captures the vibe of Wilhelm Strasse ""Deathshead"" -from The New Order- that with ""less"" he got under your skin really quick. [/i]

Loved characters from the Original get destroyed, have no depth or any character growth except for some cringe one liners. I could go on and on, but in general there's nothing but except one or two cool moments that at this moment you all saw them in Youtube, probably in a cinematic or a direct moment from the game. I wanted more of that but the game died on me at the 10 hour with nothing more to see or watch in terms of more story development. 
The game just doesn't know what to do with old and new characters, it's just in a rush mode jumping for A to D all the time.

[h3]5[/h3]Bad design choices. Not only you take more damage than previous entries, but you start and need to endure 60% of the game with a handicapped health. Yeah, I can hear you scream ""oh, but Aguila, that's because of the Lore/Presentation of the story and then you get a suit that fixes that a-and.."" WELL, FUCK THAT I SAY! Who thought that going around with your nose in the ground spamming the use key reaching for extra health constantly was a good idea? It could had worked for a level or 2, but not for more than half of the game!

Yeah, then you get your head in mode ""fly me to the moon"" and get a cool armor suit (lore) but things don't get better -well just a little bit- because like I said, that armor goes down really fast when getting shot. And you know? When you do get to that point the game just ends. Haha! Yeah, maybe 3 or 4 levels and abrupt ending. And what a shit ending that was, I better don't go deep in that one.

[h3]6[/h3] This actually a good and bad point. There were some -very few- cool acting and voice actors too, like the dude who Acted the Father of Blazkowicz. Even if I don't like the script or what they did to the characters the performance was solid. I hated that dude more than Irene! Haha! 
Oh, and big Mustache Vomit Boy and Art Director Girl did great in that scene, we all know it by now, really adding a tense atmosphere. But that's about it, it's just that scene, they appear and they are all gone. A shame really. 

[h3]7[/h3] Enemy variation and cool designs. Where are they? Where are the new and cool fantasy/tech armor from the previous titles? Well to be honest, the Dogo in armor firing fire was cool -but not entirely new- you get a really few extras I believe but not memorable and nothing more.
So get ready to kill the usual grunts because none of them stuck in my mind to be worth mentioning. 


[i]Anyway, as you can see I left all the ""Politics & Agenda"" moments in the game outside of my review. Why? Because the game it's just that: a bad game. All of the other noise and political aspects of the game I couldn't care less. If anything, it's just juvenile or in your face writing to get a reaction out of you or directed at some groups of people. You take that out and the game it's still poorly made.[/i]

Sadly, B.J Blazko' and Max Hass (my favorite characters from before) don't go out with a bang, but rather in a messy game that didn't know in what direction to go and ended in a short Convoluted Mess.

The game is good. I personally liked it better than New Order but I know there are some choices that are objectively worse.

Gore. Violence. Murder. You get to kill Nazis harder and in larger quantities than previously. The gibbing and limb damage is all pretty great. Most parts of a guy just explode into a red cloud followed by the offending part being gone. Watching the light in a Nazi soldier's eyes go out as he looks at you, totally shocked that he got got by an untermensch, will always be an easy 10/10.

Writing is cartoony and fun. Horton Boone has some of that good Cornbread Communism going which is a huge positive.

Much harder than previous games. I've beaten it multiple times on I Am Terror-Billy and it sometimes feels like the AI knows you're dead before you do. 

Anyone complaining about the wheelchair gimmick or the 50/200 health/armor split is a giant piss baby who never wants any variation to their corridor shooting.

I just got done with New Order and I was looking for a similar experience.  I played through New Order first time on I am Death Incarnate because I'm a vet at FPS games and the original Wolfenstein, Spear of Destiny, and Doom games.  That game was a fantastic experience.  When I started this game I was extremely frustrated by the difference of the game.  I set it also to I am Death Incarnate hoping to struggle but ultimately beat the game.  The game at times seemed impossible early on.  Then I realized one crucial part of this game.   PERKS.  This game expects you to either die and slowly level or to repeat missions to level.  If you look at perks you get ranked levels based on how you kill things.  For example, every 50 people you kill dual wielding you get a larger ammo capacity.  Knowing this you can grow your character over repeat deaths and eventually reach the point the game is easy.  It just sucks because you will die lots of times in the process.  The game literally is like a Dark Souls in difficult, which I typically love.  Having gotten way further now I would definitely recommend this game, but be mindful of what I said above.  You will find yourself leveling a lot at the harder difficulties because you NEED to survive.  If you have that patience of dying and repeating to level, you'll be into this game.

There is more to say but its quite obvious.
Grahpics are incredible, theres still lots of details in the game, voice acting is alright, the guns feel good and theres tons of stuff to do. 
While having more heavy plot and amazing soundtrack.

Well..... none existant balancing, repeatetive af gameplay, forced politics, ugly character models, too many cutscene, nonesensical story, unfunny comedy....

Thats mostly because of the brilliant Level design and funnier story and improved Gameplay and Graphics.

At the beginning of the game you'll get a short rewind of TNO and you have to decide (again) if you save Wyatt or Fergus.

At around half of the game you can also choose between one of three ""skills"" you earn because of an well ""serious injury"". Which also adds a lot to the awesome Gameplay. 

The Game is brilliant and adds a lot to The series. I really liked that funnier approach of a story instead of the total serious settings of TNO and TOB. I mean you literally ride a pig in this Game after you drank a lot of liqour.

I thought I'd write a review of this gem as this and the first Wolfenstein games should be really good value for money in the sales and their excellent games to pick up and play even now we're into next gen gaming  !!!!

Right so you play as BJ Blazkowicz who is the protagonist for the first two games and it's set in a alternate nineteen sixty's where the Nazi's won world war two, right from the very beginning it's guns blazing you really are like a one man army !!!! Fast and slick with powerhouse weaponry from heavy gatling guns mounted on tripods to two double barrel shotguns one in each hand  !!!! it's really quite good fun, awesome  !!! On the later difficulty's I'd say some of it ends up a little hard, but it's definitely doable on the first difficulty that doesn't mock you for playing on easy, excellent !!! The graphics are good too, you won't need an amazing rig to play ether it should run fine on a GTX 1080 like a dream - so don't worry if your on a budget, like i said when it's in the sales it's a steal probably pick it up for a few quid - get all of them for less than twenty notes ( as there's a third game Youngblood and the Old blood stand alone title ) bargain  !!!!

Yeah i recommend Wolfenstein all of them all the time I'm a bit of an advocate for any game that lets you kill Nazi's over and over again in more blood thirsty and violent ways - yeah it's class, it's got everything going for it, it's cheap, it'll run, it's awesome  !!!!! Should you buy it, ""yeah"" you should buy it - pick up all of the next gen wolfenstein games next time there's a sale you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you don't - honest to god  !!!!

Thanx very much people, MUCH LOVE

My biggest problem is that I feel the like the game has an identity issue, you can go stealth in most levels, yet the systems are not deep enough to support that kind of gameplay.

When you want to play fast, the mechanics of the game hold you back. Changing weapons is a pain in the ass. Wolfenstein wants you to take cover and slowly change your weapon instead of going all in and feeling powerful. I played the game below on the second hardest difficulty, which I never normally do.

It retains most of the qualities from Wolfenstein: The New Order and cranks it up a little. There is some awesome weapons at disposal with some cool new mechanics to come with them. Being able to have two separate guns in each hand makes for some innovative game play. The whole idea of killing Nazis is perfect for a game like this, as everyone hates the Nazis and what they did to society. We are enraged at them and being able to go rampant on them in this game just makes you feel good. It was a clever enemy choice. The graphics are very impressive too. Certainly the best in the series so far. The game play is quite fast and you always need to be on the move, but you can also take a stealthy approach which can be more a little more rewarding. Some new abilities were included too, especially when you can choose between three new contraptions. Also, there is an abundance of collectables to obtain which makes for some major replay ability. On the topic of replay ability, there is now seven different difficulties that can be played from. That is sure to get hours up high. Though, on any difficulty the game is still pretty challenging. There are three additional DLC's that you can purchase. Each of them follow a new character that is resisting the Nazis. Much like the main campaign. They all have some interesting motivations and stories but they all have one problem. The game play is the exact same. Nothing new is added at all. The only new thing is the story and the moon environment that you travel to in the second DLC. Furthermore, each DLC ends with you going to assassinate someone in the final mission. There was wasted potential with this DLC. However, the main campaign makes up for this substantially. The antagonist of the main campaign, Frau Engel, is developed really well and we love to hate her. Characters from the previous game make their returns and the usual Wyatt or Fergus choice is available. Each path develops either Wyatt or Fergus, and they both have some tragic problems they need to deal with. Not only that, but some brand new characters were introduced and they are confidentially a warm welcome to the series. Each character has their own personality and traits that make the story all the better. Though, the real highlight of this journey is William Joseph Blazkowicz. He has very intriguing chemistry with a lot of the main characters. The entire backstory for him is so tragic yet it really makes for some great entertainment. We love diving into B.J's past, especially his dad which is another great character. B.J is developed extremely well in this entry and really drives the story forward. There are so many great moments in this game. It all cranks up towards the second half after many great twists and turns in the story. With jam packed Nazi killing action, Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus solidifies itself as the greatest entry in the series to date. 9.5/10",1690548042,1694323433,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

As a sequel to the great Wolfenstein: The New Order, The New Colossus in my opinion, is a huge flop in terms of story and tone. The New Order had its moments of comedy, however largely it remained a gritty, dark alt history with futuristic Nazis winning world war II, which was interesting. In Wolfenstein II however, its like a marvel movie. The humour is too often and too out of place, and feels vastly inconsistent in tone. Sometimes, it shares the exact same dark grittiness of The New Order, before quickly jumping back to dumb marvel humour the next scene.

The story also is just... not as interesting here in my opinion. In The New Order, your goal was clear - form a resistance and assassinate General Deathshead. Here, the plot is so jumpy, it's wild. You'll go from starring in a movie for a retired Adolf Hitler on venus, to detonating nukes, to killing BJs dad, to going undercover in a texas town watching Nazis scold KKK members on their German. While it is indeed entertaining, there is clearly a lack of identity and focus on what story The New Colossus wants to tell.

Now, onto the positives.

I know some people have issues with it, but in my opinion, the gameplay in The New Colossus is incredibly fun. It is very fast paced and a lot more DOOM-like compared to The New Order. Very fast paced, brutal takedowns etc. It's very entertaining. While there are a lot of balancing issues, especially with difficulty and ammo running out fast, the gameplay is largely polished and well done.

The game visually is very done too. The environments, regardless of how well they fit into the story are very beautiful and detailed. The enemy designs too, are very detailed. 

Speaking of enemies, while I wish the devs kept the original designs from The New Order like the Panzerhund and guard robots, the new enemies such as the Zitadelles, and Zerstorers are very interesting to fight and offer a good, fresh variety.

Overall, if you play The New Colossus off the back of The New Order, and are coming for story, I don't massively recommend it, due to the issues. However, if you're not interested in the story and want to fuck up some nazi's day, then it can be pretty fun.

I mean who wouldn't enjoy killing nazis while dual wielding any weapon you like ( you can combine 2 different types of weapon too). The game itself is very enjoyable , nice graphics , quite a good story thanks to it's foundation TNO. It pains me to say this but unfortunately there are some cons. You are in a battlefield killing some nazis and what happens ? BOOM the game randomly crashes literally for no reason at all ( happened to me twice ) Half the way into the game it gets a little bit repetitive because the game gives you some side quests which are all about revisiting the previous places that you were fighting to complete them, you get back to the same places to kill ""important oberkommandos"" nothing more. Do you want to achieve all 3 of the contraptions ? Well good for you go back to the places that you have already been, kill the oberkommando and find the contraption. Oh by the way the last contraption is literally located on the last place that you visit on story so you will have absolutely no chance to try it on story missions. Well you can still try it by revisiting the places and doing some side missions but it is not for me. Anyways overall as i said the game itself is good, very enjoyable you will have a really good time that's for sure. But i would recommend you to wait for sale and then purchase it.

The story and characters only got crazier and more fun from TNO, and had some really insane moments, but unfortunately, New Colossus suffers from difficulty balancing and overall slightly inferior gunplay quality imo. 

To elaborate on the gameplay issues, first major problem is the difficulty setting of the game. I started off on I Am Death Incarnate (same as my TNO playthrough) and soon found myself struggling to survive. Enemies sometimes would randomly hit me from the back when I had made sure to clear the rear before moving, enemies overall felt spongier, and the bullet hit feedback was absolutely terrible, whether it was while taking or dealing damage. Often times I'd hit an enemy hard enough to know that the amount of hits would surely take him out, but they'd apparently get invincibility frames during their ""stumbling after being hit"" animation, making them much more tedious and annoying to deal with. Another issue was that even on lower difficulties, you can get destroyed from full health and armor to zero in a matter of 2 seconds, which is where I wish the balancing had been done better. This I think resulted from the fact that the game does not give you enough feedback when you're getting hit, and by the time you realize you're in danger, its too late. On top of all this, the ""lean from cover"" system was a lot more finnicky and inconsistent unlike TNO, contributing to the gunplay issues even further. Now if you're going into this game after a long time after TNO, or without having played TNO, then don't get your hopes down, as most of these issues are noticable only if you have TNO as a frame of reference, which I did.

On an absolute scale, I'd definitely give this game an 8/10, which is what I gave TNO. However, as I mentioned, since TNO did a lot of things better, I feel like this was a bit of a step down for me, so a 7/10 seems more accurate.",1693474406,1693474485,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
612880,145345165,76561197980565944,338,79,1381,0,1381,1693366674,"Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus starts off with an awesome intro that immediately puts you right back into all the action you’ve come to expect as the legendary B.J. Blazkowicz. I have been playing Wolfenstein since 1992 and have many fond memories of it, Quake, and of course, DOOM. I was so happy to see them continue this from the two previous games in this new era of the franchise.

Jumping into this game, I felt the graphics looked great and the story was once again a solid one where it captures a lot of different emotions. I enjoyed that it still kept that serious undertone to everything but also had some lighthearted and even hilarious moments. I also loved that there is a Manhattan level since I’m a New Yorker and all.

As I kept playing, the story was definitely a memorable one as I thought all the characters added a nice touch to everything. It was a very immersive experience from beginning to end, especially getting to see the backstory of Blazkowicz which helped fill in a lot of gaps. Not just from these newer Wolfenstein video games but from the originals decades ago.

I truly loved the fast-paced action of Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus with all the great new weapons, instant kills, and the option to go in full Rambo mode or stealth depending on the situation. All the levels looked great and the destruction elements in them from pillars, fire extinguishers, computers, walls, etc. added another great layer of realism. All in all, this is a pretty fun and short game with yet another killer soundtrack that goes perfectly with all the sheer violence and gore.

Now, the only thing I have to complain about are the annoying bugs I found while playing. There are still some potentially game-breaking bugs where you get stuck because of invisible walls or things that block you from normally walking. Basic things like going up a few steps or crouch-walking underneath bleachers to advance through a level can get you stuck permanently and you can’t go through for whatever reason.

The only way I was able to overcome this in certain levels that needed me to obviously move to progress was to save your game, quit, and restart Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus in Safe mode. That worked like a charm and if you ever encounter that issue, please do that as it worked for me at least. I also had to do that when guns didn’t work at all against enemies as it glitched out for whatever reason. I had to save, quit, and restart in Safe mode for it to work as it should.

As I mentioned earlier, it’s a pretty short game that I breezed right through. I was excited for the DLC but honestly, it was a bit of a letdown. The DLC was okay but nothing new or original. Just different characters replaying levels and maps I’ve already completed in the main campaign. This was definitely lackluster especially since you’re playing with characters you’ve never heard about until the DLC.

It would have been significantly better if they did this with the actual characters you’ve met along the way. Imagine doing a level as Sigrun Engel, Max Hass, or even Zofia Blazkowicz instead of these random people? That was a missed opportunity for sure as the DLC was pretty boring and pretty easy to get through since they’re all just short missions using special abilities.

I give Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus a 4/5 as it’s definitely worth playing if you also grew up with the Wolfenstein franchise or want a fun, quick, awesome single-player FPS game to play. The weapons are incredible, the story is great, and it has some pretty funny moments that I genuinely laughed out loud to. The only thing is you will find a few bugs here and there, especially one that looks like you’re blocked by an invisible wall that can get frustrating since it messes up the natural flow of the game. Either way, I’d highly recommend this game as it’s such a fun rollercoaster of a ride.",1693431274,1693431274,True,1,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,False

The guns sound and feel weak. They just make little clicky sounds. They sound broken and unsatisfying.
 
The head bobbing and movement is so janky and bouncy. This issue was in TNO and TOB too, but it was probably around ~75% better and more tolerable than in W2:TNC. The amount of camera shake makes it hard to see what you're doing when it really matters. Usually some head bob is done less severely in good shooters and doesn't affect me, but this game just makes me constantly disoriented. The sprint animation is truly awful and shaky. Add on top of that, BJ gets stuck on geometry constantly, making controlling him a miserable experience.

The writing is obnoxiously edgy. It forces a constant stream of mind numbing, over the top interactions, one after another that drag on way too long. It also has a really annoying leftist slant to everything. I don't care about this extremely unlikable feminist's dislike of men nor her monologue on testicles, is this really dialogue in a game? The Nazi killing an old comrade from TNO and simulating cunnilingus on your other alive friend with its decapitated head while laughing is not funny, or a good device to make you want to defeat her. Really I don't know what reaction that scene wanted from me, it was just off-putting, trying so hard to shock. Really it was just the writer badly overestimating their ability to write a shocking, irreverent scene. 

This game really is just a fundamental misunderstanding of why W:TNO and W:TOB were good games, and totally Flanderized the whole thing. Its really just TNO again, with every aspect of it done poorly, or flat out ruined.",1617092422,1693425319,False,1,0,0.496774196624755859,0,True,False,False

just as the same holds true in The New Order, killing Nazis is basically the best in this game.

Continuing the story from The New Order, BJ has awoken from a coma to his besieged U-Boat. Killing Nazis while piloting a wheelchair is an intriguing and fun concept but the game quickly advances to an upgradeable exo-suit of sorts to make up for the fact BJ is now disabled. 

Story-wise, the game is excellent, if a bit poorly paced. BJ remains the stoic hand of the Resistance while having a strong internal reflection. Continuing his relationship with his pregnant wife, Anya Oliwa, BJ fears a death he knows is imminent and laments leaving his wife and unborn children behind, never being able to achieve his vision from the first game and also leaving them in a world ruled by the Nazis. Most of the Resistance characters from the New Order, including Fergus or Wyatt (you're given a choice of timeline in the beginning) return with a few new faces. Some players will object to the overt political messaging regarding racial discrimination, but I personally believe that not only is it still necessary for many to hear, but also in my opinion, its tastefully done to not intrude on the experience. Cutscenes and other story moments do tend to drag on a bit but not too long.

Gameplay is basically the same as The New Order with some new weapons, a new weapon upgrade system, some new abilities/perks, and a few shakeups, particularly the first level in a wheelchair. Its a LOT harder than the first one so be pragmatic and do an easier difficulty.

graphically, the game easily matches most modern games, has new takedown animations, more blood and gore, and is generally better than TNO in every way while matching the style. sounds, Mick Gordon's soundtrack, and the VO quality are  all also universally excellent.",1693378276,1693378276,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Kill Nazis in a high-octane shooter where we follow a, practically, immortal soldier accompanied by witty dialogues, action-packed and fun scenes, plus some amazing music.

[b]Music: [/b] 8/10

Top-notch. Manages to immerse you in the story, from the ambient sounds, to sound effects from weapons and voices from different characters.

[b]Visuals: [/b] 8/10

Just as solid, if not better than the last entry. The only downside that I will include is that when being shot at, there is no longer a visual cue from the direction.

[b]Gameplay: [/b] 8/10

It’s harder than the previous entry, that’s for starters, so be ready for a hell of a ride. Besides that, the game remains pretty much the same with some changes to perks and weapons. Personally, perk systems work fine, but some perk options to improve them (looking at you, return to sender perk), are simply too tiresome or marginally useful to use.

[b]Story: [/b] 8/10

The story is much darker, less hopeful than the previous game. At least through 3/4 of it. Missions seem less about killing Nazis and liberating the world, and more about just staying ahead and trying to make things work. The ending was a bit abrupt for my taste, but we’ll-deserved. For at least a little while, it seems Blazkowicz will be able to relax and smile.

It runs on a new engine and that can be felt, the game is much more vibrant, sharper graphics and action is visceral.

The FPS combat is much more challenging than in New Order and the only correct way to play is on the ""I Am Death Incarnate!"" difficulty, don't pus out.

The Story is great and level design is awesome. It is not worse than the 1st game, but is weaker.
The ending feels a bit rushed and the Kill List unlocks only in the later half of the game.

Why are they sending a pregnant woman into combat? This is unacceptable and ridiculous!
Was this meant to be a ""girlboss"" kinda thing? (I wouldn't be surprised after the Youngblood fiasco)

The lack of manual chapter select is stupid and forces to restart whole game.
Why is it not present? It was present in NEW ORDER and OLD BLOOD. wtf happened?


Overall,
I am glad that the game accurately portrays Nazis and their totalitarian regime and does not present them as mustache twirling cartoon villains.
It shows them for what they are, morally-degraded subhuman cowards that are a disgrace to the human race.
So glad we get to slash and slaughter the Nazi skum just like my grandparents destroyed them in WW2.

Fantastic game!

2. The side missions are meaningless. They don't give you any real reason to wanna do them unless you're a completionist.

P.S. They have sectioned the difficulty levels even more and while UBER was the highest difficulty in previous games which was available from the get go, in this one Death Incarnate is the highest you can play on and to unlock the last one you need to finish the game on Death Incarnate (I think). 

P.P.S. Game's difficulty has gone significantly up but that is because of multiple factors including, but not limited to,  more enemy density along with a lower chance of being able to stealth through most stages as the commander is usually in the thick of the enemy distribution. Even if you kill a guy who barely spots you the alarms go off.

The Nazi killing is also amped up, however I played all these games on hard difficulty, and Wolfenstein II was much much easier. mostly because the enemies aren't total bullet sponges and actually die when you pelt them with a full clip. It felt really good but didn't give as much of a challenge. The movement feels VERY VERY SQUIRRELY. If you sprint at all you just run at 90 mph zipping past everything. Even adjusting your FOV to 100 doesn't make it feel any better. Overall, I preferred not to sprint. Very squirrely movement. Maybe this game is meant to be played on a gamepad idk.

I didn't even bother with any of the side content, which I usually go out of my way to do in most games. I just flat out didn't care about any upgrades besides what I was finding throughout the regular levels.

The gunplay is highly enjoyable. Pretty much every level has multiple routes and ways to succeed. Stealth is challenging without being punishing, (and also entirely optional.) The graphics, even in 2023, are superb.

The premise of fighting Nazis who’ve taken over the United States is, in and of itself, inherently political. The writers, to their credit, don’t shy away from that. They’ve built a resistance full of heroic, flawed, interesting characters, who will do anything to defeat the most evil force the world has ever known.

Pros:
 - Great graphics.  Some parts of this game were awe-inspiring in how pretty and cool they looked.
 - Fun as hell gun-play.
 - Cool levels and environments.
 - Interesting characters.
 - A ridiculous but fun story.
 - ""I'm from Arizona.""
 - Really stable performance.  Some negative reviews of this game say that the game crashes constantly.  I never once had it crash.  At worst, the FPS dropped because too many particle effects were on screen for a moment, but other than that, I'd say this is the most stable AAA game I've played in a while.

Cons:
 - Weird difficulty spike near the end of the game.  The game has a fairly standard difficulty curve, but then it seems to spike for no reason near the end.  It goes from challenging but fun arenas to arenas that felt difficult for the sake of being difficult.  There was one where I could only maybe pick off one or two enemies stealthily before a Laserhund would track me down, no matter where I hid.
 - Unsatisfying ending from a gameplay perspective.  The final sequence of the game just feels like any other level, except it adds in a new enemy type that'll wreck your shit.
 - Annoying VRAM bug.  There's been a bug since some update years ago that throws an error up saying that you have run out of VRAM, and recommends restarting the game on a lower graphics preset.  This is just a bug, though, as pretty much any halfway decent card has more than enough VRAM to run this game.  You can mute the message, but it only lasts for that play session, so you have to deal with it again when you close and reopen the game.

Overall though, the game is more than worth playing, especially if you want a game where you can kill Nazis.

- Perks system was an utter garbage comparing to previous games. Nothing memorable or worth taking notes of.
- Playing this game on ""I am death incarnate"" is just a whole next level of shitshow. Sponge enemies, enemies scripted to spawn behind you. One shot of a normal soldaten can take up to 75 armor, in a late game armor is not even worth being a damage buffer - everything just kills you in one shot effectively. No buff perks that allows to expand health/armor. Playing with weak Billy's body that has 50HP for 50% of the game is just atrocious game design. Courtyard fight level was probably the finishing line when game turned from good to being a complete garbage combat wise. 
- Movement system is complete trash - you can get stuck crouching, running away can get you stuck on invisible walls, you cannot jump down or crawl through spaces because of some collision issues. Some of the storyline objectives get softlocked in inaccessible states, etc.
- Enemies AI quality severly degraded comparing to previous games. They are detecting you through the walls, shoot through the walls, they can hear silenced weapons and read your inputs. Since level design was rushed and was not made in mind of having cover spots for AI, they compensated AI by making them mobile and feed of ESP features and teleports - enemies will literally track you down through the walls as they walk and will occasionally teleport to you when out of line of sight.

Incredible game, just like the first two, but with some caveats. A few annoying glitches kept bothering me throughout the game, like the game constantly claiming I'm out of VRAM when I'm not (could be a memory leak but it doesn't seem to matter if I keep playing after this), the game sometimes blacking out for a second during some cutscenes (not sure what the deal was it seems to happen randomly), and very infrequent but still present crashes. Because of this I have a difficult time saying it's outright *better* than the first two, but the ambition and fun is absolutely still there. Shootin' Nazis is as fun as ever. There's a few balance issues I noticed (some enemies do *way* too much damage), but its not that bad. 

Writing and story wise, it's a home run IMO. People mad that a game about shooting Nazis in America has even slightly less than hard right wing politics is extremely funny. Characters are written as well if not better than the first games. You do spend the entire game chasing after a single main villain though, which is a little disappointing after the first game's multiple main bad guys, but she's such a great villain that it's fine.

All in all, a great game with a few annoying glitches that shouldn't ruin your ability to enjoy it.

[list]
[*]The art team did a fantastic job with creating the environments. Each location is very detailed and you can tell care was put into each level.
[*]Voice acting is top notch and care was put into voicing the protagonist's thoughts and feelings throughout the game.
[/list]
[h1]The Negatives[/h1]
[list]
[*]The writing is shallow and predictable. Plot points are unbelievable and often achieved through deus ex machina.
[*]The strong white female character of the prior entry is promptly killed off and replaced with a strong black female character. This character is new to the game's crew and yet nobody questions her suddenly taking over complete command over all strategic decisions making it feel forced and created for the sake of diversity rather than being a well written plot point. It's so on the nose that she even takes over the prior character's bedroom.
[*]Character development is shallow. In my opinion the character with the most development and best writing is the protagonist's father who isn't even key to the game's plot and is only present in a few flashback sequences.
[*]Game play is serviceable but tries to appeal to multiple audiences without fully committing to any of them. There are RPG elements but a talent tree is lacking and is instead just a series of perks which are upgraded by performing X number of actions. Stealth is presented as viable but the levels generally don't seem to be designed well for it. Quick character movement and the option to dual wield firearms makes it seem like running and gunning would be viable but enemies very quickly take down your health without strategic use of cover. Despite this there's a mechanic called commanders who call in constant reinforcements until eliminated and they're usually placed at the end of a level which encourages the player to make their way to them as quickly as possible. All of these design contradictions make it feel like it's impossible to play optimally as each play style falls short.
[*]Weapon design is imbalanced where certain weapons are massively better than others. This along with plentiful ammo makes it so there's never a reason to use more than the same 1 or 2 best options.

The whole game inherits all the great features from the previous Wolfenstein and adds upon it. But what impressed me the most were the [b]graphics and optimisation! Seriously, once you play this you will love your GPU even more <3[/b]. The whole game visual felt like a tech demo because it looks so damn good and runs so damn great that I started to question why we are heading downhill lol.

[b]I can blindly recommend this to anyone looking for a great FPS game.[/b] I liked DLCs too despite it having no relation to the main story and doing some horrible level recycling here and there but it was alright with anime-type story videos because I already felt the game is priced much lower than the quality the base game is offering.

The only reasons I gave it 9 instead of 10 were the [b]low-quality cutscenes and a little less engaging story[/b] than I would like. The story felt like someone who is trying to be cool but actually isn't. I know you all remember games where cutscenes are of higher quality than the game itself but this is completely opposite lol. They felt at least 2 generations older to me it looks so horrible when the game switches to it in between missions. All this sacrifice just to avoid wait time during level loading and save on storage space with that low-quality videos? IMO not worth it. Anyways, great game.

I can't help but think ""I just miss shooting things!!""

Immersive sims are some of my favourite games - The Dishonoured series being one of the best in my opinion. The environments are dense and complex with a lot to take in BUT the action is slow and methodical allowing the time to plan and investigate your surroundings. Wolfenstein 2 has the same approach...meshed within a First Person Shooter setup. For me, they do not work well together. It affects your enjoyment during the action and only serves to slow down the pace confusing the player.

The previous Woflenstein games balanced the world/action very well. Just enough story but the focus was on the shooting whilst providing a few options on approaching the enemy. This sequel feels like a movie with a bit of game-play woven into it. If they had made an animated movie then there's a chance it could have won awards as the script and characters are very, very good BUT this is an FPS...is it needed?? Add to that very complicated map layouts and star cards, art, letters, postcards, diaries, newspapers, weapon upgrades, 10+ ammo types, health pickups and armour pickups...I can't help but think Machine Games have ""over cooked"" their game. Progress and growth are great but there is a limit...

I find myself pressing ""E"" to pickup items more than I do ""LMB"" to shoot!! And trying to pickup items off the floor amongst a pile of guns and bodies just feels stupid...edging forwards and backwards until you get the icon on screen you're looking for...and that's when things are quiet. Doing this in the midst of a battle is pure stress fuel!! Need a grenade?...sure, run around and have a look but are you going to notice the grenade in a bucket down besides the cupboard?? Or how about the armour folded neatly stashed on the bottom of a book shelf??? Cute and intelligent but does it work in a gun fight...NO!!!

When playing this game I find myself moaning more than I'm enjoying...if you just run through the levels shooting everything that moves then you're missing a lot of detail. On the other hand, take time to enjoy the detail and the shooting gets in the way. The two do not mix very well at all. You need simpler environments to allow the player to concentrate on the shooting (Doom 2016 achieved this quite easily in how it managed pickups/ammo/story telling.) This Wolfenstein game feels like Doom set on a Dishonoured map....

5/10 - Forgets it's FPS roots and tries to be an immersive sim which over complicates the game-play. The guns just aren't good enough for most battles making upgrades absolutely essential (they all suffer from small clips and bad accuracy!) Gun fights are over too quickly on easy and near impossible on hard. Environments are way too busy and complicated making navigating them an absolute pain the ass!! Item management gives you a headache and stresses you out as it's just not accessible in a gun fight. And an un-skipable intro which makes playing on UBER a complete waste of time!!!

It is still great to plough through enemies dual wielding shotguns or assault rifles, and the 3 short stories of the Freedom Chronicles - while being very unspectacular storywise - are very much worth playing, especially ""Gunslinger Joe"" and ""Agent Silent Death"". But overall, there are too many mechanics cramped into this. You can get three different contraptions that alter your playstyle, two different signature weapons (like in the first game of the series) and there are so many different collectibles which needlessly stretch the playing time. You also have to revisit every sector to kill Übercommanders and collect secrets to get the game to 100%.
But I love the action of the game. Apart from the Agent Silent Death DLC I did not use stealth at all, because the gunplay is so great and over the top. Another aspect that really makes Wolfenstein 2 work is the setting. There are so many hateable and evil antagonists and the vision of a 1960s USA that is ruled by the nazis that somehow won WWII is shockingly good. There are so many ridculously fanatic ideas of how the world might look like in such a scenario.
As an action game I can fully recommend Wolfenstein 2, but if you don't like collecting stuff and doing the same quests over and over again just to complete the game, you might get through this in just 5 hours or even less.
Additional note on the difficulty: for me, the 2nd highest difficulty, ""death incarnate"", is already too much, but ""mein Leben"" is only for insane people.

The gameplay loop is incredibly repetitive, revolving around killing commanders to stop reinforcements spawning; whilst this is a good idea it is over used and the game feels like a game of hide and seek with Nazi Commanders, nearly every section in this game involves this mechanic, meaning you're forced into stealth or frantically sprinting past all the enemies to kill the commander as quickly as possible.

The story is mediocre at best, with some of the writing foreshadowing what was to come with Wolfenstein Youngblood.
Grace is the biggest offender of the story; You come across her after a few hours into the game and she joins the Resistance. However from the first moment she is in the Resistance she becomes the leader, without any vote or acknowledgement from anyone. This makes no sense, why would she be the leader after being there for 5 minutes over people such as BJ Blazkowicz, Anya or Seth Roth.

This franchise went from tense, gritty nightmare fuel and transitioned into a Girlboss comedy. 

Gun play is an improvement and the customisation has been expanded but this seems pointless when you have to stealth everywhere to kill commanders unless you're playing on the easier difficulties.

The majority of achievements didn't work for me as well, including simple ones such as complete the dlc's which take about 20 minutes

It feels a bit different than the prior games, but I really love some of the new ideas and mechanics. This may be my favourite game in the series.
What I can't recommend necessarily are the higher difficulties, not because they are more difficult, but because I have the feeling that the games mechanics like enemy spawns and weapon balance are just a bit off and feel more like you're always gambling (especially enemy spawns seem to be pretty random and occure quite often at a place behind you where you just stood) than actually playing a harder game mode.

There is also a huge problem with some of the other mechanics like reloading or picking up items that just sometimes refuse to work which is quite annoying, especially the picking up items one is extremely frustrating in combat situations.

Some story elements are of course pretty ridiculous and there is plot hole after plot hole, but it's still a piece of fiction and otherwise the story can be very fun and interesting. The enviroments are awesome (you come around a lot), the gun handling still feels pretty good, the style of the game is very unique, the new mechanics are pretty cool and I had a blast trying them out and leveling guns and perks.",1691076380,1691529175,True,1,0,0.522551536560058594,0,True,False,False

Some of the good things:

- Some great unique ""gimmick"" gameplay moments, like the wheelchair and panzerhund gameplay widely shown in the trailers. I knew they were coming but enjoyed them all the same.
- Contraptions - a mechanic unlocked for the latter half of the game - can add a variety of spice and replay-ability to the game.  
- Cutscenes are very good and cinematic; I sometimes felt like I was watching an animated film because it was done so well.
- Most of the guns are useful and feel powerful, especially as you unlock some of the upgrades. But not as interesting as TNO - see in ""some of the bad things"" below...
- You can dual wield with any weapon in either hand, rather than just the same weapon in both hands like the previous game. This can create some great combos; like silenced pistol with (louder) silenced sub machinegun for stealth levels (pistol for general usage, sub machinegun if you need to spray), or assault rifle with a heavy hitter like the LaserKraftWerk or Kampfpistol (rocket launcher). It's quite fun to play around with the combinations. This system has it's downsides though...  - see in ""some of the bad things"" below...
- The game is much prettier than TNO.
- There are bonus missions where you go back into previous levels to complete optional objectives. They are quite fun but also fairly bland as there is none of the tight scripting that exists in the core levels.

Some of the bad things:

- The game does not always communicate it's mechanics well - for example, when you select the Contraptions, it explains them in terms of offering different ways to manoeuvre around the environment; and you choose based on that. What is doesn't tell you is that you also get a few bonus perks. Some of these are extremely useful and I ended up regretting my decision for a while. It wasn't until later when I discovered that two of the ""bonus missions"" can give you the two contraptions that you didn't select - again, this is not explained (or if it is, I totally missed it!)
- The story has a moment which throws all stakes out of the window and which ruined my suspension of disbelief more than some of the moments from the previous game. I don't care that they put some lore in the explain it, it had me raising my eyebrows.
- The hub world feels much more dull and dead than Kreisau Circle did in TNO
- The unlocks for weapons are just numbers upgrades for the most part. In TNO, upgrades gave the weapon different abilities, like an underslung rocket-launcher, or turning your sniper rifle into a plasma rifle. There's nothing like that in this game, and I think you're expected to meet those needs with the new any-weapon-in-any-hand-dual-wielding system.
- The new dual wielding system - and weapon selection in general - is incredibly fiddly to use, at least on mouse and keyboard. In TNO, I dynamically switched between weapons on-the-fly to respond to the needs of the battle. In TNC, I found the UI too cumbersome, and generally picked the weapons I would be using before starting the engagement. Sometimes this meant I had a heavy hitter weapon in my offhand going unused ""just in case"".... which is a shame considering in TNO I could have had increased firepower until I needed the heavy hitter. I have to imagine this system was designed for consoles because it does not control well at all on PC.
- My biggest complaint about this game is that you die too quickly. I have played and completed TNO, TOB, and TNC on the hardest difficulty for each game. In TNO and TOB, I found it generally quite fair to play and I usually knew what was hurting me and had time to react and put them down. In TNC, it was incredibly common for something to kill me but I have no idea what it was. To put it in context, I can start a fight with the maximum possible health and armour and still be dead in less than a second. This makes some sections of the game - particularly the stealth ones - quite frustrating, as ""going loud"" accidentally can become a death sentence, whereas in TNO and TOB, you adapt and have a great fight. In TNC, this lead to me playing in more of a ""campy"" style rather than engaging in ""push-forward"" gameplay.
- The enemy variety felt much smaller in this game than TNO, which is a real shame. TNO's roster was diverse and fairly challenging. TNC's roster is quite pathetic; even the ultra-heavy robot Zitadelle can go down with one well-placed fully-charged shot from the LaserKraftWerk to it's very obvious weak spot. I missed the Guard Robots and Heavy Robots from TNO.
- There is a lack of unique boss fights in this game. TNO had some really memorable ones. I would say that there is only one true boss fight in this game, and that it's not very cinematic...
- The plot jumps all over the place. I always understood why I was where I was, but it took a few leaps and felt like it skipped a few steps along the way. There is one part of the story in particular where essentially a whole mission happens ""off camera"", and I would have liked to play it.",1690239064,1690239064,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

update
nvm I found out why it was doing this my game save somehow corrupted lucky I have an auto save from 13 minutes back steam support was no help 

about the game horrible visual design why are the ladders the same color as the room, that and running in circles in the ""u boat"" hub area nothing in the visual design makes sense and sadly it lacks a visual marker to tell you where to go 99% of the time wish I could play tell the end but steam is crashing when lunching.

the story is same as before boo hoo nazi's bad with them making the world more militarized and lifting people out of poverty in there own way, I still have no clue why the main character is doing what he's doing he has no clear reasons other then ""boo hoo I hate my dad"" with a mix of a dad and mother that are clearly not genetically related, that and the dad just hates everyone even forces the son {main character} to kill the family dog, seems like everyone fighting the nazi's is just either, disabled, black, or war vet just seems like this was a huge missed opportunity to tell a compelling story, its like the writers are busy being stuck in the black cube of Saturn cult symbolism like the Bethesda logo or the box head suit you get at the start, story is a letdown

honestly the graphics look pretty amazing although the fact that the art direction is completely nonsensical is really a letdown the artwork does not coordinate with the gameplay on what you're doing easily leading the player to run around in circles for what feels like hours

if you like randomly mass killing and pretending your some power fantasy god killing nazi's with good graphics its an amazing game for that, everything else is half baked with some small funny moments",1689796776,1689812159,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sometimes absurd, sometimes horrific, it's often hard to balance out - but the writers did it well and created some interesting and iconic characters, especially with the antagonist Frau Engel.

On the gameplay side, you can expect rewarding shootouts with heavy, and dual-wielding weapons that actually feel heavy when they penetrate the Nazis. It's a good mix of modern and old-school shooting mechanics. My only gripe would be that compared to The New Order, there are little to no real bosses like in the first game. Also, the ending could've been a bit more epic and overall, and overall, the game felt a bit shorter than its predecessor.

The side missions are nothing to talk about but let you squeeze a bit more playtime out of it.

Review:

Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is a brutal and action-packed first-person shooter that delivers an adrenaline-fueled experience set in an alternate history where Nazis have taken over the world. As the iconic resistance fighter William ""BJ"" Blazkowicz, you'll embark on a gripping and emotionally charged journey filled with intense gunfights, jaw-dropping set pieces, and a thought-provoking narrative.

The game picks up where its predecessor, Wolfenstein: The New Order, left off, immersing players in a world oppressed by the Nazi regime. The story is dark and gritty, tackling mature themes such as fascism, oppression, and sacrifice. It offers a well-crafted narrative that explores the depths of human resilience and the consequences of standing up against overwhelming odds.

One of the highlights of Wolfenstein II is its immersive and expertly designed gameplay. The gunplay is fast-paced and satisfying, allowing you to wield an arsenal of powerful weapons against hordes of Nazi soldiers and high-tech monstrosities. The level design offers a good mix of open-ended exploration and linear action sequences, keeping the gameplay fresh and engaging.

The game's difficulty can be quite challenging, even on lower settings, which may deter some players seeking a more casual experience. However, for those seeking a true test of their skills, the higher difficulty levels offer a demanding and rewarding gameplay experience.

The characters in Wolfenstein II are memorable and well-developed, with strong voice performances that breathe life into them. BJ Blazkowicz is a charismatic and determined protagonist, surrounded by a diverse cast of allies who each have their own motivations and struggles. The writing is sharp, blending moments of intense action with heartfelt and emotional storytelling that will keep you invested in their journey.

Visually, the game is a treat. The detailed environments and atmospheric lighting contribute to the overall immersive experience. From the grim streets of occupied America to the twisted laboratories of the Nazis, each location is meticulously crafted, further enhancing the game's dark and oppressive atmosphere.

While the game excels in many areas, it does have a few minor flaws. The pacing occasionally feels uneven, with moments of intense action followed by slower narrative-driven segments. Additionally, some players may find the story's alternate history elements to be polarizing, as it takes liberties with historical events for the sake of its fictional narrative.

Overall, Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is a thrilling and intense ride that delivers a compelling story, exhilarating gameplay, and a well-realized alternate history setting. It offers a solid challenge for first-person shooter enthusiasts and provides a memorable and thought-provoking narrative experience. If you're looking for a game that combines fast-paced action, a gripping story, and a healthy dose of Nazi-killing, Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is a title worth adding to your library.",1689434150,1689434150,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

เกมนี้เป็นเกมที่จะพาเราเข้าสู่ยุคที่ประเทศไทยนั้นล้าหลังจนเกินไป เราเป็นคนที่รักในประชาธิปไตย เลยหยิลปืนขึ้นมาต่อกรกับพวกเสื้อเหลือง แต่ด้วยเหตุการ์ณตอนสุดท้าย ที่เราสู้กับเรือดำน้ำขนาดใหญ่ ที่พบว่าข้างในที่ว่างเปล่าแท้จริงมีระเบิด ทำให้เราถูกแรงระเบิดอัดแล้วเข้าสู้โคม่าเป็นเวลา5เดือน เนื้อเรื่องภาคแรก

และภาคสอง เรากลับมาอีกครั้ง โดยแค่ฉากเปิดก็เดือดมากแล้ว เรายังคงมีความสามารถเหมือนเดิมทุกอย่าง แต่เพิ่มความสามารถอีกสามสายตอนช่วงกลางของเกม

โดยในครั้งนี้ผู้นำม็อบของเราถูกอุ้มไป ทำให้เราต้องหาผู้นำคนใหม่ที่จะมานำม็อบอีกครั้ง แล้วก็เป็นหน้าที่ของเราที่จะต้องไปถล่มรังของทหารที่ลุงตู่ ได้ใช้เงินประเทศไทยซื้ออาวุธไปจนหนี้ท่วมตัว

สรุป 10/10 เหตุการ์ณจริง
10/10 ความเดือด
10/10 ความแทคติคคอล

612880,141747480,76561199044586619,0,2,2105,0,347,1692720776,"Story : I preferred the darker tone of new order. New Colossus has a very over the top tone but it isn't too far from crazed cult or mecha hitler from earlier games. Some chracters can be a bit cringe but still had enough emotional moments in the story for me. B.J trying to audition infront of Hitler is one of the finest moment of gaming.

Gameplay : It's quite different from the first game. You may like it or hate it. I loved it. B.J is a lot less tanky , you can go down pretty easily in higher difficulties , it's a lot less like rehashed nazi doom game and the focus is much more on positioning and choosing covers and right moments to be aggressive. 

Stealth is harder than the first game. In new order you almost always has a very obvious secondary route that will get you to the commander alone. Secondary routes are much less obvious in this game and commanders are placed deeper into the levels. 

Gunplay is crunchy . Dual shotguns or marksman assasult rifle , take your pick. 

Gore is ramped up.

PC PORT : Runs like a dream. .No stutters , no hitches. Makes me miss ID tech games. Played on rx6700xt. 

Inshort : Gameplay and tone has changed over from the first game . Your enjoyment will depend how you will react to them. Apparently game had pc issues at launch. But it's a fine game imo. A lot of hate on steam from members of a particular political mindset along the line of ""Not ALL NAZI "", ridiculous for this series.

Have a good day , reader.

And the levels themselves weren't as cool as they could be. They had a massive opportunity to show us an alternate reality of America where the nazis won WWII and we really didn't get to see it (except for the Roswell mission). It just kinda seems like you're doing missions through either ruins or bland nazi bases the entire game. I guess I just wanted to see more with it. I'm writing this right after I completed it.

612880,141040723,76561198009562083,0,1,1235,0,1235,1678682952,"PROS:

1) The game is surprisingly well-optimised. I can't really recall any moments except for maybe 2 where I experienced visible stutters and this was even in situations where my screen was drowning in bodies and bullets.

2) The visual design is pretty good and the shooting is fairly satisfying. Enemies aren't bullet-sponge chores to mow down and doming a trooper or vaporising one with a laser looks appropriately cool and entertaining.

IT'S NICE I GUESS:

1) The game has a slightly larger weapon variety than its predecessors and they are somewhat more unique. I do not put this in the pros column because it's still a somewhat boring arsenal. You've got a melee weapon that can be thrown, a pistol, a machine gun, a machine gun that also functions as a sniper rifle with the appropriate upgrades, a shotgun, a laser gun (or a sticky bomb launcher) and a handheld rocket launcher. With the exception of the handheld rocket launcher this is basically the exact same load-out as The New Order (that one had the machine gun with an under-barrel rocket launcher instead). You also have 4 disposable heavy weapons to play with - a machine-shotgun which won't hit shit unless you're standing literally right next to an enemy, a laser which fires a continuous beam, a flamethrower which shoots fireballs instead of a stream of flames and what I can only describe as the BFG from Doom except completely useless and taking so goddamn long to fire that you're better off using something else (it's also only available in the second half of the final level of the game).

2) Fergus once again is the only character worth a damn in the entire story because he's at the very least funny instead of being cringy or outright boring to listen to. He's also the only character whose cutscenes I wasn't tempted to skip through. Still, Machine Games seem to have learned their lesson in that picking Wyatt actually gives you a brand new weapon to play with (the sticky bomb launcher) so there is at least SOME reason to pick his dopey ass in this game.

CONS:

1) The level design is fucking atrocious. Not only are the levels painfully short but they can all be summed up as the following - shooting arena -> corridor to next arena -> shooting arena -> corridor to next arena -> shooting arena, ad nauseam. Each arena has either one or two commanders that will raise the alarm and call down waves upon waves of goons on your ass the moment you so much as breathe which might be tense the first time it happens but gets tedious very soon after.

2) The boss fights are virtually nonexistent. For all that I think The New Order was a piece of crap, it did at least have one good boss fight (the London Monitor) and realised the importance of having a final boss to close off the story. The New Colossus has no such epic finale and the best way I can describe how it ends is to say ""it just ends"".

3) The story is insanely stupid and unlike The New Order, which at least stuck with its retarded attempt to make a ""deep and serious"" story out of fucking Wolfenstein, it seems to be incapable of deciding if it wants to be serious or goofy. You have BJ's voice actor delivering painfully pretentious dumbfuckery in a grating whispery voice for the first half of the game and then it devolves into some wacky-ass crap once BJ gets resurrected from literally being beheaded. The story choices with BJ's stereotypical southern hick father are truly bizarre (dude is supposedly a mega racist but married a Jewish woman? Huh?) and seem to exist for no other reason than poking fun at the kind of people Hollywood liberals imagine conservatives to be...I'm guessing because it's incredibly jarring at doesn't contribute to the plot in any meaningful way whatsoever.

The characters are basically all uninteresting stereotypes except for Fergus who is at the very least a fun stereotype, you've got the angry black woman who says ""motherfucker"" so often she may as well be auditioning for a Samuel L. Jackson biopic, you've got the fat Nazi girl whom we're supposed to sympathise with because her Nazi mother bullied her...for being a lardass, you've got the completely forgettable bearded dude from Louisiana, you've got the magic Jew Set Roth who is basically a walking plot device machine, you've got Anya whom I can't even understand why the fuck she keeps getting shoved into dangerous situations by the team when she's supposedly pregnant with twins and you've got a bunch of other idiots scattered across the U-boat that you make into your base of operations.

4) The DLCs are a complete waste of time. Not only do they recycle some levels from the base game as well as the weapons but they are also insanely short and serve no other purpose except to setup what I'm guessing is plot lines for a sequel.

I played through the game once in the Fergus timeline. I started over for the Wyatt timeline sorely so I could try out the sticky bomb launcher. After about 15 minutes, I realised I had absolutely no desire to revisit this gruelling shitshow again and stopped.",1688207949,1688207949,False,2,1,0.470770806074142456,0,True,False,False

612880,140909595,76561198018134705,0,10,756,0,756,1687989467,"TLDR - A step back in some areas in terms of level design, story writing and questionable design choices but ultimately still a fun time held up by extremely satisfying gunplay and gameplay mechanics. A solid game, yet weak sequel to the previous titles.

Pro's:

- Wolfenstein's strong gunplay/gameplay mechanics from The New Order (TNO) and The Old Blood (TOB) returns and is still as satisfying as it was before
- Levels present a horrifying 'what if' the Nazi's occupied the U.S
- Characters are all likeable and entertaining.
- Story immediately picks up from the end of TNO. You're also allowed to choose which 'timeline' you wish to follow (based on a decision made in TNO, here it is presented in a flashback). The story can be altered slightly based on this so multiple playthroughs are encouraged.
- A lot of previous characters and villains return from TNO
- An interesting look at B.J's backstory is shown 

Con's:

- For some reason, Machine Games decided to handicap you with lower health (you start with 50 instead of 100). This can lead you to getting melted far too easily early in the game, making it feel more difficult than a lot of late game sections.
- Some humour and writing is out of place. There will be times where the serious nature of some scenes is pointlessly interrupted for a quick gag to lighten the mood. These light hearted elements would have served better elsewhere. Wolfenstein The Old Blood pulls the humour aspect off much better and TNO has a better balance.
- Sometimes you can spend far too much time on the Eva's Hammer (Submarine, TNC's 'Hub world'). It's supposed to make you connect with some of the characters you meet and whilst you can interact with some of them, it overstays its welcome by the end of the game.
- The story on its own can feel a little weak. It holds up better if you've played TOB and TNO because it very much picks up where they left off. As a standalone, it falls short and a handful of plot threads are left open with little explanation.",1688051659,1688051730,True,1,0,0.505882382392883301,0,True,False,False

The atmosphere in this game is far less serious and more morbidly humorous, especially during the cutscenes (which felt like they took up a bigger portion of the game). I personally did not feel that the new characters they introduced in this game were as likeable as the first game's characters. Graphics are a huge step up from the previous games, with textures and effects looking way better. While level design is not too different from before, with some levels feeling like they were rehashing or putting a new coat of paint over old concepts (Venus level), these levels seemed more enjoyable and/or memorable in comparison. Player choice exists in this game to a somewhat greater degree, more so in gameplay rather than story as you can choose between three contraptions that allow unique play styles and abilities. The perk system has been replaced by a weapon upgrade system that requires you to find upgrade kits hidden around each level. The achievement grind in this game was brutal, culminating in the frustratingly difficult Mein Leben run (you have to complete the campaign in one life).

===============================================================================

pros:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. game refreshes the gun mechanics and feel to the game it has more of an updated new look and style to it 

2. gun upgrades are AMAZING even overpowered especially the armor piercing round for your Assault rifle

3. Games story is ""interesting"" again everything still continues from where it left off so again nothing feels left out which is good

4. voice acting, character design are good as usual still great

5. this game does  WAY more cut-scenes then other previous wolfenstein titles, and honestly its pretty good the cut-scenes are solid and smooth and really fun to watch i did not find myself skipping them cause i enjoy watching what happens its really cool

6. 60 FPS CAP IS GOONNNEE, THANK GOD 
====================================================================================

cons:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. There's some useless side characters in the game that don't have a ""Major"" impact on story

2. (SPOILER FOR STORY) in the mission where BJ literally dies since he gets decapitated by helga, what happens is your head as its falling gets caught by a remote controlled drone controlled by set roth your head gets brought back to base where they hook you up to a machine that gives your head/brain oxygen and to read brainwave activity, YOU SURVIVE?!, i was kind of confused and it felt a little bit cartoon-ish in a way your head also gets placed in a vat filled with green liquid like an old school horror flick. It also kind of contradicts itself because now looking back, if they had the technology to put a head back on a body can't they just do the same to the German soldiers when they get hurt or shot, its very weird honestly they should of let BJ escape instead of getting caught in the mission 

3. killing helga is kind of anti-climatic since all you do is sneak threw a fake crowd when she is on live television and get a guaranteed kill on her which is odd and again anti-climatic

4. STEALTH in this game is a pile of horse poop its really, really, really, bad, you can alert enemies by making to much noise which in some cases you have to to either bust threw a vent to even get to the commander or when you kill a soldier another soldier can go look at the dead body and be more alert AND YOU CANT EVEN HIDE THE BODY 

5. also the ubergewehr which is just a bfg just way, WAY, WAY, WAY, worse, it has slower charge up, you go slow when charging up so your just a sitting duck, time in between shots are long AF, projectiles go slower than a snail with a 50 pound weight attached to it.

I put off playing this game for a long time, because I remember being very put off with how this game was marketed and the gaming journalism dicksucking it was getting with Vice calling it ""one of the most important games of the year"" (give me a fucking break.) For those reasons I suspected the game was going to have incredibly cringey writing dripping with the Trump derangement syndrome that was so characteristic of pretty much every piece of media in 2017. Unfortunately this turned out to be the case and the writing and cutscenes are so bad that it's honestly embarrassing. They honestly made killing Nazi super soldiers lame, how do you do that? Now if the the core gameplay was good I could have forgiven this to a degree, but sadly this is not the case as you'll see and this game takes a big step back from the previous two games.

This was an incredibly low effort game for starters. I think they only added one or two new enemies in this game that weren't in either of the previous two and the nearly 3/4ths of the game takes place in a horrible boring sewer levels and bombed out ruined buildings. It honestly might be some of the worst and most uninspired level design I've ever seen in an FPS. The funny thing is despite all the buzz and marketing about the Nazis and KKK running the streets of America they do almost nothing with those ideas, outside of one boring walking sim part, instead the entirety of the game takes place in sewers, destroyed buildings, and generic military bases. The sad thing is you could have actually done cool stuff with a Nazi occupation of America, but outside of marketing hype for the game, based on cynically manipulating the current political landscape at the time, they really did nothing with it.

Also the stealth in this game is completely broken and there's basically no reason to attempt it. Enemies will mysteriously spot you through walls randomly. It's a shame because the stealth actually works well in the first two games. Most of the guns are pretty shitty too. There's literally no reason to use anything other than assault rifle and laser gun. The tried to pad out the game with extra side content like hunting down Übercommanders, but the enigma code breaking minigame is god awful, and all the assassinations missions are just reused levels from the campaign, which as previously mentioned has pretty bad levels.

Finally being able to play this was exciting and refreshing to see the cast return and some newcomers to the story.

The story continues where the first game ended. William finishes his mission and while it was implied that he doesn't make it at the end of the first game, in this story, his friends and comrades save him. Frau Engel is back and she is more determined than ever to stop him and his revolution. It's up to William to gather other survivors and rise up to fight against the Nazis once more and take back the world from their oppression.

For starters, I love that the game still continues the two-timeline story like in the first game. So for those wondering, I did the Wyatt timeline just like I did in the first game. This changes story scenes depending on which timeline you choose. Graphically, the game still looks amazing. It was so cool seeing all the technology and machinery in all the levels. I feel this game definitely upped the gore and violence though, so be aware of that going in.

The gameplay is more or less the same just like previous entries. Once again, they adopted the perk system in where depending on how you play, you will get passive buffs. Perform a lot of stealth kills? Now you have increased crouch speed. Do a lot of heavy weapon kills? Well, now heavy weapons have a larger capacity. I love how this system is implemented, although, I wish they told you about your perks like in the first game instead of having to research them in the menus.

One of the biggest strengths in the Wolfenstein games is the characters and story and this game did not disappoint. I loved seeing the cast return and the new people William recruits are memorable as well. There were plenty of times while walking around the home base when I would stop and just watch the characters interact with each other. Sometimes you could do lil side missions for them too. Seeing characters develop throughout the campaign was great too. Heck, my favorite chapter in the game was when you go through William's hometown and see his memories.

Lastly, the gameplay expands halfway through the game when you get to choose a new special ability. One is good for stealth, the other for combat, and the last for exploration. It stays with the ""tailor to your playstyle"" type of feel and I commend the developers for the fun system.

Now for the gripes. I think my biggest gripe is just getting lost. I counted 3-4 stages where I had no idea where to go and I would spend 5-10 minutes wandering around trying to find out where I was supposed to go. The map helped somewhat, but it was still slightly frustrating. Make sure you manually save often, especially if you want to play stealthy. Next, the stealth upgrade that you select halfway through the game was sometimes hard to know where it could be used. Lastly, make sure to up your brightness, this game gets really dark, and hard to see enemies at certain points so be mindful of that.

Final verdict? This game was still a fun ride from beginning to end! There are plenty of extra missions you can tackle after you beat the main campaign. Three DLC chapters as well as an arena mode where you just kill as many enemies as you can. There's plenty to enjoy as well as the great story so I highly recommend this game, just be sure to at least finish the first one so you can enjoy the characters and story bits more.

Perhaps Wolfenstein II was the hallmark beginning the tendency of increasingly crappier wolfenstein games? 
Remains to be seen...
 
P.S.: Short example (obviously not the only issue): I've noticed a bad implementation in the game likely related to the rendering pipeline not allowing the GPU to operate at capacity as I'm getting an aprox. 60% GPU usage (with even lower CPU usage) but staying around 135 fps and not reaching the 165fps to equal the 165hz monitor.

The combat and feeling in the weapons are fun as hell and being able to upgrade them only makes them get better as the game continues, and rewards you for exploring and finding these upgrade kits which I frankly enjoy. Making a beefy and cooler weapon towards the game climax and showing I have managed to survive everything the game has thrown at you makes you feel like you will obtain victory. this game is about depression in a lot of ways, you've been fighting this battle for who knows how long and things aren't always rainbows and sunshine. tackling the problems of racism the way they do I love it (who would've guessed racism in a game about killing Nazis wow). the KKK just walking around casually, black people being treated less than just as everyone else. you face something that is nothing short of a monster maybe not some creature but they are mentally sick and you can understand that pain and anger, maybe even a bit of sadness our mc feels.

A solid, high-quality shooter with a fairly extensive arsenal (both own weapons and heavy ones). It is pleasant to shoot, the weapon does not ""feel"", but this does not affect the overall process. It's cool that open firefights are mixed with stealth, it's nice to dilute the process at a level with additional conditions such as the first level in a wheelchair or a level with recharging a suit.

If not, take one orange you love. Start by setting the orange on your kitchen counter. Use the palm of your hand to press the orange down and roll it around.

Next, lay down a plate or a paper towel to protect your counter. With your thumb, press your nail into the top of the orange near the stem.

Start from the top where you’ve made the puncture with your thumb, and pull directly down. Aim to pull a large strip of the rind at first. The bigger your initial tear was, the easier it will be to peel the rest of the orange.

The heavy weapons are awesome and plentiful but are so overpowered the only way the game can stop you is constant knockdown attacks. Stealth is there, but nothing really to say about it. Knockdowns are super annoying and will likely result in death. Most of the side content is pixel hunting random items and doing missions where you have to track down an enemy with a weapon that is insurmountable if they get the first shot (because you get knocked down and they just stun lock you until death) and you have to re-do the entire mission if you don't know exactly where the enemy is and do a manual save.

The story is amazing, you'll feel angry, sad, happy, then you'll spend a few minutes blowing nazis and KKK assholes to kingdom come.
EDIT: after reading some reviews here, I see a patern: 1 - people too dumb to follow the story and 2 - people really bad at the game complaining about the difficulty. Don't mind them, story wise I have no idea how people think this isn't good, yes, there are some characters archetypes that at first seem a little cliché but I love how they treated them on the long run, you feel attached to most of the friends you meet. And about the gameplay, the enemy AI is good, they won't just charge you, they'll try to flank, and they don't have wallhacks to follow you when you're not in their field a view, so the only explanation is: noobs trying to play in MEIN LIEBEN thinking this would be like CoD campaign where it's about trying to get to the next checkpoint.",1681484546,1681486609,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,True,False

Really fun and enjoyable shooter with amazing graphics. You can choose to play stealthily or run and gun. It has amazing animations and amazing characters.

The game is really well optimized. The particle effects are probably one of the most amazing parts of this game. The particle effects are beautiful, realistic, and really addicting to just watch. 

When I first started up the game, everything was on the highest settings, this caused a lot of issues since the game has A TON of settings. I fixed this by turning down a few of the settings. Make sure to scroll down, the menu is minimalistic and it is easy to miss the ""hidden"" settings. I tinkered around settings for a bit and after turning down 3 or 4 things, it magically fixes everything.

I run the game perfectly fine at High/Ultra settings at 1080p with around or over 144 fps.",1680313823,1680313823,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Let me start this one by saying I have no fu**ing idea what all these negative reviews are about.
To me The New Colossus completely overshadows its predecessors, doing a better job at arguably everything.

[b]- Graphics[/b]
Wolfenstein II obviously looks better than ever and to be honest, it aged magnificently.
The New Order horrid OOF system is gone and things three feet from your face are not out of focus and Blazko is officially not myopic anymore.

[b]- Audio[/b]
Sound department is top-notch. Voice acting is majestic.
Generic 30 seconds long hard rock music sequences have been replaced by a full OST matching the action perfectly, pressing the shooting sequences and fading down to an ominous hum for the stealth sections masterfully.
Dialogues are great, voice acting is spotless, especially BJ.
""Caroline. I'm hurting. Will you lend me your wings?"". Pure beauty.

[b]- Story[/b]
Character development and writing in general are not a strong side in Wolfenstein, we know that.
No exception here, everybody is a vague, shapeless and stereotypical two-dimensional cartboard figure but Anya, Fergus and particularly Wyatt, are at least granted an arc this time, changing dramatically during the game.

Hundreds of details including side quests and everyday moments and dialogues between crew members are always interesting and hilarious or just plain depressing but always capable of drawing us into the world of Wolfenstein to a degree no game in the series could achieve before.
It feels like the Resistance is truly a family. I feel overall way more invested in what's going on.

People complaining about The New Colossus ""not having a true ending"" should remember that the last two games had HORRIBLE endings, especially The New Order and its fade to black Soprano's style cliffhanger.

[b]- Controls[/b]
Faster and better with more freedom, simply put.
You can crawl, rush, tackle, run through walls, extend your legs six feet from the ground, stomp and more than everything really, your favourite nazi-killing sodlier can now successfully leap over a damn 20 inches tall handrail. Unbelievable, I know.

[b]- Performance[/b]
The only true tender spot here. Performance issues with most GPUs and drivers settings.
Thankfully, easily fixed with a 60 seconds tweak to the register file, google can and will help.
It solved 99% of the issues I had. Now it's just...a Bethesda game. You know.

[b]- Content[/b]
Way longer game, bigger areas, more variety, more turret sections and vehicles and overall more interesting missions.
Not much to say here, there's just way more content in this one, even without the DLC.

So why the hate? 
Well. Turns out only 0,8% here on Steam could actually beat the game on Uber, compared to more than 6% for the last game and 10% for the first, this alone tells us a story, I think.
This game is HARD.
Even at hard difficulty you will die, a lot, that until you learn the game mechanics.
You get maybe 1/10 of the medkits and armor you got in New Order, enemies actually take cover instead of running towards their demise, you're not a God behind cover anymore, no suggested/mandatory path for stealth segments, no 200 HP all the time, no cheesing your way out, no bulls*it.
Uber is absolutely insane, as it should be. One death game over is tough. You'll have to fully master the game to even stand a chance.
The courthouse shootout alone is more difficult than the other two title combined, including Deatshead on ""Uber"".


[b]TL:DR Verdict.[/b]
Technically and qualitatively, this is hands down the best Wolfenstein game ever made, sadly also thanks to the direction that horrendous abomination ""Young Blood"" steered the franchise towards.
Ignore people who don't have the patience or will to master the game's mechanics, great game, safe buy.

Very annoying if you want to get the nade Perk but it bounces where ever it wants when thrown. Same with the throwing weapon, miss a throw and it will not find it again.The problem with edges was more annoying for me. Stairs, doorways or just different ground and you had to jump to get pass or move your mouse around a lot for some reason, this was very infuriating when you are tring to sneak and the enemies can hear your jumping sound.The way you upgrade weapons this time is better IMO, you upgrade the one that you want first, but honestly you could play this game with only one weapon just because of how good it is and how much ammo it has. Just needs the 3 upgrades and you are good to go.The DLC's are boring, waste of money, don't buy them unless you really want to support Bethesda...Collectables are still pointless, only giving achievements, but now there are Weapon upgrad kits that you have to collect to upgrade your weapon.A lot of the negative review are right about problems in the game, the characters, story or environments.

[b]Gameplay[/b]: I think my game was bugged.

[b]Inconsistent auto-ammo-pickup[/b]
Sometimes I automatically pick up ammo, sometimes I have to press a button. I tried everything, including making sure there was room in my carry capacity. No consistency. In intense firefights, it almost always forced me to manually pick up, which was so frustrating.
[b]Broken stealth[/b]
W1 had great stealth. Enemies would need a second or two upon spotting you to realize what they're looking at, which lets you shoot or duck away and is also pretty realistic. Here, a lot of enemies had zero reaction time. The moment they appear on screen, sometimes on the other side of the map, they start to raise the alarm. A couple times they ""saw"" me through a wall (not a grate), and other times, they literally spun 110 degrees while I'm silently crouching behind cover. 
[b]Schizoprenic ""lean"" mechanic[/b]
I can't believe they somehow messed this up from the first game. Here the lean can't make up its mind as to whether to do it or not, flipping back and forth between cover multiple times a second, whether I use the lean button or the sights. It was more a hindrance than a benefit
[b]Misc[/b]
Experienced a couple of game crashes. Also some weird messages about my video card running out of memory upon loading a save that seemed to have no actual impact. Had a couple other bugs like textures, character, gun models and lighting not loading properly that weren't always fixed upon starting the game again.

All this leads to a LOT of save scumming because you can't trust the game mechanics to work as expected.


[b]Story: *spoilers*[/b]
Man, I loved the story in W1 and W2's didn't come close. W2 makes the mistake that some movie sequels do which is, rather than explore the characters you know and love more deeply, it does away with them partially, figuratively, or literally, replacing them with new characters that are supposed to be ""cool"" but are actually annoying AF. 

The romance between BJ and Anya was the driving force in the first game. In this one it's non-existent. Anya, an intelligent and multilingual medic that helped take down Deathshead is [spoiler]relegated to being a horny lackey that is ordered around and literally sent off on armed missions while being pregnant with twins. WTF. I get that they wanted to raise the stakes and make things dire for Kreisau by killing off Caroline, another great character from W1 but for sadboi BJ to forget Anya, who took care of him for 14 years and carries his children because of this is insane. It would have worked if they really explored his debilitating grief to the end, gave him catharsis, allowing him to reconcile with Anya. But no, they both magically get over it the moment he gets a new body, which is so ridiculous I won't even get into it. For a game that's trying so hard to show it knows emotions, i.e. BJ's father arc, this cop out on grief was an utter waste.[/spoiler]

Fergus was a cynical but charming Scotsman in the first but in this game he's just angry, all day every day, but doesn't have a backbone when it counts [spoiler](standing up to Grace)[/spoiler]. A literal caricature. Wyatt is slightly better but so many characters' dialogue involves them being worked up about something and almost yelling at each other. But either way, the characters never fight alongside you, which doesn't make sense considering they're the few real soldiers in the team, and that choice from W1 was supposed to be weighty. They don't appear much other than in some casual interactions. The uberannoying new character Super Spesh gets more screentime than characters from the first game. [spoiler]Thank god he dies shortly after.[/spoiler]

Grace is alright, in the end. But again, the way she interacts with the team is ridiculous. [spoiler]She literally walks in and plops herself in Caroline's room right after she dies and starts giving orders. To people that took down Deathshead and liberated and saved her. Sigrun giving her a smackdown was my favourite moment in the story.[/spoiler] 

Sigrun was probably the only new character I genuinely liked that had a proper character arc.

All in all, the game was playable and had some enjoyable moments, but other than look very pretty, it didn't scratch my itch for a grounded character-driven story with solid gameplay.",1679061541,1679383640,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Honestly it's the best of the series, taking what they did right in New Order and Old Blood and enhancing them while also adding way more content.
 The writing of the story is much more intriguing and less predictable. I really liked William's character development, it has ups and downs and questioning yourself.
Most guns feel great and responsive. Most enemies feel real and not just like stupid AI, its  not perfect but I'll get to that soon. 
The main story levels all offer different play styles with a lot of variation and I assume replayability. You know where to go the level design is very intentional. They also look great, if youre not inside of a german facility, which youre a lot of the time, because theyre just grey and nuts and bolts and crates and stairs. It feels bland but I suppose its realistic. 
I really like the commander system but it has a few flaws in addition to the whacky stealthing.
They also reduced the amount of bosses which was a welcomed change.. most of them were boring, slow and 100% gimmicks that added nothing to your game play experience.
Visually this game is impressive, from character models, maps, assets, gore and visual effects and it doesn't hide it, very American. I also really like most of the cutscenes.
I very much appreciated the attention to detail. Little items, documents or quest items found are to be found again in your hub. NPCs in the hub interact with each other and uhh while I dont really care about it personally it still is a nice touch and it feels much more alive.
There's also just soooo much to collect, gold, ""readables"", songs, toys and what not. I dont know if anyone still likes going through every inch of a level while reading some awfully written article or video about how to find all 500 weird quirky items. Just not for me, I like to collect the toys for Max but thats it.
I am German myself and obviously had a very easy time understanding NPCs, reading random texts or laugh at some of the proper german humour, I wonder what it's like for people not understanding this magnificant language. So much to do in this game, from the Main Story of course, collecting items, doing side quests in your hub, shooting range, challenges, playing retro wolfenstein- so much more content.

I did come across some issues though and I will list them now.
The Ubercommando missions were a horrbile mess. Youre dropped off at a smaller level part of the main story ( which I just complimented) but at a different point, you basically play through them in another way. Sadly this directly destroys the great level design. It feels almost random where you have to go.
They were also very difficult at some points, either swarms of enemies and no way to stealth it or just the worst types of enemies back to back to back. Luckily you can cheese them- once you killed that levels Ubercommando you can exit the mission but you'll miss out on the collectable.
I played through this game in the I am Death Incarnate difficulty which is the second highest difficulty and as someone whos played most shooters on the on the highest difficulty I stil had major problems. Some tank enemies are just impossible to beat, theyll shoot rockets at you and shoot fire if youre too close. They blast your ear drums while disorienting you and basically erasing half your HP with a single blow. I dont know how many rockets, grenades and shotgun shells they eat because I only ever beat one of them and just completely ignored EVERY one of them afterwards. It just is not worth it- doesnt grant you an achievement, doesnt make it easier to progress- in fact its such terrible enemy it doesnt feel good to fight them its a waste of time. Same with other big german things you encounter but the big robots are the worst. There are also meatier soldiers that dont drop with a single headshot. They are quite beefy but have huge weakpoints, sadly you can only really attack those weakpoints from behind and its not easy to get there. They either shoot lasers that do tons of damage or shoot slow spread rocket shotgun shells that deplete easily 75% of your MAX fully MAXED OUT HP.
Often you're almost done with a wave of enemies but then you get one shot and wanna smash your head 30 times against your wall. Its unsatisfying because these shells are very weird and super inaccurate- which sounds fine but in reality it felt bad due to the difficulty of predicitng the bullets.
And this is where I come to my main critique of the game. It's unreliable.
Some enemies will stagger when shot and sometimes they don't. Enemies when out of your line of sight will shout so you know they are gonna attack you from behind, sometimes they dont and just shoot you down instantly. Grenades thrown by enemies are marked with a symbol and sometimes theyre not and you jsut blow up because you didnt hear you were busy shooting. Enemies sometimes do little to no damage with each hit and sometimes the same enemies deplete half your hp and armor in a few shots. Most enemy troops have a certain range they need to be in to shoot William but not every one follows that rule. On some levels you just get sniped ( not by an actual sniper, just some guy with a rifle) or even random rocket fired and hit you or the insane amount of explosive barrels stationed around you. Breaking boxes with your melee feels fun but sometimes William throws his melee instead and the hatchet disappears because?? who knows. Stealth works great, unless it doesnt. Once enemies are aware of your presence they will spot you instantly and being well hidden in the dark or mostly obstructed, doesnt matter if they spot Williams huge ess model youre fcked. So? you think then do it loud and I would agree if that didnt mean you instantly die because every single guy is firing at you. the commandos are instantly alarmed although it has been established not all enemies on the map can hear your gunshots, but the commandos dont care once an enemy is alarmed and not instantly taken out- alarm goes off and everyone's after you. But you cant take out most enemies with a few shots so you have to completely stand out of the bigger enemies sights which is difficult as there are many of them in every level.

To me its a missed opportunity to make one of the greatest shooters. First Person Shooters, especially on high difficulty, need reliablity. You have skill, awareness and experience but the game can just f you over and it feels terrible. It made me actual rage quit a few times.
Due to this I will not complete this 100% and will just maybe come back to it later, sadly.",1642096836,1678833543,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It comes accross as heavy-handed and preachy, with little nuance or subtlety. Overall, while Wolfenstein: The New Colossus has its strengths, it's not without its flaws.

I played this entirely on Steam Deck and, completed the campaign, and have approximately 43% of total game completion (collectibles, side missions, etc.).

The game picks up immediately after the last game and the story didn't just feel like a rehash of it. It stands on it's own and tries some new things. The levels all felt unique and added to the story and world building this franchise has done. I really enjoyed it from start to finish. The cut-scenes were all well done and I never felt the need to skip them.

The game is pretty non-stop. You go through certain sections of a level and have to kill the enemies. If you alert a ""commander"" then swarms of enemies come for a while but is not never ending. You do get a bit of a breather between these sections though which is nice. There is health and armor throughout the levels so you never feel too under prepared. I only got stuck on a couple parts, and it didn't feel overwhelming most of the time. You just had to change up your tactics and move more in most instances. I did appreciate the game tried to keep you moving.

There are collectibles throughout most levels/locations. If you find a map in the level it will reveal where all areas in that level, and if you kill a commander in an area then it will show you the location of collectibles, but they are sometimes further into a level. I felt this made exploring a bit more rewarding, and it encourages you to go back to levels later so you can collect what you missed. One of the collectibles are weapon upgrade kits, and it was nice to be able to pick and choose what to upgrade and when. You can even William at a certain point in the game.

All of the characters had their own personalities and were acted pretty well. Nobody really felt flat or 1 dimensional which was nice.

Overall I had a blast with this game. It was fun and challenging at times, but it really did keep me engaged. Highly recommend.",1678325008,1678325008,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The killing of the Wrongfully Angry White German girl and replacement by the Righteous Angry Black New York girl as the ""rightful"" leader of the ""resistance"" is so disgusting and blatantly anti-white racism, that its pityful....

Not to mention B.J. himself has the awful side plot regarding his abusive father, something that has never been referenced in previous games. It feels extremely jarring and shoehorned in an unnecessary attempt to flesh out B.J. as a character. Men bashing at its best once again....

And the girlboss scene with preggo Anya naked throwing grenade and dual wielding full powered assault rifle against at least 15 ennemy soldier while riding B.J. is fucking CRINGE... 

Gameplay-wise, the combat is not too dissimilar to The new Order but suffers from absolutely terrible level design disguised by the admittedly very beautiful looking areas. Levels are often frustrating to traverse, particularly if you attempt to stealth your way through. 

I get the feeling the devs were perhaps trying to partially emulate the modern doom design philosophy in a way. Giving the player large arenas stocked with ammo and then filling them with enemies. It simply does not work in tandem with wolfenstein's much slower pace in combat. You cannot jump through open areas, gunning down enemies left and right like in doom, you will die.

Now, I don't think the wolfenstein series should be taken seriously, the concept itself is inherently ridiculous. This game however, takes the occasionally goofiness of the previous games and turns itself into a whole ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ circus. There are so many ""lol XD random!!!111!!!11"" moments in this game which feel completely out of place and elicit no other reaction from my body other than pure, primal cringe. I can't take any part of this game seriously because there's awful marvel movie tier dialogue every 5 minutes reminding me that the writers (who somehow are the same ones who worked on The new Order) just decided they didn't give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about this franchise anymore.

A lot of people complained about this game being overly political or ""the wokeification of wolfenstein"". THEY ARE RIGHT..... Its an assault on Men, the Army, Capitalism, those who gave up their live against actual Nazism amd socialism... Its a blatant socialist propaganda piece, and its egriegeous.....Men bad, America is racist, and putting emphasis on race instead of merit, EXACTLY WHAT THE NAZI DID....the Woke Cult is just a religious outbreak of socialism, with the primary tennet being that instead of the bourgeoisie, its the White male that is the source of everything Evil in society.....Never forget that Nazi mean National Socialist..... dont belive me, go check the definiton in a dictionaire..... you deny hitler socialism, you deny the Holocaust... you anti-semite POC......Fucking Pathetic and genocidal marxist .... Ideology before common sense....

So yeah, ♥♥♥♥ this game. Only buy it if you want to cringe at your monitor for approximately 10 hours. And if you played TNO and just want to see where they decided to go with the story, wait for a sale. A big sale. This game is not even worth £10, let alone 25.

And on a side note, the DLCs are lazy cashgrabs. No new content, no story, just glorified level packs.",1674207666,1677825384,False,7,2,0.489373564720153809,0,True,False,False

- Port giving me technical issues. Not great, getting crashes etc.

- Managed to finish the main game eventually.

- The story in previous game (New Order) was more enjoyable. I found this sequel to have it's moments, but ultimately fall well short of what was set up in the previous game.

- Some scenes tried to bring more depth and meaning to the story, but ultimately felt more like a cheap shock value (like the early game cut scene-ish stuff) and the auditioning/movie thing. It might have worked better had it been done differently, I would say it's much too blunt and feels quite disconnected from the rest of the game.

- I've seen this game get a huge amount of praise, and in a lot of cases more so than the previous game. This game has imo a definitely lower quality story whereas in the previous game it was a lot more interesting, nuanced and emotional highs and lows felt a lot more ""earned"" in terms of how it was written and played out.

- I would still say for the game itself it's still worth playing regardless, the combat is still great like the previous game, though there have been some minor changes which I found not to be an improvement and ultimately could be done differently (how weapon types work).

- Music and sound is great, also visually it's modern wolfenstein and it's pretty great.

Bottom line: quite disappointed with the port and the underwhelming story/writing, not a great result in my opinion. If you've played the new order it's natural to also play this. If you haven't played any of them I would probably still recommend to play them both in order: though remember, don't expect too much from this one. The new order is quite a ways ahead of this, in my opinion.

The weapons. From a grenade-launching shotgun to a laser gun, the weapons in this game are all unique and satisfying to use. Plus, you get to dual-wield pretty much everything.

The story. While it may not be for everyone, the story of BJ Blazkowicz and his fight against the Nazis is both ridiculous and heartwarming. It's like a Quentin Tarantino movie, but with more Nazis.

The alternate history. In this game, the Nazis won World War II and have taken over America. It's both terrifying and fascinating to see how different the world could have been.

The humor. Despite the serious subject matter, this game has some genuinely funny moments. From the ridiculous character names to the over-the-top violence, you'll find yourself laughing more than you expect.

The characters. The cast of characters in this game is diverse and interesting, from the tough-as-nails Grace to the lovable giant Sigrun. You'll find yourself rooting for them all.

It's challenging. If you're looking for a game that's easy to beat, this isn't it. Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus will make you work for your victories, but that just makes them all the more satisfying.

Overall, Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is a fun, challenging, and entertaining game with a lot of heart. And did we mention the Nazi-kicking?",1677012204,1677012204,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all, the gunplay is really satisfying and the stealth sections do the job well enough, I really like the fact that the weapons are HUGE (really, even the pistol is oversized), running and shooting has never felt better.
It's important to keep in mind though, this game will KICK YOUR ASS in the higher difficulties, so if you also enjoy that, welcome in.

This game is so confused, and is, quite frankly, repulsive.
It's trying to be dark and serious, using extreme violence and gore to shock the player, but then the next second it's using violence as a punch-line.
A game where I blow up nazis with glee, fight robotic dogs and shoot people's heads off in a wheelchair is not a game that should also try to deal with the real-world issues of homophobia, racism, domestic abuse or the incredible tragedy of the holocaust... especially not in the same fucking scene. This game is a joke, and not a funny one. I love dark humour, but there's a time and place and a general tone about it that this game has no understanding of.

You're really going to make fat jokes with a girl crying about having her diary full of sexual fantasies being read by her mother while you show a main character get their head sliced off in gruesome detail as the mother then goes to pick up the decapitated head and mimic sexual acts with it? And you expect us to believe you have any sort of moral decency or maturity? Is there even a message behind it, or are you just taking joy in the depravity of it all?

The writers severely lack maturity and self-awareness. I would, without exaggeration, seriously expect more from children. This is pathetic.
Wolfenstein shouldn't be an outlet for your own little insecurities. It's a game where the entertainment value comes out of blowing people apart for fuck's sake. Don't you think there's a slight clash in tone there? You're not goofy, you're not insightful, you're just, as I said, [b]repulsive[/b], by any definition of the word.

I don't usually take video games seriously. No-one should... unless, in the ultra rare case like this, they're actually trying to make a statement, in which case I'll treat your product like it was made by adults for adults approaching topics worthy of serious discussion. The thing is, this is so pathetically childish that it's a little hard to fathom that anyone in their right mind actually made this. 

As for the gameplay? Hard to judge from 37 minutes, of course, but my first (and last) impressions as I tried to just enjoy the game, trying to look past the negatives I'd heard about its story, was pretty unenjoyable. I was playing on the second hardest difficulty and enemies went down like bricks with stupid AI and unimpactful combat. I was bewildered by how well this game ran, though. 80FPS max settings at 4K on an RTX2060 with visuals this good? How in the fuck did they do that???

Even if the combat (again, based on very little playtime) was actually enjoyable or unique, given how much the legitimately fucked up narrative is forced down your throat, this game is impossible to enjoy to anything close to a worthwhile extent.

This game isn't worthy of anyone's time or money. Don't waste a minute on it. Don't waste a dollar on it. It's vile.",1594277344,1676434006,False,9,3,0.474411606788635254,2,True,False,False

Gerçekten Hitler'in hareketleri, dönem itibari ile paranoyası ve hastalığı o kadar iyi yansıtılmışki anlatmaya kelimeler yetmiyor. Açın deneyimleyin yani. Optimizasyon anlamında da çok başarılı olmuş. RX 560 ekran kartım ile Mein Lieben ayarlarda rahatlıkla oynadım. Oyunun sonunda ki bosslar biraz anamı ağlattı. Evet bosslar diyorum 2 tanelerdi çünkü. Silah çeşitliliği çok iyidi. Özellikle The New Order'ın üzerine en çok konan kısım bence silah çeşitliliği ve kullanımı olmuş. Eskiden aynı tür silahları 2 tane kullanabiliyorduk.

Özellikle House of the Rising Sun, Haus in Neu Berlin olarak tekrar yorumlanmış. Bence orijinalinden kat kat daha güzel olmuş. Bunu yazarken bile dinliyorum tavsiye ederim. Her zaman ki gibi Atmosfer acayip iyidi. O distopyada buldum bizzat kendimi. Wolfenstein Youngblood'dan çok umutlu olmasadam Co-op oynayacağım için zevk alacağımdan eminim. Ama şunu bilin ki Wolfenstein serisi her zaman bir efsane olarak kalacak. Birazda seri hakkında konuşmak istiyorum. Bu oyunlarda en çok dikkatimi çeken şey günümüz FPS oyunlarındaki bir çok elementi değiştirerek kullanması. Örneğin Kalkan ya da koruma ne derseniz bunları toplayabiliyoruz. Bu özellik eski bir özellik. Return to Castle Wolfenstein dönemlerinden kalma. Aynı zamanda çoklu silah kullanımıda eski bir özellik. Yanınızda bir ton silah taşıyorsunuz. Bu ve bu tarz özellikleri modifiye ederek günümüze çok güzel uyarlamış Machine Games. Yani Wolfenstein gelmiş geçmiş en iyi remake serilerinden biri oldu. The New Colossus da gelmiş geçmiş en iyi devam oyunlarından biri oldu. Gerçekten kelimeler yetmiyor ne desem şaşırdım biraz. Birkaç gün etkisinden çıkamayacağım gibi duruyor hayırlısı artık.

Heterogeneous dual-wielding rocks! To exactly nobody's surprise, settling on a combination of assault shotgun & rifle as my workhorse didn't take me long and this pair is a banger! To compensate for that, I suppose, the combat got notably more brutal. I don't even know what armor in this game is even supposed to do, it's gone entirely in 1-2 hits anyway which makes sense, given how weapons became more deadly than armor became protective during the course of the 20th century. It's all fair play though, your weapons rip through nazis just as well (I can write a whole essay on the shotgun alone). Oftentimes, you're all but forced to play tactically, with the leaning mechanic working ever-damn nicely. Otherwise, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/548570/RAGE_2/]applying constant pressure is a survival strategy as satisfying as it is effective.[/url]

And you often have to constantly apply pressure, i.e. because there's another commandant sequence, the one with 2 pricks calling for reinforcements unless you kill them quietly. They really overdid those, to be honest. This suff works well when it's sprinkled in to vary up the pacing but here, it's a constant level design element and they get annoying quickly. You still can blast you way through though.

I've ended up doing the moral equivalent of blasting my way through cutscenes, that is skipping them. [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/201810/Wolfenstein_The_New_Order/]Previously[/url], the writing was a nice mixture of over-the-top alt-history fiction with BJ's pseudo-philosophical, heavy monologue working great with that zany backdrop. Occasionally delving into serious stuff to set up the finale and viola, you got a well-crafted story arc. Here, the thick drama ruins everything, the sprinkles of bathos don't help either. There's some really good stuff (pretty much every time Irene Engel's on the stage) but most of it begs for the skip key. They should've gone for ""less is more"", same goes for the grindy upgrade mechanics.

My point is, it could be better, but it's still a solid FPS.

PS: interesting how the word ""nazi"" is a curse in of itself. Playing the German version, BJ whispers ""I can think of a thing or two to do with a hatchet and a regime asshole"". Here, ""regime asshole"" is just ""nazi"" because, y'know, it's an insult way worse than ""asshole"".

First of all, it's gore and violence are over the top and the guys definitely took quips from Tarantino both with story and presentation. Sometimes it works, more often it's cringe or disgusting. 

Second, addition of the HUB, shitloads of collectibles, mini-games and small talks with your crew. It can be fun if you into such things but also it really messes up the vibe and flow of the game.

Third, the main gameplay is slick and simple, but it's too repetitive for such a long game (maybe that's why they added so much stuff that doesn't involve killing things).

Fourth, the story. Devs really tried to send some kind of message but I am afraid even they didn't know what was the message exactly. You can see some pro LGBT, BLM, body positivism and other modern social justice stuff clumsily melded with anti-nazi/fascist narrative, all of it is set in 1960 in a world conquered by Third Reich. I gotta say it looks ridiculous and the message (if there ever was one) doesn't get across at all. Very cautiosly I have to wonder if the devs tried to appeal to some market/social group who would love such narratives?

Fifth, the whole Wolfenstein story once again moves nowhere and after finishing the game there is a feeling that BJ once again achieved nothing.

In short, a bombastic sequel, as it should be.

After reading the first paragraph, players who didn't like the first part will probably say that it looks like a nice Hollywood fool. But veterans of the latest iteration of Wolfenstein already know that it won't be that simple. The story component of New Colossus is actually one of the game's greatest strengths - it manages to be sensitive, funny, epic, moving, terrifying, absurd and disgusting all at once, and rarely does the mishmash come out with an unpleasant incongruity.

This time, Blazkowicz moves across the big puddle from Europe back home, to the occupied America of the 1960s. The New Order rules there. Guys in Ku Klux Klan costumes are walking the streets, there is a total Germanization of American culture, the Jews are gone and the blacks will soon follow. And Manhattan is a radioactive hell after being hit by a nuclear bomb. But the rebels are not going to leave it at that, so they set out on a bloody journey, the end result of which should be an all-American uprising.
The harsh tyranny of the Third Reich is visible at every turn, so it's no wonder that most Americans prefer to sit quietly at home or even collaborate with a white hood on their heads instead of trying to do something about the situation.

At the same time, the tone of the story spills over from side to side. For a while, you listen to the protagonist's genuinely touching, depressing, philosophical monologue, only to be ambushed by the comically evil main villain in no time. Into a serious dialogue about the terrible state of the whole mission, a character loudly praises how she had a nice emptying after a long time. At one point, you even find yourself going to the set of a Nazi propaganda film about BJ Blazkowicz and auditioning for the role of BJ Blazkowicz, the real BJ Blazkowicz taking the whole thing very seriously as another serious part of his quest to save the world.
I dare say it's one of the funniest scenarios I've seen in the game.

Nazi propaganda constantly labels you a terrorist and portrays you as a complete amoral lunatic, which, let's face it, isn't all that incomprehensible considering the number of your victims. And it's a fact that you cause more than one atomic explosion during the game. But in the end, there's seriously no doubt that you're doing the right thing. Because you are freeing the world from the most horrible regime in human history. And because you're playing one of the best single-player shooters of recent times.
In short, it's honest hectic shooting peppered with some stealth and tactics, served with a quality story brought to life by great characters. Gutten Appetit, Terror-Billy! [b] 80% [/b]",1675629259,1675629259,True,28,0,0.726596474647521973,0,True,False,False

I was so incredibly excited for this game and for its release, but the day of I couldn't run the game and no matter what patch I tried for my GPU or game, nothing worked. I finally found my own solution by disabling my integrated graphics card, but that's another story.

Speaking of story, this game's story leaves a bit to be desired. There will be spoilers ahead, so read at your own risk.

The entire driving force of this game is to start a ""revolution in America"", a phrase heard so often in this game, you would think you would actually build up a revolution in the game, and watch the Nazi regime crumble throughout the storyline. Wrong. The game is left at what I believe to be a purposeful cliffhanger for a sequel, and it's very disappointing.

However, the gameplay is rather enjoyable, despite the lack of boss diversity. Giant walkers everywhere? Check.

All in all, this game won't hold up to The New Order, which I highly recommend, but it's still a good way to pass the time.

Now my preorder content has disappeared! Good job Bethesda, you suck.

I just couldn't take it seriously and since the narrative is treated as something of importance in this game I therefore need to pay attention to it unlike in something like Doom 2016 or even Eternal where you were given the bare essentials and had to find the details if you cared enough.

Firstly, the story is a mess. I'm not going to say TNO's story was ""realistic"" but it at least treated itself seriously, this one does not. Your helicopters (forget what the game called them) are painted with peace signs, rainbows, and flowers. I know the game takes place in the 60s and in our world the hippie movement was in full swing at the time but that isn't the case in this game. You are under the heel of literal nazis and are fighting a guerrilla war for freedom and you decide to ride in guns blazing while also having peace signs and flowers painted on your helicopter? That kind of clashes let's be honest. And remember how the Nazis were evil in TNO in that iron fist authoritarian way where you got the sense that so long as you followed their rules, you were good? Yea, not now. They feel more like Joker's brand of evil, set to go off at any point, kill and massacre just alleviate boredom, and diabolically laughing while doing so. Mispronounce a German word? Oh boy better correct that or get ready to meet the business end of a luger. Remember when death was a definite end in TNO? Well in this game (spoilers) someone is actually decapitated medieval style but don't worry, they managed to survive and get a literal head transplant. I know we're playing fast and loose with biology in these games I mean, we were fighting basically fighting souped up super soldiers and mechs in TNO and actual zombies in Old Blood, but surviving a decapitation is just a step too far for me. And even the super soldiers didn't come out of their experiments with full functionality, they could really only follow orders and kill. Far as I know, we never hear one talk as I'm pretty sure they can't. But the decapitated guy? Perfectly fine, better actually thanks to his new body. And in Old Blood that was more or less a retelling of Return to Castle Wolfenstein so I guess I just separated it in terms of it being canon.

I felt like the weapon upgrade system was unnecessary. It feels like Doom 2016's upgrade system but to me it was just missing something. In Doom each upgrade you got would change the weapon in a substantial way. The shotgun would get a grenade launcher or a burst fire (in eternal it would be fully automatic) and could be switched out. Rocket launcher got a lock-on or you could manually detonate the rocket in the air, and so on. In this game, at least the ones I remember were more or less basic upgrades. Armor piercing bullets for the rifle, a scope, and a taped magazine for faster reloads. A silencer for the machinepistol or a drum mag, or even different ammunition that increases damage. Nothing really changes the weapons to make them more interesting just upgrades that give more ammo or do more damage at maybe a slight cost to velocity. 

You also start the game (and play a decent amount) with reduced health, I think you're stuck at 50 for several hours until a story thing happens and you are given the full 100 health to play with. The game is still functional but I felt like I couldn't run and gun like I could in TNO due to the reduced health.

And this is more of a pet peeve but with the transition to a new engine, they changed BJ's face just a little bit,  and honestly, it just looks ridiculous to me. I can't really point out as to why.

I will say that the gameplay is just as good as it was in TNO. The unadulterated violence is just next level and is why I love these types of games. Leaving a fight with a room looking like a slasher movie or a Tarantino film never gets old. Perks are more or less implemented the same and I enjoyed it in TNO and they work just as well here. But both of these were just as good in TNO so they just kept what worked. The new characters were fine, no real complaints about them. Most I can say is that they were very ""meh"" but I felt the same about TNO's characters save a few standouts like Anya, Set, and Fergus and some others but the majority were just...there and many are the same here. I did notice some performance issues stutters, fps drops, and a few crashes but reducing the graphics helped. it was odd since the problems only became apparent like 5 hours in. Prior to that, almost no issues except the occasional stutter.

Anyways that's it. I could talk about some other stuff but that's delving into spoiler territory and I didn't really get to experience it as I dropped the game shortly after getting basically a major upgrade to your character. This upgrades lets you do a few new things dependent on your choice but it also lets you now have 100 health. But by this point, I was already tuned out and dropped the game and just didn't go back.",1673740308,1673740308,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is awful, all the new characters are extremely annoying and the pre-existing ones that were actually interesting and well written before now have the depth of a puddle.

Not to mention B.J. himself has the awful side plot regarding his abusive father, something that has never been referenced in previous games. It feels extremely jarring and shoehorned in an unnecessary attempt to flesh out B.J. as a character.

Gameplay-wise, the combat is not too dissimilar to The new Order but suffers from absolutely terrible level design disguised by the admittedly very beautiful looking areas. Levels are often frustrating to traverse, particularly if you attempt to stealth your way through. There are also a few incredibly tedious sections where you have to fend of waves of enemies single-handedly. The courthouse battle is an especially egregious example of this. It's so difficult and lasts so long that I thought I was doing something wrong when I first played the game.

I get the feeling the devs were perhaps trying to partially emulate the modern doom design philosophy in a way. Giving the player large arenas stocked with ammo and then filling them with enemies. It simply does not work in tandem with wolfenstein's much slower pace in combat. You cannot jump through open areas, gunning down enemies left and right like in doom, you will die.

Now, I don't think the wolfenstein series should be taken seriously, the concept itself is inherently ridiculous. This game however, takes the occasionally goofiness of the previous games and turns itself into a whole fucking circus. There are so many ""lol XD random!!!111!!!11"" moments in this game which feel completely out of place and elicit no other reaction from my body other than pure, primal cringe. I can't take any part of this game seriously because there's awful marvel movie tier dialogue every 5 minutes reminding me that the writers (who somehow are the same ones who worked on The new Order) just decided they didn't give a flying fuck about this franchise anymore.

A lot of people complained about this game being overly political or ""the wokeification of wolfenstein"". I personally don't really care. It is kind of weird how they tried to do some genuine political commentary about the current state of the world, but it doesn't really hit. I actually think it would be quite interesting to explore other political factions in a setting like this if it was actually done well. There's the communist guy who really doesn't have much dialogue outside of his introduction and the wolfenstein universe equivalent black panther lady who is one of the more annoying characters. They had the potential to actually pose some interesting questions about B.J.'s beliefs but the writers really put no effort into fleshing them out or even giving them remotely serious or believable personalities. Just cardboard cutouts who occasionally say some dumb shit.

So yeah, fuck this game. Only buy it if you want to cringe at your monitor for approximately 10 hours. And if you played TNO and just want to see where they decided to go with the story, wait for a sale. A big sale. This game is not even worth £10, let alone 25. Fingers crossed the devs and writers actually pull their weight for the next game although that's unlikely considering how youngblood turned out.

And on a side note, the DLCs are lazy cashgrabs. No new content, no story, just glorified level packs.",1673451670,1673451670,False,9,0,0.528398513793945313,0,True,False,False

Pros:
Engaging and Fun Combat 
Neat assassination side missions
Fun stealth mechanics that are more than just staying hidden
Cool visual style and enemy design
Never had any crashes or major bugs
Rich, Well - developed setting

Cons:
Levels can be confusing to navigate at times 
Collectables in levels often very difficult to find (use a guide if you want to 100% complete everything)
Storyline, while fun, seemed a bit fragmented
Campaign was too short (in the best possible way)

The gameplay is generally good, almost identical to TNO, (which isn't a bad thing) However the difficulty is scaled a little bit weirdly. For me playing in ""Bring 'em on"" difficulty (standard) some levels felt incredibly easy with practically no difficulty to speak of, whereas others were incredibly difficult. This however didn't bother me that much.

I did however have one MAJOR issue with this game. The game ends where it should have started. Without spoiling anything I'll just say it was really disappointing. The ending was so jarringly out of place I thought I had just played a really long prologue until an achievement informed me that was the end credits. [spoiler] I found personally the fact that your actual effect on the world is never shown. Do people uprise? do people riot? what happened in the relationships between all these characters? [/spoiler] A lot of the game's ending is a big question mark, and not in a good way... It all seemed like a huge set up for a big third game, which as of now a (proper) third wolfenstein game hasn't happened, so it all feels very unfinished in truth.

I also took issue with the fact that when you finish the main story, the game never makes it clear to you whether that was actually the end or not. I actually had to go and google it to make sure. Honestly to me the most disappointing part, is the lack of recognizable landmarks in the game.

But I will say even through all that crap, it's still not a half-bad game. It has some pretty neat gameplay elements, and some damn cool characters (even if they were almost all crazily underdeveloped), and some story moments which in the moment are really amazing to play. It's hard to say it's a bad game, however, don't go in to this game expecting another New Order. It's a different beast, in some positive ways, and sadly, in some incredibly negative ways.

I only got in to wolfenstein for the story, which I understand for most people isn't the case. For me personally I'd say this game is one I have mixed feelings about. For anybody who liked wolfenstein for just the gameplay, or just liked the story as some side stuff to get in to, absolutely buy this game, however if you're like me, you may also leave disappointed

TL;DR: Story felt vastly unfinished and underdeveloped and left me craving more (in a bad way).

Wolfenstein: The New Colossus is a first-person shooter developed by MachineGames and released in 2017. As a fan of the series, I was excited to see what the newest installment had to offer. Plus, as a communist, there's little I find more satisfying than killing fascists, so I was definitely looking forward to that as well.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
The gameplay in Wolfenstein: The New Colossus is fast-paced and intense, with a variety of weapons and abilities at your disposal. The controls are responsive and easy to use, making it a breeze to take out waves of enemies. One of the standout features of the gameplay is the ability to dual wield weapons, which adds an extra layer of strategy to combat. During my time playing, I didn't encounter any major bugs or glitches.

[h1]Story:[/h1]
The story of Wolfenstein: The New Colossus takes place in an alternate history where the Nazis won World War II and have taken over the United States. You play as B.J. Blazkowicz, a resistance fighter fighting to take down the Nazi regime. The story is well-written and full of twists and turns, and the characters are well-developed and interesting. The pacing of the story is excellent, with just the right balance of action and exposition.

[h1]Graphics and Sound:[/h1]
The graphics in Wolfenstein: The New Colossus are top-notch, with detailed environments and character models. The frame rate was smooth and stable throughout my playthrough. The sound design is also impressive, with a great soundtrack and excellent voice acting.

[h1]Replay Value:[/h1]
Wolfenstein: The New Colossus has a good amount of replay value, with multiple difficulty levels and unlockable content. There are also collectibles scattered throughout the levels, which give you a deeper understanding of the game's world and characters. The multiplayer modes are also a lot of fun and add an extra layer of replayability.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
Overall, I highly recommend Wolfenstein: The New Colossus to fans of first-person shooters and anyone looking for an engaging story with great gameplay and graphics. The game's intense action, well-written story, and excellent replay value make it well worth the price of admission. It's always satisfying to take out a bunch of fascists.",1672336391,1672336391,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-It's feels more like a movie, then a video game 50/50. I've run into games like this before, where people developing it seem more like they want to go to Hollywood then the game industry. 
-The sub is a mistake, hub area. Just waste of resources, you also get lost easily it's more like a maze, plus there are no guides to get around the 2 to 3 story maze,  causes lots of frustration, reboot of Thief did the same mistake. 
-Difficulty isn't balanced, sometimes it's just too hard. 
-Lack of Nades
-Energy weapons shouldn't be in the game
-Needs Heavy Weapons to be carryable. 
-Get rid of Commander Radio calls ins. 
-Get rid of all the characters expect the player and the NAZI's. Waste of resources, time. 
-The game should be more focused on the outside world, new places, something like Half Life 2. 
-The three talents when you're close to finished should not be in the game. They make no sense

Gameplay/gunplay -wise: It's pretty much the same as ""New Order"" and ""Old Blood""; dual-wielding, solid feel to the shooting, decent weapon variety, optional stealth, commander killing, perks based on kills/tactics done repeatedly, variety of maps to go through, etc. All similar. Though it doesn't have the ridiculous lock-picking mini-game BS from TNO (thank GOD!) and it doesn't really have a ""branching story"" depending on who you picked for a companion (Death's Head survivor), that person just... IS THERE, and ... DOES STUFF.

Mechanically, it's got some rough spots. Lots of points where you get snagged on world geometry, lots of spots where the stealth system breaks itself, lots of places where your mobility skills won't activate properly, some shoddy optimization, some GPU/memory leakage, some bugged out texture loading and lighting. Mostly minor stuff, really, but it detracts from the overall package.

YES, the cutscenes are mostly throw-away and told very ham-fisted-ly, but you can skip them if you want, so, (shrug). The story overall is pretty garbage, but the ""story"" in a Wolfenstein game probably isn't why most of us are here. (more shrugging).

The combat doesn't feel right, the damage feedback is really terrible.
I often got stuck and a door because of the goofy level geometry. Same goes for jumping down in vents, you are floating in the air before you actually fall down.
The game is loaded with cutscenes to artificially extend the whacky 8hrs of main story this game has to offer. But wait, there's more to complain about:
This game seems to have a very common issue with video memory leakage, it's just a matter of time when the game tells you that the ""video driver has run out of dedicated memory"". 
The stealth aspect of the game is badly executed, the levels offer you some options to sneak around enemies but in the end you'll have to kill them either way

Some cutscenes are entertaining others annoying such as the birthday one. Some characters are good, others trash. Story is ok, but also has some stupid parts. The game is not consistent in it's quality. It's not anywhere as enjoyable, exciting and fun as New Order. I was also expecting an epic unique boss fight but nope. I went slow took my time, explored a bit to try and find collectibles and fought some of those commander guys. But just feel sick of it and can't be bothered with it.

Only problem is the game has a memory leak. After getting a play time of around 6 hours  it said my video driver ran out of memory and I had low memory. I only have a 1660 super but that is more than enough to run this game well. I also have 16GB of RAM. I noticed another review with someone having a 3070 and 32GB of RAM had the same problem.
It seems the warning is some kind of bug as the game performance is not affected as I don't get any slow down or fps drops.
It is no where near as good as New Order  and I had no problems with that game.
I really dislike that you can't select levels to play like New Order did and the ending was not satisfying. And when I tried the Wolfstone 3D game I ended up stuck in the screen when I chose to look at the controls and no matter what key I pressed I could not exit.

I am not sure I can recommend because of the annoying low memory bug that keeps popping up even though I chose the option to not notify me of it again.
I  would originally give it a ok rating to downgrading it to a 4/10 bad as the bug is annoying and several other things annoy me.

[h1] Ramble: [/h1]

This is a great game. It takes all the things that made New Order interesting and pushes them further. You're faster, aggression is rewarded, stealth is nerfed to being very situational, and you depend less on cover. It does a lot of QoL things better, too - automatically picking up ammo and armour from fallen enemies, and having a less limiting (but still important) ammo economy, are very welcome changes. It's also a very pretty game.

Interestingly, I found that you get punished for stealth in this game. Unlike in New Order, enemies usually have enough armour to mean you can't just one-shot them with the pistol or a thrown hatchet. You have to get close to reliably take them out without setting off an alarm, but then you're out of position for if you do get caught. Since patrolling enemies are a lot smarter than in NO, this will happen if you try to stealth an entire encounter, and you'll get rekt for it. Therefore, stealth is more about putting yourself in a favourable position to begin a fight, e.g. with good sight lines, being near health/armour, or getting the jump on harder enemies. This may sound like a bad thing, but it's actually great imo - it means stealth makes up a much smaller proportion of gameplay whilst still being a strategic part of combat. (For context, I played on ""Call Me Terror-Billy"" difficulty for my first playthrough).

It is held back by a few small things though. Most importantly: the lighting. What the heck? I've never played a game where I thought much about the lighting, to be honest. But NC totally fumbles it by having so many areas (especially later in the game) filled with unrealistically blinding lights, thick fog, or a weird miasma that obscures everything. Not only does it break immersion, but it adds a frustrating aspect to the difficulty because you get killed by stuff you can't see. 

Weirdly, this does seem intentional from the devs. This is obvious when you do the side content because quite a few levels have encounters designed around these lights or fog obscuring distant enemies. One level is even in total darkness, meaning you rely on a very small flashlight. I like that they experimented with this, but in practice it's annoying.

Also: dual wielding. Because they give you so many configurations, it's hard to quickly/easily get to the combos you actually want. If you rely on pressing Q to toggle to your last used weapon, you can't do that between dual weapons and a single different weapon. Moreover, if you scroll or use the weapon wheel to switch weapons while dual wielding you won't go back to a different single weapon like in NO, you'll cycle your right hand gun and keep the left hand gun the same, or vice versa. Since time doesn't slow in the weapon wheel until you get a late game perk, this means you'll get rekt for being picky about weapon combos.
This *could* be fixed with having dedicated hotkeys for each weapon, but I don't think it's reasonable to expect players to do that on a first playthrough.

Finally: the story. This is the least important part of the game really, but they gave it much more love and care this time. Even if you ignore the plot itself, the hub is full of heartfelt interactions between different Kreisau fighters which make it feel like a real place, full of real people, with real hopes and tragic pasts. Even the random Nazi dudes have interesting conversations, causing you to pause and listen to their random personal drama before swiftly relieving them of it. Same goes for the documents you find. In most games I ignore these things, but here they're witty and loaded with emotion.

It's not without issues though. Fergus, one of the only interesting characters in the previous games, is sidelined to being an angry twat most of the time. BJ becomes way too melodramatic for the first half of the game - they definitely should've toned that down a bit. And the story-laden intro is unskippable, making Mein Leben playthroughs too much of a chore. Otherwise, I really like the way they use new characters and develop old ones. It manages to be both very silly and surprisingly sincere - it has hilariously unreasonable bombast alongside heartfelt character interactions. A very nice balance of tone, imo.  (Side-note: ""Terror-Billy"" is a stupid nickname and I hate it.)

[h1] Wolfenstein reboots in a nutshell: [/h1]

New Order: 7/10. Strikes a truly unique balance between being cover based and retro style. Stealth is OP, and often incentivises you to avoid fights, but it does allow you to go ham with dual weapons when the time is right. Map design is generally open and allows you to flow between aggression and cover, though some levels (especially the final one) are all about sightline/choke abuse. Starting each mission with limited weapons, usually just the pistol, feels needlessly limiting and further encourages stealth to avoid fights.

Old Blood: 4/10. An often frustrating experience due to its over-use of tedious stealth, limiting map design that punishes aggression and encourages abusing sightlines by leaning, and one of the most mind numbing final bosses imaginable. It has its moments, but generally it takes the foundations laid by NO but puts you in maps which make most of the interesting things about NO unviable.

New Colossus: 8.5/10. Takes almost all emphasis away from cover and stealth, maps and mechanics are conducive to playing aggressively, and has a more interesting array of weapons and upgrades. Story and characters are good but a bit melodramatic at times. Held back by some small things, but very solid overall.",1670744955,1670744955,True,2,0,0.52368694543838501,0,True,False,False

I got it here on sale with all the DLC for about 8 dollars, I was curious if the story was still as bad as i remember... and yes, it is. Story aside the shooting and gunplay is on par with an Id software game, meaning really good, still It doesn't really expand much on the system from New order & Old blood, leaving much to be desired. 

The maps are also very uninspired and boring. This is meant to take place in the United states and there's only really one part that manages to show Nazi occupied America, New York city is just a boring wasteland (and yes, I know it was nuked, but they still could have made NYC look a bit more like NYC).  

I have a lot of issues with this game, like the difficulty balancing is horrible among other things. If you really wanna play this because you liked the previous games I'd lower my expectations and only get this on a good sale for 8 bucks like I did, and I still feel kinda ripped off with that. I would suggest buying Doom 2016 or Doom eternal instead, those games are made for fans, by fans, and it really makes the games shine.

Also If you thought BJ's monologues in the previous games were melodramatic and kinda angsty, they turned that up about 100% for The new colossus.

PROS:
- Plot is deep, solid and intriguing
- Acting is incredible
- The dystopian world is amazingly made
- Filler sections make sense and give depth to the characters
- Good level design
- Beautiful graphics and landscapes
- We can finally get to explore and fight into the nazi dominated cities or the post nuclear ruins, instead of having only a quick glance (I.E. as seen in London, Berlin or the Moon surface in TNO. Yes, they still taste extremely bitter)
- The combat system, the perks and the power ups are well made
- The duration of the game is finally reasonable
- A smarter AI than the one seen in TNO and OB
- The soundtrack
- KILLING NAZIS
- KILLING POST NUCLEAR NAZIS

CONS:
- Few plot holes and inconsistencies (but not nearly as many as the ones seen in TNO)
- Checkpoint system is sometimes messed up
- Difficulty can be artificial and unbalanced in some sections
- AI has definitely improved since last chapter, but is still not great
- The annoying warning message about the video memory despite spending ages on the settings

This title is great almost under every aspect. TNO started with good ideas that were never fully developed in the actual game, but that we see improved in this one.

What fascinated me the most was the idea of Nazis accelerating technology by atleast a century, their space traveling tech is something we dont even have now or portal lethal laser guns yet the game is set in 1961. This is evidence by the familiar architecture and the protagonist’s, B.J Blazkowicz, mid-western accent however i'm confused by this choose, are they implying that technology would have advanced to level never seen before if the third reich won WW2, I might be reaching it is a video game after all, just fantasy making. This version of Hitler is amusing to say the least, he won the war but is still highly paranoid and just as ambitious to eradicate his enemies prewar and obviously is a pill popping addict, he should of had more screen time they barely touched the surface of exploring this character,albeit I didn't get to kill him (only became aware of that option when I sought out the steam achievement list to see what i missed after completing the game).

The game begins with Blazkowicz kicking ass and killing Nazis on a wheelchair, the tone of the game is established early and Im loving it , just like every other fps or games with fps elements incorporated I was not sure which approach to take : go gun blasting like in Doom Eternal Or stealth approach; the game presents both methods. In some chapters of New Colossus it made sense to be stealthy to avoid dying countless times, obviously depending on what difficulty you were playing. I was playing on “Bring Em On”, it was all smooth sailing until I reached the  infamous “courtroom” (those who have played know what i'm referring to). It was brutal, I was confused and frustrated, I raged quit after 30 minutes looked up on youtube, ashamedly, to find that some people managed to play it on the utmost difficulty setting with pristine accuracy, their movement was fast and erratic like a ADHD person on amphetamine; it resemble the gameplay of pro COD players I've occasionally seen online. At that point I asked myself am I capable as a casual hobbyist to play like that, obviously for fun, it takes me too long to finish games in general however I enjoy delving into the lore that the development team created but for once I want to feel like a gun sling badass. So I set a timer for 30 minutes and tried to channel my inner ADHD to imitate those pro COD players you see on random TikTok/Youtube clips, I progressively improved with each death but because of human error and feeling out of my element I would eventually catch a bullet to the head. I think that style of gameplay requires hours of practice,it is insane, sooo I lowered the difficulty setting but using the same approach and survived, only for that surprise plot twist (WTF). Note: at one point I tried it on the highest difficulty, conclusion: not fun, maybe I need what Hitler was popping to reach those speeds.

The gun animation is very satisfying and the stealth takedowns are on point with numerous variations each with flesh debris splattered on your face and nearby surfaces. In terms of the story it's actually pretty good, I can see it being a short Netflix series with Tim Miller at the helm. The dialogue cutscenes in the submarine sometimes strangely reminded me of Cowboy Bebop’s scenes when the characters were chilled and mellow and having casual dialogue. The dialogue between the NPC was basic, nothing special. The graphics were on par with most high graphics games of 2017 but the visual effects stood out for me. I definitely recommend this game to FPS players who are also looking for a good cinematic story.

Gameplay-
Dual wielding different weapons at the same time is awesome in theory- however, the dual weapon select screen is terrible. When trying to select a weapon (with mouse), pushing your mouse straight forward/up will almost never select the topmost weapon (assault rifle), and this hold true for most parts of the wheel. This necessitates taking your eyes off combat, and slowly selecting a weapon in real-time while you are getting shot at. Some slow-down and a more precise wheel would have fixed this (it probably works fine on console/controller).
Weapon variety is pretty poor; I like the additions of the new heavy weapons and diesel/electricity refueling, but half of the main weapons are pretty obsolete. for stealth, the Pistol far outclasses the SMG, and the rifle outclasses it in open combat; making the SMG obsolete from basically the start. The little grenade-launcher pistol is also straight up terrible, and is also far outclassed by the Dieselkraftwerk-thing (which you can also dual wield!). I miss the option for a high-powered rifle like in TNO that was useful for far-off enemies. Plus points for bringing back the amazing shotgun/s though.
Contraptions were a neat addition, but the fact that you can ONLY obtain the final 2 right before the last mission (which you dont even know will be the last mission when you start) is pretty disappointing. I chose Ram-Shackles, which I now feel like is the most useless of all of them. It forces you into an aggressive playstyle (yes, I know that was the point- but players should have the freedom to experiment with different ways of entering firefights even if their ""build"" is skewed towards one end of the spectrum) by making a loud entry into new areas that are only accessible via a contraption route. The game really should have offered the chance to get these contraptions earlier, or should have added another mission or two to the main story so that you have a chance to get and test out these contraptions.
Clipping and invisible walls make it so that BJ can often get caught on the bottom parts of doorframes and other little obstacles that in most modern games would not hinder you. Trying to crawl/fall through vents is equally annoying, and some other tight areas are near-gamebreaking as you need to find the exact angle and positioning to pass through.
The melee key being double bound to the throwing axe is also very annoying. So many times did I try to stab a guard/break a box at point blank, and the axe is thrown and often lost or even alerts nearby guards. On the topic of the throwing axe- there are many instances in which it was thrown, and just dissipated into thin air; it did not hit a wall or even go through the air, it just disappears after being thrown and does nothing.

Story-
Overall, story is not bad. The main story missions are well varied and paced for the most part, and there are a lot of interesting characters, dialogue, and collectibles to be found. There are also some extremely annoying characters (yes, you know who I'm talking about) that come into the story and take very odd commanding roles and give BJ condescending orders and things of the nature. There are also a host of new characters that seem like they would be a major part of the story, but contribute almost nothing in gameplay or cutscene time. Remember in TNO when your bunker gets wiped out by the Nazis and so many of your people die? I remember that being a quite sad moment and motivation towards the final fights; meanwhile, if the ship had been raided towards the end of this game, I would have felt very little sadness for most of the crew (besides those who survived TNO) since there is very little development created. Searching around the bunker in TNO was also far more engaging and satisfying than trying to explore the ship (which has an extremely confusing layout). 

Overall, this game is not BAD by any means; it is quite good in fact, but I am leaving this as a negative review due to the extremely frustrating choices made, mainly pertaining to gameplay. I got it on sale for about $6; for that price, I am extremely satisfied. If I had paid $60 for this game brand new, with only about 8 hours of main story and some very disappointing side missions, I would have been pretty unhappy.",1669918042,1669918042,False,2,0,0.498930007219314575,0,True,False,False

While TNC inherits TNO's extremely capable shooter DNA, without the latter's set-pieces that were interspersed to keep things interesting, the former ends up being just another shooter.

The story is also nothing to write home about. Again it builds on its predecessor's, but doesn't really expand on it. This makes it a little difficult to care when certain characters are killed off, or when new ones join the party. There are no particularly noteworthy twists of any sort, it's just a case of go to a location, kill enemies, retrieve something/destroy something, wash rinse repeat. There's a sub-plot about mortality which tries to evoke pathos, but you know they're never gonna die anyway because they're a main character and therefore have plot armour, so said character's crying about it just ends up being annoying.

Environments are serviceable but small, nothing special. I was also able to get my character stuck into the level geometry at least once, which at least confirms this is indeed a Bethesda game. Weapons are nice and punchy but some of their upgrade choices are confusing. For example there's one that has a silencer, but no scope; while another has no silencer, but a scope... WHY? Then there's the shotgun, which as per traditional videogame weapon balancing is capable of doing damage only when it's close enough to an enemy to be inserted into one of their bodily orifices.

Alternative history Nazi-controlled America is less contentious and therefore less shocking at the time of this review in 2022, compared to half a decade ago when the game was released, thanks to a certain tangerine president and his supporters. Granted there are far too many Americans who need a basic history lesson in the horrors of Nazism is and why it's something to be abhorred not embraced, but I don't feel a videogame is the optimal vehicle for delivering that message. At least, not this one.

All in all it feels like a game that was created not as the result of a bold vision for how to move the series forward, but simply to tick the box ""Wolfenstein reboot sequel"" off a list.

612880,127181155,76561197998835516,0,75,1539,0,1539,1668961524,"Wolfenstein – The new colossus is a FPS set in an alternative retro-future. The second world-war was won by the germans, and now the US is under german occupation. It is up to the weakened protagonist, who just regained consciousness after a long coma to fight back against the germans.

At the start of the game you will have to choose between saving one comrade out of two. The result however will not be only slightly changed cutscenes down the line. Depending on who you saved, you will unlock a unique weapon. As such, saving Fergus will unlock the laser rifle, by far the better choice. The other one would be a large-scatter close/medium range combat gun. 

The graphics of the game are detailed, as expected from a AAA franchise. There are tons of assets used in the game, like various vehicles, ruined buildings. The german soldiers will have a wide variety of outfits, and there will be a lot of semi-futuristic weapons. There will be a few problems with the graphics too. One is the notorious “The video driver has run out of dedicated resources – accept and mute further warnings” warning, which will just keep popping up randomly during playing. For me there was a slow item loading, resulting a delayed pop-in of items at the edge of the screen when turning suddenly. Also the game imitates the delay of eye adaptation when entering a dark zone, where for a few seconds everything will be very dark, then brightening up sightly.

The level design is good. There will be various environments, but the most emphasizes will be given to retro futuristic german environments, a combination of industrial and military settings. The stealth approach felt more natural on some levels than others, still, on normal difficulty triggering the alarms won’t be fatal, merely more harder for a short time. The enemies arriving piecemeal if you stay far away from their base after an alarm can be abused in a pinch.

Surprisingly the story, specifically the cutscenes are the weakest part of the game by far. AAA games shouldn’t have issues in that regard, yet this game manages to present ridiculous / jarring scenarios. It doesn’t help that the allies to be sought for the revolution are irresponsible anarchists. While one shouldn’t expect realism in this setup, the events / characters are just way over the top, entering a bad caricature level.

The voice acting of the game is great, too bad it is wasted on a weird story. The music stayed in the background, generally I just didn’t notice it.

The weapons will be mostly the standard types expected in an FPS. A welcome option is the heavy weapon class. There will be 3 types of them. They can only be picked on the map, and have to be abandoned either as you progress through choke points, or when their ammo runs out. The best one is the heavy laser, it is basically the I win option. The diesel thrower is more of a mid/close range weapon, and there is an autocannon too. If I got access to them, I always preferred them to any of my other weapons. The catch with them is that you will move more slowly, and cannot dual wield. But on normal difficulty I never found a situation that mandated dual wielding. As for the standard weapons, there will be a pistol and a submachine gun, both of which can be silenced, so using them won’t trigger an alarm (but if the enemy gets the chance to fire back, that will trigger the alarm). The standard assault gun is good for any situation, the shotgun is only till medium ranges. I already mentioned the special weapon depending on your choice at the beginning. A mini grenade launcher will be available too, though I barely used that, even after upgrading it to a RPG. You can use throwing axes too, but I rarely relied on them, they are mostly an alternative for stealthy approaches. Grenades can be used too, but I had varied success in throwing them to the intended places, so I don’t really relied on them. After the electric discharge upgrade I saved them mostly to disable monster mechas for a brief period.

The skill tree can be unlocked by performing certain gimmicks. Some of them happened naturally, like for heavy gun use. Others were more obscure, and I didn’t really progressed with them. On normal difficulty the game was forgiving enough to proceed without much progress in most of them. Eventually you can unlock one of three personal upgrades. By far the best for a casual gamer is the leg extension. Not because of its way of handling, but because it will unlock the secret bonus of health stabilization. By doing its somewhat hidden upgrade quest, it will allow to overcharge your health to 200 without it decaying, as it would happen otherwise. It also grants the adrenaline rush, which adds 3 health to you after a kill. It doesn’t seem much, however under 100 your health will grows to the next multiple of ten if no damage is taken. Kill someone when your health is 40, it will change to 43 then increases to 50 with no damage. The other two contraptions can be obtained too through their enigma mission, but there was an in game hint as to which enigma mission is that only towards the very end of the game. If chosen, the ram shackle upgrade supposedly can be upgraded to regen armor, probably similar to the adrenaline rush mechanics.

By collecting the commander cards, eventually the option for enigma missions will open up. They offer a chance to replay previous maps of the game. Most of the times the map will be the same as for the campaign, but not always. For example, Blazkowicz’s home will be a very different map, and Roswel downtown will have quite a different setup too. Playing through these maps you get a chance to collect all the collectibles, though a guide will probably be required for that. Starting with the New Orleans ones, I just ignored them, but did all the collectibles before them - which was the cause of me burning out for this part of the game. Running around aimlessly for the remaining collectibles just wasn’t fun, neither was checking out a youtube guide for them.

There is a quicksave function, but the game does its best to hide it from you. Nevertheless, with F5 you can quicksave freely. There are autosave points, the save icon is displayed clearly in the upper left corner for them, and you can save manually from the menu.

I played with the keyboard and mouse, for FPS games they are the natural choice. There was a weird bug with the game for me, if I left the gamepad attached to the computer, the game refused to use the keyboard input and shown only gamepad prompts. I just had to unplug the gamepad while I played this game.

At the start of a few levels I got the pistol equipped. That was a subtle hint by the game makers that a part with recommended stealth approach will come. Even if you don’t want to use stealth, your first weapon upgrade should be the silencer either for the pistol or the submachine-gun, opening up the possibility to take down enemies without triggering an alarm right away. There will be such hints throughout the game. For example if you encounter a lot of shotguns on a rack it is a hint that a close quarter approach is a suggested way to proceed.

The game has DLC missions too, with new protagonists. They aren’t exactly cheap, and are quite short. If all three would have been available for 5€ when I was playing, I would have bought them mostly to unlock the achievements, but alas that didn’t happen. As such I ended up skipping on them, and probably for the better.

While the game was reasonably entertaining, its sequels didn’t catch my interest. The VR one was limited in length, and seemingly a mediocre game too. Youngblood was a coop game, which, if played with an AI companion, was deemed very tedious. As such this game seems to be the proper end of the single player part of franchise for the time being.

Unfortunately, the game crashed to the desktop a few times. After a few such incidents, I just started to quicksave after finding a collectible, or after an inner segment.",1669540718,1669540718,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Good graphics, good production quality, but this is dumpster fire level far left propaganda in a slick package. It would be a far better game if we were allowed to play as the National Socialists in their battles against Communist Revolutionaries that were raging across Europe in the interwar period between WW1 and WW2, with thousands of people killed by them in street battles as the communist revolutionaries battled with the patriots across Europe, when the Bolsheviks slaughtered the Czar and his family and millions of White Russians, and swore to link up with the other communist parties in Germany (eg; the KPD (the Jew founded Communist Party of Germany) who also founded the original Antifaschistiche Aktion, with the same logo, as their paramilitary wing, the same terrorist thugs they are today), in France, etc to conquer all of Europe for Communism. Thankfully they were barely stopped by the Poles in 1920, and failed in 1918 and 1919 in the revolutions within Germany itself. (How many of you knew that there were socialist/communist revolutions within Germany in 1918/19? Hrm?) Until the International financiers got the United States involved, who allied themselves with the Communists and eventually after several years brought down the only movement in the world that was actually fighting for White Europeans and trying to preserve our way of life, our values, and our people.

(Same with the lies about why the Germans were trying to regain Danzig, or why Austria wanted to rejoin with Germany, both being ethnic German populations, etc... similar to how you're being lied to about Ukraine today, with Russia now ironically being treated as super evil, despite the US backed coup that ousted the democratically elected leader and replaced him with pro-western puppets, who then spent then next 8 years shelling innocent civilians in eastern Ukraine, killing thousands, before Russia, having exhausted all other options, finally stepped in to stop the mass murder of innocents by the criminals in Kiev, etc... but you're fed absurd lies about the Ghost of Kiev, Snake Island, Bucha Massacre, etc... lie after lie after lie, while they butcher civilians, use human shields, assassinate politicians that dare even speak to the Russians for the sake of creating green corridors to safely evacuate civilians etc... while western media bald faced lies about Ukrainian losses, about who is actually very clearly winning the war, etc etc... the same people, telling you the same lies, and you believe it about this like you believe it about the NSDAP.)

Now when we look around TODAY and see our children being indoctrinated to be revolutionary communists, to hate their own race, to hate their people's own heroes, history, and accomplishments, to want to destroy their own people and give their own nations over to envious foreigners, to hate themselves and wish to mutilate their own bodies, sterlize and castrate themselves, etc... when you see the rampant crime, violence, corruption, the collapse of social trust, etc... when your capitol cities are no longer inhabited by your own people, but by foreign peoples who only work to give ever more of your money to their people, to open your gates ever wider for their people to flood in and replace you...

When you open your eyes enough to see this reality, you'll know why the Nazis fought as they did and who the real enemy always has been.

You'll see these games as the insanely dishonest jokes that they are... where the Jews are brilliant super geniuses who invent all this technology centuries ahead of its time and use their powers only for the good of humanity (Tikkun Olam), and the Nazis are these absolute hyperbolic maliciously evil villains reveling in torture, gore, suffering for the sake of suffering, etc... whereas in reality they were chivalrous, honorable, noble and intelligent people fighting desperately to save their people from international bankers and foreign invaders. Simply trying to get those people to leave them alone so that Germany could be for the German people and not be debt slaves.

For the sin of not allowing the Jews to make them into debt slaves under the Usury system in their own lands, and not open their borders, promote degeneracy to their children, teach them to hate themselves, and allow a communist revolution by these internationalists to completely crush their own control over their own destiny, we now have to see these absolutely absurd lies, promoting Jews as superhuman saints, and the National Socialists as the epitome of absolute depravity and evil.

One could hardly be more dishonest.

Sadly their propaganda has been highly successful and most people think that the blatant and obviously ridiculous lies told in the constant drumbeat of Jew funded media like these games, the annual movies, etc... actually represents reality.

Most people know nothing at all of what the Jews actually did, their roles in the communist revolutions, their roles in the financial manipulations that fomented the wars against Germany, they know nothing of the horrific crimes committed by the Japanese or the Soviets, the larger body counts of Communism, etc... and so we're best friends with the Japanese today. There's no stigma attached to their people. You can wave the communist flag across the west without fearing violent attacks. Because that's what you've specifically been taught. For specific reasons.

They've made it LITERALLY ILLEGAL to talk about in several western countries. They're even trying to do that here. It's a violation of Terms of Service to do so on almost all major social media platforms.

27 STATES here in the US have laws requiring government contractors to swear oaths of allegiance to Israel.

The #1 recipient of foreign aid, at over $3.5 BILLION every year, year after year, is Israel. With the only country in recent history temporarily surpassing that was Afghanistan during part of our war there.

You're not allowed to talk about these things. And you really need to ask yourself why.

Most reading this will just see red and reflexively feel outraged, because of this absurd propaganda they've been taught, and they won't think twice about it. They won't question why the characters in this game behave the way they do, why the villains are so absurd, why the Jews are treated as the most virtuous, intelligent, and righteous of saints, etc.

Because it's been a drumbeat they've heard their whole lives. They've never stopped to actually carefully look at history and see if these ridiculous caricatures actually represented reality.

They don't question why you don't hear about the holodomor, or see a new movie every year about how evil the Japanese are.

Maybe somebody here will finally have that little lightbulb go off in their head and start to NOTICE.",1669525712,1669525712,False,1,2,0.324660658836364746,0,True,False,False

Alternate history stories where Nazi won the WW2 is not rare, though Wolfenstein is one of the few game series which makes a fascinating story out of it. Wolfenstein TNC brought the story to 1960s United States, and successfully rendered a chilling Nazi-occupied nation.

Still, there are some problems with this game. For example, the annoying ‘out of VRAM’ bug, which would appear even if it just use half the VRAM available; the Steam achievements not registering bug, which is especially annoying since even some basic storyline achievements cannot be completed.

[b]Spoiler Alert[/b]
Also, the gameplay is a bit empty after completing campaign. [spoiler]After killing the main antagonist, the only thing you can do except for grinding components, is killing the Ubercommanders, which still doesn’t give you anything besides a hidden assassin mission.

The first two were nice. Fairly enjoyable action gameplay, well thought level design. The characters have been interesting so far, but the story around them wasn't something to write home about. The alternate history *setting* and lore, however, are really interesting. Yes, I liked The Man in the High Castle. How did you know? Yet, the first two games didn't draw me in all that much. The graphics were fine, and something about the visual design felt noisy and cluttered. They didn't come close to being my favorite games of the last few years.

All this made me hesitate to start The New Colossus.

Wow am I glad I did. This game is a *massive* glow up for the new Wolfenstein series. 

It not only addresses my complaint about visual clarity; it's a hands down handsome looking game! 

The story remains just as interesting. Characters, old and new, are more fun than ever. Something about the cinematography and music in the cutscenes elevates them, and their performances pack a punch in this one. Grace Walker, a new addition to the squad, was solid all around. Another thing I enjoy about this game's narrative is the tone. It seems like a totally serious action-thriller on the surface. Yet, it's not afraid to delve into the weird and ridiculous from time to time. I think this was true for the previous iterations as well, but The New Colossus dials it up a notch. While I enjoyed it, I don't know if everyone would.

I enjoyed the gameplay loop in this one a bit more. If I remember right, the first two games ""chained"" their set pieces, with the character moving from scene to scene. I didn't complain about that, but I prefer how The New Colossus lays everything out. The game has been restructured to follow a home base and missions model (after the first mission or so). This gives an in-universe excuse for the game to take you to familiar locations, reusing maps with slight modifications for special assassination missions and collectible hunting. The New Colossus remains a gameplay-first game, offering a good amount of replay value and bonus ""levels"" to players who value those things.

Finally, one of the most standout aspects of this title for me was the FEEL of everything. I don't have a single word to distill this into. Everything from the menus, to the sound effects in the menus, to how the weapons looked and felt, movement controls, and overall UX is remarkably crisp. It's not easy to balance the fluidity of first-person character animations with how responsive the controls feel while managing to not look janky. I think it was mainly the UI respecting the player over unnecessary animations, delays, fade-ins for aesthetics. During gameplay, almost every voluntarily triggered animation (such as reload) can immediately be cancelled with reasonable consequences. I never found myself waiting for a menu to fade or slide into place, or for my character to finish reloading or switching weapons as an enemy guns me down. I'd love to see other games learn from The New Colossus how to make an experience that *feels* fun while looking nice.

All in all, I recommend this game. It's great. Please play The New Order first. Knowing all the characters was a big part of my enjoyment. Skip the prequel unless you're a huge fan of the first one. It's non-essential. It's very much a gameplay-first game with good replay value, bonus objectives, fantastic level design, fun collectibles, good humor, all packaged in UX that respects the player.

As a bonus, The New Colossus has a satisfying ending that could spark a sequel, but it won't be necessary. Netflix original series writers should learn from this franchise.",1668844484,1668844484,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game definitely has a story and a quite good one, but be honest, you are here to demolish Nazis and feel like an absolute badass. Being able to just rip through waves upon waves of these mech suit Nazis feels so damn good and the art/animation really does its job to convey the power you hold. Another really big positive for me is how the cut scenes are integrated in and how damn good they look, so hats off to Bethesda, great work per usual.

Running and gunning is definitely an option for the more seasoned Wolfenstein/Doom aficionados but for those players looking for a casual experience expect to take the stealthy route and die a lot during intense gun fights. And not to the difficulty either, more so fixed things in the environment killing the fluidity of your movement, random explosions caused by an over abundance of gas containers and explosive objects jam packed around each setting, getting dropped by an enemy or explosion and not being able to bounce quick enough, and the slow reload rates when overwhelmed by enemies.

For the upsides I'd say New Colossus' biggest draws are the characters, extremely satisfying gunplay, enemy variation, and story (some would disagree with this point). The story itself is nothing amazing or groundbreaking but its a good story none the less. The characters each have their story arcs that flesh out both their flaws, and their best qualities (to an extent  with some). The gunplay is my favorite aspect; the shooting mechanics, bullet impact, weapon design, and variety and choice when it comes to killing enemies is where this game shines. There are some moments that are more predictable when it comes to the gunfights but the replay value is high. I've caught myself wondering how I can go about killing an entire squad of elite nazis on my second campaign playthrough with a different set of weapons and using the environment to my advantage. Sure does getting killed by a random explosive ammo container get frustrating after the third or fourth time: absolutely, did I still have an amazing time: Ya mein fuhrer. Last thing I wanted to mention was the graphical improvements over the previous games. The art style really stands out and the smoothness, textures , and lighting give this game an aspect of eye candiness I haven't seen in very many video games trying to achieve a similar art style.

Overall highly recommend this game for anyone looking for high replay value, great fast paced gunplay, good story and characters, as well something beautiful to look at. Best Wolfenstein in my opinion.",1668412197,1668412335,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics are better, there is more extra stuff for you to do in this game than just getting collectibles as there are side missions and also assassinating the commanders, and the amount of weapon upgrades and how you collect them also felt better. However I have to say that I still found The New Order to be better. The levels are good but not as good as The New Order in my opinion, The New Order also felt like it had more tension because the situation was a lot more dire but in The New Colossus the resistance is doing much better and as such there is less tension throughout most of the story.

Combat are pretty frustrating on higher difficulty, or get so brain dead if you managed to upgrade your assault rifle to maximum level. Idk but this game have some lag when you try to duel wielding or try to switch your weapons, yeah combat is good but combat system? It just lacks flexibility and agility, just feels like developer try to make you play dumb way. Bro even Half-Life 2 has more better combat experience than you WTF?
Other than that, this game kinda sucks, especially the plot, sometimes I just feel like this story could happen in Saint Row Wolfenstein DLC. TBH some scenes are pretty good in first half, but after some middle point, the plot just go full Saint Row way. Remember the feelings of New Order? The feelings of Old Blood? Remember in New Order each character has some deep story behind them? Remember the depressing and hopeless tone with a bit of bright in Old Blood?

The sound is sometimes so overwhelming that you can not hear your surroundings and I had to turn it off completely in the last section of the game. It should be possible to cancel some animations, like when you are picking up some big weapon, you have to wait for the picking up to finish only then you can throw it down. You start story where you ended, on the big submarine. Then there is the old bat, frau Engels, she will be your nemesis throughout the game.

Oh I forgot to tell that it is so cheese, it hurts. Like a play from high school. But weapons are good. Pistol, SMG, Sturmgewehr, modern shotgun,grenade launcher. And trusty hatchet for a melee. Can be thrown as well. You can upgrade your weapons, in a really good way and can even switch between mods. You can get up to 3 gadgets of war. One is walker, imagine 2 meters high polesthat jump out of your boots. Just double jump and up you are. Has some tactical usage. The other is armor that allows you to ram down things. Last is sneaky/snaky, harness that allow you to shrink a bit, get into small air ducks and such. Later in game you need to use them to progress further. You are getting also skills, this time to acquire them is more about using them then before. AI is nothing out of ordinary. You get officers that if alerted and not finished of quickly will summon allies. When killed he drops enigma ticket. You can use them in enigma engine to decode locations of commanders on map. It only adds flavor to the game, nothing else. It is so hard to pick something from the ground. I had to backtrack quite often because of that. Like missing enigma ticket when you pressed E during shoot out. Who likes that? And best thing as last – you get to play the conversion of original Caste Wolfenstein. Modded a bit. There are 6 episodes each with 9levels. I enjoyed it a lot and play it all thru.
All in all I can recommend the game. You will have fun. But there are so many more better then this one. The cheesiness was too much. Like you get to fly to Venus, to audience with Hitler to play role of B.J. Blazskovic in a movie. You do not get to shoot him, but the things they show you are too much.",1668203233,1668203233,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cons:
Getting hit doesn't feel impactful, and can go unnoticed, causing frustrating deaths

Save system is god awful and ruins longevity of the game
No way to skip non-cinematic scenes, even if the only interactivity is camera movement. 

It's worth a playthrough of the story, but that doesn't make it worth buying.  Better to rent/borrow rather than buy.  There is no New Game Plus, so creating a new save of any kind erases all of your old progress.   If you're a completionist then be prepared to watch the extremely long and unskippable opening scenes to get all the difficulty achievements.

the bad : bogged down by it's own bad design choices, game crashes a lot, armor and weapon pickups tend to fly into hard to reach little spots throughout levels,little crevice's between debris, you can and will be shot during melee glory kills and dismounting vehicle states, stealth is nearly pointless, not entirely, it's only generally useful for starting fights, too many cutscenes and the mundane tasks in the hub between levels. honestly, just leave all that to a cutscene.. that's skippable. I'm playing wolfenstein, I'm here to kill nazis, not be an office assistant. the story... the whole power armor, and artificial BJ suit... it's awful. the weapon wheel can be really moody if you play on a controller, weapon swaps are slow, and if you need to change weapons during a fight, the wheel may or may not work at times. the autosave points... i can't tell you how many times it saves the game while you're being shot. so die, load auto save and you're taking damage instantly. 

the good: when stupid things aren't happening and you're shooting nazis, it's good at that. AR is OP, shotgun is still my preference because AR's are boring and overdone. stick to shooting, don't try to run and melee/ mix up the action during a fight too much if you have to reload or swap weapons because the wheel may not work, you'll be shot/killed for doing it, what sucks is it's so close to playing like you're in an 80s action film, and when it does play to that potential, it's fun, it's challenging and the a.i isn't entirely stupid on death incarnate, they're accurate, will flank and change positions a lot. the action is great only to be bogged down by it's crap.

1. On principle. 
I don't like this Nazi-obsessed shit. All the guns are German-styled. None are Allied-style. There are swastikas fucking everywhere. The team's pig is named ""Rosa"" - clearly a racist dev was referring to Rosa Parks, the African-American civil rights activist. Though we are shooting at Germans, I don't believe this game is anti-Nazi. I think it's just the only allowable way to make a game that is about ""what if the Germans won WW2?"". 

2. Bethesda cannot do FPS. 
I've played Dooms and Fallouts enough to know this. They try hard, but they are RPG guys; their style doesn't translate over. The gameplay is in some aspects pretty good early on, but overall it is just boring and poorly designed, and I can't bring myself to finish the campaign. The few weapons on offer grow tiresome, the enemies are boring, the gameplay, the whole game actually, is just childish. 

3. The characters and story are cringe, and often crossing a line. 
Again - they tried real hard, but what they produced is crap. Every character, every scene, is a cliche. Lots of it doesn't make sense and is anachronistic. It gets worse though. There are many moments in the game where I am just honestly questioning the mental health of the devs. Scenes of domestic violence, animal abuse, child abuse, a pregnant woman smoking, the main character rambling to himself on and off during the campaign, you have to choose which of your comrades dies and which lives, every parent-child relationship is just abusive and you're watching the abuse. The game just isn't right. What do you expect when the whole thing is about Nazis.

Positives:
The graphics and engine are slick. There have been moments I was really enjoying gameplay, but they don't last. 

I've played Wolf 3D, RTCW, this. This is a shit attempt. I was offered the game along with Doom Eternal for $5 or something, so I just added it. Having played enough of it, I can't recommend it.

I am quite impressed with the game design because it allowed me to play most of the way through with stealth which is my preference. I was also surprised to find that the game did not force me to endure ""mini-boss"" fights because there always seemed to have been an alternative option (stealth, sniping or running away). Regular saving and changing difficulty is enabled too. I did find that the format of finding and killing officers did get a bit tiring, so I was disappointed to discover that after the main game ended there was a series of uberkommander killings to be done. Nevertheless I did them all but my enjoyment level was dwindling. I bought the game in a sale and got the dlcs which I mostly enjoyed, apart from Joe which often felt like a vanilla FPS. The other two are more fun because of the stealth, but by the end I had definitely had enough.

Whilst Machine Games did manage to fix a few of the issues I found In ""The Old Blood"" sadly some well working mechanics seem to have regressed.
The New Colossus is definitely still a Wolfenstein game, however, whilst I enjoyed playing ""The Old Blood"", this game was a bit of a nuisance to play.

So, a list of the bad:
*With generational game and engine improvements, The New Colossus now has terrain that is not even, which is great for the looks of the games but terrible for actual gameplay purposes when the game isn't tested well enough. I ended up getting stuck in multiple areas that I couldn't get out of. I also had multiple situations where the platform I wanted to get onto was 1mm higher than the one I'm on and I couldn't walk onto it and had to jump. Its not a huge problem but over hours of gameplay gets annoying.
*The lean mechanic is broken. A mechanic that worked well on both the original and the prequel has somehow managed to break on the new game. The leaning would frequently glitch and it got so bothersome that I avoided using it
*The SJW plot point seems forced and unnatural. This seems to be a trend in plenty of new games. Just so its clear im not against such ideas being popularised in video games, but it feels like an afterthought rather than something natural that fits into the game.
*Extra Uberkomander missions were a nice addition to the game for more gameplay, however they just reused all of the same maps and made it feel like gameplay padding.
*The fog in some of the maps is terrible and makes you not able to see any enemies, whilst they see you clear as day.
*The shadow of BJ running is hilarious.
*The DLC ad that I get every time I launch the game is annoying
*I usually suspend my disbelief for the Wolfenstein games since they are a little out there, but not too far out (in terms of what is possible/impossible and/or liekly/unlikely to happen in the real world), however I got blown right out after a key point in this game and it killed my immersion.
*I ran into a game breaking bug that has been reported by multiple people but was never fixed (during the looking for Wyatt scene if you do an Uberkomander mission, all major NPCs disappear)
*Video RAM constantly ""running out""

The good:
*The game is finally no longer capped at 60fps, thank you Machine Games.
*The game looks amazing. For something released  in 2017, this game has no business looking this good.
*The difficulty settings have finally been fixed (which is a complaint I had for both of the older games) and higher difficulties are actually more challenging.
*For better or worse, the game is longer so you get more for your money
*The core gameplay is still the same Wolfenstein, so if you liked the old games you will likely like the new ones too.

Overall, its just another game in the Wolfenstein series. Nothing spectacular, some old issues fixed and some new ones created.
If you liked the old games and can get this one for cheap I'd say its worth a play, but just don't expect much of it. For everyone else I'd say its probably better to leave this one alone...",1667063688,1667063785,False,1,0,0.478624522686004639,0,True,False,False

Technologically speaking, it's a leap forward in terms of the unlocked FPS and graphically it's a beautiful game. The story picks up where the first game left off and it's more or less what you would expect from a sequel such as this.  With all that said, I still think The New Order is a superior game.

The pacing in The New Order was brilliant with some areas welcoming/encouraging stealth while others saw you blasting your way out once shit had canonically hit the fan.  However, The New Colossus did away with this narrative-based pacing in favor of a more generic stealth game feel.  Each mission is separated into a number of big rooms in which you enter silently with the choice to go loud or sneak through.  Many will love this ""play your way"" style and that's respectable, but personally I liked the mixed-encounters approach better in the first game.  Walking into a room, coming face to face with 10 guards who are looking at you like a deer in the headlights added to the intensity and realism.  On the other hand, this almost ""sandbox"" approach in the sequel slows the gameplay down too much for my liking.

All in all, it's still a fun game.  It's basically stealth-optional Doom 2016 and that's not necessarily a bad thing - it's just that no one played Doom 2016 and said to themselves ""man, I'd love to be sneaking through these maps right now"".",1666035862,1666039567,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Small but cool tweaks, such as being able to handle a different weapon in each hand.

And fewer bullet-sponge enemies. Almost anyone can be killed instantly by a hitting a weak spot (usually the head). Even big honking robots and be killed fairly few shots, if you aim good enough, with the right weapon.
I don't think it makes the game easier than the first, as difficulty is somehow scaled accordingly, but it fells better.
I don't like bullet-sponges in games like this. I want it to fell lethal.

Otherwise, everything about the first game (which you should play, if you haven't already), can be repeated here:

I played it well after first release.
It still looks and fells really good!

Pretty straight forward shooter. Not a whole lot of complicated powers, just shoot some Nazis.
The setting is really cool. Kinda ""diesel punk"" 1950-60's aesthetics, but kinda sci-fy?
Cool characters and story, with lots of detail and flavor. Clearly someone cared.

The game an amazing linear adventure and continues where New Order ended, following the amazing and bloody story of BJ Blazkowicz an unstoppable Nazi-killing-machine that is trying to free the world on this dystopian alternative past. 
The game is not-stop-action, more action than ever, more blood than ever, more carnage than ever, killing Nazis never felt so good. But the best of all is, if you wanna take a more slow approach, go stealth you can do it and it can be very rewarding since the melee finishers are bloody and super fun.
Visually the game is pretty good as well, it is very detailed, with great visuals and amazing light shadow effects, even for the 2022 standards it is really good experience, graphically speaking.
But as always the gameplay is the cherry on top of the cake. Yes you have a good story, yes you have good graphics (and even a very nice soundtrack), but if the gameplay was not so fun, fast paced and intuitive the game would not be the amazing game that it is.

The games picks up exactly where the last one ended (so i would strongly to play the previous one). 

Along the way (around 10-15 hours), you'll meet a colorful cast of characters (some new, some returning).

There are two playthrough min to finish the game and taking to various locations across America.

The short playtime makes it so the pace remains up the God damned roof the whole time.

Upgrading from an old laptop to an RTX3060 12Go GDDR6 vram, 16Go DDR4... I ran it maxed aside from adaptive resolution at 60fps, biggest drop was 58 for two seconds (while that was active).

It looks gorgeous.

Every weapon feels great (there was one i didn't use after a while but it's just down to my preference).

Story is really good (especially for the genre).

My only regret is that i bought the Alt.history bundle and didn't know there are some DLCs.

Edit :
I finished my second playthrough (got the collectibles) and played the post credit content (some of the collectibles were hidden there by the way).
It's good content but hyper repetitive. It feels like a ""do that thing again until the sequel"".
Tried to beat the Mein Leben difficulty in order to complete the game... 4 tries and no luck. It's really cool to put a permadeath but it's really hard. That takes a lot of skill which i seem to lack. I'm not giving up and will try again from time to time but then again i'm not all that good at fps...
Tough but fair.

In full i'd say it's very good for the genre, not too bad if i consider other genres i play most of the time.

Edit #2 : I finally finished it (forgot to update the then). Mein Leben was really tough especially in some sections. As it's a permadeath mode if you loose you restart... Usually what most games would do is you die, you restart the whole playthrough. Not here though. Die and you'll have to redo a whole playthrough before being able to have another shot at Mein Leben because dying there means save erased. I wasn't a big fan of that - at all.

Wait... i must finish the campain in Mein Leben again to get a shot at finishing the DLCs ? To Start them i must finish the campaing AGAIN ?",1643504964,1665316797,True,2,0,0.536784708499908447,0,True,False,False

I'm not saying The New Order looked bad, but The New Colossus takes it to a whole new level.

On the gameplay side, it mostly plays like The New Order, with a few additions to make it feel fresh.
I really liked the Killboard as a way to revisit previous levels; it felt way better than just replaying the same level like you did in The New Order. It took me a total 37 hrs to 100% the game on I AM DEATH INCARNATE, which didn't feel all that long simply because of said Killboard feature. 100%ing The New Order felt way more tedious, even though it took me 14 hrs LESS to complete.

From a technical POV, The New Colossus is a huge improvement over its predecessor; the switch from OpenGL to Vulkan makes it run as smooth as DOOM 2016 while looking even better. There's also no more physics bugs when playing at 120+ FPS; in The New Order, you couldn't go over 60 FPS without e. g. Nazi drones moving ridiculously fast and water pushing you back so hard you couldn't take a step forward.
I also noticed no stutters while playing with Intel's Alder Lake E-Cores enabled, which I had to disable for The New Order (and also, The Old Blood).

All in all, The New Colossus is a general improvement over The New Order, at least in every way that matters to me - and The New Order already was a great game. So yes, I think you should give it a try!",1665316421,1665316686,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I absolutely do not recommend you play on anything above Bring 'em On unless you're a fan of stealth or have the reflexes of a cat, 'cause you can and will die dozens of times in the same spot from two or three stray shots.

The gameplay itself feels really satisfying to me. I love the weapon selection of this game, even if the upgrades are nothing special, the weapons themselves are very satifying to use.

I have mixed feelings about the story. It's not terrible, but it does feels like they went full ""Whatever, just write something to kiss some american ass, write the word 'freedom' a bunch of times and be done with it, you know they'll swallow anything. We still need to finish some other things and this is supposed to launch next week"" on a meeting. An effect from that is that some characters' personalities seem a little off, specially Set's who plays a large comic relief role pretty much all the time. On the other hand, Irene's psychopathic personality is awesome and I find the new characters very likeable.

All in all I do think it's pretty good and satisfying gameplay wise and the story is not bad enough for me to not recommend playing it. It's still the nazi-murdering simulator we all know and love.",1665280244,1665280244,True,5,1,0.565797984600067139,0,True,False,False

I found it a lot easier to play a stealth-based approach with this sequel, but it's just as fun to play a tactical or run-and-gun/tank style. The perks have been revamped, and the weapons upgrades and customization system offer more options than the preceding game (in New Order,  weapon upgrades were linear and tied to the plot, some of them entirely automatic). One change that I didn't welcome so readily is that of the character models for BJ, Set, and Anya-- I supposed they are graphical improvements but they look like entirely difference characters, and BJ in particular looks as though his eyes are a bit too close together (perhaps that's just his near-death gauntness, but the look is carried through the entire game).

I'm not sure what is going on with this franchise but the story in this game was incredibly bad, at times it was so bad i couldn't help but laugh at what was going on on the screen.

Story Issues:

The story is just so bad right away from the very beginning that i had to force myself to keep playing in hopes that it would get better, however it did not and i feel like this was one big gimmick. 

1. I didn't play the previous game but from the preview it seems they left you off with a cliffhanger that you were badly injured. So to start the game off in this state was really jarring, considering i didn't play the previous game. With that the wheelchair was pretty slow and your first introduction to this game is incredibly limited gameplay with a literal handicap applied.

2. The fact that the main character goes back to his home / the farm makes sense but was incredibly stupid on the characters part, as that would be one of the major places the nazis would be watching. Considering he knew how his father was, it should have been very apparent that he would have snitched on him the moment he showed up.

In effect he causes his own capture / death / beheading which was just really dumb.

3. Once you get to the point of the main character being beheaded, the story just gets out there and makes very little sense past this point, making you question if any of it is actually real or just a figment of his imagination as his head is dying lol

Like they just so happened to find a new body for him right after he was beheaded, where was that when he was literally dying in his own body? Would have saved him from being captured at the farm lol

4. The gold ""key"" that you collect is never actually explained or used in any way whatsoever, even though they show it and talk about it quiet a few times, as if it's supposed to play some important role but never actually does.

5. Your wife, being super prego, makes very little sense for her to constantly be the one on the front lines fighting nazis and jumping from helicopters, at some point her kids would have sustained so much damage from her constant erratic movement, gun blasts and explosions, that they probably would have died lol

6. The whole new orleans recruitment scene when you talk to the group stationed there, was so hectic and nonsensical, for no apparent reason, just made it really hard to keep up with what was going on. Constant gun shots going off, can't even hear what they are saying, both guys screaming at each other nonsensical nonsense that didn't even pertain to the issue at hand and then you allow yourself to get so drunk you pass out? lol in enemy territory? was just really dumb and way too hectic. 

7. The last time you see your wife fight, is when she strips for no apparent reason and then blasts away at nazis fully topless lol which was just like ""why?"" XD Being pregnant shouldn't it have been you that protected her from the blast, not the other way around? and why did she need to strip? she wasn't on fire or anything... it was just incredibly odd.

8. The final scene in the game was very disappointing, considering your going to kill the person who killed your leader, you'd figure it would be much more dramatic or at least offer some sort of challenge to do, yet you simply walk up to her and axe her once lol done deal. 

It was a huge letdown, considering all that she's put you and everyone you know through, to have her die in such a meaningless way and for it to be so simple / easy. As if she never actually was a big deal in the first place, which kind of makes you wonder why did everything happen if she was such a push over? lol

9. During the final ""speech"" which wasn't even that motivational or rousing, you / the main character just stand there in the background like a dope, with a blank expression on your face and don't even really react to the ""speech"" that's going on, in fact you barely move at all or acknowledge anything around you.

At this moment, it should have been the main character making the speech, considering he was the one doing most of the important missions and killing lol and the fact that he was the one who just killed their supreme leader, why is he just standing in the background? Just a perfect moment to really get players pumped completely missed and made the ending way less of an impact than it should have been.

9. After the main story is over, none of the main characters reside on the boat anymore, you are left with nothing but side characters / people you picked up along the way and have zero attachment to any of them. It made the entire after main story experience empty and made me wonder ""where are my friends?"" lol after all you've been through, they are just gone? 

10. The main characters notable talking point is ""i have kids on the way"" lol which was laughable, like, dude why did you get her prego during the middle of a war? Then try and hold it as some candle to light your way... as if you weren't the cause of that lol 

As such, thousands, upon thousands of lives were depending on the success of his missions, yet his main concern is ""i got kids on the way"" XD lol like dude how self centered can a hero be? Was just super cringe.
 
Mechanics Issues: 

1. Collectibles do nothing / accomplish nothing (wasted time)
2. Killing all the leaders from the war map does nothing / accomplishes nothing
3. Completing side quests does nothing / accomplishes nothing 
4. Getting lost easily - I found in certain areas / levels i was not able to find which way to go or i was not able to find paths
that lead out of a building, which made me run around looking for the correct way until i simply gave up and re-loaded or
searched every single nook and cranny (which was a waste of time really)

5. Complete lack of indicators - Certain games like the latest Tomb Raider games do a great job at indicating action points while blending in those indicators to the world, i found that in this game there is nothing of that sort and i easily walked past action points (i.e breakable walls, vents, etc.) without noticing them at all.

6. When talking to someone, if you happen to run past another person or a few people, they just automatically launch into a long discussion and then you can't even hear the person you are actually talking to, doesn't make sense that they wouldn't stop the previous discussions or at least lower their volume while you are interacting with or talking to someone else.

7. Odin Codes - I found that a bunch of times during the war map missions, odin codes do not collect properly and sometimes i'd lose 1-3 odin codes due to them not collecting even though it showed a prompt saying i collected them, this lead to me having do re-do areas / levels just to collect them again, in specific spots that i knew properly worked.

8. SAS mission - doing these seems to do nothing at all or provide you with nothing even if you clear them of clear a bunch of them, on various difficulties. Seems like a total waste of time unless you simply want to replay those missions.

Summary:
In short there were simply way too many issues with the story and out of combat gameplay to make this an enjoyable experience, i kept having to ask myself if this was going to be worth it and unfortunately the answer is, it was not worth the time i spent playing it.

As stated, the combat mechanics are awesome but that's the only reason why i finished the game, which isn't saying much since the story is what is driving the entire experience lol

I had originally bought this game a few years ago and then refunded it because I could not get past the first level due to the game either freezing or crashing upon trying to exit the level.

With it being on sale recently and it being a few years later, I thought I'd give the game another shot. I was able to finish the first level BUT a different issue has occurred. Upon exiting any level, the game gets stuck on whatever the last thing you were looking at while loading the next level. After a little while, I am able to progress to the next level at the expense of ""skipping"" the current cutscene that is not actually playing. 

With that said, in order to understand what is going on, I have to go to YouTube to watch the cutscene I had just ""skipped"".  While highly inconvenient, I could live with it... if it were not for the other issues that have also appeared.

NPCs are often missing their dialogue despite doing all the animations. In at least two levels, I've experienced missing or screwed up textures. Another error, one that I see often mentioned by others, is the memory leak error. And the worst of all, I am now unable to further progress in the game because when trying to exit the start of the Roswell mission, I get an ""str_online_connection_error_03"" message that sends me back to the main menu.

My computer meets all specifications for this game. My drivers are up to date. I've already verified the game files a few times. Again, this game is nearly 5 years old. This is unacceptable. 

I guess I shouldn't be surprised with it being a Bugthesda title. I've also had issues with a previous Wolfenstein title which I left a similar review for before it was unrightfully removed from Steam for apparently ""violating the Steam ToS"" when it was just complaining about poor performance.

Anyway, I'd say I'd revise this review once the game is fixed, but with how long its been and with Bugthesda's track record, I'm not expecting anything. If you were able to enjoy this game without any issues, good on you, but clearly I am not the only one who is disappointed with this game due to absurd errors.

First of all, the history, even though, it tells something that is difficult to be believed, it is like more like a sci-fi history based on actual event. I mean, what would have happened if Nazi would have won the war... Some parts are extremely exaggerated. I mean, even winning the war, they would have been broken to address fund to develop advance technology and even having the resources, some of the technologies showed in this game would have taken several decades to develop instead of few years. Anyway, despite all of these, I think it was a great experience and great story to follow. Acting of each characters were top notch. Seeing Hitler was very interesting. All were well thought through.

Graphics are ok for today standards. Good sound, good effect. In overall, the some of the parts make a great experience and place this game as one of the most rewarding game to be beaten.

TL;DR at the bottom. I got this game on sale, and it's a big part of the reason I had a good time with it. If you just want to shoot the absolute fuck out of some nazis, then this game is perfect. If you're like me and hoping for an improvement on the first game's story, setting, and gameplay, you miiiight be a little disappointed.

Right off the bat, I [b]loved[/b] the first Wolfenstein game in the reboot. The New Order had somewhat compelling characters, a thoughtful narrative, fun gameplay, and a couple of exciting boss fights (although the final boss was impossible on the hardest difficulty). This installment is [i]fine[/i], but it misses a lot of the things that really made the first game great. 

The upgrades feel kinda milquetoast, and save for a few, don't add much to the gameplay loop. I really enjoyed the stealth gameplay in the first, and I felt that this installment did little to build upon it meaningfully. You get an SMG that can be suppressed, and there's an upgrade you can get that allows you to walk silently and squeeze under tight spaces, but they do little to actually service the gameplay itself. 

The story is really where I was hoping to love this game, and I'll try to keep this spoiler free so you can experience the little details for yourself. I personally was really fascinated by the first game's world-building, and the alternate history and its focus on America was tantalizing. I like the small details here and there, such as the KKK's rise to power in the US as allies of the Nazis. But the storyline itself feels pretty rushed and shallow. I was hoping for some more of the gritty, emotional choices that had to be made in the first game, which helped that game's story feel weightier and more personal. The missions you went on followed directly after one another, which meant that they narratively flowed together without many seams to pick at. This game opts for a hub world instead, which is [i]fine[/i], although there are extraordinarily few games in which the hub world actually feels like anything other than busywork or a portal to make the missions make sense. The linearity of the first game's gameplay was not only a fun return to the retro style of the original Wolfenstein 3-D, but also helped the storyline in a way that I failed to appreciate until this game. New Colossus' story feels very scattered and unfocused at times, and while I like the animated, vibrant characters, the rapid introduction of them leaves little room to develop them in a terribly meaningful way. They're not an inch deep, but your feet will still touch the bottom of the pool. 

[b]TL;DR[/b] I had fun with this game, but it didn't feel quite as inspired as the first game. The story suffers from lack of grim, gritty choice, overabundance of characters, and unfocused storyline that webs out from a hub world rather than moving in a straight line. The gameplay loop felt pretty identical to the first game, but is missing the spectacle of the first game's set pieces and boss fights. By the end the story feels like it's sprinting to its conclusion.

Overall: 6.5/10. Fun, but lacks the inspiration of its predecessor.",1664380213,1664380402,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This game however, better graphics, better gameplay. But the storyline wasnt quite there and it impacted my immersion. The news articles and written notes werent as good. Got to new york and I thought yeah this is it excellent map. But then Grace.. Oh god Grace..

It began to dawn on me that storyline wasnt going to be a strong suit in this game..

I quickly got tired of poor character responses and unrealistic arguements between grace and other crew. The main character seemed to become completely helpless and stop asserting any kind of lead role as soon as she appeared, if not before then. Missions on the boat were boring and irritating ""go here and get this"".

Then it became worse It felt like I was no longer the main character and im forced to witness a this side character who I rescued, take over the entire crew, the submarine and the main storyline without any buildup or reason as to why my character is listening to her. She literally walked into the sub and took the captains cabin without any complaints from anyone. Given that the last captain had died not a few days earlier, you'd think they would tell her to do one, but no. What made it yet worse was how obnoxious she was, anything but a leader completely unlikeable, the former captain wasnt amazing but atleast she had the character and personal struggles to back it up.

The main character going from a patriotic soldier of the good ole USA, to an a an apathetic dogs body who wont even step up for his friends, completely ruined the story for me. Watching Grace bully the scotsman whilst he stood aside doing nothing, then watching the scotsman completely forgive her for her bullish behaviour was wierd. Sadly for me as im not massively into FPS action games, this killed the immersion, and ultimately the game..

Before anyone makes it about Race, you can p**** off. Its nothing to do with that its plain bad writing.. Were there some back story, some build up before grace takes over, some give and take in her arguements, and maybe some missions where you work with her. I might have built up a mutual respect and acceptance for her edgy attitude and understanding why she takes over. but the character behaves like an absolute cow.

As I say, I didnt play this for the FPS action, I played it for the story, everything else, ill be honest was great.. but as soon as I realised this character was in it for the long haul, i uninstalled.",1664214307,1664214556,False,1,0,0.522293031215667725,0,True,False,False

Gameplay is nice, tho stealth system kinda sucks, but the story, tone, dialoge are pretty bad.
right after killing 30 enemy soldiers, blazko has a cutscene where he laments the worth of a life, how all memories and experiences are lost.. Stuff like this has it's place. Right after killing plenty is not the place. Hell, a shooter game is not the place.
And who thought it would be a good idea, in a game where you fight racists, to give you a racist companion that likes to insult people on the color of their skin? Would maybe help if the character was not as abrasive and arrogant as it is. That Irish dude just saved your life, maybe don't order him around like your personal servant and call him an englishman ffs.
The whiny internal monologue of Blazko is also very cringe.. Oh caroline, lend me your wings! Oh caroline, how were you the best person to ever exist. Oh caroline I can't do this no more T.T

Also, I get constant error messages that video memory is full. I never saw such an error message in any other game and I'm pretty sure my RTX 2080 Super is more than enough for a 5 year old game. It keeps working if I just say ""accept"" but it's annoying

It interweaves a bombastic narrative style with the necessary amount of grace and tact for the intense subject matter. I’d recommend it to anybody who enjoys FPS games or alternate history.

Nazism is disgusting and makes monsters out of human beings. Animal abusers and narcissists, addicted to power and hatred, petty, jealous, aggressive, cruel. A bigotry so powerful it overrules rationality. It is the irredeemable ideology, one of humanity’s greatest shames, and so insidious that strains of it survive into the modern era despite the catastrophic cost of such ideals.

As a result, Nazis make fantastic video game enemies for anyone with the slightest moral compass. Killing them is uniquely satisfying. Nothing of value is lost when you kill a Nazi. Even the most pacifist gamer is going to want to pull the trigger. 

Wolfenstein II understands this, and presents you with an exceptionally rich and disquieting cast of ‘ubermensch’ to eviscerate. Mothers who torture their children, husbands who beat their wives, murderous stormtroopers and eugenicist scientists - even the KKK make an appearance at the end of your gun.

Wolfenstein clothes them in success and finery that seem like a skinhead’s wildest fantasy  - a Supreme Nazi Court gilded with gold, a base on Venus, mechanized military and a stranglehold on the planet. But all of this does them no good. All it does is place these horrible people on a gilded throne that they never earned - and then it lets you tear them from it.

The standout moment of repugnancy (and there are a lot) has to be a withered Hitler, ranting and spitting with hatred as he fails at urinating in a bucket, humored by people who hate and fear him. The scene is a devastatingly effective critique. It sums up the real Nazi endgame most elegantly; total power, no control.

Wolfenstein remembers that Nazis live base, hate-filled lives. Their dreams amount to nothing but greed and petty tyrannies, all change negotiated from the barrel of a gun, all relationships irredeemably ruined by power and irresponsibility. This isn’t a story about Nazis ruling the world - it’s a story of them ruining it, and that can’t help but remind you that they ruined our world, too.

(Comparing to TLOU2)
*Both games overhauled their predecessors' overall gameplay mechanics into a much better experience. Probably the selling point for me to recommend because of the gameplay and the shooting mechanics. Get it just for Nazi killing.
*Both games had a step-up transition from their respective game engine to an improved one. Enhanced graphics and details tailored for next-gen consoles.
*Both games had a slight to heavy redesign of known characters in their own respective franchise.
*Both games had a great improvements to it's audio and sound design. Can't say which are those specifically.
*Both games had great soundtracks.
*Both games introduced permadeath feature.
*Both games had a step-down to it's storytelling. Inconsistencies to it's tone, it's pacing, and the poorly written new characters that makes you want to gouge your eyeball and shoot them with a fully-upgraded shotgun.
*Both games had unnecessary story expeditions. Leading to some poor pacing issues and lengthy cutscenes.
*Both games had injections of forced politics and wokeness in it (aside from Wolfenstein's Nazi ideology and the imagery because that's pretty obvious)

The graphics still hold up today, it looks beautiful! And framerate is stable and high.
Gameplay so good, weapons feel solid, shooting is smooth.
The story, the plot, is the best part, I wouldn't spoil it there. I just want to say that you won’t anticipate how the story goes, no game has balls to show what this game shows.
I will give a score  9 out of 10.  Because player can’t replay the story missions, so -1 point. I am kinda nitpicking.

By the way: It has been 5 years since this game came out, will it be Wolfenstein 3?

W2 flips this formula on its head by making the reward for completing tedious mediocre levels some excellent cutscenes.

I was quite hesitant to play this game given that the previous game in the series ended on such a perfect, melancholy note (quite exceptional in games of this ilk), but I have to say I was pleased with where they took the story from there.  But while I loved the movie/story side of this sequel, it was rare that I found myself truly enjoying the actual gameplay.  And, sadly, even when I did my enjoyment was marred by a host of small annoyances in design.

There’s also a host of what is almost shovelware piled on top of what would otherwise be an adequate game.  It seems as though the final product was presented to some Suits who demanded that the game length be doubled – so the devs just piled on assassination missions where you go back to the same level maps you’ve already completed, and a bunch of pointless collectibles (some of which you can get only on the replay missions).

I recommend this mostly for the story, which is outstandingly written, acted, and shot. The levels themselves are ok, as long as you can resist the urge to find every hidden collectible.  I completed the main game and played a few of the replay missions, but got bored and decided that was enough.

THE GOOD:
•	Story/cutscenes
•	Environment/concept
•	Decent selection of weapons and useful upgrades

THE BAD:
•	No quick save.
•	No walk (probably the usual lazy console port issue, assuming PC players will use controllers rather than the more precise keyboard & mouse). This also caused problems selecting codes on the Enigma machine, as the arrow keys repeatedly overshot entries.
•	Can’t remap some keys (most notably escaping from map/inventory screens)
•	The weird ability to overcharge health, resulting in a cacophony of useless glowing health packs begging you to click them even though you’re already at 100%.
•	When trying to smash crates, your axe throws if you are not right smack up against the box.
•	Speaking of axes, sometimes they disappear after a thrown enemy kill.  At other times it’s a pixel hunt to recover them.
•	Combat sounds, such as gunfire, are weak compared to explosions and voiceovers.
•	There are a couple points where you can make a choice, but it doesn’t make that much of a difference.  For instance, you can choose one of three gadgets, but every time there’s a place to use one gadget, you can clearly see how you’d proceed from this exact same point using the other two.
•	Pointless collectibles that have no in-game effect.  
•	Collecting enigma codes from commanders is supposed to reveal collectibles on the map, but this worked inconsistently.
•	Dropped items like armour and ammo can be very tricky to pick up. Sometimes running over them collects them, but sometimes you have to specifically click on them.
•	The mechanic to enter small spaces with a gadget is very picky, often resulting in your staring at the wall just above the space you wanted to crawl into.
•	The hint function was almost useless. (Not at all the helpful sort of nav guide in games like Dead Space.)
•	Can’t change the level when looking at the map – you actually have to go to another level to see that part of the map.

THE UGLY:
•	Many poorly explained concepts/mechanics – most notably the Enigma decoder, which is both timed and can use up resources if you fail.  Oh and it doesn't autosave before you use it the first time.
•	Arena fights (the laziest form of level design).  Luckily only a handful of these.
•	A couple points where it’s not clear at all how you are meant to proceed.
•	The terrible cover of ‘We’re Not Gonna Take It’ during the end credits. At least now I know what happens if you remove all traces of melody from a song and turn the volume up to 11.

Not straight up nudity or violence (though there is both), but more so in the idea of torture, physcological issues, drugs, racism, and other more serious issues being taken (semi) seriously. Also yes, it does get gruesome, and not just blood splattery gruesome, sometimes a fair bit more graphic and well rendered.
Overall it's a refreshing change of pace from most stories or stuff that can't get too far into nitty gritty or realistic issues or social problems for fear of not being able to sell enough copies or alienating some players. Most that do this stuff barely touch surface level and keep it simple, here, they'll go down into the nasty bits and details, though often each area is still covered more quickly do to the limited length of the game. But for the length it is solid more often than not.

Now, gameplay, pretty good, decent action, though also has some issues and areas that get frusterating they could have polished or tweaked. Some inconsistencies like firing the heavy beam gun hits targets right on the crosshair, even if to get to them the beam travels through the edge of a wall or crate from the gun. On the other hand your tossed axes and grenades seem to originate someplace far off to the right side of your character, even further right than the hand the visibly throws them, so those seem to love getting stuck on cover or obstacles next to you in tight areas even when visually it seems they shouldn't have. The part the game is inconsistent between weapons and mechanics with things like this mean you keep randomly having problems and annoying moments that keep you from reliably falling into a gameplay groove where everything flows... since some always break the rules of others. It's not too bad... but still something often enough that hurts the gameplay experience. When it is working, combat can be pretty good, though there are also general issues like visibility. They like extreme lighting, but night time or evening with bright sun and shadows in buildings on the streets of an old city... where you can easily see in reality thanks to a nice high danmic range of lighting our eyes provide this game does not. Areas not the brightest are frankly... just dark, so dark the one thing I wanted the most in this whole game as a bloody flashlight since my characters eyes are just terrible. Even if you stare at the enemy in the shadow of a building in the evening, the games camera doesn't exposure adjust so you can see there, it's constant, you just can't see guys beyond general outlines or moving shapes far too often. On the other hand, most levels to look great and the lighting is very atmospheric... if you take a screenshot or aren't trying to actually see into the shadows or such while fighting. But you are so ya it's an issue.

So overall, a pretty good game, one I'll recommend to many (not everyone), but also one that's definitely not perfect. Still, better than the last Wolfenstein game and that one was fairly good already. You'll probably know yourself if you'll want it or not already, but overall I'll still recommend it. Gameplay while not perfect was overall fun and enjoyable more often than not (just make sure to use F5 for quick saves often), and the story was pretty decent and refreshing in how it's told and doesn't hold back or shy away from parts most games or media would. And while being somewhat serious, it also never stops being over the top so don't worry, you're not going to get depressed or overly downered feeling playing it, there's always enough guns and explosions and cursing to keep you from having to think too hard if you don't want to about the stuff, and to keep most of it feeling more... heroic? Actiony? Eh, the pacing and mood keeps you in a good most of the time feeling. Yes you can argue about freedome, slavery, and stuff with characters but while throwing a back and forth fight of punches, alchahol, or bullets, there's some action or dynamic fighting going on with strong music and a nicely set up pacing, not just sitting and talking 90% of the time. And many of the characters you have issues with, get what's coming to them eventually, gotta love the characters (or hate them) as they are all very well done here.

The main campaign was fleshed out and pretty long, and at the end I was just wanting more. Played through the first time on ""Bring It On"" difficulty, and I think it was fairly well-tuned to be challenging without being annoying. Got kind of stuck a few times, but felt driven to keep trying. Having finished it and gotten more familiar with the mechanics, weapons, etc. I think I'm going to try playing on a harder difficulty. 

One thing I strongly recommend is to start doing the Ubercommander side missions as soon as you get access to the enigma decoder, and prioritize them over the main plot progression. These side quests will feel more natural if you do them as you go, and you will get more experience, perks, etc. to help you through the final stages of the campaign. They account for a lot of the actual play time you can sink into the game, and it's going to feel more fun and rewarding if you're doing it along side the main story.

The alternative is - like me - you save up the maximum stack of enigma codes so you start wasting officer kills not being able to pick up more, you finish the main story, then you have a whole bunch of side content that doesn't feel like it's happening in the correct context. You go out and do these side quests (which are fun enough, but fairly basic) - but it never actually amounts to anything. It feels like maybe there is going to be a payoff at the end, but you just unlock things that you won't actually use in the campaign. To make it worse, after you complete the story, the vast majority of the main characters just vanish from Eva's Hammer for no apparent reason, leaving it feeling kind of weird and lifeless.

The Artstyle is great, sci-fi nazi kitsch at its finest.

the game itself is imo worse than New Order.

Most of the characters you meet are uninteresting or unbearable to the point i skipped most of the cutscenes.
The game tries to take itself serious while also being schlock and it just doesnt work as well as in the other titles.

it gets worse with every level, all those funky sidemissions and activities on the Evas Hammer are unecessary.

I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

The gameplay is actually good, but the whole story behind this sequel has deep roots in bad writing, which leads to cringe moments.

We get in Blazko, your life fucking sucks: You're a crippled fuck for half the game with nearly suicidal instints, but you still go on for your love, but there's no real need to burdening people with your depression.
This continues until [spoiler]He gets captured and executed. His heads falls down but PlotArmor stuff kicks in and he gets emergency transplanted into a vacant supersoldat body. Remember Mars Attacks? that's the same fucked up stuff.[/spoiler]

Anyway, even the Nazi go full cringe here. They were brutal and such but there's no need to force the player to watch a mother-daughter body shaming moment (haha she's fat!).

One last thing, on the cringe. Max Hass.
They got the genius idea (no) to give further depth to a character that is borderline worthless. By following the general writing, they could've written a moment where Max Hass has to play a quiz game, and choose between some real answers.
Well, he then would the say his line (""Max Hass"") and would instatly win the big prize.

Thank fucking god they didn't do that.
Ewww, do gamers really love this stuff now??? Seriously???

I love this for the fun ride. This game makes me angry at the antagonists. They piss me off so I want to fight back and kill them.

There are no difficult secrets to figure out. There are no ""gotchas"" that will ruin the game if you don't know about them. It is just good clean nazi-killing fun!  Throw in a little steam-punk-esque  body armor and leg and arm transplants here and there and you have the formula for a fun romp through an alternative reality where Hitler got the Atomic bomb first and used it on us and we folded like a guy playing poker with a pair of nothing and leave it to Mad Max to save the day from these evil, twisted 1/2 dimensional cardboard cutouts who are all sociopathic psychopaths who are a little crazy to boot, and you have a comfortable formula for a fun game where you spend hours upon hours of your time running around killing dirty nasty nazis who deserve to die without question.

Also, Blastoffovich is just like before, same voice, same overly dramatic ""Caroline can you lend me your wings since your head has been cut off and you can't see to fly anywhere anyway, I'll see you soon cause I know I'm dying (somehow) and I'm ready (sort of) but that's cool because my gf is preggers with twins and while I'm sure that I can handle this Nazi-nonsense, I don't think that I can handle twins!!!

Not gonna lie, I love this series. 

REAL WORLD COMPLAINTS.  Ammo is both too available and too difficult to find. Seems like you have TONS of it when you don't need it and not enough when you do.  And since enemies are bullet sponges, it takes a lot of ammo to kill them. I wish the game awarded marksmanship more with headshots being instakills (often they are, but sometimes I don't think so) and maybe I will get a subsonic silencer to allow me to be a more gun oriented professional sniper/stealth killer.

STILL, I highly recommend this whole series.

ONE FINAL PROBLEM, the video programming in this game is plagued with bugs, but they haven't been deal breaking of game busting. Just mildly annoying. The game itself runs ROCK SOLID AT ULTRA SETTINGS and 144 FPS on my several years-old Alienware, M17 R2 laptop with some nice specs. It has a 2070-MaxQ video card and i9 intel processor with 16Gb of ram.  The game looks and runs beautifully, so Iwould get this even if you are worried about graphics. My experience has been that the graphics actually work well, even when they say they aren't going to...

- The story is fantastic. There is excellent character development here, and not just with Blazkowicz. Some of the scenes really impact the player at a deep psychological level. The developers actually make you care about the characters.

- Awesome graphics that still hold up by today's standards. Even facial animations are lifelike.

- The weapons are nice, and there's now an upgrading system so you can add cool gizmos to your collection of bang-bangs. 

BOO ON THIS STUFF:

- The mapping system REALLY stinks. Many of the levels are multi-level and the map doesn't show you where the objective is until you're actually pretty close to it. I found myself backtracking a lot and wandering around aimlessly simply because I missed some small detail in a room, like a covered hatch, for example.  There is a ""hint button"", but it unfortunately shows points of interest possibly along with your objective, so it's fairly worthless.

-  During some of the levels, Blazkowicz keeps whispering to himself about his relationships with several characters (his mom, his dad, Anya, Caroline, etc. etc.), and that gets old REALLY quick. Shut up, you hammerhead!

- The heavy laser is sweet, but it has a very annoying metallic buzzing sound to it. This also gets old REAL fast.

- Way too many developer logos before the menu boots up.

I am still recommending it; it's well worth the money.",1661027044,1661180975,True,0,0,0.490797549486160278,0,True,False,False

The levels are fairly complex in their layout but often you won't know where to go and you have to seek your path out too often. Including in home-base where it's just tedious to walk around until you find 'that room' or 'that exit'.
In normal levels it's just so odd that you can't climb up a perfectly low ledge where other ledges are fine because they've been designated for this. 1st person shooters have been around for so long it's like the designers aren't playing their own game with open eyes to see what's weird about it. (edit: there's more game play oddities but the killer issue is below)

The worst thing, though, is the notorious crash/error ""str-online-connection-error-03"" and the follow-up 'Could not write Crash dump"". In my case it happened for all my saves in the Roswell level and I could not fix the issue. It's been around for years but no suitable fix can be found. Safe Mode, Verify integrity of game, delete config, reinstall drivers etc etc etc.Its a game breaker. Nothing works and that's the end of my time with this piece of sh*t game. So many people have been let down by this issue. Thanks for nothing Zenimax, Bethesda and Machine Games. I can load old saves again but I know the same thing will happen again later on. 

Edit: Spent 2 weeks with Bethesda support on this but it was a waste of time because they just give you suggestions like reinstall or 'change that gfx setting in the config file' which couldn't possibly have an effect on the issue described.

Do not waste your time with this because there is a high chance you will lose all progress. I symbolically asked for a refund, although i am not eligible for it.

Pros - not that many :(

I was invested enough to really despise some of the antagonists in the game. Characters are borderline caricatures sometimes but I think it adds to the games flavor. It's both serious and ridiculous. I enjoyed pretty much all of the cut scenes.

Weapon variation was acceptable. There are light upgrade mechanics that also keep the weapons fresh. I found taking out Nazis to be quite satisfying. Unfortunately, you can be forced into a situation where you don't even get to use the most OP weapon in the game. Also for anyone else who doesn't know, there are also movement/navigation upgrades half-way through the game. Ex: Leg extensions that give you height, the ability to plow through walls, and fit into smaller crawlspaces.

The DLC is 100% a waste. I didn't buy it and I'm only referring to reviews that anyone can read. That's how bad it is.

The ""stealth the radio officers"" sequences aren't fun because of cock-up-cascade.  They aren't a great fit for Wolfenstein.  If you want to be Dishonored, be Dishonored all the way.
The worldbuilding and character design are still excellent, but I kinda feel like they should just be a movie.
B.J. has way too much voice-over monologue about his internal thoughts in a ""tell don't show"" way.
I hate the gun design.  Like Antoine de St. Expury said, a design is good not when there's nothing to add, but when there's nothing to remove.  Stop bolting pipework onto the barrel.
The submarine is WAY too big and mazelike.  Submarines are super fucking cramped.  There should not be a bottomless pit in the middle of a submarine, even if it is the ""world's biggest"".  It should feel like a being stuck in a phone booth or a classic Mini Minor with three wrestlers.  The downtime between missions felt like a tedious easter-egg-hunt rather than an actual relaxing way to get some character development (though that happened, at least).  Metro 3's train was much better at this, because the map was just a straight line.
Why the hell are we liberating America anyway?  Fuck America.  I'm sure there must be more useful places to liberate from the Nazis.  Kazakhstan, for example, has a shitload of uranium, and is ripe for Seven Pillars of Wisdom-style guerilla raids.  Where is China and Japan in this world anyway?  If you're going to copy The Man in the High Castle, at least *mention* what happened to the rest of the world.  It's not just ""America"" and then a giant blank until you hit the Rhine.
PS: BJ's dad was way too one-dimensional.  We get it, Americans are anti-semitic racist dickheads, too.  We all know about Tuskegee!

The guns feel bad. The firefights are just enemies flooding toward you until you kill them all. There's no AI to speak of. Trying to actually run and gun through areas just gets you killed - better to sit in a hallway and let all the enemies file one-by-one to their death. The levels are short, and never build towards an exciting climax. The level design is often confusing. There's a couple super harsh spikes in difficulty that come out of nowhere. It's incredibly annoying having to spam ""E"" everywhere to pick up health and armor, and the hitbox for actually grabbing the items sometimes seems bizarrely small.  The game mimics real difficulty by constantly just spawning enemies in behind you out of nowhere. I literally watched enemies appear out of thin air many times. 

I eventually got so bored I dropped the difficulty all the way down to the easiest setting just so I could sprint through and finish the game as fast as possible. 

The only thing I loved about this game was the characters. I see a lot of people complaining they're too wacky or too over the top, but I liked that. The writing for their dialogue is all solid, the lip synch is pretty good. I wish these characters were in a better game. Also the visuals were pretty nice.

I don't give many games an unambiguous thumbs down, usually there's some caveat. But in this case, I can confidently recommend skipping this game entirely.",1660871397,1660871397,False,22,2,0.532805025577545166,0,True,False,False

I honestly think this game is drastically better than the new order and slightly better than the old blood.

They would throw enemies at you in constant waves and it just would make several sections no fun (the bridge being one major example). It would prevent stealth from working effectively too.

Let's talk gameplay first: this game's guns are infinitely better than the previous game's guns. They have better handling, clear purpose (strengths and weaknesses), and look better. Each weapon of your arsenal will be useful in one situation or another, and suits each playstyle (stealth or run-and-gun). The enemy variety is also there, with clearer markings of what each enemy is and does. Without too many spoilers, later on you get a choice of, let's say, contraption, that lets you lean further into your preferred playstyle.

Another section where the game truly shines is its story and presentation. The characters you already know get more fleshed out, as well as new characters that are introduced; they all have their humor and their personality, which makes them feel real. BJ is still the good ol' badass we love, and he gets a more fleshed out backstory, which I enjoyed. There are various points of the story where BJ will feel differently, or he's in a different headspace then before and he talks about it. Every bit of monologue and dialogue is enjoyable and I commend the voice-actors for doing an amazing job!
The atmosphere is top-notch! Same with the first game, Nazis have occupied the world and you get to see different parts of the world, but mostly America, as this game it about liberating the USA.
There are many twists and turns in the game, elevated that much more by the AMAZING cutscenes that are longer this time, as well as well-shot and well-paced!

There are numerous collectibles to find should you so desire, as well as news articles etc. which flesh out the world. You get a feeling of how much Hitler was actually idolized by the Nazis - reminded me of The Emperor from the Warhammer 40k universe.

On the technical side, the game's graphics are simply amazing! Never underestimate how much good lighting helps graphically, and you will see this both as you're peacefully exploring the levels as well as frantically shooting your guns. If you're in a darker corridor or room, the muzzle flash from the guns simply lights up the area you're in, and it looks amazing, not to mention the explosions and the particle effects.

You may encounter an error saying your video card is out of memory after some time of playing, but this is a bug that has been left in the game, so don't worry!

All in all, I recommend this game to everyone, especially if you love shooters like Doom and have played and enjoyed Wolfenstein: The New Order!",1659553137,1659553137,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Bug is here that happens.. when you defeat all the enemies she stays in her corner and does not fulfill her part in the mission that will open some closed doors that give us access to a few hours of play until the end..

RECIPE TIPS
FREEZING THE BISCUITS
If you’ve frozen the biscuits, take them out and arrange them on a lined baking sheet. Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/170 fan/gas mark 5 and heat for 2-3 mins to crisp up. Don’t leave them too long or they’ll dry out.
STORING DOUGH
You can keep the uncooked dough in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Simply take some out, dollop on a lined baking tray and allow to come up to room temperature for 5 mins before baking",1612714591,1659124616,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The characters were a high point. The plot was serviceable. In my opinion the new order was better, but this game was a good continuation.

My biggest annoyance with this game was that they redid every characters model in this game, so pretty much every returning character falls into the uncanny valley where you don't quite recognize them (this includes BJ, although his model is nearly the same so it's not as much of a distraction). Anya and Private Wyatt have completely different models. Unlike the other characters where they still look like themselves pretty much, Anya and Wyatt are literally just different people. If they hadn't told me who they were I might not have recognized them.

The fights were pretty annoying at times, where there's a room full of baddies and commanders so you're clearly supposed to stealth it, but there's so many people that you keep getting spotted. At times i beat rooms not because of my skill but because of memory because I had died so many times. Unlike TNO, there are 0 bossfights in this game. Some of the most fun times I had in the previous game was [spoiler]The London Monitor and Deathshead[/spoiler]. There's none of that in this game.

Pros: 
-Passable gunplay.
-Occasionally funny scenes.

Cons:
-Nazis are bad, if you haven't caught on to the whole premise of the series by now, yet the writers seem to want to shove this down your throat at every single possible opportunity. Its like the writers never went through 2nd year high school English and completely fail to grasp the concept of 'show not tell.' 
-Overblown but underdeveloped characters. The main characters you interact with are all cardboard cutouts of political /cultural /racial stereotypes and never seem to have any further character development beyond your initial meeting. After certain cut scenes I feel like I understand why the Nazis would want to conquer and kill everyone (not say I agree, just that I understand).
-BJ doesn't feel relatable anymore. He spent close to half the game moping about his impending demise I almost stopped playing 3 times. All that was missing was him cutting himself on the wrist while Linkin Park blares in the background. Give me back the grim but sympathetic soldier who has witty one liners. I get that the writers were trying to show more of BJ's thoughts and develop his backstory, but the more he speaks, the less I am able to self insert.
-Graphics feel like a downgrade, also it will remind you that your video memory is full until you mute it.
-Stealth isn't always possible, sometimes the commanders are located in odd positions, sometimes the enemies seem to be prescient.
-AI is dumber than two sacks of bricks. Once your location is know, all the enemies will attempt to swarm you. It took me one fight to figure out that you can pop one soldier, retreat down a long corridor, and pick off the enemies as they come to you.
-Upgrade system for perks is a chore. You can easily max out 2/3 of all perks before you leave the airship.
-Contraptions are neat, but I feel like they come too little too late into the game and realistically won't affect your gameplay loop unless you are a completionist.
-Upgrade system for guns is.... passable. Upgrade the silencer for pistol, armor piercing and scope for the assault rifle, charge up and ammo capacity for laserkraftwerk and you've basically won the game.

Final Thoughts:
Wait for a sale if you really really REALLY want this game. If you don't want to end up disappointed, just pretend Anya and Caroline rescued BJ at the end of New Order and they all lived happily ever after.",1658585869,1658585869,False,2,1,0.474294006824493408,0,True,False,False

Wolfenstein II features incredibly entertaining combat and great villains that were carried through the previous games, afterall, who doesn’t want to kill Nazis? The gameplay was incredibly smooth, featured more weapons and new mechanics. 
The game was very optimised and can easily run on medium end computers. The new weapons were certainly a refresh from the previous games and being able to dual-wield any two weapons was a great addition. 
The quick fast paced action made the game incredibly entertaining and I never felt bored when I was playing, the story was always there and while it did help the experience it was certainly being carried by the gameplay. Additionally, the campaign was quite short (around 10 hours) however I do not believe there is a content problem as there is much to do after completion with 80 achievements, DLC and combat simulations.

The Wolfenstein games are all very well made and I can recommend all of them to almost anyone, however this was certainly the weakest of them all. This is mainly due to the lacking story despite the fact it isn’t the focus of the Wolfenstein games, it was certainly very entertaining in TNO and set the standard. 
Additionally, Wolfenstein II featured extra content through the Freedom Chronicles DLC which is an entirely different mess of weak, nonsense and extremely expensive for the little extra content it provides. The price I would put on this expansion is around $10  (AUD) and honestly wouldn’t pay a cent more as there was probably close to 4 ish hours of content. They also featured 'static pictures' as the cut scenes which definitely made the whole experience more 'underwhelming' in general. Like the other wolfenstein games there were a lot of easter eggs and collectables which to me are always fun.

In the end I would say Wolfenstien is definitely worth the price and anyone who is on the fence should stop sleeping on the decision. If you don’t know, the Wolfenstein games are credited with being the first FPS and the games have been running consistently for around 30 years making it one of the longest running franchises. I firmly believe anyone can pick up the Wolfenstein games and very easily enjoy them.

The game also lost a lot of its luster after I realized you can just fucking sprint through the levels and avoid most fights.

I forced myself to watch the cutscenes, I really like Horton, and the scene when Sigrun slaps the shit out of Grace is good. Auditioning to play yourself on venus was excellent. The other 99% of cutscene in the game made me dry heave it was so cringy.

I never liked Caroline, but Grace is so much worse, I hate her so much. A bad rendition of the stereotypes they were intentionally drumming up to 11. Her husband too to a lesser degree, though he was the fine kind of normal flat bad. Just regular bad character writing. The scientist thirdly too also only got under my skin a little, they absolutely did not need to make him so insanely over the top stereotype. Or I guess, to summarize my whole annoyance with the game: They did it all intentionally. They made everything bad as like a statement. An ode to the most boiled down concentration of everything the genre stands for, and then they essentially forgot to put their /s. They made me sit through hours of cutscene instead of a tastefully short and sweet serenade. I was dragged over the hot coals of a tone deaf opera-ballad-epic. Anya and William are not characters, they are blank slate cardboard cutouts, and forcing me to listen to his inner monologue made me physically ill. The whole plot main A plot is literally the subplot from gears of war where you help your buddy dom find his wife.

The themes are the opposite of subtle. The bad guys are so... cartoonishly-over-the-top evil. Caricatures of bad guys in media. Not a tasteful dollop of trope-y. Full on, in-your-face shock value for shock value's sake. The game lurches from one bombastic shark-jumping scene to the next. Some of it works. But not once its all stitched together like the soul of a little girl shoved into twisted demented body of her childhood dog.

The game-play is all below average drivel. Of the 9(seriously, is there only 9?) guns, 3 were so bad I would never use them under any circumstance. I was playing on hard, and I never found the shotgun, heavy gatling shotgun, or the BFG to be useable. I would only ever use the SMG when I was out of STG and beam rifle ammo. I would only use the pistol when I was out of ammo for all three. The enemies are all bullet spongy af. On paper, trying to disincentive headshots and reward skillfully landing your body shots in the same place with the armor system sounds good. But in practice it never helped. 3 headshots or 3 bodyshots is still three bullets ttk and often 1 bullet too many, an unlucky dropped stagger and every other or every third enemy will trade one bullet on your health bad.

When every third enemy gets to shoot you once for free because they have laser perfect accuracy and great damage at any range, it can be rough to get a good auto save. For the courthouse sequence I literally ran out of patience and dropped from hard to medium, just so I could kill every enemy before I ran out of ammo with all the guns worth using. There is gatling shotguns galore to tickle enemies across the room with as they 3-shot you with their STGs and then drop 6 rounds of ammo for them.

Rapid fire nitpicks that add up: Grenades and tomahawks are scarce/floaty/hard to aim. Entering and exiting vents and doors should not have me getting stuck on them. I should personally not be able to climb or swim faster than a gods damn super soldier in a video game. Mantling makes no intuitive sense. The ground slam attack is worthless. Why do I have to (waste time)hold E to pick up inspectible collectables but not other collectables. Why do half of my E to pick up and R to reload presses get eaten by animations taking priority. Speaking of animations taking priority, why does it take so ffff long to change weapons, they chose this aspect of all things in the game that they wanted to make realistic? You're getting shot at man, stop messing with the collapsing stock and shoot the thing already!

I found myself hoping that William's pondering that maybe the rest of the game is also a day dream was true.

I just played the game; 7 hours on file between today and yesterday. I already can't remember a single line of the music. I already can't remember if I might be forgetting the existence of a 10th gun. Weak shallow game, imo.

Wolfenstein 2 is a great game, but it is not perfect. 
[list]
[*][b] The Value! [/b] It's a single player game, with no microtransactions. They even gave away a ""free sample,"" of the DLC. The DLC hasn't been released yet, it looks like they are setting up to do the best type of DLC. Three new characters in three new missions, on new levels.
[*] [b] It's very cinematic [/b] It is a story driven FPS. Most of the story is told in cut scene, not during gameplay. Watching a 10 minute cut scene (even if the graphics are top notch), is annoying to some, and you could make the argument for YouTubing the game.
[*] [b] The signposting is poor [/b] You can push ""g"" anytime in game to display a waypoint, but the levels don't naturally lead you to where you should go as well as you'd like. Midway, you'll get to choose one of three abilities: Break walls, crawl through narrow tubes, and extendable stilt legs. I found myself getting stuck, where I could not find the way to use my ability to get past an obsticle more than once.
[*][b] The game play [/b] is a real matter of personal preference. There are roughly three styles the game leads you to - stealth assasination, cover based shooter, and dual wielding mayhem, but none of the three styles are good enough to play the entire game that way. You can stealth for awhile, but you can't see enemies through walls, or hide bodies, and if you are seen or a body is found it will trigger every enemy in the level. There are enough enemies with explosive weapons that you can't just use cover, and your character is squishy. If you go mayhem and get flanked, you will probably die before you can react. There are a handful of times that the game forces you into a mayhem scenario, and always felt lucky when I beat the area, not skilled.
[*] [b] The story [/b] On the one hand, the story is the highlight of the game... on the other hand.... It is really over the top. I think the safest example is (not really a spoiler, but tagged anyway) [spoiler] that you will go to Venus. Not the moon, not Mars, not one of Jupitor's moons, Venus. You will have gun battles outside on Venus. [/spoiler] So you need to approach the story with a sense of humor. But it also has a unique world, where Nazis have conquered America, and a lot of Americans are OK with that. You'll see Klansmen, walking around opening in their robes. It's a world where respectable Americans have made peace with the Nazis, and only outcasts and weirdos are willing to fight.
[/list]

Again, Wolfenstein 2 is a great game - I love the humor/over the top storytelling. Watching a cutscene and thinking, ""Are they going to... oh my God.... I can't believe that happened."" I love sneaking around and murdering Nazis with an axe. I love the characters, even if they are sometimes flat or cliche.

Update: I replayed this game in July 2022: It's still so much fun... killing nazis is still great. It's not the best gameplay out there, and you really have to be down for a rididulous story, but it holds up.

As far as the DLC: I thoroughly enjoyed it, all of the DLC are the ""good type"" of DLC - each on focuses on a different character with one of the three abilities from the game, in a stage with gameplay focuses on that ability. They are short, and worthwhile if you enjoy the base game.",1512362388,1657148309,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story is horrible. Big contrast to The New Order where everyone was more calm and the overall mood was depression but hopeful that they will defeat the nazis. Here its like everyones characteristics were turned to 1000%. Everyone seems like a caricature of themselves and the new characters are even worse. The story itself is nonsense but not in a fun way like before, a lot of cringy lines and unbearable cutscenes. Also why send a pregnant woman into the battlefield if there are so many people on the submarine? 
Gameplay is mediocre at best. Guns are not as precise as they should be, some enemies are bullet sponges, sometimes they spawn behind you and sometimes they can even shoot you through walls. At least they gave us a better way to deal with armored enemies with some guns.

Sound is of the highest level (including weapons, sci-fi ones in particular), voice actors are all great, music is outstanding, and you start in a wheelchair dual-wielding guns. This game has a ridiculous style that I like.

Story/Dialogue (3.5/5) - great voice acting aside, I have mixed feelings about the story because it can be a bit confusing on what it tries to be: a 'Doom' with nazis instead of demons that doesn't take itself seriously, a gritty and sadly too accurate observation on an American society what-if. There are plenty of absurd moments on the former (enjoyable and all) that can clash with the other elements of the story. The dialogue, character choices, and some of the chemistry between the characters don't always work and some jokes fall flat. That being said, the hilarious Hitler cameo has to be seen - such a great mocking portrayal.

Gameplay (4/5) - This game is clearly well designed. You have satisfying weapons, challenging biological and mechanical opponents that can have good AI, optional but helpful stealth approach, and doesn't get too repetitive. There's light RPG elements to develop your character or weapons as well.

For example, why do games insist on forcing iron sights on every weapon imaginable? What does it achieve other than obscure 80 percent of your screen and artificially slow down the action to an absolute crawl? 

Why do guns have so much recoil and particle effects that obscure what little is left of your view after the gun models take up most of the screen anyway? Yes, it's more realistic that way but honestly, who gives a rat’s ass. This isn’t a hyper realistic military simulator, it's bloody Wolfenstein. It’s a game where you shoot Hitler in a mech suit, for the love of god. Why is it so brown, gray and uninspired? Why is there so much melodrama and hours upon hours of terrible cutscenes and story being crammed down my throat?

Why is my character so pathetically slow?

Why does every modern FPS insist on having a BFG-type weapon that slows you down even more and takes an hour to rev up and is therefore rendered completely useless? 

If you find yourself asking the same questions then my best advice is to go and download Return to Castle Wolfenstein instead of this one. It's old and it looks like ass by today’s standards but it is by far the closest thing you will ever get to a good Wolfenstein game. The story is simple and unobtrusive and there’s lots of nazis to kill, as well as zombies and zombie nazis. What more could you possibly want?

The gameplay mechanics are above average but extremely repetitive. There are no special or unique weapons; just your standard assault, submachine gun, shotgun, pistol, and, for some reason, two grenade launchers (I chose the Wyatt path). There less than 10 different enemy types; 3 different types of humans and maybe 5 types of robots. 

But the gameplay isn't what I came to this game for. It was the story and characters, which were annoying, goofy, unlikeable, and written extremely poorly. There were scenes of dialogue in this game that made me embarrassed while playing it. Also, there are character subplots that come up and made to seem like they're going to be major issues but then are resolved almost immediately in the next scene. 

As for the main plot, I keep being told by the characters that big things are happening but I never get to see or feel that. You kill the main antagonist at the end of the game and when I got back to my home base, not a single NPC commented that we had killed the big bad of the game (with only one exception). 

I haven't played Youngblood (nor am I going to) but I watched a couple of reviews that talk about how bad the writing is and how cringe-worthy the main characters are.

2. Perks give ""+% to something"" rather than some new effect like in previous games
3. There is no highlighting of hidden items, like in previous two games, and killing commanders in stealth gives you fuck all. You need to use online resources to find them
4. After BlowJob Blaskowicz gets his new body, suddenly I get those alerts that I need to calm on my graphic settings, and in Vulkan Performance info I can see sudden spike from just 3.5GB in VRAM and 70MB in heap2 to 3.7GB in VRAM, 3GB in heap1 (I can assume ram or swap) and 200MB in heap2. 
5. The detection of enemies is wonky, just like it started to be in Old Blood (in New Order if you killed someone before they shouted it was chill, now if they just see you it's instant alarm).

this game would easily be probably my favorite wolfenstein game if it wasnt for the bugs and glitches that are in the game

there are spots where the hitboxes are too big such as on stairs and small ledges that make it hard to walk over which is annoying at times

the game also crashes every once in a while which is also very annoying

there are also many glitches involving the sounds of the guns constantly playing over , most notably on the laserkraftwerk charge fire, where the noise of the charge constantly plays until the save game has been restarted which is also super annoying

besides the bugs and glitches this game is a great game following new order and would be a great game if there werent so many bugs

another thing i noticed is the difficulty in each level is very inconsistent; in which some levels are laughably easy and some levels are frustratingly hard (playing on death incarnate) which wasnt seen in the previous games although it is not something i would degrade this game for",1656206529,1656206904,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Kick-ass Nazi-killing game, my butt was glued to my chair for hours when I was playing this game. The graphics, the gameplay, the story are great, although I felt there was a little difficulty spike compared to The New Order and The Old Blood. It got to the point where I had to turn down the difficulty all the way down to Do or Die near the final section of the game. But maybe I'm just bad at wolfenstein, I don't know about you.

Gameplay is fun for the most part - my only major gripe being at the epilogue when you have to hunt down the last of the oberkommando, you don't have enough enigma codes to unlock all their locations so you have to replay levels you've already completed.
In addition to this the bosses are pretty tame, being only bigger versions of regular enemies that have way more hp and more damage - though not any worse than previous entries in the series.
The Positives:
The story is really compelling - comparable to the Metro series. It starts off pretty lame with a total Deus Ex Machina, but after the ending of New Order they totally wrote themselves into a corner - so they get a pass.

A complaint i keep seeing in the negative reviews is that this game is ""too woke"". It reaaaaly should go without saying that if you're anti Antifa, the game about killing fascists is not for you. It is a historical fact that the Nazis were heavily influenced by America's treatment of its non-white population, and that white Americans were by and large in favor of the Nazis before the war. If this game didn't delve into the plight of the underprivileged classes in American society the story would be very, very shallow, and lack necessary grounding in reality.

An improvement over the previous two MachineGames titles in every way... except the storyline but I guess that's a bit subjective. Don't get me wrong, I loved Wolf2's campaign but some story beats and a few freshly introduced characters really rubbed me the wrong way. The usual argument is that it goes too over-the-top for its own good and I can frankly see that but I really like stories that don't take themselves seriously, so this one hit the mark for me. The issue is that it follows two games that do take themselves seriously and directly set up the plotline. Nonetheless, I didn't mind it as much as other people did.

Still, the gameplay, weapons (good lord the shotgun and hatchet!), engine and performance, sound design, direction, voice acting and soundtrack (Mick Gordon's actual magnum opus, no one can convince me otherwise) are all exemplary. The level design took a slight hit as commanders are encountered a bit too often and too close together which can detract from the enjoyment for some people. 
However, ""could not write crash dump"" was the bane of my existence. A very common complaint I see in forums and discussions is the constant crashing. Even the developers have addressed this with a list of proposed solutions. None of them worked for me despite playing on an AMD system, the one Wolf2 was advertized to be most optimized for and slated to offer the best gaming experience on. Although I was able to bypass the crashes since I was able to point out exactly what causes crashing. Namely, trying to preview collectibles straight after picking them up - most of the time. 

Overall, Wolfenstein 2 is an incredible package with a few blemishes that should absolutely be experienced first-hand.

[b] Story [/b]
It's surprisingly good. We are talking about a game where the main appeal is blasting up some Nazis. Yet, I really enjoyed the story itself. Especially the start. The way Blazkowicz feels and talks is so good, that you can actually feel how sad and defeated he is. His interactions with the rest of the crew is really human. The story was pretty good.

[b] Gameplay [/b]
It's mostly the same as the previous games. You got guns, you shoot some Germans or [spoiler] Klan's members[/spoiler]. The guns are fun, but they are not all good. Like the lazer beam blaster thingie is fantastic, the pistol isn't that great, the shotgun is good, but I didn't really use it. Dual-wielding is veru fun. The new abilities are alright, they are not a gamechanger, I thought they would be more useful. The skills are underwhelming, that was the only disappointing thing for me.

Honestly cant believe there are so many GOOD reviews for this game. Have they been scrubbing the bad reviews are something? I haven't seen a single review mentioning the blatantly obvious over the top propaganda being shoved down your throat in this game. People can try denying it all they want but even the games creators openly admit that the game has an agenda to push and it does that. Oh well, even without that the game is about 4 hours of cut scenes and about 7 hours of actual play time of some of the most boring level design I have ever played in a Wolfenstein game. .....Im glad I waited to buy this game when it was on sale for $7, having said that, I actually thought about returning it to steam to get my $7 back. So I hope that gives you a good idea of what you are getting into. I give the game a 3/10

So I'll start with coming up with anything positive.
1. It pretty
2. Gunplay solid.
That's absolutely it. It looks and plays just like the first one. Everything else is just bleh.

Negative:
Every character is insufferable. Not even Blazkowicz is likable in this game. They make terrible decisions which I get to a degree, cause you know its a game. However, NONE of these people are likable and I would say are almost as morally corrupt as the villains. I'm convinced the leaders of the ""good"" guys would cause just as much suffering as possible if they were in control. I forced myself to sit through every cut scene hoping for some redeeming qualities, but alas it just made me hate them more.
The story itself feels pointless. Just like the previous game there's one main villain  (should've died in previous title) that is introduced in a cut scene and you don't interact with them for the rest of them game. You fight the same enemies in uninspired levels all across the states and again you go to space. All the maps aren't bad but none of them stand out and the story and characters are so weak I can't remember why I was there half the time. It just feels like a carbon copy of the first game, but misses all the marks.
I would not buy this game again. Even if it was free its just not worth your time. I only put in 9 hours and i'm sure you could get at least 20 if you did all the side stuff and end game content, which is literally just running back through the mission areas and killing the ""high profile target""...... It's just a regular officer unit with a special location. This game is just feels so lazy every step of the way and loses all the wolfenstein charm very early on. Seriously ya'll don't support AAA junk when we know ,and they have done better.

2. Weapons are too weak and feel awful to use - you have to shoot way too much into enemies unless it's a perfect headshot, and the ammo capacity upgrades don't help because it still wastes time how much you have to shoot into them. They don't have oomph and any sense of power to them, and the pistol is entirely unviable unless you're going stealth, which the game actively discourages. 

3. Bad story with cutscenes that just make you uncomfortable with characters that have unlikable traits

4. Game is anti-stealth despite the fact that it has skills dedicated toward stealth play. Enemies will shoot instantaneously upon sight of the player which was never a thing in the past two games (you had a second to kill them beforehand which made it manageable), and commanders suddenly get alerted that you're around when nothing even happened (no one saw you, no gunfire, etc), yet sometimes even the exact opposite happens, commanders don't get alerted when explosions when off and you chopped the limbs off a big guy.

To add to this, there are levels that are impossible to do stealthily. It's simply not an option. 

5. Has one of the worst final bosses in any game I've ever seen. Again, stealth is impossible, and there are so many nazis literally everywhere that I'm not surprised if they're set to infinitely respawn. It makes it extremely difficult to focus on the final bosses (of whom instantaneously kill you in 1 shot), and it doesn't feel challenging, it just feels like you're being f*cked over on purpose, it's not at all satisfying, it gives the feeling of ""thank god this is fucking over"". 

To add to this, the exit to the level is in the area the final bosses come out of, allowing you to completely skip them entirely if you're fast enough and they aren't looking in that direction. 

6. If you don't have armor, assume you have 1 HP. If you have full 100 armor, assume you have 50 armor, because you take so much damage that you die just being breathed on. The game also does very bad at communicating to the player WHERE they got shot from. I can't react to getting shot at when someone is outside of my general vision, one because the game doesn't let you know which direction, and two, BECAUSE YOU'RE SO FRAIL THAT BJ WOULD PROBABLY FALL DEAD IF A NAZI BREATHED ON HIM!

7. The New Colossus decided NOT to learn from The Old Blood, and doesn't reward the player with anything whatsoever for getting all gold collectibles, or any collectible at all for that matter. I'm sick of games doing this. I don't want to get collectibles if all I get in return is a stupid achievement. I want a genuine reason to unlock them.

8. Wyatt is barely utilized in the story and feels more like a background character, while remaining incredibly uninteresting the whole way through the game. Fergus is objectively a better character which feels like a kick in the balls to anyone who chose to save Wyatt - which I did because it felt like the morally correct choice and initially I was more interested in him. 

9. Wyatt also gives you a Dieselkraftwerk, which is objectively a worse weapon than the Laserkraftwerk Fergus upgrades for you to be more powerful. The Dieselkrafterk has extremely limited practical use, and its upgraded fireballs have tiny hitboxes that make it impossible to hit anything that isn't a large target. And even then, it's too hard somehow.

10. The Ubergewehr is the worst weapon in the entire game. It has a small blast radius and heavy armored enemies can literally just walk outside of the blast even if they were directly hit by it, nothing paralyzes or sucks them into it, they just walk out and they're fine. The same thing can happen with the robots because they're decently powerful and have speed. 

Overall, it's a massive step backwards in gameplay compared to The Old Blood and a massive step backwards in story quality compared to both New Order and Old Blood. I don't recommend it at all. I'm even willing to say New Order's extremely bad final boss is better than New Colossus' final boss. What is wrong with these developers?

1) only supports vulkan-capable cards.

So, regardless of how capable your old gfx card is, if it can't support vulkan you get an error msg that's basically saying ""go buy a new gfx card, scrub""


2) Once you do get a gfx card that can play it, the game eats your cards ram like popcorn.

I got a RTX3060 w/ 12gb GDDR6... I would consistently get warning messages saying my card's ram was used up. Give me a break.


3) Someone decided to go nuts with Volumetric Lighting / Fog

Many levels have fog so thick you can't see where you're going, or if there's enemies there. But, enemies can see perfectly in the fog, so while you're wandering around like an idiot, they're keeping easy track of you and lighting you up. And, you try to see who's shooting at you, and you barely see a flicker of light in the foggy haze from their gun.


4) Game tries to mix action and stealth like The New Order did in a ""play your way"" style, but it feels like they sacrificed the action to try to bolster the lackluster stealth, so now both are  lackluster.

Stealth is still ""crouch to sneak / d**k-eye view of the world"" which I'm sick of. I'm tired of games making you crouch to sneak. It's unrealistic, and I wish this stupid trope would die already.

Enemies still spot you easily, because even on the easiest difficulties they can spot you through thick fog, or spot you from a mile away while they're up on a catwalk. Or, they hear you walking, b/c you decided to stop crouch-sneaking.

They give you a hatchet to silent-kill enemies via slash or throwing it. And, it's ok for a bit, until you throw the hatchet at one enemy and it bounces off their back armor while they stumble forward, yell, and now the alarm is going off. So, the tool you're supposed to use for stealth killing is unreliable as a ranged stealth killing too... YOU HAVE ONE JOB, HATCHET, AND YOU'RE FAILING AT IT!

Anyways, the action starts, b/c of course it does since stealth sucks...

Now you can-run-gun to avoid getting hit.

But, someone made the ham-fisted decision to make you have to practically be right on top of ammo and armor for BJ to auto-pickup.

So, levels usually devolve into this Keystone Cops BS:

* you try to stealth a bit
* you get caught, b/c, of course you do
* you start blazing
* every enemy in the map comes at you at once, and commanders call for reinforcements to constantly spam more enemies at you. So, you go from no action to suddenly an arena-style boat load of it.
* you're running around shooting them all, but run out of ammo. Why? Because you're not picking up most of the ammo from the enemies
* eventually you kill everyone
* now you get to spend the next 5-10 minutes walking around like a glorified janitor manually clicking the ""use"" key to pick up all the ammo, health, armor, etc that BJ decided to waltz on by during the combat

It's not fun.

It kills the pacing of the game, and becomes boring.

And, it actually becomes deadly when ....


5) The game randomly & DRAMATICALLY spikes in difficulty here and there.

I'm not trying to prove my man-hood on a video game. I just want a fun experience. I'm a seasoned FPS gamer. So, decided to go with ""Bring it On"" (normal mode). I was tearing through things, and thought about turning the difficulty up until I came to one area where they just spam enemies at you constantly in a place that has no cover, and where enemies can flank you from multiple sides.

I was running around getting my rear shot off, b/c couldn't find cover. And, I was running out of ammo, b/c all the ammo and stuff is on shelves that BJ won't pick up.

So, you know what's really fun in the middle of an intense fight?

Having to STOP FIGHTING, mouse-over to target an item on a shelf, and then click the ""use"" key to pick it up. AND THEN REPEAT THAT OVER AND OVER to get more stuff.

So, you get your rear shot off b/c you're having to stop and pray to god Fitts' Law kicks in and lets you target the pickup quickly.

After you die continuosly, you figure it's just bad level design. Ok, get through it, set difficulty back up.. until you keep running into the same situation OVER and OVER again in many other levels.

I gave up and just played on easy mode, b/c I got tired of bipolar game play that can't decide if it wants to be a cakewalk or a suicide mission on the same difficulty mode.

Of course, killing enemies is a pain, because...


7) Enemies are bullet sponges

You have an armor-piercing assault rifle. You have to waste 1/2 your clip to take a guy down. You stop shooting.. he stumbles and you sigh, b/c he should be dead, but he's going to get back up.

You have an auto-shotgun that you run up on enemies with. It takes 3-4 SHOTS to take them down.

It boggles the mind how much damage these guys can absorb. But, then again, BJ is made of some kind of self-healing steel, so I guess it's just the nature of this fantasy universe.

But, it's annoying going through on the easiest difficulty, and enemies still take many shots to go down. That's just lazy programming to pad the diffuclty.

""Should we make the enemies smarter?""
""No, just add more health to them.""

smh


~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Was there anything good?

Sure, the story was good.

But, I got irritated at how several characters on BJ's team were just complete jerks for no reason.

In The New Order, folks acted like adults, and were focused on solving problems while respecting each other.

In this game, most folks are acting like high-schoolers ... like some 12yo boy wrote what they think someone ""cool"" would act like.. which means bullying and name-calling folks that are supposed to be their friends and allies. Because apparently being a jerk to others while expecting to be respected in return is ""cool"".

And the bigger annoyance is BJ just stands there and lets it happen.

BJ was acting like a moral compass of The New Order, but here he just lets members of the team bully each other right in front of him without stepping in.

smh

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The more I think about this game, the more it teeters towards a down-vote.

The story is interesting, but has ham-fisted, contrived drama
The stealth is better, but that's like saying cold garbage is better than hot garbage
The action is ham-fisted, so the pacing of levels is awful
They pad the game by re-using previous levels for ""commander hunts"" that ""liberate america"", but they don't explain what that means or unlocks

For the most its the same really great game play and characters I loved from the previous game. Sometimes though, the game does make some questionable choices with its story and level design.

The story is pretty great most of the time, however there were a few times throughout where an out of place scene or line would make me flat out roll my eyes. The same kind of rule applies for the game play as well. Most of the time I was enjoying myself and getting the most out of the refined mechanics. Sometimes however, I'd be reminded of some of the more negative changes.

The best way I can describe the game play changes, is that the game feels a lot more punishing, but not always in a fun and fair way. The best parts of the previous titles took place in these linear sections where the game would allow you to take on tons of enemies in these close quarter battles with fun weapons. These sections do exist here, however they're certainly not as common. The game instead decides to place you in a lot more of these open levels with commanders. This combined with the new special enemies and how insanely fast you die this time around, going loud and proud is a lot more difficult for the most part. Playing this game on hard just like the previous games, I died a helluva lot more than I used to and it didn't always feel fair.

All in all I don't have a ton to say in all honesty. It's another good entry but just with some minor improvements and minor annoyances.

Overall, I think Wolfenstein: TNO was a superior game in terms of story, presentation and atmosphere. In TNC, every potentially emotional cutscene gets abruptly cut short by cringey jokes or crude humor that don't stick the landing. It's hard to tell what exact kind of tone Machine Games was going for when they developed this. Character motivations are all over the place. The first and second half of the game have markedly different tones. BJ himself feels like a completely different character by the end of the game, and it's not due to earned character development whatsoever. In fact, it almost seems like Machine Games themselves were conflicted as to whether BJ should be a silent protagonist or not. There were many in-game moments where characters would ask him a question or interact with him directly, and there is absolutely no option to respond.

The combat and visuals have been bumped up, but it still feels a bit like ""Doom-lite"". The map and objectives list need serious work. Collectibles and hidden items are heavily obfuscated in the environments to the point where I would blindly spam the action button in hopes that I'd pick something up. Also why is armor and ammo not automatically picked up like in Doom? Although I realize the developers are different, it's impossible not to compare Wolfenstein to Doom since they have so much shared DNA, not to mention the same publisher and engine. The levels are extremely short and rarely have any branching paths. Much like my issues with the first game, the developers clearly created the levels with stealth in mind, but the enemy AI keeps switching between brain-dead and omnipotent seemingly at random. 

I think it IS worth playing, albeit at a severely reduced price. If I were giving it a score, it would probably be 5/10.",1651688462,1651688462,False,4,1,0.516837477684020996,0,True,False,False

[b]The rebellion begins...[/b]

Set back in alternate 1961, when the Nazis won World War II and took over much of the world, B.J, affectionately known as Terror-Billy, plots an uprising against the regime with rebel troops.

[b]If you haven't played the first part, Wolfenstein: The New Order, you should do so before playing this game, as the story flows seamlessly and there are some familiar faces to see.[/b]

In Wolfenstein 2, MachineGames puts a whole load of crazy ideas on top of it and throws the logic completely overboard. But that doesn't matter at all and it's actually a good thing because it's not about a history lesson on World War II but about an intense, emotional and profound story.
And this is exactly what is told with the quite long but complex intermediate scenes and with a lot of depth and also shows our Terror-Billy from his somewhat softer side. The characters, including those who are new on board, work and convince with their stories. Toilet jokes included.

The stolen submarine ""Hammerfaust"" serves as the starting point and rallying point for the rebellion. And this thing is just huge. It really takes a while until you know all the routes between e.g. the operations center, hangar, canteen. Although there is an in-game map, it is still easy to get lost. Aside from the story missions, optional side tasks can also be completed on the Hammerfist. In addition to the individual character quests, this also includes the district assassinations. As soon as you have the punch card from a killed commander you can decode it on the Hammerfist and unlock the corresponding district. Here it is then only necessary to locate and eliminate the officer. As a reward, for example, improvements for weapons or combat modifications waving. Unfortunately, these district assassinations are all very similar and there is nothing worth mentioning as the locations are just variants of the locations already visited in the story and after a short time they become more tiring than fun.
However, for those who want to get all the achievements, the districts are a must, because that's where the missing collectibles are and you can't get them through the story.

[b]Sneaking or just shooting away, you can do that however you want[/b], but Wolfenstein 2 is definitely a bit more difficult than The New Order and the opponents act, depending on the level of difficulty, sometimes really cleverly by enclosing you, sounding the alarm or using a grenade the other throw. Eliminating the commanders early is just as important here again, because otherwise they'll call in a lot of reinforcements very quickly and then the only thing left is to shoot yourself free.
Also this time countless weapons are available which can also be modified with up to 3 stages. From the ax to submachine guns, assault rifles and rocket launchers, everything is included.
The Akimbo mode also now offers the possibility to carry two different weapons.

[b]Visually, Wolfenstein 2 is absolutely great. The engine convinces with extremely good light and particle effects and also metal surfaces or the armor look extremely good.[/b] The game can be played, presumably on most computers, with maximum graphic details and without major performance problems.

[b]Is the game worth buying?

Yes, in any case. I think Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus is just brutally good.[/b]

Game is very good. However the engine is so, SO un-optimized. Whenever I leave the Oberkommando at Roswell, the game breaks. I lost a few Mein Leben runs that way. Please optimize the engine a bit more, other than that it's a good game.

Admittedly, the game could codify more of one style or another of combat (stealth or loud, most missions end up as a shootout) and it badly needs some bug fixes (shots passing through enemies sometimes)
One thing I think this game does great is actually the 'soft cutscenes', the ones where you cant move and are just an observer, without the ability to skip. In this, and much of bioshock 1 & 2, they serve a narrative purpose- in Bioshock, important twists and details are revealed using them.
Here, the soft cutscenes serve the importance of making you HATE the enemies, so you really FEEL the rage felt by Blaskowicz as you hack them to pieces, blast them apart, or disintegrate them with an energy weapon.

I want to start with the negative in this instance as it is game breaking. Throughout the game, a video memory issue would pop up, however, it would go away and not be so much of an issue. At about 9 hours into the game the memory issue came back with a vengeance. I looked up several online solutions and none have worked for me, be it updating my drivers, verifying the integrity of the cache, starting in Safe Mode, or adjusting my graphics settings. I am relatively disappointed as I hit a point in the story where I am able to freely roam around and hunt down various Nazi Leaders without having to progress further in the main story. Based on this issue alone, I would not recommend this game. If I can find a solution, I will update my review accordingly. 

The game still looks great despite being as old as it is, the game play is balanced and for the most part very smooth. Controls are simple and for the most part, everything is fairly self explanatory. The world is semi open in a sense that you can travel to locations and approach the objective the way you want, kind of like Splinter Cell Blacklist or Metro 2033 and Last Light. 

The story is pretty solid and there are a lot of collectibles to search for within the world that will keep the game going on for some time.",1649511609,1649511609,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, despite having a brand new rig with well over the recommended requirements the game likes to freeze and throw random error messages. Sometimes I can play for hours with no issues. Other times, its a matter of minutes. I do not have issues with countless other AAA titles. Must just be a Bethesda thing.

I shouldve done this years ago, but im going back and replaying and realized i Had left a negative review. I'll leave the old review down below. After a few patches the game ran smoothly. I no longer have the old issues <3



So right now I dont reccommend this game. It's super fun and I was enjoying it despite it crashing at the end of every level.

Then on the last crash it corrupted my files and said achievements would be locked until I turned off dev mode every time I load up the game.

Hits the same positives as The New Order and Old Blood though the game feels very stealth focused on almost every moment, as going in guns blazing feels like the enemies do WAY too much damage no matter the difficulty which makes stealth almost necessary the entire game. The games cutscenes kinda last abit too long, like around 30 seconds - 1 min which really shouldn't be the case as i'm here to play a game not watch a movie, sure i can skip it but my point still stands, compared to The New Order for examples the cutscenes were short, simple and explained enough to the player to understand why everything is happening. The game has alot of iconic moments though such as the strawberry milkshake scene and that same level having alot of great lore to read and playthrough even if it's just a walking mission stuff like that is always welcome and much prefer that over watching a cutscene as having the player playing the game is the right way to do it. Also the Hitler scene too is greatly done which is probably the most iconic scene in this game next to the Strawberry Milkshake one. 

The engine too i much prefer over the older one, the shooting, cutscenes, levels, everything all feels so much better than The New Order as with that you had moments where something as simple as papers and pencils were 2D and that goes for alot of the environments in The New Order where everything here is 3D, looks and feels so much more atmospheric and gorgeous at times. It runs on ID Tech 6 so same engine as DOOM 2016 and works perfectly here.

I still enjoy the game though as it's continuing off The New Order and does enough that makes it passable to me but i understand this game being very 50/50 to others but i say give it a try atleast and see if you enjoy it or not as everyones different.",1648033107,1648033389,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cons - The character scripts are just awful.  Worse than mediocre.  Every time someone speaks they're being emo or saying something predictable.  Should have called it Cryenstein.  The song at the end is one of the worst covers of all time.

I don't game often, so I do not have alot of expience, but I can say that this game is just plain chaotic. Most of the time I'm getting shot and I dont even know from which side I'm being attacked, the dual weild controls are difficult and I often end up shooting with the wrong weapon. That ends up being frustrating. Also the difficulty seems to vary alot, the courtroom was the hardest part of the game even though its in the middle, the last bossfight couldnt even compare. The story is alright, but it felt like sometimes the writers didnt know when to time the serious parts and when to time the humor. However, the flashbacks from BJ are amazing and give so much more depth to his character and the story. I was overwhelmed at some points. Also the character Sigrun was an amazing addition to the cast, I love her so much. Unfortunately this game has also made me cringe a couple of times, and it was unbearable, especially the part where BJ yells ""White-ass fascist nazi pigs"", I get what he was going for, but no. Grace is a character I can't seem to form an opinion on, she's a strong woman and I like that alot about her, but her dialogue often feels off and too over the top, but maybe that's because I'm not familliar with Americans (lmao). This game doesnt shy away from being batshit crazy, and that honestly is one of its charms, but the story ends up becoming bland; you have to unite with a resistance group TWICE?? You go to the same spot TWICE??? The Eva's Hammer is so huge that I often spend more than half an hour wandering around, and that becomes tiring. Alot of the levels look gray, gloomy and alike. The scene on Venus holds a special place in my heart, and it is definatly the best part of the entire game. Even though this game sometimes gets on my nerves, and even though its not as good as New Order or Old Blood, I do recommend it.

So let's start with the good things: combat is really satisfying, guns, sound, graphics and gameplay are really top notch, it's really a lot of fun being able to run at full speed through the enemies while double wielding any gun combo shooting around at averything that moves. Everything about gameplay just feels great, I don't really care about stealth, I mean... It's a Wolfenstein game, I don't wanna be skulking around, I just wanna shoot Nazis and that's it, though if you like Stealth gameplay I bet you could go through the game playing most encounters like that.

So, for the cons: my gripes with the game are what most people might dislike, there's just soooo muuuuch exposition, why? whyyyyyy is there so many moments in the game that you loose control and just have to sit and watch cutscenes to deliver the story?, just: WHY?... There are moments that made me feel like the intermission was longer than the actual map I had just gone trhrough, it's baffling, I mean IF the story was really good, I'd be ok with it, but it's just a mess of a story that doesn't know what it wants to be: A serious story about loss, and a group of people trying to live through an oppresing regime? Is it trying to be a kind of love story of two people facing parenthood? Is it trying to be a lighthearted story that's just ""for laughs""? Is it trying to be an action packed type of story?, I felt it was trying to be all of them, and in the end it's just messy. Also, there's a thing about difficulty, It's a hard game in the way that maybe a couple of shots will get the player dead, so: on higher difficulties you'll have to play slow, and carefully, I really don't care for that, so I lowered it enough for the game to become ""fun"" for me, and allow me to have that really great ""Run n' Gun"" type of combat.

[h1]Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is a fun action-adventure first-person shooter game where you are simply just tasked with killing every single Nazi you come across. This game is great for players who enjoy a really well made story, a pretty nice combat system in a video game, and good game graphics.[/h1]

❌🚨---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------🚨❌

[b]This game is a lot of fun to play for many different reasons. The overall story is really well written in my opinion, plus the game-play and combat are both excellent. I mainly like this game simply because of the fact there's not that many games out there that includes and lets you kill Nazis, so having a game like this just out there is really nice. This game also has many different things you can do within it even though its a story focused type of game.[/b]

❌🚨---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------🚨❌

 [u]✔️Overall Pros✔️[/u]

➜Really well-written story
➜Well developed characters
➜Graphics are amazing
➜Very good soundtracks
➜Is definitely replay-able
➜Amazing enemy designs
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀      
 [u]❌Overall Cons❌[/u]

➜Glitch's every now and then but not too often
➜Vaulting over things during combat is kind of annoying
  ➜The ending wasn't really that good (this is just in my opinion)

❌🚨---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------🚨❌

[b] Although the game is amazing in general I personally wish this game had things like steam backgrounds, badges, stuff for the steam point store and such since I would like to see more content of the Wolfenstein series in general, but all these things are probably never gonna be added.

Overall would definitely recommend this game to others since its a really good game but I wouldn't pay for its actual full price I would wait til it goes on sale before buying this game. Plus the game is not for everyone for obvious reasons.

10/10 love the Wolfenstein series :>

One thing I think this game does better than the previous two in the series is the story. The ending is sort of mediocre, but its the middle section that exceeded my expectations the most. If you enjoyed the previous two games, I'd recommend to stop reading the reviews already and just jump into the game instead so you don't spoil yourself by accident.

The game also does a really nice job between balancing high adrenaline action with relaxing game play. After each mission, you get to return to ""Home base"", where you can explore around and check out what your crew is doing. It's a nice change of pace but also not necessary, as you can start the next mission immediately if you want to.

A note though, make sure your graphic drivers are updated. This game will keep crashing if the drivers are not absolutely up to date. I also got random ""graphic memory full"" alerts, which would sometimes lead to a crash. The game does auto save a lot, so crashes don't set you back that much at least, but its still something to look out for.",1646480874,1646480874,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As another reviewer put it, is this supposed to be a serious story (the racial friendship flash backs) or is it supposed to be crazy over the top? I was on board until, I guess you would call it jumping the shark, in the story.  It gets B-movie material at one point where it's like WTF okay.  The story is all over the place to me. Felt like they were combining two different plots into one game.  Wolf I and Old Blood kept it simple and that was okay.  

Pros: graphics are great, visually impressive level design, decent fps mechanics

cons: not really into the background music at times, sometimes it was confusing trying to find the exit, story all over the place, could have used more boss fights (I can only remember a few it was more clearing out the enemies).

the graphics are amazing for a 2017 game, 5 years old and looking like its 1. the story is also good. bj is a great character and killing nazis is always a good thing. 

but the gameplay is VERY rough and clunky. the guns are annoyingly chunky with ott recoil that leads you to believe its a run and gun.... its not. so you play stealthy..... but it hates that. 

you kinda have to brute force your self to safety, save then rinse and repeat. 

it is not fun. 

its the first time ever i actually enjoy the cutscenes more than the gameplay. 

theres a part on venus that youll defo get stuck on if you choose the torse. the game bugs tf out when trying to sneak around the edge ledge and even getting into it is a nightmare. 

but art aspect of the game is masterful its just the programmings very shotty. 

there is no final boss battle, it all kinda just ends

tbh this would have been a better movie as the cutscenes are way way way better than the horrendously buggy and bad designed game play if im brutally honest.

I'll start with the few positives this game has. Gunplay is still fun enough, as they mostly just ported over The New Order's weapons. The game also looks nice, even if it lacks unique environments save for things like the courtroom scene.

Now... the rest. Like I said at the start of this review, The New Colossus is disappointing and feels incredibly forced, especially from a story and level design standpoint. Without spoiling too much, it feels like the writers got cornered by the studio/publishers to just... undo the ending of the first game. Not only that, but halfway through the game, the story also undoes the protagonist's entire arc he's had throughout the first half. It's an extremely bizarre and unnatural shift in the mood, and stays with you for the rest of the story. Characters get killed off but replaced with carbon copies of themselves, other characters just have no impact after being introduced, they keep throwing shit at the wall but nothing sticks. The semi-serious, dry, sarcastic, almost parody tone that The New Order navigated so well is nowhere to be found in The New Colossus, and is replaced by awkward dialogue and cringy interactions.

The levels and gameplay are similarly dour and feel uninspired. It is carried hard by the gunplay, but lack of enemy variety (and generally boring enemies in general) is the downfall of TNC. For example, the Panzerhounds that were absolute MENACES and generally extremely scary due to their speed in TNO are just lumbering around, being shitty mobile flamethrowers that can't turn very fast? Wtf happened? Why is this game a downgrade to the previous one?

[b]*SPOILERS FOR THE FINAL BOSS [/b]

[spoiler] THERE IS NO FINAL BOSS, ARE YOU KIDDING ME MACHINEGAMES? WHY ARE TWO RANDOM SLIGHTLY BIGGER ENEMIES THAT WE'VE FOUGHT FOR THE ENTIRE GAME THE FINAL BOSS?  And then the game just... ENDS. Wow. Even of the rest of the game was better, that ending is downright criminal. [/spoiler]

but

It's cringe; it is laughably cringe

Actual details:
Well spoilers aside, I'll just lay this out in a way that sums up why I think most people *truly* hate parts of this game. Firstly, I bought this in order to experience a top shelf nazi killing ride. I didn't expect it to have a coherent story (which it struggles at even that).

What you get is a mess of awesome fps action, and pro-commie undertones slowly making their way in more and more as if it's some creeper cuck trying to open the closet door without making enough noise to alert you havin sexy time with big lasers.

Next section will get political, but I tried very hard to supply real value to the conversation, so give it a chance. If not, skip to ""The game - ...""

That's not even close to being all. The anti-white sentiment in the game is clever, subtle, and sick. Simply put, this game insinuates that America isn't actually a group of freedom loving fuckers from all backgrounds, but rather a country ruled by the evil white man who would've happily kneeled down, had the Nazis dropped atom bombs on the eastern seaboard, ya know, because white man has that pure instinct to be racist. 
Fuck Machine Games for this one. As if there wasn't enough media in the world right now that straight encourages my own fellow Americans to believe this sentiment. I'd be thankful that this game ""went broke"", but it doesn't matter either way. Whatever forces are pushing the mentioned propaganda, are successful at it. Companies worth billions all echoing the same things, so this issue with the game hit close to home. And yes it is an issue. I shouldn't even need to explain why but to anyone ignorant of how the Nazis propagated anti-jewish hatred, I encourage some light reading on the subject.

There is one particularly nasty scene which shows exactly how aware the dev/publisher is of what they are doing. You are sneaking through a section and two high ranking officers are discussing the finer nuances of the violence. The game uses them to make a line for line parody of how victims of antifa attacks have discussed real life violence. We are talking about victims, that were minorly right of faaaaar left - disabled veterans, blue collar workers, etc. who just in the last few years were protesting just for conservative values and suffered bloody violence for it. Words like ""We are all people"", or ""Violence against someone just because their beliefs don't match your own, is terrible"".. When those words were spoken by American protestors just who happened to be conservative, they were just protesting... In this game those SAME words (I swear to fucking christ the dev did this on purpose), were spoken by men who promote authoritarian nazism and kill men, women, and children.

I won't give a class in manipulation here, but I'll state that the dev accomplished two things.

1. They draw a strong comparison between evil killer nazis, and joe shmoe American conservatives from the 2010s.

2. They make the rational of ""We are all people"" devalued, and laughable from a certain angle, especially if you are already deluded enough to support violence against someone who's conservative, liberal, whatever, simply for being those things.

The game - it is most parts pure action, and it's fun. There are a lot of cutscenes and without them, it just feels like your average current gen shooter. There really isn't much to say about it. Everything is really well done, even the sound design has gotten so much love.
I think if I could get this game on sale for less than $15, it's worth it. I really have a problem with the narrative they're trying to spin here though. ""White America"", ""Black America"", just enough. This garbage, divisive, dangerous propaganda (let's start calling it what it is, rather than ""mindset"", ""agenda"", or ""narrative"") is getting old and tired. I do believe most people are getting wise to it, but just barely. Here at the end of 2021, it really does feel like we're just barely coming out ahead of all the manipulative tricks these large companies are throwing at us. And I do feel like that comes before another average shooter. I'd only recommend it to people who aren't impressionable towards the mind games this plays on the player. I got so tired of it, I sometimes skipped cut scenes. It doesn't bring anything new to the genre, but it is fun. I don't know what else to tell ya.

At time of writing, I had bought the game after *passively* watch youtubers play through it. That's why it only shows 2.5 hours at the time of the review. I'd regret the hell out of this purchase if I didn't get it on sale",1640885363,1645280750,False,8,6,0.453471004962921143,3,True,False,False

Honestly, this game isn't as bad as I remember it being, but it's still a monumental dissapointment. And it baffles me to this day that this game is by the same people who made New Order.

Pros:
-Presentation is super good visually and musically. MG put idtech6 to it's absolute limits and it shows, these environments genuinely hold up 5 years on. Mick Gordon's composition is also incredible as always, even if I enjoy his stuff on KI and Doom Eternal more.
-Gunplay is punchy, impactful, and just damn fun. A lot of the arenas have super nice design too.
-Stealth is... not as non-viable as I remember. There's still a few points where it flat out forces you to go loud and auto-triggers a commander which sucks, but you can still absolutely stealth if you want to. The perks assigned with the constrictor harness help a ton too.
-The contraptions are a fun addition, even IF they come in too late to have any sort of meaningful impact. Channeling my inner scalebarer main and trampling over a nazi into a pile of bloody chunks never gets old.
-Brian Bloom as BJ never gets old. Even with a worse story he has some damn great moments in this, and specifically the stuff with his mom is genuinely some good stuff. It's just a shame the whole situation with his dad is as one-dimensional as it is (racist father is racist, he bad).

Cons:
-Lack of combat innovation. Aside from some new toys and a more streamlined upgrade system, this game plays about as the same as TNO and Old blood. At least Doom Eternal tried to make itself play different from 2016.
-The tone and story. I'm not gonna harp super hard on this as many others have said the same thing I do but this game's writing is such a downgrade from TNO and Old Blood. I don't know how they turned a alt-history story with the overarching themes of war and how it fucks people over from both sides into a generic ""fuck nazis"" story just for the sake of pandering. A lot of the new characters like Grace and Sigrun are not only genuinely unbearable, but also contridict the previous game (Dealing with one's post-nazi relations was already a theme dealt with between Klaus and BJ. Why do it again here?) Some of the lines too from others are absolutely cringe-worthy, and you could absolutely tell near the end somebody on the team had a prego fetish for anya. It's sickening. 
-A lot of this game too uses violence just for the sake of it or for shock value, unlike TNO and Old Blood. In those games, the violence was used as a way to show how bad the situation was, and to give presence to your enemy as a threat and how fucked they were. In this game it's just there for the sake of telling us how bad nazis are. Which we know already. It's redundant and honestly uncomfortable at points.
-Frau Engel's presence as a villain is absolutely a downgrade comapred to deathshead. Whenever you saw Deathshead in TNO, you knew something fucked was about to happen, and you were in for pain. His smile and demeanor helped drive in the threat of him as a villain. Yet in this game you see Frau Engel only a couple of times and doesn't have as much as a presence despite being THE MAIN VILLAIN.
-Area reuse. I'm not gonna apply that to the post-game, but even near the end of the game it loves to reuse areas and it's lame. Look, we're back on the ausmerser like at the beginning of the game! Look, we're back in manhattan! BUT IT'S AT NIGHT SO IT'S DIFFERENT! It gets tiresome.
-The final ""Boss"". Remember Deathshead in that mech in the first game and how memorable that was? How about 2 generic robots that are introduced as normal enemies. That's the final boss. [spoiler] Oh, and you just kill frau engel with 1 mouse click. Absolutely no buildup or satisfaction, it's so flaccid. [/spoiler]

It's a 6/10 if I were to give it anything. A fun game, but an absolute dissapointment in reguards to the story, which is a shame considering just how good New Order's was. I know people are still hoping for a wolfenstein 3 at some point to close everything out, and in a way I can't blame them, but at the same time I can't say I'd be super excited if they're just gonna retrace their steps again in terms of design with this game and it's writing. I don't want to play the same game again. And I want to actually enjoy and be invested with the story too, and not be frustrated with it.",1580927579,1644618686,False,0,0,0.486061453819274902,0,True,False,False

The story? It changes tone way to often,sometimes trying to be dark and focusing on themes like abuse, racism, and murder, and sometimes just downright weird, using some crude humor and violence as a joke. Not too sure what they were going with. Fortunately you can just double-press escape. Still not a good story by any stretch of the imagination. 0/2

The combat is enjoyable and that is what earns TNC a positive rating from me. All the weapons feel great and are impactful. Playing this on ""Call me Terror-Billy!"" mode for my first playthrough felt pretty unbalanced, with me dying 5 times in the first level. Playing more carefully is really important, especially in the beginning where you only have 50 health. Once I got the hang of it the combat was satisfying and challenging, but not unfair. Halfway through the game, you get 100 health instead of 50, and in the words of BJ, you ""feel like a fucking tank"" in comparison to the beginning. You can play more aggressively, but still have to be pretty careful. The fully upgraded StGs were awesome to use dual-wielded, melting super soldiers in a few hits. There are a few cheap sections, but overall the combat is fun when you get to know the  tactics you should use. 7/8

I would rate this 7.1/10 as I don't care as much about the story and only allocated 2 points to it. The combat gets one point deducted for being slightly cheap in terms of death. Bonus 0.1 point for a naked, pregnant woman killing 2 nazis and getting covered in blood in a cowgirl position at the end.",1614040876,1644291445,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I might not have a good computer, but this game runs perfectly fine with little to no lag. Optimization is navigatable and a person who doesn't know much could understand it. The combat is the same as New Order, but it kicks more ass with the new gore and dual wield ability. A downside for this game is if you would like to complete it. One achievement requires you to beat this game on insane high difficulty if you die once it's a game over. Keep in mind, this is probably the hardest installment (Just behind RTCW). The DLC installments are also not worth a buy.

At the end of the day, this is a solid game that is just doom but with n*zis.

It's quite ridiculous to witness, and frustrating to play since the game rewards stealth. When you sneak behind some enemies, they will start yelling at you before they even fully turn their head towards you, like they have eyeballs growing out of their ears. These are enemies wearing goggles in radiation suits that obstruct their vision, by the way. 

A cool weapon from the previous game is locked behind a timeline decision now. You won't even know unless you search online for it because the game doesn't tell you that you get only one of 2 weapons depending on that choice. One weapon is significantly better than the other in combat situations, and the other one can cheese some parts of the game.

Sometimes, enemies will have no clue where you are, and other times, they start shooting in your direction to hit solid walls before they can see you. Drones will hover on the opposite side of walls or doors even before they see you, and will leave when you walk away. 

The level design is also significantly worse. The manhantan level is full of invisible walls and forced linearity. Rubble that look like it should be climbable are not.

I also can't figure out how to make collectibles reliably appear on the map. It's very inconsistent. Stealth takedown of commanders don't do it. Picking up maps don't do it. Sometimes they're there, sometimes not.",1643604355,1643872588,True,0,0,0.492307722568511963,0,True,False,False

I've played through this game twice, once on steam and once not on steam when it was released.

TNC is a hard one for me to review, it feels so right in so many places at times. When TNC feels good, it feels exceptionally good. However those moments are a far cry from the previous two games in the series continuity. The gameplay systems underlying the game itself are ultimately a much shallower suitor than the admitably flawed perk system of old. While obtaining upgrades within TNO and missing them felt bad, it kept you always searching for something fun and unique to use and knew how to pace them better. The endgame upgrades which branch into 3 different trees feel incredibly hemogeneous. By the time you get them, you're unstoppable with the exception of some really really annoying enemies. The poor execution of upgrade systems means that weapon progression feels so much shallower as a result. There are so many blind spots in combat that are so unfun could have been mitigated with a perk or an upgrade even that just.. don't exist. Instead we have a version where you level up random stats. Insanely boring. Doom got this right! Come on!

Combat sometimes can feel less like picking a weapon for the right job but whatever is going to serve as the right bullet hose at the time, shotguns are not the beasts that they were in TNO or TOB. They hurt a lot but so does pretty much nearly every other weapon on the game, at least on the ""expert"" difficulty. You die incredibly fast in TNC, so much faster than TNO and TOB's equal difficulty. Sometimes you can be staggered which leads to your immediate death, if you don't see it coming then you're likely already too late because a lot of the arenas take place in corridors or tight spaces. Most enemies forgo taking cover or even trying to flank you like in TNO and instead beelining it straight for your location, meaning that sometimes it's as i said. Use bullet hose weapon. Use your heavy weapons for the slow supersoldats to save on ammo. It very rarely steps outside of that rhythm except in stealth. Stealth feels like a much more annoying cousin of TNO's stealth but does not innovate and infact regresses from the original system. It feels like it exists because it existed in TNO, it feels very stagnant. In terms of difficulty, the game definitely feels easier than it did on launch. It was insanely difficult back then. Even so, it does feel good. Feedback is still somewhat decent. Just not as fun as TNO or TOB.

I've just utterly destroyed this game's gameplay portion but i just wanna say that this game looks fantastic. Even in 2022. It's much less an objective a subject. You might find the colour palette drab.You might prefer the grittier takes from before. The same goes for the story, i personally feel like it ends much too soon and it can feel like very little happens in the plot at times.I think it's very subjective, i'm not fond on it personally. You will revisit certain locations and it can feel very underwhelming in that department. The side content feels the same way and i have very very little motivation to do it aside from achievements. I'm so tired of people screwing this stuff up, seriously. It shouldn't be shallow content to pad gameplay, it should be just as fun and meaningful as the main game.

Overall i think i'll give it a very disappointing not recommend if you are buying it at full price in 2022. If you're playing through the rest of the games and it's on sale like it was for me. It's still fun for a few hours.",1643724029,1643783126,False,1,0,0.493705272674560547,0,True,False,False

I loved New Order, but this game is messy in design at all levels. There's no direction to the maps and I was backtracking for ten minutes on each level just to figure out where to go. Do I go down this ugly, gray hallway or that ugly gray hallway? Neither! Go out the door that you can't see, because, like a fool, you chose the correct brightness/gamma settings! 

Ammo, health, and armor pickups are damn near impossible to pick up, even while moving slowly and mashing E. I got stuck after meeting the New York Resistance group and couldn't get past holding off the Nazis that broke in because I couldn't grab health or ammo in time. 

The weapons don't auto-switch when you're out of ammo, which is fine but one of the weapons has an inexplicable delay in firing after pressing the fire button. So you can't tell if the game is working as designed or if you're being screwed over and by the time you figure it out, BJ is dead. Also, while dual wielding, if one gun runs out of ammo BJ won't automatically holster it, he just keeps aiming it like an idiot. There's a learning curve, but I'm on the third level, where the hell can I get better?

Weapon switching is clunky and slow, the animations for reloading are confusing and also slow, not a single invulnerability frame during melee kills makes them worthless. I could go on, but I just can't believe anyone would play this game and say they enjoy it.

I'm not like...bad at video games. I like a challenge. But there was no way out of this room for me, because I entered with no ammo in the AR.

I'm upset by the design choices made and have no interest in continuing and I can't sleep at night knowing anyone made money off this purchase. First game ever that I requested a refund for.",1643480474,1643480474,False,16,4,0.511417388916015625,0,True,False,False

I will say the shooting feels good, as there is nothing more satisfying *in this game* than chewing through a hallway full of nazis with twin shotguns, or turning them into a cloud of embers with the lazer weapons. But my god the story and dialogue are incredibly painful to sit through, and the non-combat segments on the ship feel quite phoned-in and yet unskippable. A lot of very unlikable characters as well, such as Grace and Horton, both of which felt forcefully inserted into the plot.

The mechanics with the world map that you can interact with are very disapointing. They seem like an afterthought and just a reason for you to revisit already completed maps to collect missed junk.

The game is only good for about half the duration, (not to mention it's terribly short too) after which it turns into a poorly designed, repetitive hallway shooter. It beat the campaign in 11 hours, and if it weren't for the boring wandering around the u-boat, it would've been a few hours shorter. Speaking of wasting time, this game has probably the worst navigation and level design I've ever experienced. The levels are sometimes so convoluted you may end up spending 30 minutes just wondering where you're supposed to go next, only to find that the exit was some obscure part of the scenery that is completely random. There are also a ton of empty rooms with zero purpose, which only further throw you off. The latter half of the game is just ridiculously easy, you can camp in corners and take out every enemy one by one. There's not even a final boss to speak of, only a few bigger robots to take out before you get to walk towards General Engel and click her once to initiate a cutscene that takes her out. Wow, what a payoff.
I found the selection of weapons to be rather limiting. Only the maschinenpistole and laserkraftwerk were worth a damn, since the other weapons have terrible damage at longer distances, which wouldn't be a problem if the game didn't have so many hallways where you have to quickly kill nazis from afar.
The story has several of fun moments in it, like Bombate hooking up with Sigrun, or demented Hitler trying to hold auditions for his movie. However, the cutscenes are way longer than in the previous game, and it might not suit everyone to sit 10 minutes watching a single cutscene. They should've opted to shorter and more concise cutscenes like in New Order. Again, this is definitely away from time that could've been spent making more actual gameplay. I think most people don't play Wolfenstein for the plot anyway.
Then there are the technical issues with the PC release. People have reported several issues with the game crashing and not booting up. I had these same issues with my older PC setup. So be prepared, if you don't have the console option. They definitely rushed this PC version.
Overall I can't recommend New Colossus. It's a disappointing mess with less focus and less polish than in New Order. Only pick this one up if it's on sale.",1642348861,1642349190,False,1,0,0.481898397207260132,0,True,False,False

+Visual part. I liked the environments, both from art and level design perspectives.
+ I like how they wrote BJ in the first part of the game. You can feel him trying his best not to literally fall apart while trying to help the cause.
+ Shotgun and Axe.

[b]Cons:[/b]

- I don't like the writing in general. I feel like the devs tried to ""sit on two chairs"" at the same time. On one hand, they condemn nazis for an inhuman amount of unjustified violence, on the other hand, they glorify the violence too. Yeah, I get it, nazis are the scum of the Earth, but the way that this violence towards them is being glorified gives me the creeps. I guess it's because all of this is being presented as a fun, albeit bloody, comedy.
- Humour is not funny.
- No likable characters that you can sympathize with. Even BJ ""worked"" for me just for the first part of the game.
- The game doesn't know what it wants to be from the story perspective. Is it a comedy? B-class trash and gorey story? A drama? 
- Game was broken by some patch that probably will never be fixed. Had to drastically lower the settings to be able to play and I still get the error. At least I didn't have crashes like other players. 
- AI. It's not that smart really, and it constantly spawns behind your back. Can't even imagine what it's like to play above normal difficulty (I played with a controller).
- The ending is rather disappointing.

They focus more on multiplayer systems with lootboxes and progression systems meant to keep you playing in order to feel a sense of completion, rather than enjoyment. It's rare to find a shooter that even has a campaign these days, let alone one that isn't tacked-on for sales purposes on consoles.

There are thousands of shooters released but so few of them are actually any fun to play for more than a few hours, these days - the new DOOM games, Deus Ex, Metro, Bulletstorm, and Titanfall 2 to name a few. In my opinion, Wolfenstein II blows all of these out of the water. With the exception of Titanfall 2, Wolfenstein II manages to have some of the absolute best gunplay of the past few years, while simultaneously crafting a decent story and characters you actually care about. It looks great and the soundtrack is perfect, and it's one of the few FPS games I actually never ragequit. I highly recommend this series.

Nothing is off limits in this first person shooter. The saga continues in this sequel with terror-billy being just... broken.  A symbol to the resistance in an alternate past in which Germany has taken over the USA, and a general all 'Merican badass, he nurses his wounds and gets back in the fight. 
  I will be honest: This is the first ever Wolfenstein game I have played.  It was a stark difference to the call of duty style of campaigns that I have become used to. I started out with an open mind, but was quickly reminded of a strong story line present in the franchise that I was unaware of. Not great for newcomers like myself. Blood and violence with a hint of steampunk inspiration made this game great. Bursting through the first few levels, building a sense of dedication to the characters and learning the weapons/gameplay theme when suddenly, PLOT TWIST. Let's kill off a main character in the most gruesome fashion possible, shall we? It was at this point I realized I was in for a strange dreamlike emotional roller-coaster. And it was. 
  Glorious character dialogue and independent styles of thought make the down time on the ship a genuine pleasure. Listening to the arguments, watching the genuine interactions happen, and getting to laugh like a mad man for the sex and toilet jokes. Simply excellent writing on the producers and designers' part. The evolving emotions and character arch for every individual team member is such a pleasure to behold. Good gameplay mechanics and weapon/equipment aids in the combat. Stealth options are a welcome addition to the game, if not difficult to use. 
  BLOOD. Like a level of blood spray and violence that I could nearly smell the metallic tinge through my monitor. I have played and seen some fucked up shit in my years, but DAMN. I actually had to take a break at one point and wonder if this was going to have a lasting effect on me. If this game were any bloodier, I would be sliding it chocolate and tampons under the bathroom door, asking if it needs another Midol.  Regardless, I pushed on to the finale because nazi's don't kill themselves. At a stage late game you are captured and
SPOILER ALERT
you are executed publicly. Then your head is revived and you are brought back to life with a cyborg body. This is about where the game lost me. I continued to play through and give it a decent effort, but all of my care for the characters and plot had been tossed aside. I lost faith in the story.  In the end I finished the game and was indeed happier that I had played it to completion, but I'm not itching to play the next one like I had hoped. The game lost me when it took a sharp left into fantasy land. 
  Do I suggest playing it? Yea, if you've got a stomach for gore and violence. Just don't expect to come out on the other end with a victorious smile and heartwarming feeling.",1641609112,1641609112,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The developer's reliance on cutscenes to move the story along is absolutely exhausting though. You aren't engaging the player with the story if you are repeatedly forcing them into a spectator role. It's not as though the plot requires a ton of exposition either; it's a pretty simple affair about killing Nazis. The cutscene quality itself is quite low and they are all over the place in terms of their tone. At one point, BJ and his pregnant girlfriend are mid conversation about him likely dying from internal organ failure in the next few weeks, when one of the side characters bursts out of the bathroom to derail the scene with a poop joke. The game had been building up to this conversation prior to this with BJ reflecting via monologue on his fears of leaving his girlfriend to be a single parent in a doomed world. I get the game is trying to be irreverent but I think you would need be brain damaged to believe this is effective storytelling. When the storytelling is done this poorly, the cinematics just feel like a chore, something you need to get through so you can go back to killing Nazis. I suppose every game is political in nature but such an overt display of politics seemed a little out of place for a game like this. There are some very questionable death defying turns in the plot, I won't get into spoilers but if you've played it you know what I mean. Hard to be invested in the story if death can be so easily averted. Suffice to say, having been worn down to dust, I skipped a couple cutscenes toward the end. 

The story takes the player to a variety of different locales (ex Nevada desert, Manhattan, New Orleans) but they all feel very much alike, featuring the same assortment of Nazi industrial corridors and crumbling cityscapes. This is a real shame as some of the locations could have been interesting. The combat is decent but becomes a bit stale after awhile. More weapons or a more diverse array of weapon modifications would be welcome. Additionally, the AI is dumb as rocks and it really lowers the game's difficulty.",1641576376,1641576907,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Loved this game. The story wasn't as good as The New Order in my opinion, but gameplay and graphics were far better. I'm glad there weren't any supernatural elements, as although I also loved The Old Blood, it was a spinoff. In the end, this is the same top-quality Id Software release I've come to expect from Wolfenstein or Doom titles. Also, there are tons of collectibles, so completionists could easily spend hundreds of hours with this one. All in all, this game is a blast and in my opinion there's nothing more satisfying than blowing the head off of a Nazi or KKK member with a fully automatic shotgun.

[b] SPOILERS: [/b]
[spoiler] My biggest problem with The New Colossus is the ending. There is no final boss battle, although there is a final level which is very difficult on higher difficulties. Still, it was very unsatisfying. In The New Colossus there was a satisfaction in killing Deathshead after a multi-stage boss fight that was difficult even on the Bring 'Em On difficulty. In this one, you assassinate Frau Engel by ambushing her on a talk show and burying a hatchet in her face and leveraging it to crack open her skull like a coconut. Visually, this is incredibly satisfying, but why couldn't it be after a boss fight where you, for example, fight your way through waves of Nazis she sends at you and make your way to her command station? Maybe the writers wanted to subvert expectations, but the result is an incredibly unsatisfying ending. In fact, as the credits rolled, I believe I audibly said ""that's it?"" [/spoiler]

[b] POLITICS: [/b]
Okay, this is the point where ""Anti-SJW"" types should probably stop reading. I'll start by putting my biases out there; I'm a socialist and an anarchist, so the anti-fascist themes here are gonna immediately make me like this game more, so I'll share some of the things I appreciated as a leftist. First of all, similar to how Jimi Hendrix was essentially in The New Order in the form of J, the Black Panther Party is in this game in the form of the Black Revolutionary Front, whose members make a home in the Evas Hammer (essentially your home base). The detail here is outstanding; the members have black berets, brown leather jackets, pins like the Black Power fist and even ""Free Huey"". Speaking of which, Huey Newton is even in this game under the name Huey Parks, and his character model is strikingly accurate. Next, we get to see Nazi America, which reminds me of the famous quote from James W. Wise, in which he wars that if fascism comes to America, it will not be identified with any shirt movement, nor with an insignia, but wrapped up in the American flag and heralded as a plea for liberty and preservation of the constitution. Now, none of that should offend anyone left of the far-right, but this next thing might. This game is incredibly feminist, with arguably the most moving character being the leader of the BRF, Grace Walker, who is a very complex character. She's a battle-worn and calloused strategist and orator who slowly opens up to the residents of Evas Hammer and becomes an incredible leader. I should also mention that I'm no liberal, and I think the corporate pandering game studios tend to do is annoying and counterproductive, as this pandering usually results in one-dimensional characters who are never wrong and have no flaws. This game has none of that, all the characters are the way they are for a reason. Grace Walker is leader because she's competent and intelligent, but has very obvious flaws that she works through. At one point she's even knocked down a peg and taught a lesson by Sigrun Engel, Frau Engels' daughter, who is a defector who clearly holds no loyalty to the Nazis and is even willing to help in killing her own mother for the greater good. Grace stubbornly calls Sigrun a Nazi, eventually resulting in Sigrun hitting Grace and giving a moving speech that teaches Grace to accept the fact that even Nazis can change and become good people. So no, Grace is no ""girlboss"" Mary-Sue.",1641496350,1641496495,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really don’t know how to start this review everything in this game feels so average that I have nothing to commend or criticize. I guess the visuals are good enough, both technically and stylistically I love the techno Nazi aesthetic and seeing everyday 60s Americans standing next to high super soldiers (and KKK members) is quite fun to see. The plot of the story isn’t great you basically just get shoved around a few different set pieces and locations until you end up on national television killing a general. Some of the set pieces are definitely worth experiencing [spoiler] (I really enjoyed the Hitler scene, especially when I got to just randomly kick him although… why can’t we actually fight and kill him? Seems a bit like sequel bait) [/spoiler] most of the characters are fun to be around although I dislike the new rebellion leader, she just acts like an arsehole all the time and therefore must be the boss? 

As you might expect the Gameplay is quite fun and frantic, but it lacks a lot of depth. you get a few standard weapons and some rarer heavy weapons which usually aren’t worth using because they make you so slow. Enemies have a few different varieties but its mainly just upscaling normal dudes with power armour.  there was one big mech which showed up a few times and I literally have now idea if I was meant to kill it or not, it would shoot it for a few minutes then just run past it because nothing stopped me. Dual wielding is fun but its sometimes a hassle to equip. you have to press the key twice to pull out the weapon, the animation is slow and if you do any action, it cancels it. So, if you fail and stealth (oh yeah theirs stealth btw) and need a big gun quick it just isn’t worth doing. They game is also quite hard on the higher difficulties, but it does not get fairer most enemies have hit scan weapons so as soon as you are in line of sight you are taking damage. Honestly no matter how good at shooter you are just put it on medium its a lot more fun. 
 
Overall if you are bored and just want a quick Nazi shooting fest the Wolfenstein will do the job but don’t expect any depth or complexity with its systems or story.

This game is run and gun, not much more to say if you love the genre and lots to complain about if you hate it. It serves as a DOOM alternative, replace the demons with some angry nazis eh? The game play is brain numbing point and shoot but that's exactly what you need sometimes in life. Like most run and guns of its genre the play time is short and expects you to collect all the werid misc around each map with its replayibility being repetitions of maps but this time harder. Story is second to the game play and cool nazi tech but welcome, love the post ww2 society built with a rebellion ship with blacks and jews fighting kkk and nazis.

Worth the buy on sale, you won't get more than a week or two of gameplay and is goes for dirt cheap on sales.

I played both on the highest difficulty available and New Colossus feels infinitely more fair while still being very challenging. It could be compared to Doom 2016 nightmare being absolute dogshit stupid hard and Doom Eternal nightmare being very balanced and a good way to play the game for the first time. The performance also, IdTech 5, the engine that New Order uses, absolutely HATES AMD cards, which is what I use, even on the absolute minimum settings I was getting 10-15 fps average during combat, while here it stays above 60 always even when I max the settings. The story was absolutely phenomenal aswell, might honestly be the only game I didn't instantly skip the cutscenes in, all the characters were well written and just felt... alive, as if they were real people. The music aswell, another FANTASTIC soundtrack by Mick Gordon that perfectly compliments the gameplay, however I'm not sure about him returning for Wolfenstein 3 after the whole Doom Eternal situation.

Overall I'd recommend this game to absolutely anyone who can handle quite a few fucked up things (SPOILERS: [spoiler] Having to choose a friend to get their eyes and brain cut out of them while they're still conscious [/spoiler], [spoiler] Seeing a few beheadings [/spoiler], [spoiler] Having YOUR OWN head cut off[/spoiler]).",1641239074,1641239199,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Flawed combat experience holding on by excellent gunplay.[/b]

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
1. Gunplay feels even more satisfactory thanks to id Tech 6's excellent animation and sound system.
2. Adding three additional abilities(smash,stealth,height) to improve player's combat experience.
3. Amazing graphical fidelity. Eye candy level.
4. Very interesting plot and scenarios, a mixture of black comedy and serious tone, putting a smile on my face with every mission.
5. Solid voice acting.
6. Nazi ruled 1960s America is crazily intriguing.
7. You can kill Space Nazi again. (On Venus this time.) 
8. You've got the chance to kill Hitler himself!

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[b]1. Combat flow is NOT as great as The New Order, and here's why:[/b]

[b]a)Weapons are a downgrade compared to The New Order,[/b] Rocket Launcher attachment(Assault Rifle) now replaced by the Kampftpistole which I don't really care in The Old Blood, AR marksman rifle is now replaced by the Assault Rifle, and it's secondary plasma shot are removed completely. Pistol's burst shot mode is also removed. Grenades no longer explode on impact. Why Machinegames why?!!!!

[b]b)Some weapon upgrades are pretty lame[/b] like the submachine gun's nail rounds, making the bullet much slower(still spray like hell) and doesn't gain the impact effect it deserve like the nail gun in F.E.A.R. Molotov upgrade hurts the player more than the enemy. Overall it's trash.

[b]c)Player's movement system feels so underwhelming [/b]once the super solider and teleportation robot arrived; the super solider can head butt charge into the player so fast that the player's old-school FPS movement system doesn't give you anything to counter that. Same thing goes to the teleportation robot, the player just can't have any initiative against them thanks to the game's uninspired moment system.

[b]d)Enemy(again,the super solider and teleportation robot) doesn't seem to have a visible weak spot[/b], making them a pure bullet sponge to deal with, ruining the combat flow even more when the game decide to throw a lot of them at you at once. 

[b]e)Also since the grenades no longer explode on impact[/b] combined with it's weird physic behavior, using Tesla grenade to stop the mechanized enemy is more like rolling the dice.


2. The three new abilities are a welcome, but there's only one that's actually useful. The other two are simply lame af and didn't add a lot to the gameplay. Some could even make the game harder, like the Battlewalker ability...(Let's ignore all the cover and become a 7 foot tall target by double tap the space key!)

3.  The ending felt so weak compared to the ending of The New Order, there is not a solid conclusion and we never saw the revolution happens.(Actually we will never know if there IS a revolution until The Young Blood....that's lazy af)

4. Limited enemy variety....You will be shooting the same Nazi solider and robots over and over and over in the latter stage.

5. Weak enemy design....they mostly looks the same...felt like Machinegames are running out of ideas. 

6. Weak music compose compared to The New Order. 

7. Venus is super lame compared to the Moon base in The New Order. Everything is so brown and fuzzy...like a base built on diarrhea(COD vibe)....also it adds a cooling meter(something like a oxygen meter), breaking the combat flow even more.

8. Promoting Communism and SJW ideas in a video game all about killing space Nazi.(it's generation Z, so we got to came up something edgy and ridiculous for our audience. Guess Wolfenstein 3 will set in the Meta-verse.)

9. Can add more creativity in player's ability, Iike the ability in Rage 2. Guns、Movement、Combat flow is all it matters in a FPS game. Story should be the second place.

So it understandable why some people may not like this game as much because there could be an argument made about the narrative being tonally inconsistent and breaking up the gameplay pacing, especially if you consider that the Old Blood and the New Order had some pretty emotional and decent stories in them. To a certain extent the narrative/story does have occasional pacing issues and flaws; however, I enjoyed the narrative this game was going for and, gameplay wise, I notice no drastic changes or major difference from the New Order and the Old Blood. If anything, I feel that this game gives more freedom in level approach not forcing players into either all out stealth or guns blazing.

This one turned into a slog, a grind I didn't even want to finish and the only reason I ever picked it back up to complete it was so I could uninstall it and never look at it again.  Now why is this?  How did this one turn out to be something I didn't like versus my pure enjoyment of the new order?  I think I figured it out - The enigma system.

In the new order you get to run and gun a lot, and it feels fantastic.  On occasion there are radio operators, if alerted they summon a never ending stream of enemies until you hunt them down and kill them off, this forces the occasional bit of stealth gameplay to try and assassinate them so you don't trigger the alarm.  Well in new colossus they added the enigma system where you have to collect codes from the radio operators to use in a minigame to unlock more stuff, which means they littered the game with more of these operators and have encounters with two of them much more frequently slamming the breaks on the incredibly awesome run and gun gameplay I liked so much from the first game.  

The story also feels very much disconnected, they keep trying to have these awesome moments, that just don't fit together as well as the previous games.  That is in addition to a small pile of absurd choices, the use of multiple nukes, and general tone whiplash.  There is still plenty to enjoy, but coming off the last two games I was expecting better than this.

I was glad to see the game still enforcing different, yet viable choices of approaching a situation, without binding you permanently to one playstyle. Blazkowicz can be stealthy, crafty, or a straight up terminator mowing down enemies. The gadgets acquired later on don't hinder this flexibility, and instead enforce a playstyle that you've grown more familiar. However, I do wish that they were changeable, instead of being bound to just one.

The plot of the game was easy to follow, and continued the story well. I liked how the last game's resolution had an actual long lasting effect on our main character, and the first portion of the game really felt like he could collapse at any moment. The later outfit change was a downgrade though. Seriously Blazko, yellow leather jacket? Nothing compared to the rugged looking comfy brown jacket of the previous game. 

The lenght of the game is fine, about 11 hours of the main story. A bit of spoiler here, the game is still playable after the story, to finish some quests and get achievements. However due to the confusing layout of the hub area, and the map, I don't feel like playing these, even when the NPCs can be quite endearing.

After loving Wolfenstein: The New Order when I was younger I am honestly appalled by how bad this game is. I uninstalled the game at the time of writing this, so it is long after the games release and I never quite understood why this game got so many bad and mediocre reviews considering how well the first game was received. Well if the reviewers made any of the same points I have issues with then I finally understand.

Good:
- Graphics - In game is great and cutscenes often look like E3 presentations.
- Performance - runs very well while looking good, didn't notice any stutter at all even when running from my backup hard drive.
- Set pieces - some cool parts and areas
- Theme - Slightly cheating since it already had the universe, but its still a cool setting of a rag tag rebellion taking on an empire of uber nazis.

Bad:
- Story - Relies on unbelievable shock factor and wackiness yet tries to take itself very seriously elsewhere. If you are avert to SJW politics, some of the dialogue can be very jarring and not exactly subtle in what the writer's opinions are but it calmed down after the beginning enough for me to ignore almost entirely for this review (at least up to where I stopped playing).
- Movement - Running, jumping and climbing all rarely work, especially in combat
- Missions - Short and sometimes not even relevant to the story.
- Difficulty - Goes from being spammed in a corner and having grenades snipe you to death to walking through a level without losing any health. No consistency and only difficult due to mentioned broken game mechanics rather than the actual difficulty choices. 
- Stealth - Bare Bones yet arguably forced due to officers that will set off alarms inviting infinite enemies if they are alerted.
- Map - You will get lost all of the time. The map is bad and doesn't allow you to change floors. There is no compass or on screen marker and the objectives are nondescript like ""go to character"" or ""get out"". 
- Combat Feedback - the hit indicators for the player are very bad so you will find yourself dying because you didn't even know you were taking a lot of damage. Same goes for grenades that only seem to have an indicator if you are looking at them, which is just as useless and redundant as the game telling you that your eyes are open.
- Controls - Very finicky. Some have double functions that can't be undone such as TAB scrolling the journal menu and melee also throwing an axe which will randomly choose which it wants to do. Another is that it is very temperamental whether it allows you to pick up armour and ammo automatically. So in combat you will try to pick up armour manually because you are dying and the game will refuse to pick it up automatically and accidentally pick up an empty heavy weapon, then die.
- Weapon Swapping - Possibly the worst I've ever seen. Firstly it is very slow not allowing for the on the fly weapon changes that Doom does. But also the duel wielding system is horrific. You will find yourself swapping weapons 4 times before getting the combination that you want. Combine that with the swap speed and you will die to this a lot. Also the weapon wheel is terrible too.
- Music - Its good because its Mick Gordon. I'ts bad because its horribly implemented with full levels having no music and very quiet ambient noises, even in battle. The mixing is pretty bad too considering Doom had a dynamic orchestra that followed the players actions.
- Side Quests - inane nonsense like feeding a pig potatoes, literally.
- Shooting - Sadly it just doesn't feel good. Weapons have no punch to them and feel like BB guns and the ADS covers so much of the screen and wildly shakes it is more of a challenge to use than hip fire. Also the game fluctuates in brightness a lot and at points you won't be able to see enemies at all until you see their muzzle flashes.

When I Stopped Playing: 
Near the end of the New Orleans level. Got charged by an enemy and knocked my heavy weapon out of my hand (annoying mechanic regardless). Spent 10 seconds looking for the gun only giving up since it despawned. Run away and pick up another of the same gun just to be immediately charged again and spammed while I was on the ground due to the slow stand up animation. The enemy wasn't even difficult, the death was purely from looking for a despawned weapon and the enemy spamming me while I couldn't move, a combination of previously mentioned issues. No thanks. I'd just beaten a miniboss by walking away slowly from its awful AI and was feeling that the game was running out of cards to keep me playing.

Rating: 5.9/10       (cant bring myself to give it a 6)
It is playable and can be enjoyable between the mess of game design. But the frustrating issues are so frequent and the variety of problems is so huge that it really isn't worth playing unless you truly don't care for your time or are one of those people that will defend any game that you have spent money on since your souls are monetarily linked no matter how bad the game is. 

Essentially the only thing that this game does well is graphics and performance. Other than that it pretty much fails in all aspects of game design making it a frustrating experience with no actual reward or satisfaction from playing it. I will have to replay Wolfenstein: The New Order to see if I was a stupid child for liking it. But until I am proven wrong, If you want the uber nazi killing experience just play The New Order, or better yet Doom Eternal.

I'm sure in some way they caused this so...

Getting the obvious out of the way first, it's pretty buggy, as said by pretty much every other negative review.
At first it really wasn't that bad, but after a while, it really does prevent you from having fun the way you want to, which is kind of a big deal when you consider that this game lets you approach each level in a more open-ended sense. 

The gameplay is fine for the most part. Again, there are bugs, but when your either using a stealth or guns-blazing approach the game does FINE. I thought the weapon upgrade system was actually pretty cool, but I found the contraptions to be pretty underwhelming honestly (except the constrictor, which is actually kind of fun). It feels like they promise WAY more than you can actually get out of them. Additionally, the difficulty ranges between piss easy to borderline ironic (both of my playthroughs were on difficulty 6/7, 7 being hardest). With this in mind, you can pretty much forget realistically beating the game on the hardest difficulty, which is the exact same as the second hardest minus being able to save. Speaking of which, the checkpoint system in this game is pretty disappointing. It works more on a manual save system, so you either cheese the game by saving ALL the time with kind of bad loading times or restart each level on death.

Lastly, the plot. Overall it has its ups and downs. Obviously being able to take down Nazi's is great, but the game presents this idea of a ""revolution"" but never shows us this ""revolution"" outside of the submarine (except once, but then those people get in the submarine too). It promotes a grand sense of scale without actually backing it up. There are genuinely cool moments in the plot, and the areas you visit are also pretty cool, but these moments are broken up with some corny and hilariously bad dialogue. Hearing BJ philosophically whine to himself is unintentionally funny in ways I don't think the developers intended. Other than that, there are some seriously shit plot holes, and the ending is not only abrupt, but super disappointing. Even worse, instead of just letting that ending set up a new game, they just give you the aftermath in a serious of PICTURES, and then skip TWENTY YEARS to the plot of the next game (which has its OWN issues, but that's there, not here). All of this makes what you just played feel borderline POINTLESS. It's kind of mind-blowing to be totally honest.

I know people enjoy this game, I know friends who enjoy this game, and that's totally cool, but if you're looking for something more tightly knit, I would genuinely try either one of the newer DOOM games first (same publisher), and even THEN, I'd still recommend something else.

Imagine that quote as a game. That game is the new Wolfenstein series by Machinegames, from 2014 's The New Order onwards. If you like linear story driven first person shooters, please do yourself a favor and play The New Order and its prequel The Old Blood. Pre-Doom 2016 I would have said those were the most visceral, action packed shooters I have ever played.

The New Colossus, a name Wolfenstein 2 shares with the poem at the base of the Statue of Liberty, completely eschews the adage ""less is more"" in favor of the tongue in cheek ""but more is also more"". Its a sequel in the truest sense of the word: it takes the foundation laid down by The New Order and refined by The Old Blood, and just dials things up, keeps dialing them up, hits the point where it should probably stop dialing things up, then cranks the dial straight past 11 and keeps going. In some ways, this is a good thing. We don't get a lot of solid linear story driven first person shooters nowadays, and its great to see Machinegames... uh... stick to their guns and just deliver more of what the first game offered.

But where The New Order sort of toyed with the line between style and substance, the macabre and the comedic, while keeping its separate elements in a near perfect harmonious balance The New Colossus suffers from its excesses. Don't misunderstand, the game is actually riotously funny and equal parts dark and gut-wrenching, but rather than delicately holding the line between these two disparate tones the game is almost bi-polar in how poorly it handles switching between the two. This comes to a head near the climax of the game where the schzophrenic tone begins to resonate with the narrative, where even the main character begins to question whether what he in the context of the game is experiencing is real or some sort of twisted dream. As the player, you progress ever forward, more and more with this gut wrenching sensation that the second act of the game does not feel... right. Like a fever dream where there is something just wrong and you cannot quite put your finger on it.

Its possible that Machinegames will pull off a narrative coup de grace in the third act (not Youngbloods, which is more of a side adventure similar to The Old Blood, but a true Wolf 3) by building this tonal dissonance into the story or plot (and part of me suspects they will) but only time will tell.

There was a lot of hooplah and controversy regarding the ""SJW"" elements of Wolfenstein 2, but like many of these twitter controversies it is overblown and can really only be played up by ignoring any of the subtlety (yes there actually is some of that) between character interactions and sometimes outright ignoring major plot points. Yes, Nazi's are like... super bad. I think we can all get on board with that. Wolfenstein 2 goes through really great pains to make sure you the player see the Nazi's are just people through any number of collectible readables scattered through the maps (postcards to family, friends, loved ones) or through little interactions between NPCs to even having one of your gang of outcasts provide perspective that these are not monsters, just people that do monstrous things.

Nazi's are also predominantly white, protestant, upholding the ""Aryan ideal"". Naturally, when recruiting a resistance movement against the Nazi's you're going to pick up all the people Nazi's find subhuman, which if it were a ven diagram would likely overlap with what people would consider a ""diverse"" cast of characters (multi-racial, differently abled, multi-religious, etc) but it makes perfect sense given the actual context of the game. I feel this game does in fact benefit from some distance from the zeitgeist, in 2018, that the game launched into. Bethesda's marketing leaned into it which naturally resulted in a backlash against it, and gamers were obligated to divide into the ""pandering to the SJW"" camp and the ""OMG they're FREAKING NAZIS"" camp which seems to taint the conversation surrounding this title to this day.

As for the game itself, it is a damn masterpiece of production. The visuals are stunning, but the game easily pumped out 100+ FPS thanks to its Vulkan renderer. Mick Gordon and company have assembled an absolute gem of a soundtrack. The character voice acting and animation is absolutely superb, some of the best I have ever seen. There is plenty of environment and enemy variation, the locations are rich and varied and although the basic types of enemies don't fundamentally change, their appearance matches the environment. Its just little things that draw you deeper and deeper into the world.

Levels generally follow the same flow of The New Order. You are inserted into a level from a hub world, and have the ability to sneak and silently dispatch enemies. Inevitably, at some point, you will be spotted, an alarm will sound and you drop the charade of sneaking and mow down waves of Nazi's as you beeline for the nearest Nazi Commander to dispatch and end the alarm. Glory kills are present, but unlike Doom 2016, you get no invulnerability during the takedown animation, limiting their utility.

The game does have some other flaws, small but annoying. The game does a poor job telegraphing where you're receiving damage from (or that you're even taking damage) so in a hectic firefight you can think you're doing ok only to suddenly see the screen go red and a few seconds later drop dead from a hail of Nazi gunfire. This combined with some bizarre dificulty spikes (The Courthouse) can result in some staggeringly difficult sections of gameplay. The level design in the first half the game is definitely weaker than the second, and weapon balance (especially after upgrades) can leave something to be desired.

None of the flaws are enough to actually stop me from wholeheartedly recommending this game to literally anyone that will listen. If you've been looking for a solid linear, story driven FPS hit, play all the new Wolfenstein games (excepting Youngblood, which I haven't played but heard handles things quite differently). The New Colossus definitely benefits from playing prior games in the series, although it can certainly hold up on its own. Just be warned that you're getting onto a weirdly melancholic ride for what outwardly presents itself as a meathead shooter.

If Joker had gotten up on Murray's stage and started telling an aristocrats joke, it would have sounded like this game.

I have been shooting nazis in video games for decades. From Hitler's head exploding cartoonishly in Bionic Commando to countless Medal of Honor games to putting three or four rifle rounds through the Fuhrer's crotch in the various cash-grab Sniper Elite mediocrities, I have a great deal of experience in shooting nazis in video games, and even in the heights of some of the most sadistic displays of hateful violence you could feasibly fit in an WW2 game, Wolf:TNC is absolutely not what it has ever looked like. Wolf:TNC is deeply ugly, aesthetically and spiritually, and manages to make a decades old tradition of heroically shooting nazis in video games into something disgusting, nauseating, and alien. No gamer should ever feel alienated while shooting nazis in video games and it is to Wolf:TNC's great shame that it manages to do so.

The people behind this game have put their myriad psychological issues on display for the world to see here and nothing good can come of indulging them in this. (I saw Wolfenstein Youngblood. Nothing good DID come of supporting this sort of filth.) After forcing you to sit through obnoxious, ugly, pointless nudity or scenes of a father abusing his family that last longer than whole stages of better games, the people behind this will insist loudly, with an elevated uptalk accusatory tone completely devoid of self-awareness, ""It is just a game about shooting nazis, just like Indiana Jones! You don't love nazis, do you?"" No. It's not like Indiana Jones. Get help. And get away from me.

Please, do not get involved with this game, even and especially if you enjoyed the previous two.

I really don't recommend playing this, if you have below 4GB of VRAM, you will probably get a message, that your graphics driver has ran out of video memory and the game is going to run like shit. I have 4GB of VRAM and when I set graphics preset higher than HIGH, I was getting this and the game was looking blurry and the fps were like max. 60, when there was absolutely no action, but playing on HIGH was okay in my case, except for some places, where I got some little fps drops below 60.

I really like the futuristic looks with the retro theme. As for the story, it's great too. Gameplay has several interesting mechanics with easy and simple control. A little negative thing for me, was that at a little longer distances, the bullet spread was kinda random, especially with pistol, so if you were trying to play stealthy, sometimes it was hard to shoot the enemie's head on the first good.

The game itself can be quite a difficult challenge for you, if you play on higher difficulties and game offers several of them. I have played the second hardest and enemies could sometimes kill you just with two bullets. Once you complete the storyline, you will unlock the toughest challnge of the game.

But. 
The tone has changed. Its not the grim story we are used to. Instead, they added some humour into the game and tried to adress some serious issues. Some might find it a funny or interesting twist. And although I recognize they are imporant themes; I hate it. I chose the for the wyatt guy to live as I liked his story in the new order. In this game, he becomes some weird vision having, drug using dim wit. They make a point of making him unfit to lead in favour of some chick you have never seen before. From a friend I  heard Fergus gets an uncoperative bionic arm. I mean.. that form of humor just doesn't fit with wat I expected or wanted from this title. BJ starts to have psychological problems. A logical concquence of the things he has been through, but it feels off. The defeatist tone of the hist voicelines rubs me the wrong way. He is the hero, the man who liberates and destroys nazis wherever he goes. I love stories and I play a lot of story heavy games, but something about the cutscenes, the tone and the way the characters are portrayed just ruins the game for me. I realize this is deeply personal but I thought I'd write it down so someone else might find it an usefull perspective. 
Also they changed anya's face drastically :( 

In the end, its a fun game and besides the points outlined above, I mostly have fun :-) So go play! Buy in sale i'd say.

Edit after few more hours of gameplay: Lighting and graphics are awesome. Story doesn't get any better. You end up watching hitler being and old man and a just plain bizzare display of slapstick by him. Farting, vomiting and more. Its supposed to be funny but I didn't think it was. Its way too much and bizzare for me. But then the cutscene was over and I was shooting nazi's again. 
I don't think I'll buy the next game in line though.

The game is too short for starters... and I got caught off-guard by the last mission without having most side quests... I just couldn't believe it was already the last mission until I saw the credits roll... and then yes you can complete the side quests afterwards... But it just made me realize why they were there in the first place... Its just filler. Most side quests are reusing the same maps (although sometimes modified) and they just feel boring and repetitive. So much of this game design seems to be built around dragging out the game... Boring side quests in the U-Boat that rely on the fact you will just waste time going from point A to B because it can feel like a maze(at least at first). And tons of Assassination missions that really feel like more of a chore than a pleasure... And also there is a Enigma Code mini-game required to unlock the Assassination missions... Which is practically impossible to fail... At first I was like why the hell did they even put this in here... And then it dawned on me... To drag out the game for an extra 20 minutes... Also even after having finished the game I realized I did not even have enough Enigma Cards to unlock much more than half the Assassination missions... Which would force me to replay levels, assuming I wanted to complete everything... But after doing 5 Assassination missions I just didn't care anymore...  And last but not least ''an alternate timeline'' that you can play by choosing to save a different NPC at the beginning of the game... But the differences are marginal. If you take out the couple side missions I did, the cutscenes and the cinematics... The main story probably took me less than 6 hours to complete. OK so enough about the length of the game and repetitive missions... Gameplay was OK at best. Rather than give you a ton of Nazi Soldiers to mow down... Most of the time you are fighting a couple at a time that are fully armored and even in Mech Suits which at times forces you to use the overpowered and heavy energy weapons in order to take them out... For someone like me, who comes from the original Wolfenstein 3D game this feels so different. I liked the fact that you can dual wield almost anything and the weapon upgrades you can unlock are nice... But that`s the only thing I enjoyed a lot about this game. Everything else was mediocre... And I could have recommended it had the main story been 2-3 hours longer... But this just felt so intentional and lazy... and its a shame because the game looks good visually... Although there are way too many dark tunnels and night time sequences... And the best looking level... Which happens to have a bunch of KKK walking around... You can't even fight in it.

[b] Playthrough Length - [/b] 7 hours

[b] Plot and Dialogue: [/b] 8/10, 7/10
[b] Setting and Art Design: [/b] 9/10
[b] Soundtrack: [/b] 8/10
[b] Graphics: [/b] 7/10 
[b] Gameplay and Sound Design: [/b] 9.5/10, 8.5/10

[b] Plot and Dialogue: [/b]
The dialogue in this game definitely takes a set back from the previous entry. The characters have good interactions and the new characters are welcome (except one). I didn't like one of the characters as I felt it was pushing a bit too much of a particular agenda which really annoyed me with a game like Wolfenstein. Ultimately, the Wolfenstein plot doesn't matter a helluva lot considering we're focusing on killing Nazis. 

[b] Setting and Art Design: [/b]
The setting continues to excel as we can really see the fusion of American and Nazi architecture. One of the most shocking scenes involves Washington D.C. and Manhattan, which you'll find out later why. The Evas Hammer does feel pretty cool as well, so they did a great job in that regard. 

[b] Soundtrack: [/b]
The soundtrack really gives me DOOM vibes as it really kicks in when you're ruthlessly slaughtering tons of Nazis. Helps to get that blood rushing. 

[b] Graphics: [/b]
This game is a graphics hog. It takes so much VRAM and for the amount of VRAM that is used, it doesn't look that good. It does look good though. Be careful with HDR as when I tried to use that in Wolfenstein, the game dropped to 10 FPS. Not a good look. 

[b] Gameplay and Sound Design: [/b]
The gameplay is the most important aspect of Wolfenstein. It continues to excel in this installment and offers you even more weapons and ways to go about killing the Nazis. Enemy class types are very distinct and provide their own unique challenges which is very good. There is also an additional side mode that allows you to hunt down the higher ups of the Nazis even after the story is complete so you have even more Nazi killing fun. Sound design is also an improvement from the last entry.

[b] Final Notes: [/b]
While not as strong as the first entry, it is still a game that I would highly recommend for all to play.

I will say I think the pacing is a bit more comical than grounded but it does make the evil of the enemy darken with great contrast. 

Gameplay wise I miss some things, for instance now you can just treat bad guys like a bullet sponge you don't have to shoot certain weak points. However I'm sure some people find it a relief. However I do notice that this game is more about running ducking shooting looting and axeing almost all at once. 

I gotta say they may not have meant to make a crazy good story but it worked either way. The performances are just as hammy and yet endearing at the same time. The German performances are done well enough that you love hating them and you can tell the actors had a blast making this. I love the fleshed out Backgrounds and it broadens the awareness of the character you play. While making vapor nazi fumes with your plasma gun. 

And of course they throw hints and tid bits of ID's identity and their history all around. For instance. BJ is in fact from Mesquite TX. The very home of the dev studio.

Missions have a difficulty mix of overly-easy to sudden shoot-heal/reload-shoot game play, and a few weapons that don't have much uniqueness compared to other shooter games.

I struggle to find reason this game should be bought other than on a good sale ($11 w/ expansion during the thanksgiving 2021 sale). While the plot to the main story is compelling, it's slow and clumsy. This is a game that could be easily compacted down into the space of a movie runtime, but is interrupted with constant battles of grinding the same few types of enemies over and over and over. Grinding being a keyword, because every bout with enemies feels repetitive and samey despite slightly different environments. Additionally, Wolfenstein operates on a very narrow track of what weapons should be used when.

Tight corridors = shotgun (If you run out, go to SMG)
Heavy unit = Grenade launcher (when you run out go the rifle)
Anything else = Rifle (when you run out, SMG)
Stealth = The pistol and SMG, which are the only weapons that can be suppressed. Having a suppressor option feels out of place for the game though, and I almost never chose the stealth route. Enemies act oblivious until they identify you, then behave omniscient once alerted.

Heavy weapons exist (dropped by what are essentially mini-bosses), which early on are absurdly powerful. They do not persist in your inventory, are dropped at the end of levels and when traversing ladders. Around 3/4ths progress through the game though, your core set of inventory weapons are likely upgraded and (conditionally) better, especially when you upgrade the Sturmgewehr (the assault rifle) to have 'Armor Piercing'.

As mentioned, the pistol and SMG have a suppressor option, and the assault rifle has a armor piercing option. This is part of the games upgrade system, where upgrade kits hidden across the levels can be used to improve your weapons. While there aren't many upgrades (3 per weapon, and 6 weapons not including grenades and not including the alternate special weapon you don't get), it becomes very obvious which upgrades you should go for first.

****Spoilers below****

On the story front, little feels accomplished by the end. One of the big baddies is offed, but it felt like I was just grinding through the same enemies to get to that point and it felt like a somewhat hollow victory. As I previously mentioned, I *want* the main cast of characters to be successful and to make progress, but at the same time they're an annoying burden. It feels like it was attempted to have the depth of characters you'd find in 'The Last Of Us' (knowing the story of Joel from pre-clickers to the end of the game), but without any real reason to care for them.

And with minor and major story points, this persisted. The best example being Caroline Becker, (spoiler) she dies early in the game...but I really couldn't care. I played the first game years ago, but she was forgettable to me. Will talks to her through thought/internal dialogue very frequently for the first half of the game, but then due to a situation that essentially boils down to the story not having room to progress and needing a longer run time, Will no longer has a reason to continue this inner dialogue focused on Caroline and shes brushed aside.

This circles back to what I initially said. I find the main plot compelling: Wolfensteins world, *some* of the characters, and where we are story wise in this game. It's just that the points that are interesting could be condensed to little more than three hours and you'd still have the complete picture.

One other aside is that the main baddie feels like a dollar store knock off of a wannabe Joker. You hate the baddie for their actions, they act maniacal and insane, do crazy things, but it just seems weird and lazy from the writing perspective when you step back and look at it as a whole.

It's entertaining at first, interesting and fun at times, but mostly boring and grindy for the rest. Hard to recommend other than on a steep sale and with no other games to play.",1638165963,1638244284,False,2,0,0.479643791913986206,0,True,False,False

The levels are quite boring, basically your dark corridors, rundown building, sewers. You think you will get to visit interesting locations like Manhattan, New Orleans or even Venus, but that's just for the first minute, the rest is, you guessed it, dark corridors, rundown buildings and sewers. 
Even the gunplay seems like a downgrade from the previous.Everyone is wearing damn armor and are bullet sponges. Your big and imposing weapons feel like bb guns, if you want to deal real damage you have to carry a huge weapon that slows you down to a sloth level. Waves of enemies will swarm you and if you don't take the stealth way chaos will ensue and you will most likely die from something. Did I mention you get knocked down? Yep, knocked down by enemy hitting you, by explosions, by dogs, by the wind. If you are hoping for an engaging firefight get ready to crawl on the floor a lot.
Is there anything positive about this game? I guess. The graphics are better, the music is good, didn't encounter any bugs, so I guess you could say it's competent.

Although personally I think I liked the story of the first one more (this is subjective), this second part is incredible in all levels. The gameplay has been improved with more details, weapon upgrades, the interaction throughout the game with the NPCS is changing and what they have to tell is quite interesting, the scenarios are wonderful and has a decent secondary material (there is a section that are quite repetitive though).

Third installment in the reboot, the core of the game is the same: killing nazi's in all forms and shapes, including some KKK-ers. The game drops all reasonable ""what-if"" stuff and just goes full fantasy with things such as stitching heads back to bodies or a senile Hitler that hangs out on Venus and wants to make a movie about Terror Billy (you). Oh and half the US gets atom bombed.

You again have 2 ways to kill everyone: Rambo or Sam Fisher. While going stealth is a bit more difficult, its rewarding to finish a district or a section without setting of any alarms. The AI does have some minor quirks so getting spotted happens more often than not. You do have an arsenal of weaponry at your disposal that even can be upgraded along the way.

While the gameplay is fun and some of these 'what-ifs' are funny, the story as a whole feels rushed, incoherent and maybe a tad incomplete, especially towards the end. The final boss fight is relatively difficult but it never felt like a true boss-fight as its just against robots. Actually facing off with the main baddy - Frau Engel - is a fun sequence though.

It also feels short. You don't expect length and depth like in an RPG, but the game setups some elements (like a homebase on Eva's Hammer) that make you expect a longer duration. However, after 10 hours you're pretty much there. There is some artificial lengthening (not like that) in terms of collectibles (toys, tablets, tapes, cousin Niko ...) and killing Ubercommanders. 

The latter is locked behind a non-explained minigame (I actually had to lookup how it works, but that might be me) until relatively late in the game so make sure to pick up Enigma codes along the way. You'll also have to farm some districts (Penthouse is your friend) to get enough of those codes to unlock all Ubercommanders. Its a fun addition to the game - and a reason to revisit certain locations - but it could have been woven more into the main story in my opinion.

All in all, definitely the best of the 3 so far (New Order, Old Blood and this) even if its for the unlocked framerate alone.",1636390876,1636390876,True,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

Quite similar to the first one (which for me is a big plus, as I liked it a lot as well), with a couple of new features ([spoiler]contraptions, side quests, enigma machine [/spoiler] etc.).
What I liked:
- variety of locations;
- memorable characters;
- satisfying shooting and combat mechanics;
- story is alright;
- enemies are OK animation- and AI-wise;
- possibility of different playstyles and approaches (I prefer stealth, and here it's implemented nicely);
- all the fun Wolfenstein can deliver ([spoiler]riding a Panzerhund, kicking Hitler in the balls, playing Wolfenstein3D[/spoiler])
- Shoshana <3.
What I liked less:
- felt a little bit too easy comparing to the first game (especially bossfights, which are rather absent here);
- some cut scenes were a bit cringy;
- bugs (constant crashes during attempts to view a freshly found collectible, not getting an achievement about finding at least one of every collectible - those are not fixed from 2017);

Unfortunately I can't recommend it. I must have had 40+ crashes and freezes during my play time. I tried multiple variations of settings. Much googling. Nothing worked really. I think towards the end, I may have struck on something by raising the pool size (image streaming in settings) but it still crashed. Crashes exiting levels. Crashes transitioning to cut scenes. Freezes just bloody looking around. Constantly having to end task through task manager. In the end I'd just had enough. I will put my specs for reference. Ymmv but I rarely have games crash on me and I have never had a game crash on me the way this game has. It's in a league of it's own.

Also, although cut scenes are skippable ( ... not immediately mind, as levels have to load .. ), there are in game ""events"" that may as well be cut scenes (since all you usually do is press one button at the end) that can't be skipped and go on for f****** ages. First time around is bad enough but that second play through, those are gonna be torture.

- Game is a bit short (15 hours to complete the main campaign)

- Not safe to play with kids around. The game has very gory cutscenes and harsh language.

As much as I hated this game's problems, broken balance, cringe and a lot of else things...I still enjoyed it
And here's some cons and pros

[h1]Cringe Plot...or He_il Hit_ler?[/h1]
Shooting in a wheelchair, body replacement for a head, fuhrer's movie castings, fart jokes, alcoholism, feminism
And yet lots of epic, pathos, brutal nazi shooting and most importantly - Hitler himself
This game does not afraid of its storytelling, and sometimes its too much, too much fun or too much cringe
You can still enjoy its plot, but if you are was born without a sense of humor - you're gonna have a BAD time

[h1]Badass Shooter or EVERYTHING IS BROKEN?![/h1]
Its cool to fight of enemies... in a wheelchair.
But its not cool to have 50 hp FOR HALF OF THE GAME
Especially if you're taking on higher difficulties
Enemies WILL kill you a lot, if you dont use LEANS
But its not only problem - enemies have very strange hp
Some machines like PanzerHunds will tank every god damn weapon you throw at them
But then Bosses like Zerstrores - will die quicker than Armored Frogs like wtf
Some nazis will be oneshotted
Others will withstand a rocket into their face
Some areas are extremely hard whilst latter zones will be laughably easy and boring
The amount of fun and frustration is equal - and its not that good

[h1]It looks good but at what cost?[/h1]
FINALLY MachineGames remembered about Red Videocards - no more fps drops like in New Order or Old Blood
NOW EVERYONE HAVE THE SAME ISSUE - CRASHES
LOTS OF THEM
FOR NO REASON AT ALL
CRASH WHILE LOOKING ARTS
CRASH WHEN LOADING
CRASH WHEN SOMEBODY DIED WEIRDLY
CRASH FROM JUMPING
This game looks very good, but be prepared to save a lot, you're gonna need those F5's

[h1]BJ and some weirdos[/h1]
Our main hero is still a badass, talks random sad stuff and is still a pretty good MC
Despite the fact he suffered a lot and actually survived all of this
But his team?
AfroNigoWoman is now our leader
MAX HASS is good in my book
Bombata is useless
Anya is cringe
Sigrun is LOL
Fergus is now became an onanist
Wyatt is just an idiot

[h1]Mick Gordon ROCKS[/h1]
There is no bad opinions about the music or sound effects - everything is perfect

[h1]Corridors, lots of them[/h1]
If New Order tried to have some different ways to approach each mission
This game said fuck it - and made itself as linear as possible
Of course we still have stealth...but most of the time we're using the same route as Agressive way
No more storytelling from props too so the whole game is basically - a shooter, just as it needs to be

[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]
It started good and fun
But then it showed its true colors, meh lore, HARD difficulty, EASY when mastered, boring levels most of the time
Still enjoyed it tho, since THE BLOOD IS BLOODY AND EXPLOSIONS ARE EXPLOSIVE.
But still wouldn't reccomend it if you're looking for the same experience as from New Order.",1634835315,1634835812,True,2,0,0.486851811408996582,0,True,False,False

I don't really like it. There's multiple annoyances with the way this game is designed that rubs me the wrong way at every turn, I feel like a moment doesn't go by that I'm not being annoyed by another aspect of the game.

It's going to sound nitpicky as hell, but here are some of the reasons I'm finding it difficult to pick up this game and play it.

-  This game suffers from triple AAA budget syndrome where they're trying to make a cinematic experience alongside a video game, and it sucks. The camera work in the cut-scenes feels meandering. The dialogue is rattled off inorganically as if these characters are reading verbose scripts and not having a conversation. And while I do not subscribe to this idea that this game is ""Woke"" and therefore it's bad, it does sound kind of preachy at times where it feels like the writers are trying to tell you some kind of message instead of a story. 

- On the subject of the story, the game feels like it's trying to be Inglorius Basterds. But it sucks. Just lean harder on the grind-house violence and make me feel disgusted but justified with what I do to the Nazis and make the story focus on that.

-Blazkowicz is just majorly cringey. You're unfortunately given access to his isolated thoughts and he waxes lament like he's writing lyrics for a country song. He speaks slowly and depressingly to himself at random intervals throughout the game, often about some woman character I've already forgotten. And he's doing this right after he hacked a Nazi's face to pieces with a tomahawk. It's just stupid, unrealistic, and it feels like the developers are elbowing you in the side saying ""Hey, you should empathize with this guy, he's not just a blood-crazed nazi killer, he has feelings""

- The Heads Up Display is ugly and it's especially heinous when trying to use the hint system to see where you're supposed to go. The icon that's supposed to highlight your destination is like a transparent off-white diamond that's incredibly small and only stays on the screen for like 2 seconds so you'll miss it if you blink. I mean fuck, I'm 31, I'm not an old man but this game is making me squint like I'm in my 60's. 

- Level design is bad. This goes in tandem with the HUD problem. It's not that the environments don't look good, is just that they're not intuitive to navigate. When you arrive in the ruins of New York City you basically need to keep guessing which direction you're supposed to go because there's no obvious little indications that the pile of rubble over yonder has a trail underneath it that takes you to the next area. When you're in the U-Boat everything is just a labyrinth of hallways and metal catwalks that there's not a single memorable area in the zone.  

- The actual gameplay itself is mediocre at best. It's functional enough for some people to find it fun. It's not quite on the boomer-shooter level of high octane run-and-gun gameplay like Dusk or Doom: Eternal, and it's not slow and methodical like Call of Duty, it's somewhere in the middle. If you were looking for a FPS game with a story, I'd recommend about 10 other games before I ever recommended this one.

And the worst part is that killing nazis should be fun, but this game is a total snooze fest. Play something else.",1633892244,1633892244,False,2,0,0.461077839136123657,0,True,False,False

Firstly, we have nothing new here really. The graphics are decent, the gameplay is good, and the story is decent. No more, no less. A fairly limited amount of different weapons and gameplay options make replay unlikely. Some cutscenes shine, while others are uninteresting.
Secondly, the social justice messaging is just juvenile. An overweight nazi is insulted by her mom, then turns sides and has sex with the black resistance fighter. The black panther party are the heroes, and their female leader breastfeeds a child on camera, and acts like an alpha strong personality, while her husband is just a weak cuck. Really?

BJ Blazkowicz, currently the main protagonist of the series, is humanized beyond my expectations in Wolfenstein II, to my immense delight, as these aspects of the story are much of why I love these games. I have a great deal of attachment to the other characters as well, especially Anya, Fergus, Grace and Horton, and thought they made cutscenes, which I'm normally not a big fan of, more enjoyable. The gameplay is a step above the previous entries, being quicker and deadlier than the previous entries, more akin to the new DOOM games, with the (admittedly clunky) ability to dual-wield different combinations of weapons.

I didn't think it was quite as memorable as its predecessor, admittedly, though it still has plenty of strengths in its own right. The graphics are gorgeous as ever and the gameplay is fairly smooth. Plenty of your favourite characters from The New Order are back, and some of them get a bit more screen-time than they did the first time around (like Bombate, for example), though some old favourites (like Fergus) take less of a key role in the overarching story. Then there are new members of the cast, such as Grace, Sigrun or Horton. Granted, not all of these new characters get any real development before the game ends, but I still enjoyed them for what they were.

The story of the game is that you're liberating the US from Nazi occupation by linking up various resistance groups. The game does end somewhat abruptly - but I guess it didn't overstay its welcome, so I suppose there's a silver lining to that. Plus, part of the story really revolves around Blazkowicz himself, who learns he is going to be a father - which prompts a bit of exploration into his own backstory.

So yes, I do recommend the game. If you want to see a sample of gameplay before deciding whether to buy, here's a handy link to my Youtube playthrough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DlfFIsbBo8&list=PL05Yc3_TEBpO7DvEupeG6y6yP9JfDsF3N",1632234338,1632234338,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

El combate mejoró muchísimo para este título, ofreciendo muchas formas de enfrentar enemigos.

Retiro lo dicho, no estoy tan mal como para pasarlo en ""Mein Leben"", jamás lo sacaría probablemente xD. Igualmente, la verdadera dificultad que veo es encontrar una mujer como Anya (y que me de bola).
La trama es la que más ilusión me hizo, por fin sentís una chance de que sea posible acabar con los nazis y tiene un buen y muy satisfactorio final. Eso sí, los diálogos son muy feos, parecen sacados de la peli más taquillera que te puedas imaginar. Es peor que en los anteriores aunque tiene alguna que otra buena línea.

Los niveles van siendo uno mejor que el anterior, tanto en diseño como en objetivos están muy buenos. Salvo el del Metro, disfruté de todos tanto como en ""The Old Blood"". Está muy bueno lo de las ""mejoras físicas"" y como juegan con el mapeado, cosa que podés aplicar en muchos combates una vez lo conseguís. En ciertos niveles se usan vehículos de combate que resultan equitativamente letales y divertidos, cosa que se agradece.

El final es hermoso como dije antes, salvo por el cover djentoso que le metieron, pero bueno, al menos es ""metal"".

En general, vale muchísimo la pena jugarlo, más aún si jugaste los anteriores. Mejora en algunas cosas y la caga en otras, pero la verdad es que lo disfruté igual. En todo caso recomendaría agarrarlo en oferta.",1632106102,1632106593,True,4,1,0.550364315509796143,0,True,False,False

Positives:
-fun to use weapons and tactics
-good to great atmosphere
-immense detail in graphical and audial capabilities
-well delivered lines from voice actors
-fair bit of extra content including side missions, shooting range, collectibles, and Wolfenstein 3D

Negatives:
-heavily stereotyped characters
-overly goofy tone that (while some might enjoy) doesn't at all fit the universe as set up in the previous two 
 titles
-disproportionately large focus on cutscene length for an action/shooter
-mostly hitscan enemies can make the game feel unbalanced on occasion

Ultimately, much of this is personal opinion, and the game was still pretty well made. However, the dragging story filled with so many pointless moments and characters that i found it impossible to be engaged with the plot as in the last two games. I don't really recommend this title unless it goes on supersale and you NEED to play it.

""Could not write crash dump"" happens way too often and there's no guaranteed fix for it. There are many possible solutions that seem to be hit or miss. I haven't found one yet although I haven't tried them all yet since it wasn't really happening that often. But often enough if I want to go for Mein Leben run which I definitely do.

Apart from that there was 1 moment in story that kinda ruined it for me but there were still many other positive wtf and very funny moments in the story, all the likable characters come back from New Order and some cool new ones are introduced as all. All that made it even better.

Gameplay wise I think it's a huge improvement as well although I thought weapons were better balanced in TNO and TOB. In this game there's one weapon with specific upgrade that can do it all at all ranges against all enemy types. Not really game breaking but a bit of a shame. Other weapons are still very fun to use at least.

Content wise there's a lot of it in this game. Compared to TOB and TNO, A LOT more. Many more collectibles, actual side missions, ""assassin contracts"", DLC campaigns, combat challenges from TOB return and there's even an arcade machine with full Wolf3d game. I like this main area, your base where all the characters are and they have little chats, usually very funny, with each other you can listen between missions. Kinda like that hideout in TNO but much bigger and many more characters. All that makes this game the best of the series imo.

It also shows how much you can achieve nowadays with this kind of technical production: powerful, imaginative and dynamic camera movement, engaging performances by good actors excellently motion-capturing memorable characters in far out scenarios and just giving your game that extra little... panache.

As for the gameplay - it's good (not great). The weapons lack a certain punch, there is not a great variety to them or the enemies and the boss encounters are not that special or fun. There's not even a colossus to fight. :( I found it to be a minor improvement from The New Order, though.

- The soundtracks are amazing
- The oberkommando missions are just lazy reused levels, and it is bullshit sometimes. The oberkommandos are using kampfpistole. The annoying part comes when you're playing in mayhem way (run and gunning). There's zero checkpoint in oberkommando levels so if you're dead, you're restarting the whole damn level. The oberkommando can kill you with one shot of kampfpistole. So, don't do these missions with mayhem, do them with stealth.
- And no chapter select like the previous games? seriously? 
- The DLCs aren't bad, but overpriced. 
- The dogs are annoying. This isn't an issue with the previous game, but those mutts are just too fast and hard to kill in this game, especially if you're a controller user.
- The game can be hard sometimes, that can be a good thing in a video game, but not this one. The enemies aren't bullet sponge, but you became as weak as a fetus. I've tried the ""do or die!"" difficulty, everything was fine and not really that challenging. But the real shit begins in one oberkommando mission: the manhattan subway. For some reason I always die in that level. I've beat the court level (the level that everyone has a hard time dealing) with no issue, so why's this one the hardest one?
- the story is amazing and sometimes can be funny. The characters are lovable, but some are introduced too far in the game. For example, Horton and his gang, they're introduced too far, almost reaching the end of the game.
- There's the motherflipper himself, hitler, in the game. You do get an achievement when you kicked him, but they missed an opportunity to have him as a cyborg boss.
- The end boss doesn't feel personal. Just more soldiers and ubersoldatens, and two bigger and harder ubersoldaten. When you kill general engel in the game, it feels satisfying, yes. But you don't feel the satisfactory of killing her in-game. You don't fight her like you fight Deathshead in The New Order. Everything was scripted. 
- They tried to make a ""BFG"" version of Wolfenstein, the ubergewehr, but it ended up just a weapon that got you killed multiple times. It's slow af and not fun to use.

overall, the combat is superior than it's predecessor, and the game is fine. I've replayed the game three times and it's still fun. But it would be cool if they added the chapter select tho..",1628905236,1631499036,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[*]Horrible level design.
[*]Visual effects terrible at night, you have no idea what the f@ck you're looking at.
[*]Unintuitive controls for weapon switching.
[*]Game having an anneurism whenever you try to lean left/right and shoot.
[*]Boring visuals, just grey and brown corridors one after the other.
[*]3 useful weapons out of 15 provided.
[*]You will be wondering if anyone playtested this on a real difficulty. Certain sections are meant exclusively for the player to go rambo, without considering the absurd damage received in higher difficulties. It's impossible to beat without save-scamming.
[*]The DLCs are just a waste of money.
[*]SJW propaganda shoved in your face at every available opportunity, and poorly executed at that.
[*]Abrupt, anticlimactic ending.
[*]Writing fitting a cartoon meant for toddlers, especially concerning philosophical concepts of morality and the more action-packed ""coolness"". Frankly I'd be ashamed if I ever wrote anything as immature as this. [/list]

I like most of the new characters, even if they sometimes make me cringe. But they do a lot of disservice in this game, particularly to Wyatt spends the whole game high but Blazkowicz doesn't even notice which is disappointing. The same can be said for Sigrun. In the previous game you have Klaus Kreutz, a nazi turned freedom fighter. The team seems to instantly accept him, albeit with some hesitancy from Blazkowicz. It can be argued that Sigrun instantly proves herself to an extreme extend saving the lives of Blazkowicz and Wyatt/Fergus whilst freeing the U-Boat and everyone on it. Everyone walks all over her just like her mother does and it's uncomfortable. Aside from those awkward character moments is the final boss, or lack-there-of. There literally isn't a final boss. You fight two nameless robots and capture the Ausmerzer. Then there is a cutscene where you kill General Engel. That's it. That's the end of the game. Though the story was a bit wild with Blazkowicz's losing his body and gaining a new one, it was good. I just wish they did literally anything else with that ending.

New Colossus is unfortunately lacking, especially when compared to previous games. By no means is it a ""bad game"" so to speak, especially to players with no prior experience regarding the franchise. What I dislike most is the pacing of the game, the severely abrupt (and lacking) ending, and the fact that it doesn't make you feel anything significant (story-wise) in the third act; It feels very rushed. 

I only found enjoyment whilst going for the Mein Leben difficulty, as it gave that intense feeling that would never really leave you until you beat the game, but that's not a pro for New Colossus, its primarily just thanks to the Wolfenstein formula.

Also; The super forced feminist quips are especially weird in a Wolfenstein game. I personally wouldn't have mind a quip here and there, but its too present and almost feels forced. Really weird choice in this given setting Bethesda, but you do you. Wonder if the next game will have BJ jamming to Dua Lipa while killing Nazis.

It's straight up disrespect. 

The blatant politics that they injected into this game simply don't belong here. Which is such a shame because the gun play is so good.

The graphics are good, even now 4 years after its release (if you can ignore the hunch back that all 3D models of the characters have).  The story is, well, ludicrous, but it has a few moments of fun (and lots of utter tastelessness, but that is a matter of taste, in a manner of speaking).  
None of the characters in this story made me root for them, or even only feel sympathetic with.  In fact, the only person I felt remotely I could relate to was the father who was trying to teach his son that he had to stand up for himself.  This part of the story played almost 100 years ago, and back then life was harsh, nothing for the young, soft snowflake generation of current times.  I wonder whether the makers of this game have ever realised how much they placated themselves with the pinnacle of their story - a gory, brutal act of violence far worse than the supposedly heartless father teaching his son a lesson.
The biggest gripe I have is the BORING game play.  All weapons feel the same, all environments look the same, all enemies look identical, and the whole darn thing seems to play as if all movement is done with rubber bands attached.  The action does not nearly make up for that, because, it too is the same throughout.  The worst part is the ""Lost at Sea"" portion where not even the action is there - all you have to do is endlessly run about the huge U-Boat and look for people and/or run stupid errands that have no meaningful impact on the overall story line.  All of this comes with countless ""collectibles"" and other side information neither helpful nor immediately relevant to the story, and it is just a pain to look through.  I guess the authors wanted to create ""atmosphere"" but it simply does not add up.  It does not get better by the mistakes of the German language used, both spoken and written. At least they did have multi-lingual voice talent, such as General Engel, who seems to be native (or close enough) to make her German and English sound natural. 
I had played the 2016 release of Doom only half a year earlier, followed by Doom Eternal.  Both sport an equally strange but engrossing story, both give the player the Doom Guy as a highly enjoyable character to relate to, and both are highly addictive and left me with an urge to move on, to know more, to understand the story.  It is a mystery to me how Wolfenstein II could be such a let-down, coming from Bethesda just like Doom 2016 had.

When I first bought this game on PS4 a couple years ago I lost interest after a few levels as I couldn't get into the story, now having played new order and old blood, the story was captivating and immersive.

I can't wait for the next mainline instalment in the new Wolfenstein franchise.

An epic sequel to an epic series. Wolfenstein II manages to improve its already impressive predecessors in almost every way - much better visuals, better gunplay, more varied enemies with vastly improved AI, bigger levels, bloodier action, more strategic combat and more. The gameplay is super fun, fast, yet varied with decision making needed on the fly. Just for the action, this game deserves to be played.

When it comes to the story, I think it's very good. Very well written, large in scope, but well fleshed out, with a very large cast of characters that all feel real and alive, with BJ at the center of it all as a very good protagonist. The worldbuilding is also amazing, combining Nazi brutalism, sci-fi dystopia and a hint of hippie 60s America. There's also a bigger dash of humour than before which helps lift the pressure of the high stakes. Now, there is an obvious hint of modern liberal politics and humour but it isn't ham-fisted and doesn't get in the way. If you worry that this game will push political correctness onto you, fear not, it won't.

Also one more thing, something I've never mentioned in a game review before - cinematography. The cutscenes in this game are among the best I've ever seen, with fantastic shot composition, transitions, atmosphere and style, making the experience feel like a high budget action film. In game, the first person perspective and detailed visuals are used in clever ways to create amazing immersion and emotionally moving experiences. Chef's kiss for you Machine Games, you outdid yourselves again. Just, please do something about all the technical issues, it's a shame for a modern AAA game that is otherwise very well made and well polished to have so many bugs that sit unfixed.

In conclusion, the same that I said for the previous Wolfenstein games applies here - one of the best story-driven FPS games ever made, both in terms of its story and its gameplay. Highly recommended.

Pros:
+ gunplay is rewarding and weapons feels heavy and devastating
+ levels are beatiful and full of details
+ soundtrack is good and fitting

Cons:
- story is atrocious, filled with not likable characters and full of cringe moments
- everything is a much more exagerated (especially during the custcenes) which is taking any sort of believability out of the world.
- not really a long game

*Edit:
I have just completed The old blood and I am even more dissapointed with the overal feeling and story in this game.

Revisiting it now though with a stronger PC and coming fresh off of replaying the New Order (Using the fan patch to make it run at a better FPS) I can honestly say all this game really has going for it is okay gun play, okay story, great graphics and thats it.
The stealth straight up doesn't work, the enemies may as well just be giant floating eyeballs with giant ears when it comes to detection.
And the perk system is terrible compared to the first. The first is wonderfully straight forward. Do the challenge (From just kills to streaks to not missing) Get a perk, unlock another challenge for another perk.
This is just kill x guys with x weapon unlock more space for it.
Get it for £5 tops imo.

So many jaw dropping moments to be had throughout this game. After 3 incredible games you finally feel like you have set the wheels in motion of taking America back from the Nazi's. 

SPOILERS AHEAD:

With incredible moments like the tragic death of Caroline or the dramatic ending of BJ's cruel father. The game constantly keeps you on edge. Especially when you are put before a judge sentenced to death, then out of a fit of rage you break out of your bonds and kill everyone..., and see BJ's mother. But, none of that matters because in reality it was all just and dream and then you see BJ's head get cut off on live TV. An unexpected turn of events to be sure. Especially when you get a brand new body, with a brand new set of abilities. Making your way to confront Hitler himself steal the Odin codes and finally kill Frau Engel.

I'm sure I skipped a couple details here and there but at the end of the day this was one of the best games I have ever played. BJ truly is a monster, patriotic, and god among men. 16/10 game.

Gameplay is still fun, it is still a wolfenstein game afterall. Its just not as good. 
The music is alot like Doom in that they made it heavier and it works well with this gameplay.

Overall I got it on sale for $11 but I still wouldnt recommend it at that price honestly. Replay the first one to get your fix so you wont be dissapointed.

The gunplay is fantastic, and it feels so satisfying to shoot and kill the enemies! The sequences where you fight the bosses/big bads are challenging, but not frustratingly so.  The level design feels organic without feeling too linear. However, there were times where I was a little confused on where to go without using the hint key, and that brings us to the main hub. The submarine where the player spends a good portion of time is confusing to navigate even with all the signs it has inside. It was too easy to get turned around in the submarine and have a ""where am I?"" moment. From my perspective a lot of the submarine just didn't seem to necessary to the game, and detracted from it more than helped it.  

The weapon upgrades and perks for the game, felt largely like an afterthought. I never really got as invested in them as much as I was in the first game. I was also a bit disappointed with the lack of weapon variety. Maybe I missed some weapons during my play though, but there seemed to only be 6 weapons worth using. 

The story is so-so. I didn't really find it compelling or interesting, and I get that wolfenstein has a history of ""out there"" plot points, but this was [i] really [/i] out there.  The character development, besides the romantic interest, was actually pretty good, and I liked the other characters quite a bit. They all had good dialogue, and it was fun interacting with them.  The voice acting was good, for the most part. Although, some of the dialogue was more than a bit weird even for wolfenstein. 

With all that said the game is short, about 8 or 9 hours if you complete everything. Not that it's necessarily a bad thing, it just is.  Too add to that the gunplay is also sporadic, a player can go 20 to 30 minutes (multiple times) without shooting, which slows down the game. 

All in all, I can recommend it, but only when it's on sale. It isn't quite as good as the first one, or Doom 2016 for that matter. However, it is still worth a play through.

The levels are more varied than the first taking you all over the world and they are much more open. Has quite a few really solid twists and turns that I simply did not expect.


Unfortunately aside from the bugs this game has one hugely annoying flaw: The commander mechanic. It seems like every five minutes the game plops you in a level with Commanders. Why is this a big deal you ask? well it severely limits how you play. You can't just run and gun because it will alert the Commanders and then they proceed to spawn waves of enemies unless they are killed. This means you are forced to stealth in and kill them first if you don't want to be swarmed by infinite foot soldiers. Really not sure why they insisted on this mechanic popping up so frequently because it is very annoying. When I think of Terror Billy the last thing that comes to mind is the titular character cowering in the shadows. He's a bad ass who has slaughtered Nazi's in the thousands, not Sam freaking Fisher.

At first, like you <probably>, I didn't get the reason for the negativity in the reviews for this game. A certain mob of people tried bashing the game for daring to show Anya topless in a rather hilariously bada$$ scene, but it otherwise seemed like more of the same in terms of gameplay. And yes, the level design feels a bit lackluster yet similar compared to the prior entries, the guns don't feel nearly as powerful as they should be until you upgrade them, but the story is truly the bullet to the knee. 

They roped me in at first, with some fairly hardcore setup and a visceral look into our hero's past, but things quickly fall off from there. Without even trying or meaning to, most of the levels in this game are short, direct, and pretty easy overall. You can crank the difficulty up, but that often just leads to getting one-shot in ridiculous ways to the point of needlessly frustrating you at the end of a level. The enemies are primarily just cannon fodder, with visually generic armor and going from being decent in their damage resistance to outright absurd. Tell me, should a grunt magically absorb half a mag from an SMG point-blank before dying? On Normal?

By the time we clear things out and get to a standard, you see what the game is trying to set up: a death march. Make every action count. The characters are lacking in emphasis, they're abrupt while tossing words and """"""funny, quirky"""""" events at you to try and give a laugh. In the end, the dialogue just feels forced and phoned in compared to prior entries, with the aforementioned events just feeling shoehorned in with such a tactless approach that they feel more awkward than anything.

But, then we get to meeting the New York resistance, and speaking of lacking tact and subtlety, ho-lee PHUCC, is the intro cutscene bad. In light of events in the past couple of years, you have to tread as if walking through a minefield, so I'll just say this: if they made Grace's dialogue and ""personality"" with any less subtlety while making it painfully obvious, they might as well have just codenamed her VSD-1, the first virtue-signalling drone that you meet in this game. After seeing this, it's pretty clear when they began the wild swing to left field that would eventually spawn the abomination known as Youngblood.

The gameplay and design quality was lowered, but it was still fun. Then you get to the shoehorned political dogma, and it just kills it. When combined with the game freaking out over technical issues, a horde of crash reports, and continuous spam to buy the expansion when you start the game and get through the 30+ seconds of trigger warnings, it's just not worth it. Stick to New Order or Old Blood, skip this as <even without politics> it's more of the same but to a lesser degree, and don't even waste time with Youngblood.",1629648796,1629648796,False,10,0,0.550140917301177979,0,True,False,False

if i didn't know any better i would have guessed this game was made by a different developer. everything is pretty much worse. 

ill start with the gameplay first. gameplay and level design wise this game feels like a huge step back. everything felt more claustrophobic (im not sure if this is right word) and every time i got into a firefight i just wanted it to end quickly so i could just move on to the next section. in new order and old blood i would sometimes not stealth right off the bat in a new area because it was fun fighting and the weapons felt good to use, but in new colossus i tried to stealth every single time because i just didn't have fun when i got caught and the alarms went off. none of the weapons felt particularly satisfying to use either which is a huge negative in a fps. my favorite weapon was a heavy weapon that fired a laser beam so i couldnt carry it with me forever. also i get why you have 50 health for like half the game but i think this was a very poor choice.

characters/story wise... holy shit. like obviously if anyone has played new order or old blood you'll know shit is a little ridiculous. old blood had that giant final boss. in new order you went to the moon and hid in submarine missile and came out and hijacked a uboat. you know, ridiculous shit. new colossus breaks the ridiculous meter in a way that makes me feel like it was too much (although i will give it up. when i was about half way through the game i thought about dropping it but then something happens that made me think ""okay, this is dumb. but now i have to finish to see what the fuck happens now""). probably the biggest problem i have with the ridiculousness is anya (who is several months pregnant and is showing quite a bit) goes out on the field. you might be thinking, ""oh? that's your biggest problem and not the thing that happens in the middle of the game?"" the reason the anya business bugs me the most is the scene in the last mission. that was the like the cherry on top of it all and i just mentally checked out. 

i wanna talk about wyatt. apparently people did not like his change to like the hippy/drug tripper. i didn't either but if im being honest i didn't like him at all in new order. the reason i picked the wyatt timeline is because i feel it's the more canonical timeline. so while i do like fergus better, i feel personally if bj were to be a real he would have chose to save wyatt (but that's just me. i was also planning on playing this game a second time for fergus's timeline but i probably wont play this game ever again). the reason i wanted to talk about wyatt specifically is because i thought his speech at the end was incredible. his speech (almost) made it worth it to slog through this game, and for a second i forgot about the issues i had with it.

bug wise, i had an issue constantly when i would be crouching around and would get stuck in door ways. in the epilogue i had to reload my game so many times because i couldnt crouch and get through a section in the stands. there was also a part early in the game where i kept clipping through an elevator. i never had any big/constant issues with new order/old blood so this is upsetting to have so many issues with the third entry.

after playing this and seeing the reception of youngblood i hope machinegames can bounce back but i dont know.",1629614118,1629614118,False,1,0,0.499353080987930298,0,True,False,False

Right away, I was blown away by the graphical improvement and the fluidity of the game. The New Order was locked at 60fps, however I was able to easily reach 120fps at 4K max settings. It seems to be a new engine, which performed amazingly. Some of the things I really liked were the updated, yet familiar game designs, such as recharging your heavy weapons. The characters in this game were way more memorable and distinct to create their own impact on the story. Everyone was a useful addition and the voice acting was superb. I enjoyed the cutscenes before and after each level which gave the characters more room to shine and establish themselves. There were minor adjustments like the ui, and weapon selector which, although not as significant, still stood out as a good improvement to the series. Finally, the story this time felt much better, and had much more satirical moments which actually made me laugh out loud. Each level was memorable. I also really enjoyed how straightforward the game was with certain issues, and didn't shy away from topics like other games would. Having a main hub for the game was also a smart idea since it made sense in terms of the story, but also allowed the player to decide where they wanted to go or do in the universe. 

In terms of things I didn't like, my biggest gripe with this game was that each level felt WAY too short. You could rush through each level in only about 5 minutes just to trigger the cutscene and move on. Additionally, you did not even need to kill, or even fight the bosses. You could run away from them and exit the level while still under fire, and there were no consequences to this. It made the enemies seem pointless at times, which for the final boss, after continuing to die over and over, I finally just learned I could run pass the two big enemies and escape without even firing at them. Very anti-climactic for something which should have had a better pay off. Other than that, there were a few minor bugs in trying to climb through small spaces, but really that was the only issues I ran into. 

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this game, and would highly recommend it.

The good things are :
- Story
- Atmosphere
- Skippable cutscenes and etc.
- No Crashing issues for me and the game still runs good on PC's with lower specs (I have 8gb ram, Nvidia Geforce GTX 960 and intel Core i5 CPU. The game runs perfect on my PC. I can play it on Low Graphic Quality setting and I'm still very happy. For me is just important to play the game and to enjoy the game and graphic setting doesn't really matter. For me it doesn't matter If I can have Graphics on Low or Ultra and for me it's just more important to enjoy the game, enjoy the story and to have fun with the game I'm playing

The bad things are :
- There is no chapter select option in the main menu (In Wolfenstein The New order and The old blood there was an option that when you beat the game, you can just went to chapter select and finish all remaining side quest, collect all collectables and max all perks, but here if I want to do all that stuff and get the achievements I don't know how can I do it, because there isn't any option for chapter select)
- Cracking Enigma Codes (In Wolfenstein the new order , cracking Enigma codes was super easy. you just have to collect all Enigma codes, went into the main menu and crack them, but here you have to use the Enigma machines and play hard minigames to crack them.)
- Mein Leben difficulty (The only thing that is annoying about this difficulty is that this difficulty is permadeath difficulty. They should make a difficulty that is simmilar to uber difficulty in previous two Wolfenstein games games, because the uber difficulty was challenging , but is still enjoyable because you can save and you have checkpoints and in The New Order you can play Uber difficulty through 999 mode which makes it even more easier)",1628979945,1628979945,True,1,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

This one is okay... it feels a bit smaller, a bit less coherent as a story and a lot less focused in its design.

BUT compared to such a well crafted and well done game as the first one of course it's going to pale in comparison. On it's own it is pretty good fun to shoot nazis, pretty horrifying when the nazis you have yet to shoot are allowed to have their way with the world, and the interesting character moments you see along the way.

Though the weird health system you're saddled with at the start is quite frankly a major design flaw, as sometimes I found myself cranking the difficulty all the way down to the lowest level just so I could get past a section without dying over and over again.

Though it might be more flawed than it's predecessor, it still  is a quality peice of gaming that I cannot recomend enough... though with the qualifer that you should probally get the first one first.

DON'T BUY THE SEASON PASS OR DLCs, THEY ARE NOT WORTH IT!
Story wise, this suck and didn't show as much hype as the previous two. However, gameplay is some good shit.

SPOILER:
The story for me has too many plot holes, it wasn't as serious as the first one and in the end it doesn't deliver the hype or having ""the final big boss"" as the first two. In The New Order, we have a mini boss (which is either Wyatt or Fergus depending on you) that made us furious to kill Deathshead and in Old Blood, we still have the vibe from saving either Annette or Kessler and unveil the final goal of the villain, The New Colossus however didn't have that much of a strong taste.
About the gameplay though, it's an upgrade compared to the other two, it feels smooth even with graphic upgrades. It has few bugs, especially when you bind the key for rifle it usually swap with the SMG and this annoys me. 
And last, DLCs are trashes, both storywise and gameplay (some of the missions should be easier and some should be harder). 

Overall, worth to buy but not as a complete package.

Let's start with good stuff first:

- Visually games looks impressive, especially the lightning and particle effects. 
- Voice acting, motion work and cutscenes are fantastic.
- Gameplay is good, if you played the last 2 games, almost the same as before, but still satisfying (with minor issues tho)
- [spoiler] Hitler scene is just hillarious and amazing at the same time. That and courtroom/execution are highlights of the game [/spoiler]
- Few cutscenes and moments in the game which are dark and brutal, I won't spoil, but it's well done.

That's about it, now for the bad stuff:

- Writting. Absolutely terrible, characters are dumb, makes no sense in what they do, dialogue is sometimes cringy and bad. SJW's wet dream to put it correctly.
- Cutscenes. Yes, they are skippable (although not on hardest difficulty, which I still can't fathom why not), but it's a fucking Wolfenstein game! I mean, when compiled together it lasts for 3 hours!!! It took me around 8 hours to complete this game on Death Incarnate (second hardest diffuculty) and I skipped almost all cutscenes, and that's because of me dying over and over on some sections, so I assume this game takes around 5-6 hours to complete when skipping cutscenes. It's damn criminal to have that much cutscenes, especially in a game like this, this is not Metal Gear Solid or some shit...
- Some minor complaints: 
Weapon switching is slow, it should be a bit faster.
Movement over obstacles is janky and sometimes bad, I got stuck A LOT. For example, sometimes I couldn't walk up the stairs, I needed to jump on every step to go up, which is ridiculous. It's weird considering I had no issues at all with the last 2 games.
Game had decent amount of bugs too, cliping textures and all that stuff.
Graphics on highest settings looked weird sometimes, like plastic.
No chapter selection after you complete the game, which is absolutely insane and I don't get why they removed it, last 2 games had them and it was perfect. It just sucks if you are after achievements and you missed some, you need to replay the whole game again, which has some of the cutscenes that are in game and go on for 5+ minutes... Super annoying.
- Crashing. Now I don't know about others, this might be subjective, but what killed the game most for me was constant crashing, which was super frustrating and almost made me quit the game. I stopped to count after 10 times, but I would say easily over 20 times in my whole 25 hours of playthrough, game crashed. That immediatly turns me off to even attempt the Mein Leben difficulty (perma death + no saves + NO skip cutscenes). Imagine getting to the last boss and BOOM, game crashes. Fully up to date drivers, with beffy rig (2070 Super GPU), so no lacking on my part.

I got this game on Steam summer sale recently for 8,99€ and I still feel robbed honestly. I'll never support MG's games anymore, my experience was bad with this game, just because of the constant crashing alone. 
I still recommend it if you are fan of the series and want to experience it (and even then wait for sale, don't buy it for full price), but don't expect anything great as far as writting goes. For other folks, hard pass.

4/10 score.

Edit 8.8.2021:

So Steam summer sale came in and I bought a DLC, just to complete rest of the achievements. 
But first let's talk about Mein Leben run. I did it. After 8 attempts, I did it. It was mostly not that hard, honestly the hardest part is to endure through all the cutscenes... I mean first one takes around 10 minutes, you get a little gameplay and then after that again for the 5+ minutes... It's horrible and mind numbing stuff. WHY NOT ADD THE SKIP BUTTON?! I mean, at least give it for perma death run, for folks who will attempt this A LOT of times.
As for the difficulty itself, the most important thing is to hide in a spot where they can't get you from back and sides. Enemy AI is kinda dumb, but beware, if you allow them to shoot, you're gonna get fu**** most of the times, because they can melt you in half a second, no kidding. Some sections can even be skipped, luckily enemies despawn after you hit next triggers. But yeah, Venus for me was the hardest part, there's lot of tight and smaller areas with tons of enemies, mixed with the hard/big ones. Good luck if you attempt this, you'll need it!

As for the DLC, nothing special, ok at best. You have 3 chapters, each one having 3 volumes. Maybe up to 1 hour max is the duration of each chapter, some even less (stealth ones can be completed in minutes if you know the drill). You play as 3 different characters, that each have their unique abilities (breaking walls, moving through tight vents and the legs that make you taller). As I've said, nothing special, no new weapons or enemies, just basic linear campaign missions.
Aside 3 campaigns, there are sort of like challenges, basically parts of the campaigns, you get points for kills on various ways and you need to progress throught it, just like a mission.

Overall, nothing special, definitely NOT worth the full price, it's barely worth on discount tbh.",1594468695,1628497250,False,0,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

Is this in-game Nazi propaganda, you say? No, this is in-game fact. In other words, a game ostensibly about fighting Nazis is based around one of the oldest and most corrosive anti-Semitic tropes there is.

But the game doesn't stop at just simply being nakedly anti-Semitic. It's also openly racist. The game's central African American female character assumes a leadership role over your already-hierarchical ragtag band of fellows from the second you meet her. And why/how does she do this? Because of her great leadership abilities? No, she constantly denigrates and insults her subordinates. Her fierce fighting ability? No, she doesn't fight a single person in the game; delegating 100% of all fighting. So why does she immediately become leader? She assumes leadership simply because of the color of her skin, her gender, and her stereotypical bad attitude. Regardless of a person's skin color or gender, showing someone overcoming adversity, having unique skills, and bringing people together is how a leader is created. Making a character a leader with no journey there whatsoever simply to score woke brownie points is the epitome of bad writing.

The story is borderline incoherent and the characters are awful caricatures of what they were in the prior game with no real personalities, goals, or even shortcomings. On top of this, the plot is just flat-out horrible. You careen from map to map, with little rhyme or reason for how or why. This is clearly a game where they came up with a set of maps and then tried to (badly) shoehorn a story in after-the-fact. There is quite literally a part in the story where you meet Hitler, and for some reason are both forbidden from killing him both before and after the cut scene. You'd think GI Joe would be smart enough to realize maybe killing Hitler would be a more important target than finding whatever stupid document he was after. And let's not forget the abrupt and pointless ending after a mediocre boss battle.

And I haven't even touched on the gameplay yet. The game is extremely easy, with moronic enemy AI that will happily run directly into your line of sight to be mowed down over and over again. Though the game has a (weak) stealth mechanic, there's really no point to using it, as letting alarms go off is barely an inconvenience since mowing down the guards is so trivial anyway. 

The levels are 100% linear cake walks with no thought, strategy, or exploring required at any point. That's modern game design for you. I hope you like the look of ""generic Nazi bunker"" or ""destroyed city"", because these two archetypes are repeated over and over again for every single level in the game. The Venus level was the only remotely interesting level in this game, and even then it was claustrophobic, tiny, and linear as pretty much all the levels.

The devs were obviously acutely aware with how short this game is, so they attempted to pad it by giving you in-story missions back to *every single* previous level you've completed, plus tons of useless collectables which have no in-game purpose. Why does collecting Nazi gold have no in-game purpose? Why can't I use it to buy upgrades instead of finding poorly-hidden upgrade containers in every level? It's so frustratingly badly designed. 

By far the worst part of all this padding though, is that through the story most of the maps you've played through are supposed to have been destroyed by the time you're finished. So magically somehow being able to go back there as if nothing has changed ruins any shred of immersion this game was trying to establish. 

I sincerely hope the Wolfenstein franchise remains in stasis until a company that actually cares about making a good game with a good story and intriguing gameplay takes over again.",1628436931,1628436931,False,2,0,0.478801995515823364,0,True,False,False

+Pros+
- The game is a beauty and the art direction did a pretty amazing job. I've found the game slightly to dark in tones at some points, but it is probably the way I've set-up my Alpha.
- Same for audio, everything is sport on from menu interaction to voice over. they did a really, really impressive job.

-Cons-
Where to start.... 

From a general standpoint they really messed up the super strong base they add with new new order and old blood. That is probably one of the rare game I just rushed to the end past mid-game because of the pilling of inconsistencies, poor game design and rushed level design. 

- The combats really felt bland and unbalanced. You either smack opponents way to easily, or get smacked way to easily. Armoured opponents do way to much damage. So if you wanna go head on dualwielding, you need to wait to have a significant amount of upgrades on your weapons. If you want spot-on gunplay and variety, play Metro Exodus.
- Infiltration is not enjoyable due to the randomness of enemy detection, and you are anyway not provided with extra tooling nor level design really taking it into account... 
- Which leads me to the big NO of this game.
Rushed level design: yes Levels look good, as I stated above, art direction did a phenomenal job, but they play bad. Poor spatial indication an readability of the levels. I could be in a level and just don't naturally feel what to do next after cleaning a pile of foes. They really don't stand the comparison with New Order and Old Blood. You can feel as well the ""replayability"",  where levels keep this generic feel to allow for other activities. I don't like that, but it is just my personal taste.
- Game design is poor, in my opinion. They had really great things to build on, but instead they decided to cut corners. simplifying gunplay, and last but not least creating this absolutely awful narrative. God it is bad. 
- Great heroes and stories are developed by formidable Foes. Foes here are poorly build. As a secondary villain in New Order, Frau Engel had a really deep construction and substance. Here as a main Foe, she just doesn't stand the comparison with Strasse, she does not have this focused madness, this discipline in inhumanity. 
All the cutscenes, and god knows there is a ton of them, doesn't give you insight on character or their motivation really, but many excuses to be dicks and unlikable, that's for sure (hence why I rushed the second half after new York). I am not going to scratch deeper about Narrative anyway... Where you had a real deep sense of desperation and retribution In New Order, with the single purpose to remove the heart of Evil, you have here a single man army of Blasko surrounded by pretty much useless people that screams ""Revolution!"" and expect the world to follow them. 
Grace is the typical team manager you don't want to have at work: Bully, unapologetic, poor communicant, she just doesn't compare to Caroline. The badassery of Caroline was just second to Blasko. She could plan a mission, shoot hordes of N*** and drive back an helicopter with a broken spine. 
They made Bombate unlikable, unforgivable.
Seth is just a shadow of himself.
They are rude to Max. Like wtf.
Anya turned from operative nurse with a stong maternal symbolism to a pregnant commando with fucked up level of hormones... I mean come on! 
The cynicism and Irony of New Order gets replaced by situation comedy, the poo level one (Literally). It is tiring. You don't want to listen to characters, or whatever they want, you just want to get done with the game and uninstall it.",1628158215,1628178802,False,2,0,0.450924068689346313,0,True,False,False

I think it has some improvements over the original mainly that most of its cutscenes are left for the start or end of a level and that when the game does let you play it focuses on its main FPS mechanics rather than one off concepts.
However, its cutscenes are somehow even longer than the original and you never know if your going to get a short intro to the next level or are about to sit for 10/15 minutes on a small episode of a TV show. Especially near the end it gets up itself with excessively long cutscenes where it suddenly tries to be a comedy which just isnt what I came for and didnt enjoy.
The basic FPS mechanics lead to even more frustration than the original for me. Stealth really feels like an afterthought in terms of level/enemy layouts. There are a few neat additions such as a the tomahawk for more stealthy options but the stealth option is so often undermined by tomahawk throws or bullets just going missing. I set up a clear headshot on someone but something happens to the bullets on the trip so instead of someone dying quietly they start looking in my direction. 
When I did get to shooting it wasnt very good. The guns I thought felt worse than the original and it felt like you could take so few shots even on the middle difficulty. Sometimes it was fine but too often when I really want to go guns out I would walk into the area, immediately take two thirds of my health from one enemy and then have to start running around for health packs. Its really disappointing since The Old Blood was such a fun experience with a great balance of enough health to take advantage of the duel wield but also not so much you didnt have to consider your health.
I cannot recommend playing this. If you really wanted to see the story I think it would honestly be more fun to just watch the cutscenes.",1627831844,1627831844,False,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

Enjoyed the first two maps of the campaign until I got severe graphical glitches, falling outside of the map, getting stuck inside walls / objects etc. Google search indicates I'm not the only one and the only fix that works is reduce graphics settings to low and 640x480 resolution. Looks like crap now.

Seems to affect Geforce 970 and 1080 series of cards. Installing an older driver sorta works but it's still not right; textures flicker between high and low res and other issues. Glitches make this game unplayable so not impressed with it right now especially seem as it looks like there's no intention of fixing it seem as it only affects certain cards.

May try and struggle through on low settings / 640x480 but it kinda ruins it for me as at this low res any text is unreadable. Oh and it crashes as well albiet this only happened twice but not good seem as I'm early into the campaign.

Specs Core i7-4790K, 16Gb RAM, GTX970 4GB, Windows 10 home. Should be more than enough to handle this game on ultra settings and I'm not exactly blown away by the graphics.

Sick of the games lately that have been released in an unfinished condition.

Gun play is basically unchanged, as are the approaches to combat (a mix of stealth, tactics, and unmitigated aggression). Level design is solid; still plenty of reasons to explore (collectibles, secrets, upgrades, etc), but navigating isn't much of a challenge. There's also not as much variety to levels (or enemies) as you might first believe. If you just wanna bring death and destruction to the Nazi war machine, this will be your cup of tea.

The story on the other hand... That's something else. “Colossus”suffers from sequel syndrome. Rather then focus on tighter story, character growth, or world building, the focus is instead on revisiting the things that made the previous title great. Like the designers thoughts, which include no awareness of terms like 'gratuitous', went along these lines:

'Can't add too much new stuff. New stuff is untested and might result in diminished sales due to buyer uncertainty. So... make things flashier. Bigger. Current social issues must be inserted wherever possible (regardless of whether or not they actually add any poignancy or depth to the story or characters affected). Awareness/visibility/profile is good, right? Preachy without relevant context isn't cheap, right? You know what? Somehow, let's find a way to add even more blood. To EVERYTHING. 'Cause more blood is more cool, right? RIGHT?! Oh, and add some b**bs. Why? WHY?! THERE IS NO WHY. JUST DO IT! AND COVER THEM WITH BLOOD!!' 

Many plot points, characters, set pieces, and twists/developments were dialed up to 11. “Order,” while ludicrously over the top, still managed a relatively cogent narrative structure. Sure, BJ went to the moon in order to deliver his borderline farcical levels of violent deliverance. Yes, that was pretty outlandish, literally and figuratively. It may have strained the bounds of credulity but, and I can't believe I'm about to make this distinction, the lunar base mission was still logically consistent with the shenanigans “Order” establishes in terms of both flavor and scale for its mythology. 

“Colossus,” however, never finds a way to stick that landing. Going to Venus felt as superfluous and unnecessary as most of the blood in the game is overly gratuitous. It happens simply because it can. Sure, what happens on Venus is humorous, gratifying, and memorable, but it doesn't resonate the same way as the lunar base. There's no tongue-in-cheek, 'ah, of course' moment. BJ goes to Venus only because he'd been to the moon in the previous game, so the new game needs a space mission, as well. Then the designers said, 'well, something absolutely huge needs to happen here,' so having the biggest bad guy of all show up in that level became a given. But not because it made sense. In fact, it had to happen because it didn't make sense. No one would see it coming, so everyone would be surprised. The only real storytelling here was to frame the scene as a film audition.

Honestly, it could have worked. But rather than a message about the universal pervasiveness of impostor syndrome, or the importance of taking a stand against intolerance, or why it's incumbent on every individual to never give up... we get none of those things. We don't even get an exploration of the notion of a scene in the game, which can no doubt be played out a different way, resembling a scene in a film, which can no doubt be played out in a different way. Instead, we get nothing of consequence. Because even if the writers were trying to say all, or any, of those things, it was more important to focus on crazy bad guy doing crazy bad guy things. Don't get the point across, maybe even with a little artistry. No. Make it about all the blood crazy guy caused. And his vomit. What could have been a clever, profound statement instead fell utterly, terrifically flat. So much promise that ends up so... squandered.

Yeah, I'm salty about it. Here was a chance to say some serious things about some serious problems. Perhaps it stings so badly because of how good it could have been.

Definitely one thumb up, but I don't know how to score it numerically. As a tactical FPS, it's at least a 7, maybe an 8. Graphics are an 8. Story, though? That's a 6... maybe a 7. Expect your enthusiasm for the game to end with the campaign and you are less likely to be disappointed. While there is a lot of additional content, in the form of assassination missions, DLC, etc, I'm not convinced it's a good investment of time.

Game play is not fun. Unpolished game, multiple bugs and some questionable design choices keep wearing your enjoyment for the game the longer you play.

When i first started the game, it bugged and throw me into the Engel head chopping cut scene hence i never played the wheel chair part. You can even check my achievement to see that I finished the game but never unlocked the fergus vs wyatt decision in first chapter.

Lighting in this game is atrocious. Either you barely see anything in the darkness or you get blinded by any light source: 1 simple light, your own muzzle flash, etc. Hell there are some level the devs think its not enough an they make the enemy use spotlight directly to shine your face.

The game is a wolfenstein game with dual wield mechanic, you would think dev designed this game for you  to run and gun blasting nazi. Your ms is fast. Enemy is quiet spongy. HP/armor/ammo scattering around the map.
However, they also made the enemy to be some kind of sharpshooter division in nazi army. They have deadly accuracy and the reaction time that makes you feel like you are playing PvP fps CSGO, Cod, Battlefield. The best way for you to survive is to hide and peek out to shoot enemy. But then your weapons have really bad spread at distance. Best you can do is tapping or burst with your assault rifle.
And because of that, its so hard to use any other fun guns because you will die so quickly. Heavy guns are also out of the question because you are slowed when you use it. and the 1s or 1.5s spin up time to shoot is enough for enemy to burst you down.

Damage indicator is really badly designed. No low hp indicator. 
No actual boss fight. The so called last boss fight of the game is stupid. They just put tough enemy into the closed area, double it so you fight 2 of them at the same time. Add more common soldier to sneak around and flank you to make it hard. 
Why is it hard? because while you using heavy gun to fight the boss, common soldier just sneak around and burst you twice to kill you. Shoot them with the heavy gun? You are at disadvantaged because heavy gun are slow and not too accurate for that, or its explosive and you also blast yourself. Switch to another gun? The switching speed is slow af and the weapon switching system is horrible in the first place.
 The ""boss"" itself, you fight by hitting it until you break the first layer of armor. Then you keep shooting until it dies. The same way you fight a MMO boss with health bar. Hit it till it dies. Very cool.

Maze liked levels with no minimap, no clear indicator of objective. Lots of time spending on finding the right way or the prompt to advance the story.

First part of the game sucks hard. It is stupidly hard because you are handicapped with 50 HP only. Also your main character, BJ is now a depressing, whining guy in grief. Levels are so uninspired. You run a maze, find the prompt to go to cut scene and then get thrown into another corridor to find your way.
The game only get better at 2nd half when you get more tools to play with. Sometimes it reminds you of Dishonored franchise when you get to pick the upgrade and have multiple ways to approach the level ( Dishonored dev is Arkane studio also worked on Wolf 2). But then its just half ass and never get fleshed out. They mostly just replace a corridor with new way for you to use upgrade. It doesnt really change the game much.

Very disappointing game. Worse than TNO for sure.

Pros:

1) Great art-design for the characters and the world. Diesel-punk is a unique aesthetic that we don't see used very often.

2) The story is crazy, over-the-top and cheesy; and i love every single part of the tale this game tells.

3) Graphics are great; the light effects and sparks that fly as you tear your way through Nazis look fantastic.

Cons:

1) Wolfenstein 2 really suffers from an identity crisis. It gives you a fast character, and heavy, bombastic guns, but then expects you to play carefully, hiding behind cover wherever you can. The sheer speed with which a full stack of armour and health melts away from your body makes no sense at all.

2) The level design, especially when compared to the previous two entries in the franchise, is quite poor. There are several places where collision issues happen and you character will get inexplicably stuck, forcing you to flail around frantically as you try to set him free.

3) Switching between weapons (using a keyboard and mouse) feels clunky and sluggish. Weapon switching animation is slow and out of place, often forcing you to run and hide, just to switch weapons before emerging again.",1627122182,1627122182,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The sin of all sequels.

When the first game came out, it presented us with a horizon. A wide and daunting vista of a world where Hitler won. Yes, there are some characters striving in this world, but their main quality is just that – strife. How exactly do they return the pressure this ideological apocalypse weighs on them with? When pani Oliwa from the first game says: “No more resistance, the Nazis rule everything”, it sounds final and hopeless. It’s this finality, this apocalyptic hopelessness and the unlikely battle against it that lured people in.

Aaaand now we’re focusing on the characters. BJ? He’s not just a hillbilly dreaming of a never-to-happen barbeque on his own back lawn. He’s a complex character now. Firstly, he’s a Jew because his mother is a Jew. Okay. There was a tell in the first game, so fine. Also, his father is a bigoted antisemitic arschhole. Okay. Also, he’s got Oedipus. Okay. Because of the combination of the previous two factors. Oh…

So, yeah, credit where credit is due: [i]New Colossus[/i] doesn’t just focus on characters for characters’ sake. Instead, it presents us with a new vista. A vista of America where all of its most chauvinistic tendencies have been not only left alone, but cultivated. Thing is… It’s a boring vista. A world ruled by Nazis is a fear many people can get behind. A world full of bigotry is just reality. This focus on specifically American societal birth traumas instead of the world overview limits the sight of the player. Plus, some of the threads connecting the characters and the society are liable to transform into something else entirely. Take BJ’s father, for instance. His last name is Blazkowitcz. And seeing how William speaks a bit of Polish in the first game, we come to the conclusion that his father can’t really be taken as a classical bigoted American redneck. Especially when you consider the history of Polish nationalism and anti-Semitism (not trying to be antagonistic here, Russia has a lot of same stuff).  Indeed, Joseph Conrad became who he became just to escape his Polish nationalist father and his fight against imperial Russia. Truly, seems that children of Polish nationalists make great New People. Only none of this has anything to really do with America. But do the writers of [i]New Colossus[/i] realize that?

And New People our people are. Where in the first game the Resistance cell felt like dregs of society, the best we could muster, now we wear our eccentricities on our sleeve. Hippie shirts. LSD. Flowery patterns for decoration. It is all fine,but... The hopelessness is gone. We feel like the odds are at the very least equal. 

And then there's the character creep… Some people die, but many show up and… Don’t do too much. Half of them are just quirky and comedic, brought simply for a memorable image, and the other half are Angela Davis. Would be more peculiar if they put Malcolm X in instead. But he would probably refuse to cooperate with BJ in the first place.

Really, bringing historical figures to such game is… Not a good call. It primitivizes them. Yes, I understand, new [i]Wolfensteins[/i] are camp. But they’re only part camp. The other part is quite serious, and in this game it’s a lot more serious than in the previous one. There’s actually some message here. And when in a single scene you see [spoiler]the Führer[/spoiler] a)puke b)piss c)mistake [spoiler]Leni Riefenstahl[/spoiler] for his mother d)shoot three people e)curl up like a ball on the carpet… The message kinda becomes redundant. There’s no way a player can imagine he has any capacity to become like this man one day. Some people are just evil and deranged. A message for the ages.

And even on the level of characters the game kind of falls flat, because the conflict is no longer as sharp. In the first game everything hinged on Deathshead. So much so he was on every loading screen, BJ and him had William-Wilhelm chemistry, and their face models were somewhat reminiscent of each other. They try to do something like that here too, but eventually fail, because here the antagonist is just a high-seated goon, and not a shot-caller. Plus, the game can’t quite make up its mind whether the worst thing are the Nazis or the American bigotry.

On the bright side, the direction – both of design in general and of cutscenes just skyrocketed. Extremely well done. Also: stealth is better and enemy variety is a bit wider.

Critics loved this game’s story. Hope they enjoyed [i]Youngblood[/i] which has all the same tendencies, but in a more terminal stage and with smaller budget and poorer cutscenes.

Before I go, just a few short technical questions about the gameplay. Nothing too important.

Why the #$%@ can I simultaneously sprint and reload?
Why the #$%@ do I move as fast while dual-wielding as when I’m not?
Why the #$%@ leaning up and down has been tampered with?
Why the #$%@ in some arena battles do enemies spawn in when there are no commanders?
Why the #$%@ do I have to be surgically precise to pick up a piece of armor or a medkit when bullets are flying?
Did anybody bother to #$%@&*^ test the courtroom battle on higher difficulties?
What’s the #$%@&*^ point of augments from the second half of the game?
Why the #$%@ are there no boss battles?

That’s it. Hope they’ll find the budget and a multiverse loophole out of [i]Youngblood[/i], seeing how [i]Man in the High Castle[/i] tradition allows for it.",1626978077,1627026665,False,62,3,0.575229763984680176,6,True,False,False

I think the developers were a little too inspired by Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds, Kill Bill films, because the influence clearly is shown in the game. I wonder what would Tarantino say about the game after playing.

The story's good, though not as good as the New Order, but it made me laugh at few scenes. Irene Engel is a totally sick villain. Haven't encountered this type of female villain in games, in a long time. She's a total b**ch, and she's takes real pride being that way. 

Blazkowicz feels a lot more fleshed out than the New Order. The moments spent with Anya and the interactions Grace shows he's too a human.

Game is well optimised and on my G4560+ GTX 1050 Ti combination, the game runs at rock solid 60 fps. Kudos to machine games there.

New Colossus has a great story, that builds on the events of Wolfenstein New Order. I personally prefer New Order, but New Colossus is very good too. I would describe the story as an emotional rollercoaster.

You know a game is really well done when it gets you to hate an invented character with your whole soul. This woman, fucking Frau Engel, is horrible. And you meet her for the third time. She was in every single game of this series. But all the other characters are well done. They are unique, have their own stories and most of them are interesting and essential.

The detail in this game is amazing. I probably spent about 20 minutes just walking around the submarine base to check out every corner because it was really well done. So many easter eggs, documents and that design… wow. So good. Also, the city of rosewood was incredibly well done and I appreciated every minute spent there. There are even well designed “movie posters” around the map. You can see that they spent time and effort to design even such small things as invented Nazi movie posters. Small details, that most players won’t even notice.

Wolfenstein New Colossus is a futuristic sci-fi shooter, with lots of action. Nevertheless, a quick disclaimer: This game is not for people that are new to video games. I honestly often had to follow my gamer instinct to find the right way or were to go. This is mostly due to the fact that some of the maps are quite big and not necessarily linear. I managed to find the way without further difficulties every time, but if you are a noobie to video games, you might have difficulties. Keep that in mind.

The graphics are great and obviously better than in the older parts. Also, the soundtrack is good and fits perfectly to the scenes.

This game felt somewhat different but in a good way. The characters had even more spunk and character. Some people complained about the characters...Let's be clear, the world has ended, all hope is lost, you and your team are attempting a revolution, so I expect there to be some drama. 

There are plenty of perks to choose from as usual. 

The guns were fun to use and I found myself plowing through most enemies with the triple shot on the shockhammer--there is something satisfying about using dual wield shockhammers to obliterate the nazi opposition. 

There are some side quests that you can take on, along with the enigma codes to headhunt commanding Nazi officers.

612880,95867979,76561198314455351,0,1,961,0,961,1626472379,"Before playing this game, many of the reviews I'd read led me to believe it was a lukewarm, slightly-above-average shooter with fun gameplay. Having now completed the game, I could not disagree more with those assessments. It is so much better and so much more than what I was expecting. 

This is a fascinating game - it has starkly memorable characters that exchange well-written and interesting dialogue, fun and slick gameplay, an extremely lived-in world chock full of thoughtfully placed details, a consistent tone tastefully punctuated with story detours both humorous and dark, and a surprising amount of tenderness. More than anything, this game has a story that was clearly crafted by writers who genuinely love these characters and want you to love them too. 

At first blush, ""A New Colossus"" may seem like a superficially dumb meathead shoot-em-up. However, anyone who has played its predecessor, ""A New Order"", might correctly expect some surprising layers underneath the adrenaline-filled action. The story is poignant and self-aware, and invites you to explore a myriad of themes and ideas. Like other great games, ""The New Colossus"" doesn't just hand you everything that the devs prepared for you. It doesn't cram every poignant character interaction down your throat - if you want a lean, short experience that only focuses on blowing up Nazis with no reflection, then you can have that. But there are *so* many interesting moments, waiting patiently for you to discover and engage with. 

The central ""hub world"" of the game isn't just pretty to look at - it is full of scripted interactions that are *worth* witnessing. One of my favorite moments of the game was a tender, quiet moment between two relatively minor named NPCs in the hub world. It wasn't just dialogue between two static characters, either - it involved one NPC standing up, taking the other by the hand, and walking them across the ship to show them something. And all of that was just a moment in the ship, entirely independent of the protagonist's participation. 

The story progresses at a steady clip, and takes place in a variety of locations. Personally, I think the writing team knew when to be lean and concise, and when to slow down to allow the player to really take in certain story beats. There are a few fascinating, stand-out moments and missions that really feel inspired and unique. Some of the most memorable are quiet interludes involving Blascowicz's past, and one in particular I will remember for a long while. 

Tonally, the game shares a lot of DNA with ""The New Order"". William ""BJ"" Blascowicz's heavy, thousand-yard-stare in-game narration makes a return, and establishes a mainline mood that is weary, war-torn, and depressed. That central tone, however, is often deviated from - this is much less of a war campaign than ""The New Order"". Other characters bring colorful personalities and joy into the story, and you can almost feel the effect they have on elevating Blascowicz's own spirits and mood. 

I think that overall, it creates a consistent mood: the characters are shining beacons of hope that live in a terrible world, where the worst of the worst wield absolute authority. Though they all have different and well-realized personalities, the main cast of allied characters do share one trait: they have a molar-grinding determination and discipline not to give in to the seeming hopelessness of their situation. They choose to fight and resist, and all without becoming grizzled piss-and-vinegar caricatures of resistance fighters. Your band of rebels aren't all tropey ""insert badass with five o'clock shadow"" characters. Instead, the rebels you meet include a pregnant woman, academics, musicians, etc. They're people first, rebels second. 

Naturally, it is often said that stories like these are only as good as their villains. Luckily, a deliciously detestable villain stars opposite the heroes in this game. Irene Engel was one of the more memorable characters in ""A New Order"" and her return as the primary antagonist of this game works to great effect. She is formidable, incredibly hateable, and commands a chilling presence both in and outside her scenes in the game. I think she is a stronger villain than the series' preceding main antagonist, General Deathshead. 

I could say more about how surprisingly good I felt the characters and writing were, but I'll just sum it up by reiterating this: I think that the writers are talented craftspeople who genuinely love these characters, poured passion and talent into creating them, and are inviting you to love these characters too. I cared way more than I thought I would. 

The gameplay is very engaging. The guns are crisp, loud, and each has a distinct use and personality. The gun upgrades and customization can also actually significantly impact play, as well - instead of leaning into the assault rifle's capabilities as a full-auto weapon of destruction, I slapped a precision scope on each of mine and ran around duel wielding them in single fire (the scope changes the reticle even when not ADS). Enemy types feel varied and dangerous, and also just look really good. The weapon design, enemy design, and general environments are all aesthetically interesting (or at least I thought they were). 

I feel like overall, this game was created with a very cogent, consistent vision. It wasn't designed to maximize milking your money. To use an incredibly overrused cliche (but one that I think fits), it feels like this game was made with love by a team that was genuinely passionate about bringing their vision of these characters and their struggles to life. 

I strongly recommend. Would definitely step into Terror-Billy's shoes again to bash Nazis and feel a surprising amount of fondness for him and his found family of misfits.",1626475486,1626476232,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The story is just pretty bad in this Wolfenstein. I absolutely loved the other two, The New Order and The Old Blood. There was so much virtue signaling that was super lame. Really ruined a lot of the game for me.

Stuff I liked about the game:
-The shooting mechanics, they are very good in all the Wolfenstein games
-Some of the level design was pretty creative
-The voice acting was pretty good for the most part
-There were some good weapons and they were fun to use, although wish there would have been a few more
-I really like how there are two story lines like in The New Order, that is awesome

Stuff I didnt like about the game:
-The virtue signaling, probably the worst part of the game
-The starting and pause menus are so blank and boring compared to the other two games, literally just a white screen with black text, couldnt have put at least a tiny bit of work into it? Kinda lame.
-Same with the Item icons that appear on screen, blank and boring
-BJ, (and most NPCs) look way worse in this game, i didnt like how they looked at all, their teeth and eyes were awful
-The beginning level you start off in a wheel chair, was pretty boring they should have made some sort of short normal level before that, I didnt like the wheelchair level one bit.
-Anya also looks awful, Same with Wyatt
-A couple of the soldiers didnt even have German accents or anything, though it was only like 2
-Music not as good as the other two games
-BJ is ALWAYS talking about Caraline that got really old really fast
-The resistance in the game, is just a bunch of hipsters, kind of stupid
-99 percent of the characters in the game are totally unlikable
-Couple of references to BJ that he totally would not have gotten
-A lot of man hating, which is weird for a game that mostly men are going to play
-They like try to make this game a love story, which is just pretty awful for Wolfenstein
-Stupid tasks between missions
-Ridiculous plot holes
-The HORRIBLE song cover at the end, WHY couldnt you just get the original song? lol

If there wasnt so much virtue signaling, and more like-able characters, and less plot holes I would recommend this game, but how it is, I cant. Only get it on sale if you have already played the other two games, and just want more Wolfenstein to play, but dont expect it to be as good as the other two.

The writing for the slapstick humor and build up towards the final entry of the trilogy is just fantastic. Gunplay plays very smooth and there is alot to do after the main campaign, the only downside I would call out is the lack of boss fights which are missing in comparison with Wolfenstein: TNO but in the end it wasn't necessary persay. The highest difficulty ""I am death incarnate!"" is just the way it's meant to be played, it's balanced very fair and you'll only get killed due to your own mistakes.

The gameplay is great, even better than the last one thanks to weapon upgrades and contraptions. But gameplay can only do so much to make up for bad writing, and that's why I wouldn't recommend this game.

*spoilers ahead*

It's stated in this game that with the death of Deathshead, the nazi's R&D is crippled. Yet every weapon and enemy is bigger, badder, and more advanced than ever. Despite it only being 5 months after TNO, nearly every design for enemies, weapons, and environments has all changed. My biggest gripe is with the U-Boat. It tripled in size since TNO and it has a secret section with a single hidden entrance that seems to take up half the ship. It's also where all of the nuclear warheads are found, apparently, and yet for 5 months not a single person wondered why they couldn't find any more nukes.

Moving on, the Ubercommando missions have no impact on the story whatsoever, and the ending is so abrupt it feels like a large chunk of the game is missing. There's an artifact BJ gives to Set that makes him go nuts on 3 occasions, and that goes absolutely nowhere. One mission is basically a copy of the Moon mission from TNO. Just lots of dead ends, weird, awkward, and uninteresting characters, a boring story, etc etc.

The gameplay is actually pretty good, something interesting i haven't seen in other games, but it can get a little bit janky in higher difficulty cause they just throw you 19384507143802 enemies and its just repetitive and tedious at some points.
Story is good, i actually found it pretty interesting, the script is ok and i think GmanLives really exaggerated with the: This game has some of the worst written lines ever. Which is not actually true, yeah it has some pretty bad and cringy lines but nothing really important.

Perhaps the biggest reason are the advanced visuals and very high contrast, which often make enemies and objects difficult to spot (not in the good-difficult way, but in the unnecessary-annoying way). However, the combat is still by and large enjoyable, with reasonably well-balanced mechanics and decent weaponry (aside from the questionable decision to remove the option to toggle aiming down sights).

What truly convinced me to this game though, is the absolutely brilliant production throughout. From world design, through dialogues and lip sync, all the way to cut-scenes, the game is very immersive, and made me enjoy the experience of playing it tremendously, even if I didn't enjoy the combat itself as much as in TNO. Some of the cut-scenes were really long, but they were so well-produced that they felt like genuine scenes from a movie! I think they worked perfectly in combination with the gameplay though; thankfully they didn't go overboard and make it into a full-blown movie.

And a final shout-out goes to performance optimisation, which is maybe the best I've seen. Despite the game looking fucking gorgeous, I got stable 160+ fps on max settings and 1080p on a GTX 1070. I genuinely can't remember a game where I'd get such high and stable fps throughout, let alone such a modern one.

When it comes to the DLC (The Freedom Chronicles), I think a lot of the criticism is deserved, as they don't really add anything new to the experience, other than a little more volume. And, given the length (3-4h if you're rushing, 8-9h completionist), it's certainly not worth its full price. I don't think there's anything terrible about it as such, but the levels are pretty repetitive in terms of enemies and loot, the stories are rather bland, and there are no new mechanics whatsoever. Despite that though, the stories were a reasonable amount of fun to play through, as they mostly maintained the still solid combat experience of the main game.",1626213257,1626213361,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gunplay is smooth and fast-paced, but frustrating in parts. There are places where you have to make split-second decisions based on things you won't know until you've died at least once. People praise the level design, but it leads to some trial-and-error gameplay, because a good stealth level isn't a good arena and vice versa. You can now dual-wield two different types of guns, but the dual weapons wheel is so clunky I didn't want to risk using it in combat. Even for switching single weapons. So that was one step forward, two steps backwards. There are lots of new weapons, but they have so much functional overlap that there's no reason to switch unless you run out of ammo or need a silencer. And in place of the second half of the story, we get a bunch of sidequests on reused maps. Between the unnecessary upgrade system, the grindy perk system, and the hub world with side-quest filler, I felt like I was playing a Ubisoft game. Ugh.

The story was... interesting. The New Order ended on a low note, so continuing from there felt a bit forced. The tone is inconsistent and keeps the more serious moments from really landing. It's also short, but I was either bored or frustrated most of the time, so I wasn't disappointed to reach the end earlier than I expected. There are too many new characters in too short a story, so I never got attached. MG really tried to weave together a narrative from the dangling threads of the last game, but Order wasn't written with a sequel in mind, and there just weren't enough loose ends to work with. A lot of the major plot points in Colossus are recycled from Order, but dialed up to twelve (Order was already at eleven.) What *is* new feels as contrived as the intro, and there's no tension when people you don't care about die and resurrect at the writer's convenience. Colossus paradoxically lowers the stakes as the scale grandiosifies.

TNC's biggest problem is that it's a sequel that no one needed. It doesn't have anything new to say and it could only top its predecessor by increasing the scale and lowering the emotional stakes. But while it's unnecessary, it's competently made and might appeal to fans of DOOM '16. Just don't go into it expecting a sequel to Wolfenstein: The New Order.

Side note: some of the voice acting was pretty bad. I caught the schizophrenic French bartender pronouncing voiced initial ""TH"" as ""D"", ""Z"", and correctly as ""TH"", all in one sentence. I'm thinking that VA has never even met a French person. A bit disappointing, considering the first game used native speakers for the voice roles.",1626163078,1626163078,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game had potential, but falls short of the New Order in a few ways.

-environment design. At a few points in the game I had difficulty in telling where to go or what to do. This could have been abated by clever coloring and texturing, but most of the palate is just some variation of dark and or grey. This makes it difficult to tell where enemies are, since they also blend into the environment since they use the same color palate

-general handling. the dual wielding is a bit clunky, and for some reason only your right weapons gets reloaded, which really messed up the flow of combat. It is also very time consuming to switch out of dual wielding to another dual or single weapon. The stealth system also needed some flushing out, as enemies can see you when peaking around corners, for example.

-overall structure. BJ spends the first half of the game partially crippled (hilarious early part rolling around in a wheelchair shooting Nazis though), but the first half of the game throws too much at you to justify this half health restriction it imposes and just is frustrating after a while.

-confusing rules for the player. Maybe this is because I have been playing Doom Eternal, but I just can't figure out what the game wanted the players to do. Should I be running and gunning around to pick up health packs or hiding around a corner to funnel the enemies into a killzone? It does not help that enemies seem to appear out of nowhere behind you, and you end up dying quite quickly.

-overall balance. I found the heavy weapons dropped by supersoldaten mostly useless by the end. dual wielding certain upgraded standard weapons offered far better odds, compared to the movement restriction imposed by the heavy weapons, especially because BJ seems so fragile in this game. Just an indication that the individual parts of this game were not put together very well in the end.

Like I said at the beginning. It is worth 10 bucks and a single play through, but I do not see much beyond that. It definitely has some of the charm that the New Order had, but it seems to be trying to take things too seriously in some places.",1626060331,1626060331,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are great things and not so great things about this game that make it a solid 85/100 for me.

The most appealing factor to this game for people is undoubtedly its unique take on Alternate WWII history mixed together with phenomenal gunplay. 

Let's get to the important stuff before the more nit-picky details that I had problems with..

How is the Gunplay/Core Gameplay?

The most obvious feature this game has is its emphasis on intense close quarters engagements, however there is another side to this coin. You can approach combat in any way you want, or not at all in some situations.
The rpg elements this game has are progressed in accordance with what weapons you use, or how you take down Nazis. There is no overall leveling system that you expend points earned on perks. Instead, the devs used a more hands-off system to enact their rpg perk elements, which I appreciate. We know this game is first and foremost a shooter, the hands-off ""unlock as you use system"" is refreshing over an outright RPG leveling system and in my eyes keeps the action-shooter in the front supported by a serviceable perk system that add the appropriate amount of depth to the gameplay. 

Further in to the game you unlock a ""new suit"" that adds little to the actual gameplay other than, I guess, roleplay purposes? This mechanic being added in about midway through the game is purely optional to use in actual gameplay and, in my eyes, is a wasted opportunity to have a more fleshed out system than what it is.. a gimmick.

You are presented with a choice of three suits all three clearly having distinct playstyles in mind. Guns blazing, stealth, and tactical. 
Something about this system just seems so unnecessary, you can do everything in this game without the mechanic better. It feels bloated and a square piece for a circle hole. This requires further explanation.

The first one is a ram ability that activates when you sprint. okay, but what if you play on higher difficulties to where you die in five shots with max health and armor? The mechanic is negated.

The second is a compression vest for your torso allowing you to fit in smaller spaces for a limited time before dying from oxygen loss. The thing is these smaller compression zones are few and far inbetween and seem to be where the enemy is patrolling. Okay so you take an extra couple of minutes to get behind the guard and stab him from behind rather than just peek a corner and pop him in the head once with your suppressed pistol which is much faster. Its negated. There are far more efficient ways to play this game without the risk of 10 guards seeing you try and maneuver to shank this guy from behind. Defeating the purpose.

The third are these long legs, similar to stilts. I play my games on the highest difficulty I can. The reason I do this is two fold. The first reason is that it creates much more satisfying gameplay moments. The second is that it forces you to maximize efficiency and use every system the game offers to achieve your goal, experiencing everything the game has to offer. The purpose of these long legs is that you can get a more ""tactical"" view of the area. I get the idea, you can peek over tall cover and smoke a bunch of Nazis from above right? Wrong. You're dead in five shots, and the Nazi scum has Annie Oakley accuracy up close. Negated. Before you can fire a couple of shots you're swarmed because your position is exposed and the enemies fire on sight, duh.

Overall, I think the gunfights, the stealth and even the gun niches are enjoyable. The best part of the game hands down. Some gun/grenade upgrades are useless and very situational and some are so important that you almost are forced to take them. It really does suck to not see such a balanced gun upgrade system. Because it should add, not just be there and be forgotten about.

So, what does all this really mean? It means there are great aspects to this game and there are super forgettable ones as well.
Moving on..

How's this game sound?

It sounds brilliant. This game's combat music takes inspiration from Doom's phenomenal soundtrack as well as elements from The New Order, which in my opinion is slept on. 
Guns sound punchy and the impact of weapons sound gory and brutal. Grenades are generic grenade explosion sounds with nothing of note. The laser weapons are distinctive, effective, and the sound of disintegrating Nazis is always satisfying. The heavy weapons sound and feel so good you'll wanna slow yourself down on purpose just to drag them around. Love em. The sound of the world around, the ambiance, is calming compared to the brutalistic nature of this game. A nice dichotomy that I think highlights the absurdity and perversion of nature that is the Nazi ideology. Maybe I'm reading too much into it who knows.

How are the Levels?

While I think the New Order's level design is superior to this installment, I do still like it. Most environments are open enough for you to have tactical leeway without it feeling you're on rails. And some times you do. Some chapters feel like you're doing nothing but going room to room clearing Nazis just to do an action that opens a new area, then clear more rooms. This was revolutionary 25 years ago. It is not now in current year. However; the weapons and intensity of the firefights keep you engaged and all that feeling doesn't wash over until you're looking around for collectibles in each area. It really does feel like a cage match at times, albeit a fun one. 

What's the world like? How about the lore? Is the Story any good?

The World of New Colossus is far more fleshed out than the New Order and adds to the already great ambiance and setting of the series. Finding all the collectibles reveals a lot about the world that didn't make it into the dialogue/cutscenes of the game. The world building is obviously fantasy as to how the Nazis won WWII with them essentially stealing technology from a secret society and using it for their own gains. This game really does hammer in the point that Nazis are evil by the way, and that you are the underdog good guys. I agree Nazi man bad. HOWEVER; a lot of people don't understand that historically the Nazis drafted people against their own free will into their war machine, and I'll bet my bottom dollar a lot of germans didn't agree with Nazi propaganda. Watch interviews of german veterans of the war and citizens. To paint the picture that every single soldier of the Reich is nothing but a mindless drone takes away, rather than adds. I remember a cutscene from the New Order about the horrors of war BJ was discussing with Bombate. If the game wants to blatantly talk about the ""horrors of war"" then at least mention in a cutscene rather than a discarded letter that those soldiers were boys drafted by a monster to do the bidding of an empire they didn't believe in. The world is more than just 2Dimentional boogeymen who kill anyone they don't like at any given time of the day. Shallow to say the least.

Overall, I think the story is next to derailed by obvious token characters whose personalities are entitlement, greed, and outright narcissism. The comedic relief characters are there to service the token characters and it really is insulting to the legacy characters we had in the original. I do not want a lecture when playing my games whether I agree with the agenda or not. Almost ruined the game for me because I have so much love for Fergus, Anya, BJ, Max, Bombate, and Caroline.. most of these characters are dragged through the mud for no reason other than servicing these new token characters. 

The story is in the end satisfying because for me its about the journey, not the destination. 

Lasty how does this game look and run?
To run this game at 60 FPS on Medium settings you're looking at a decent rig..
I play max settings and the game looks great! Beautiful to look at truly.

Combat is satisfying. Contains less of a focus on ""Jewish Magic"" than the last game. New characters are pretty much all racial stereotypes, but for a game which's can be entirely summed up in ""kill Nazis"" i guess that's fine; not really going to character depth.

My two major complaint are: that the game ended suddenly, and without any real resolution to any of the plot points or a ""final boss"". And that i wanted to see more of Nazi occupied America.

I personally enjoyed playing this game a lot! The soundtrack was amazing, and the gunplay is so much better. The guns sound and feel great to use, and close quarter takedowns are very satisfying (although, it does suck that you can still take damage when you’re performing one, making it not worth doing on higher difficulties). 

The difficulty in this game is alot different from what it used to be back in the prequels, TNC/TOB. [b] I AM DEATH INCARNATE! [/b]from those games are more in line with [b] I Am Terror Billy [/b] than with the one in this game. You die REALLY fast, and are forced into playing stealthy, which sucks, because the gunplay is so good in this game. If it gets difficult for you, I recommend lowering the difficulty. I started on [b] Terror Billy [/b], and went down to [b] Do or Die! [/b]. Play with what you’re most comfortable with.

gripes: 
Played on I am death incarnate, the difficulty felt at times incredibly luck-based - like getting randomly oneshot by an enemy. Came into a T-junction and looked in the wrong direction first? Fuck you, you are dead. And the AI definitely felt smarter in New Order, many of the harder fights are possible to cheese due to dumb AI.

Heavy weapons are kinda useless, the slow movement and slow spool-up means death. Probably worst offender is the Ubergewehr (BFG), i literally only used it twice effectively and that was when you come across it for the first time - where the area is literally designed for it to be effective to try it out. 

The SJW propaganda was also pretty heavy-handed, i doubt other games would get away with it if you weren't fighting literal nazis. [spoiler] Is it just me, or Caroline was killed off just so they could introduce Grace - the strong black woman leader? [/spoiler]

Collectibles in games lately really piss me off. It is not a fun experience to look for them at all, yet it still creates the feeling of leaving the game unfinished if you don't. Probably my brain is just broken.

gripes end.

This game fights itself over being a hardcore burly American adventure, and a soap opera. The mood that the lore of the game sets for itself through the majority of the game matches with the setting, but not in a good way. The game tries to explain BJ's past as a sad, depressing one full of pain while simultaneously putting on a depressing lore for the present. Thinking about BJ's hardships as a kid and depressing circumstances as an adult which the game doesn't let you forget does not put me in the mood to blast Nazis into smithereens.

Gameplay:
Compared to the last version there is not much difference, they are both very alike. Graphics are way better obviously and quite a few things have changed. Variety of guns, characters, areas, enemies and so on. Wheel, from where you are able to change guns, also feels way smoother and you can choose which gun you want to hold. You can have a pistol and a shotgun in another hand. Movement feels similar, shooting as well. It has 2 endings, but nothing really changes. It is possible to upgrade your guns and there are ""skill tree"" sort of things, basically you have to kill enemies and you level up, which makes your character strong. However, its not exactly skill tree, things just upgrade on their own as you kill nazis.

Story:
I actually enjoyed the cutscenes way more than actual gameplay. Frankly, it was quite boring and got repetitive quickly, however the story itself was amazing. I'd love to just watch them instead of playing. William moves to New Mexico, USA, and starts a revolution against nazis. In the meantime he gets a lot of new friends who help him riot against them. In the USA William finds a village, where he used to live. He starts to reminisce about his mom, different race(d) girl and a dog. Unfortunately, his dad was a d1ckhead and excessively strict. He used to beat him and tried to teach him how to be a man. The dad makes William to kill his own dog (you can make the choice as a player whether you shot it or not). I, personally, did not kill it, but dad did anyway. I wont take anything from him though, because he was a strict one yet nice at times. Once William could not sleep, because he was scared of basement monsters, therefore the dad came up to the child, gave him a gun and they both went to the basement to find demons (with the mom). Keep in mind the year, everything happens in 20th century where racial discrimination is a thing, thats the reason why his dad did not like the girl (William's friend) with different skin color. Blazkowicz's mother is a jew and as its already known nazis did not like them. His dad sets her up and gives her to nazis. However, William did not know anything about it, untill he went back to the village (as mentioned). After he is done reminiscing about his childhood, he enters his parent's room and sees his father. They have conversation about personal subjects, but after Blazkowicz finds out that he, basically, sold his wife William gets mad and murders him, but the dad was close to nazis, therefore he had called them in advance, hence they knew William's location. This is basically the sum up, but there were a lot of things i did not mention.

The story is not all about Blazkowicz's childhood, but it surely is interesting. I dont wanna spoil much, but revolutionaries somehow got themselves a huge USS Nautilus sort of thing (you can google that, i did not know either). Sadly, they did not check every room on the ship, therefore some nazis that were still on board hiding, they were sending the revolutionaries' location to nazi nation. However William finds them and murders them all. After they have cleaned the ship then they head to New mexico. Let me cut the chase and tell you the best scene in the game, where you meet Hitler the Führer himself. I wanted to see him in game and i was excited to observe what he was capable of and let me tell you, he did not disappoint. He lives on mars, i think, because that was the safest location. In order to get to Hitler, William had to change his ""body"" basically and became an actor, because Hitler was planning to set up a theater about killing Blazkowicz, so he needed people. I wont keep on going, you must see everything yourself, not to mention i am bad at telling stories so!

Things i did not like:
Game being repetitive. The fact that it does not have replayability, even though it has 2 endings, but not different from each other one person replaces another. and same times of enemies, I did say it has variety, which is true, but after some times they were all the same and it just got boring.

Historia, Personajes y Estética
- Buena historia, con tíntes ridículos tal como debe ser en un Wolfenstein
- La progresión de la historia está muy bien, se recorren varias ciudades/escenarios segun avanza la historia
- Los personajes están bien desarrollados, hay continuidad con el juego anterior
- Graficamente el juego se luce y la ambientación nazi está demasiado bien lograda
- Las partes scripteadas son asombrosas llenas de gore, sensaciones increibles y todo muy intenso

Gameplay
- Excelente gameplay, cada arma tiene su mecánica, que la hace única
- Usar 2 armas al mismo tiempo es algo que caracteriza a Wolfenstein y dependiendo del nivel es muy util combinar distintas armas para vencer algunos enemigos
- Hay algunas armas y ""vehículos"" que se van a poder usar por única vez en algún nivel determinado
- Los Bosses de cada nivel están excelentes, son realmente impactantes, cada Boss es diferente y te hacen cambiar el gameplay constantemente, aunque me gustaron mas los bosses de su antecesor
- Las armas especiales tienen su zona de recarga ubicadas de forma muy intuitiva.
- Los mapas son increibles, el diseño de niveles está construido a la perfección y con una calidad visual impactante
- En una parte del juego hay que elegir entre 3 habilidades, segun la habilidad elegida podemos recorrer los mapas de distintas formas
- Hay ciertos niveles que se recorrerán más de una vez en distintos puntos del juego con distintos propósitos
- Al igual que el anterior, hay una zona espacial y está muy buena, se introducen armas con nuevas mecánicas
- Los únicos secretos son los Códigos Enigma
- Hay algunas mini-misiones secundarias dentro de cada base establecida por el equipo (ej: en el submarino)

plot- who gives a shit, also abruptly ends with no climax, feels like there was quite a bit cut from this game.
weapon variety - nil, pistol, shotty, assault rifle grenade launcher and a couple of heavy weps bare basic gunners
-characters - boring and unmemorable
- game randomly wanting to pressure you into stealth/ having stealth builds/ perks. hello this is meant to be wolfenstein? shit does not fit well at all
commanders r a stupid mechanic as ever, basically forcing you to rush maps to get to other end to take em out to stop reinforcements, you end up not taking as much of the world in or exploring due to this.
-the 'usa' setting is rather negligabe trailer made it seem more like you were fighting in town USA for a lot more but its just one scenic mission, rest is just dreary nazi megastructures or ruins.

IMO it's one of the best single player fps games of the 2010s, up there with DOOM, and other great games. Its a sequel, and it could be played without playing the first game and the spinoff, but those games are really good too, I recommend picking up A new order, the old blood, and this all on sale. 

First of all I want to talk about the protagonist, P.J. Blazkowicz, perhaps the most badass protagonist in any videogame, rivaling masterchief and DOOMguy. He falls into that category of unkillable badasses, and he really makes you just want to kill nazis. He was a good character in the first game, but not great. However in this game he is outstanding, they give us a great backstory, and he is amazing.

The game itself has amazing graphics, music, super fun gameplay, where the dual wielding system lets you make tons of combinations. movement is good, everything you could want is good. My only complaint is that it is only 7 hours long, but those 7 hours are amazing. 

The campaign has a good story, and the cutscenes feel like a movie, but the best stuff is how gruesome it is, there are multiple cutscenes, especially early on that are just horrible, but even in some of them you start cracking up from how hilarious this game is, its so goddamn funny. There are other normal cutscenes that are just hilarious.

after you finish the great campaign, theres the side missions to do, I havent done them yet, but Ill edit this saying how worth it they were.

you can also play through all combat sections for points and a time in the main menu

First of all, the game goes waaaaay overboard on the cut scenes.  Other people who've played this have done the math and apparently half of the game consists of cutscenes.  I don't know if this is true, but it sure felt that way because every other level seemed to involve me wandering around the much larger hub (a stolen U-Boat called Eva's Hammer) listening to numerous conversations and doing various fetch quests. 

Don't get me wrong, some of the cutscenes were extremely funny such as the one involving Hitler and the milkshake scene in Roswell, but there were a lot of times when I just wanted to get to the action.  

Speaking of action, the gameplay wasn't as fun as The New Order, either.  For starters, you play a good chunk  of the game with half health, which means you have to rely much more heavily on stealth and cover shooting instead of mostly doing whatever you wanted like in the first game.  Second, I hated the weapon switching mechanics.  Perhaps it's easier to use on a controller, but it was cumbersome with the keyboard/mouse.  

The levels didn't have as many interesting features, either.  Sure, you get to go to Venus this time, but it didn't feel like a space station and there wasn't much to see outside the windows, though I did laugh when I saw that on Venus they eat the nutrient cubes from the original Star Trek series.  The Roswell levels, though, were the game's high point since you get to see what Nazi America would be like as well as travel through a speeding rocket train.

Enemy variety seemed to be missing as well.  I missed the different uniforms that the Nazis in the New Order wore depending on their location, and they seemed to carry a greater variety of weapons in the first game.  There aren't any truly massive robots, either.  Indeed, I wouldn't even say there is a final boss fight unless you count two extra tough versions of the supersoldiers you've been fighting throughout the game.   Thus, the final enemy you dispatch was a bit of a let down even though it was enjoyable to finally put an end to her.  

As for the story, well it's not as tight as the first game's, though it has some good moments.  They managed to create an even more ridiculous plot, to the point where it was a bit difficult to suspend disbelief even for a Wolfenstein game, but overall it was okay.  The new characters were a bit of a mixed bag.  Most of them are forgettable since so many of them end up in your hub, and a few like Grace are downright obnoxious, but some like Sigrun were pretty funny.  The returning characters, however, were more interesting overall. 

Lastly, I had a lot more technical problems with this game.  For some reason, it liked to crash during loading screens somewhat frequently.  I tried a few fixes but none of them worked.  I'm not sure if other people will experience the same problems, however.  

Overall, I'd say that Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus is worth getting if you really need to see how the story continues, but otherwise I would stick with The New Order.",1623224808,1623224868,False,0,0,0.495934963226318359,0,True,False,False

Game is amazing looking, effects, you may get odd error where weapons are near silent and everything else is loud. 

Gameplay tuned up and good from first 2, nice selection of games and neat upgrades to each weapon.

gunfights can be fun, I say can be. Why?

Poorest execution of a certain trope 
[spoiler] Character is slowly dying on first half [/spoiler] at start of game you are stuck at 50hp in one of the most frustrating, poorly executed mechanic for tension. 

Armor, might as well be wearing paper because thats how it feels like, running to 2-3 soldiers will shred you like it.

Problems due to 50hp

YOU WILL DIE A TON and for BS reasons. If you have the odd quiet gun sounds problem, you will miss being shot from the back.

Certain level areas are constant death traps as you struggle to stay alive with bad armor and 50hp.

And it doesnt get better with 100hp with poor armor  and enemy dps just destroying you.

A lot of weapons feel poor. Pistol? eh only if you want to stealth but game is setup to eventually set off alarms.

SMG, pretty good once upgraded, AR also, and shotgun 3x shot, is you're best one

nade pistol nah skip it, you'll find others are better.

laser: best one once upgraded fully.

Other heavy weapons, good but major draw backs

BFG like weapon, I swear the way they put this one into levels is non viable. Why?

Unless you're shooting normal soldiers directly its good. Shooting at mechs, heavily armored power suited ones? Ha they just charge at you so you lose the secondary dmg explosion. Charges slow so get shot and die, travels slower than grandma on sand. Get ready to miss unless you plan out spawn areas.

It just feels like wasted potential. Especially on Air ship battle, ready yourself for frustration. Drop it and use fully upgraded weapons instead.

Overall

Gameplay 7/10

I knock down points for super poor execution on HP at start and weapons viability.

Take everything good about Wolfenstein: The New Order (2014) and throw it out the window. 

Alternate reality / alternate history games can be amazing fun and a great trip down the ""what if"" rabbit hole, this is not one of those games. The writers seemed more concerned with how much shock value they could throw in without the ESRB damning them to hell and the game is filled with characters that to be honest, you'd rather shoot in the head then suffer through one more of their cut scenes or one liners. 

The plot feels extremely unfinished and more of a ""wouldn't this be cool to do"" brainstorming session than anything that should have been a finished game. Sure this is a game, in a fictional alt history setting, but there's no way in hell a pregnant lady is going to be running around in a warzone, jumping and rolling around, flinging herself through the air and landing on her stomach every two seconds. A lot of the wordage used in the dialogues was just plain unnecessary, there were tons of different ways to get across the point that his father was racist without resorting to using the N word, but again it's all about shock value and not substance.

As far as the actual gameplay, every Nazi either is heavily armored or even when they aren't it still takes a good deal of ammo to bring them down even when you have your weapons upgraded. A headshot doesn't feel like a headshot, etc. for example. They rely far too much on enemies dropping from the ceiling, etc. things like that to bring enemies in rather than having them patrolling the larger areas, everything is very contained. 

Overall: Wolfenstein 2 feels like they took the original team, fired them, and then scraped the bottom of the barrel to put together a team that would have been more suited to a Duke Nuke'em game. It's lazy in every way, uninspired, more annoying than enjoying, and hopefully if there's another game made after this, it's from a different developer.",1622014665,1622014665,False,2,1,0.479123920202255249,0,True,False,False

new order is full of surprise and have a bloody good story
old blood as a prequel of the new order, is not as extensive as the new order but still very exciting to play with and the final boss is quite nice

as for this game 
the story is good, but surprisingly dull toward the end.
and the final real boss fight is simply vs some unname npc. Big disappointment.

I am not facing horrible crash like other review said, but there is some soldier doing moonwalk some time to time nad there is some freezing issue, minor problem really.

[b] Spoiler free Review by an average gamer. Game beaten on ""Bring em on""/Normal difficulty [/b]

[u] Things I enjoyed [/u]
- Obviously, stunning graphics and a great artstyle. Machines, Buildings, uniforms and many other aspects are designed stunningly
- And unexpectedly amazing story (for a shooter) that actually entertained me, no more whining and bo hooing like in TNO, just sheer dedication to fight the Nazis
- A point that I pointed out in TNO already and I'm happy to do it again: Stealth is 100% optional = no ""you have to retry mission if spotted"" no, if you are spotted you will just have to fight head on. Stealth makes things easier, but it's not required
- Even further, the game extends into that fact by letting you customise even more into the 3 playstyles ""Stealth, Mayhem and Tactical)
- Weapons feel beefy and impactful. Even on strong enemies you notice that your weapons do in fact hurt them. (Except for the MP, that one feels weak unless used in stabbing range akimbo)
- Damage model. In combination with the above, enemies get damage depending on the weapon you killed them with (chunks of flesh are missing if shot with the shotgun)
- Akimbo is possible, just like in TNO, but this time you can select two DIFFERENT weapons for each hand
- A comparable arsenal to TNO, some weapons have been ""merged"" (The STG61 now serves as assault and, on switch, as a sniper rifle with a flip-up scope) in order to make room for a few new weapons. Especially the heavy weapon-pick ups are glorious
- After the Knive from TNO and the Pipe from TOB we now have a fire axe as melee weapon
- Old senile Hitler

[u] Things that could've been better, but were okay/avoidable [/u]

- most interaction scenes are too slow/clunky to be fluently integrated into the combat. I had to avoid melee takedowns because BJ would always take his time on the kill, so the other two enemies had plenty of time to get me from full health AND armor down to zero

- The Laserkraftwerk, which was a signature weapon in TNO, constantly being upgraded and growing with the player, is now rather ""unimportant"" like its just another weapon in your arsenal

- Your max health is limited to 50HP for the first half of the game

[u] Things I did not enjoy [/u]

- The Dogs and the miniature version of the mecha dogs. If you play without headphones and due to their small size you have almost no chance to hear or see them coming, and then you suddenly get pinned down to the ground to be annihilated by other enemies with guns
- Venus, I almost enjoyed not a single bit of it. 
- Tampers, absoluetly annoying enemies
-Very poor feedback for incoming damage. I often died all of a sudden because I literlly did not notice being hit
-Like in TNO I could write an entire essay of why I did not enjoy the finale. Too hard, no explanation given. Which would be no problem as bosses are supposed to have a tactic you need to discover BUT you have NO time to find out about it as you are under constant fire that shreds you once you are out of cover and while you ARE in cover there are endless standart enemies that use the chance to swarm you

[u] Conclusion [/u]

I overall enjoyed Wolfenstein 2, more than The New Order or The Old Blood. It improved on some weaknesses, but also created a few new ones.

Wolfenstein II is the worst attempt at storytelling I have recently experienced. That is not normally a problem, however, you CANNOT SKIP THE IN-GAME CUTSCENES. IN A GAME FROM 2017. Making this game almost unplayable. You can't even alt tab since the game auto-pauses on loss of focus, with no option to adjust this. And while you can skip the rendered cutscenes, anything performed within the game engine itself is unskippable. 

Let me waste my time and tell you why the writing deserves this hatred:

The writer committed the awful sin of attempting to tackle extremely mature themes and ideas, while obviously lacking any of the skill or talent required to do so. The style poorly emulates the ironic tone of Rockstar's GTA 5 and perhaps a little bit of Half Life-esque first person narrative, also done in a merely emulative fashion. A number of the characters are walking punchlines (Fat Nazi, Walt the Hippie who took LSD and haha he's so loopy) or shallow caricatures (your dumb cardboard wife, or the main fucking character being a chadlord mcgee). These characters spend their time completely ignoring the context of this brutally racist (albeit futuristic and campy) Nazi Germany and, for the love of god, why is everyone having fucking babies? I cannot recommend this game at all, because the writing is essentially trying to be so bad it's good, and you can't DO that! Not intentionally, at least. 

Spoilers:
In the second fucking cutscene you are forced to endure ridiculous and cheesy depictions of childhood abuse, including the murder of your pet dog. In a game about campy nazi shooting... they felt this was a solid theme to explore in the OPENING OF THE GAME. Unskippable nonsense. And before you think there is some larger story to explore here, well, later on in the game you return to your childhood home and I guess murder your father? With the same cold, distant method by which you murder like 10,000 nazi soldiers, you 'Press Middle Mouse Button to Murder your Father'. And that serves as a 'story arc' or something. It's like they copy pasted the wiki article on character development. lol what a fucking joke

The rest of the game was fun in a vague way, though the level design was mostly just a re-hashing of the various levels from the Half Life games. ultimately it was uninventive compared to the first in this reboot series. The guns were enjoyable to learn. 

Hire some new writers, or don't give them the tools to direct in-game cutscenes, or.. just drop the pretense a game like this needs a story full of characters. This review has nothing to do with having a diverse cast, which I felt was welcome and made sense in a story about fighting classic racist types, you know, Nazis. However, the universe of Wolfenstein II is not conducive to interesting character development, and regardless of your rendered setpieces or wacky deus ex machinas, the story was ultimately just really fucking boring. zzzzzzzzzzzzzz

There are so many things Wolf 2 gets right, but the things this game does wrong, can ruin the whole experience for some people. Machine Games are clearly a very talented studio who love what they do, and love Wolfenstein. Even with the issues I have with this game, I am still excited for what they will do next, and this title gets a strong 6 to a light 7, but more on the 7 side on my non existent numerical rating system. 

The part Wolf 2 had the most effort put into was definitely the story, which I actually think is really good. Most people may scoff at the fact that the game is 60% story, 40% shooting, but at least the story is really well done that I am interested in watching the beautifully animated cut scenes with incredible voice acting. Wolf 2 is a mid point between the spark that was Wolfenstein The New Order and what hopefully will be the bombastic finish that will be Wolfenstein 3. Focusing on the softer side of BJ Blaszkowicz journey, Wolf 2 shows that even the strongest of FPS protagonists are still made of flesh and bone. I also love how Nu-Wolfenstein blends really serious characters and dreadful situations based on real horrors of facism and Nazis, is blended with this Tarantino-esque, or Matthew Vaughn style pulpy, blatantly video game plot that only a Wolfenstein game can get away with. If you want a more thorough examination of the story of Wolf 2 with spoilers, I really suggest watching the video by Errant Signal because almost everything he says I agree with. But being as vauge as possible, Wolf 2 has one of the better written stories in the Half Life clone genre of action FPS games, and I am glued to the screen whenever a cut scene occurs or a character is speaking to me.

However, most people come to Wolfenstein for tearing Nazis to Heinz Ketchup, and unfortunately this is where the game really stumbles. Lets get the positives out of the way first. The weapons feel and sound great, and when every thing is working just as I expect it to, I am having the time of my life. Nazis fall apart with ease from dual wielding shotguns, or shredding them with dual assault rifles. The action in Wolf 2, when it is working is even better than what The New Order had and then some. My issues with this game all stem from the controls and the level design which potentially can ruin all the positives above. Being built on ID Software's at the time latest ID Tech Engine, a lot of traits relating to controls carried over to Wolf 2 from the acclaimed Doom 2016, specifically the character speed. When sprinting and even when walking, BJ moves at Super Sonic Speed, in really cramped levels. You will stumble on things you do not see because of how fast you move in these tight levels, which only offers close quarters combat situations. Okay, not off to a great start. Next, one thing I did not expect with the movement itself is that it feels really slippery and wonky. Because BJ is a full body character now, which really impressed me as an animator, as a responsive FPS character, something about the movement feels really off. Its almost if, BJ has butter on his shoes, but when he runs into a pebble, he stops. Because of your frustrating controls and really cramped level design, you will die really fast, even on lower difficulties. BJ's health drops at the drop of a hat even with maximum health or armor because the damage model is completely off. All of this, in addition to a wonky mixed dual wielding weapon system where you can now equip two different weapons at once, Wolf 2 has some of the most frustrating controls and level design in an FPS game I have played as of late, which is a darn shame because the weapons are fun to use when the level design opens up a bit.

As far as presentation goes, I also had some issues. The game performs really well on my 980ti, 4790k system running at 1440p,  but I had some weird game breaking crashes where some saves were unusable upon reloading my save. Thankfully this was early in my 3rd play through so it wasn't that painful, but your mileage may vary. The game looks really great with many graphical effects like global illumination, physically based rendering and really satisfying gore effects. The texture work is top notch and the character models and animations again are really well done. I especially love the way the game renders eye balls, they look so good in these Nu-Wolfenstein games. The soundtrack by Mick Gordon and Martin Stig Andersen is obviously really great, Mick Gordon providing the fist pumping industrial combat music, and Andersen serving some really creepy dark ambient pieces, reminiscent of his work on Playdead games. The sound design is also awesome with beefy weapon sounds, nice ambient sound effects, and some of the best voice acting I have heard in an FPS. Overall, the presentation when it is working is even better than The New Order, but the technical issues may get in the way of enjoying this title.

Wolfenstein II The New Colossus gets most things right as far as presentation and story goes, but the game play is a step backwards for the most unexpected reasons. All of these problems I think could have been fixed with a fan patch or some quick number swapping on the damage values for enemies and your weapons, but unfortunately Wolf 2 stumbles on what I expect from a Wolfenstein game, sending Nazis back to Hell where they belong. There is a wonderful game here, I can see it through the too tight level design, but it just doesn't work all the time. That is why it gets the lightest 7 out of 10 for me, just because when the game is firing on all cylinders, It is better than The New Colossus, but most of the time, when the game is not showing a beautiful cut scene, its a frustrating mess.",1620701215,1620701215,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The art direction (apart from the casting on Venus) is uninspired and generic
The gunplay and combat physics are less smooth
The new characters are annoying however the old characters are expanded on and actually are likable (like Set Roth)

Finally the story;
It is a joke, and not in a good way. New Order tied the snippets of gameplay and story together extremely well and immersed you as being part of a resistance in a dominated world. Things made sense.
New Colossus takes that to an absurd level, where the Kreisau is essentially invincible and manages to complete feats that don't make any sense whatsoever.
For brevity, I will take the example of the moon in New Order. The buildup took time, and created suspense until you manage to reach the base. It felt powerful because it bloody was. Meanwhile Old Blood takes something that is EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE AND AMAZING and makes you appear there with nothing to it.

I wanted to like this game, force myself even, as New Order is one of my favourite games of all time, but I simply cannot. And with Youngblood apparently being even worse than this, I don't think I will return to this franchise again. RIP Wolf, time to wait for another sci-fi Notsee game

Don't get me wrong, the cut scenes are sometimes absolutely hilarious and the jokes are on point, but that's really all that's great about this game. Overall, if a comedic story game is what you are looking for, then this game could be it, but if you care about anything else, I wouldn't recommend this game at all. 

The combat/gunplay feel clunky at best and just downright not fun at other times. Selecting your weapon is a very annoying process as using the weapon select system leads to many frustrations of accidentally choosing the wrong weapon. The dual wielding concept is interesting at first, but it just feels extremely clunky especially when shooting. Switching weapons with duel wielding is very time consuming as if I wanted to use a longer range weapon I'd need to switch off duel-wielding, then switch to that desired weapon. Whilst you could use Q (or whatever keybind for switch to last used weapon) and that would solve this problem, I've personally encountered many times where I forgot that the last used weapon wasn't the long range weapon I desired and just switched to a gun/guns that I didn't want in that situation. 

Level design wise, I think they are okay, no complaints for the most part, but nothing stunning/spectacular. In the beginning of the game, it explains that you can try to stealth some levels but honestly, you can easily tell that this isn't a stealth game. Not only are most level just not made for stealth, the enemy detection system is straight up garbage. After playing through the entire game I'm still not sure what/how the enemy detection system works. In most stealth games you have either a indicator that an enemy has seen you and while sometimes there is a verbal cue that enemies may have heard or seen you, I've been caught hiding behind boxes while others times I've looked straight at an enemy and they just don't see me. That aside, another gripe I have with the level design it is sometimes difficult to know where you need to go as there is no obvious signage/visual cue as to know where to go. If not for the helpful ""tell me where to go"" button, I would have been completely lost. The map is legit useless as I've never found it useful whenever I got lost. 

Besides the jokes I really would have liked getting more story/background on the characters. They feel almost robotic sometimes and you just can't/don't get attached to these characters at all. Maybe this is due to the comedic nature of the story, but it's just hard to convey a serious idea. Death is treated almost like a joke and while that isn't an issue, the reaction I get when they kill a character is ""Oh, Unfortunate"". The lack of character development paired up with the type of story telling just doesn't pair up well and leads to characters/npcs that I just don't really care about. 

This has been a pretty long review I must say, but if you only can take one piece of information from this review, then that point would be that this game is not meant for those looking for a fun shooting game, nor is it a game for stealth and strategy. It is a loud n proud shoot em up type game with honestly an unamusing gunplay and mediocre story telling aside from the jokes.

Wolfenstein II still knows how to let you have fun tearing apart the scum of the Earth, also known as Nazis. It continues the franchise's proud tradition of over-the-top baddies and over-the-top violence. Released in an era when it seemed that you couldn't call Nazis Nazis without receiving a bunch of idiotic blowback, it could have been the middle finger to modern Nazis that we needed.

If only it worked. If only it hadn't crash-landed the ending. I don't just mean the closing scene that, if you haven't been spoiled on yet, good for you. No, before that is a final boss fight that does not announce itself as a final boss fight like a proper game should. Worse, at that point you can't go back to the sub and get the brute-force upgrades that will actually help you in this fight, not the stealth upgrades that amount to very little here. And if you beat that fight, get ready for a penultimate cutscene that is one of the most ridiculous, gratuitous scenes ever released in a video game.

Besides that, there is an annoying Enigma Machine and a clunky mechanism to pick up weapons and armor. Most of the characters in the storyline don't resonate; Sigrun's and Grace's story arcs in particular were letdowns. On top of that, all that Wolfenstein II seemed to say about resistance to Naziism is that its cause was for ""freedom."" Freedom? That's all Bethesda wants us to think the Nazis took away? Come on. The most satisfying part of the game to me was Wolfstone, which is nearly the original Wolfenstein 3D with mostly minor changes. Sidequests should not be more fun than the main storyline! Bethesda, you can try harder than that.

You might find the game worth it just to advance the franchise if you can get it on sale. Don't waste your money on a full-price purchase. It's not worth it.",1618974147,1618974147,False,1,0,0.481881260871887207,0,True,False,False

The cut-scenes can be on the long side at times, which makes the moments when you get the chance play the actual game further apart from each-other, but it is also at the same time makes those climactic story events even more jaw dropping and suspenseful.

The combat is spastic, bloody and fun while offering a story that sees the development of its characters. Enemies can be relentless, but each can be taken down with tactics and patience. The enemy scaling is linear, which means that there isn't such a massive difference between the average Nazi foot soldier and the supersoldiers. To use an analogy, compare the supersoldiers in Wolfenstein to Halo's Brutes, where Halo 2's were like bullet sponges and Halo 3's were more like facing an Elite. You have to be smart about using cover and the right weapon and watching your ammo counter, but you won't feel like the game is throwing you into a gauntlet every time a supersoldier comes your way. And believe me, the supersoldiers are small potatoes compared to the bigger and badder enemies The New Colossus has in store for you! It's a fair change. 

Eva's Hammer becomes your base of operations and as you progress through the story, you get to see your fellow teammates interact with each other in meaningful ways and often quite hilariously. Wyatt has a pretty good character arc if you've chosen him instead of Fergus as the one to be spared from Deathshead's experiment. Sigrun also has a pretty good character arc. B.J. himself is struggling to keep going while on the verge of death and with the thought of Anya having to raise their kids herself and the death of a former comrade both lingering heavily in his mind. I love his narration so so much. I've gotta address an elephant in the room here. You've probably noticed that other players have complained about Grace and taking a dislike to her outspoken opinions as well as her group's association with Communism. Listen: this game takes place in 1961, in a timeline where the Civil Rights Movement is almost non-existent because the country is under the control of white supremacists and fucking Nazis. But just like how early Civil Rights Activists sided with Communists, so too do people of color like Grace. If you know your history, you'd know Southern Capitalists didn't give a damn about black people. What's the enemy of my enemy? Just like in real life, in this game's universe the enemy of the enemy of black activists, including the Black Revolutionary Front, is going to be Communists. And we all know Communism failed (and where it exists, continues to fail) because it probably cares even LESS about liberating people than Capitalism, so enough with the hand-wringing and pearl-clutching about Machinegames perverting this game into cOmMuNiSt pRoPaGaNdA. Stop that. You sound so stupid when you treat everything that pays even the littlest bit of attention to historical detail and fact as some kind of America-hating liberal conspiracy. Alright? Grace was a former member of the Black Revolutionary Front (which was a black nationalist group), so excuse her for having certain opinions that are going to be pretty disagreeable. Even Malcolm X distanced himself from black nationalist groups. Get over it. Don't be obtuse. Not YOU, though. You're not buying into that nonsense, which is why you're still reading this review. Good for you! You're one of the good ones. I apologize if I sounded accusatory. Grace is a great character. You will learn to love to her and her fucking brilliant/hilarious plan of stowing a nuke in a fire extinguisher and dressing up B.J. as a firefighter so he and her crazy lawyer/amateur-ufologist hubby Super Spesh can smuggle it deep into Nazi/KKK territory. Goddamnit, I love this game so much.

Besides the main story, there are also plenty of items to collect, including kits to improve your weapons. After finishing the main story (and witnessing a spectacular end to the most evil bitch in Wolfenstein history), you can crack codes to discover the location of high-ranking Nazi officers and systematically send them straight to hell. Also don't forget that you can also play a Nazi-twisted version of Wolfenstein 3D, where you play as Terror Billy playing an arcade game where he's Nazi soldier whose mission is to search and terminate...Terror Billy.

- Level design is bland, and not particularly intuitive. Game takes about 7 to 8 hours. Difficult darts all over the place, I found myself dying in early sections, and steamrolling the game in later levels, then getting to a part where I would just restart all the time. The final airship fight, you basically have to cheese the AI.

- Gunplay is functional, but the dual wield seems to serve little purpose. I found myself only using the assault rifle throughout the game as the rest of the guns don't really seem to have much going for them.

- Characters and dialogue are cringe, and seem to be all stereotypes. Not exactly sure what the Hitler scene where he's shitting and pissing and farting was about, but whatevs.

- Story is just confusing. BJ, go and get this magguffin, now collect these people who do nothing for the plot, now go and get this magguffin. 

- Graphics are decent though, so that's a winner.

Let's begin with the best thing in the game: the gameplay. It's OK. It's basically exactly the same as Wolfenstein The New Order. More or less the same enemies, the same weapons, the same mechanics. The problem is also: there is nothing new and exciting.

There is a severe lack of variety and nothing is memorable. A lot of levels look the same: you have the inside of a military base, ruins, more ruins, more military base, yet more ruins and a foreign, red planet (with a military base, what did you expect) Because the previous game also took it to space of course!

Level design is boring, not to mention confusing because it all looks the same: endless boring corridor after endless boring corridor filled with the same after same after same after bloody god damn same fucking enemy.

I finished the game and hardly any level in particular stands out in a good way. Looking back at the game, my memories are more like: New York, oh yeah that level was terrible. Roswell ... Roswell ... Roswell ... wait, was Roswell in the game? Ah yeah, I remember the non-combat intro. Hollywood ... hmm, did I really go to Hollywood?

The difficulty is fairly high so you are encouraged to make use of the stealth system (lifted straight from the previous games). Stealth is hard as well, but often just boils down to relentlessly reloading which pads out the game's length nicely. The alternative is playing it as a cover based shooter, also unnecessarily lengthening combat.

Once you get the hang of the stealth mechanics you can complete fights just fine. The only really difficult parts are when swarms of enemies are thrown at you in arena style, but there are just so many health packs and ammo lying around that it ends up an exercise in taking care of everyone in the optimal order rather than actual playing skill.

Also, the game is fairly short if you take away all the padding and cutscenes. It tries to lengthen the playtime with ""enigma levels"", but those are nothing more than replaying previous levels and could not really interest me.

Oh yeah: the RPG-ish perks that you can level up are back again as well. They are even more uninspired and pointless now.

So sameish combat in boring levels. The gameplay is mildly entertaining mostly because its just copy/pasted from the better Wolfenstein games. Those were the ""good"" things I have to say ...

Up to the bad stuff:

First of all, a special mention must be made of the writing. The writing is terrible, it's just plain horrible. The script is mind-numbingly bad: not ""so campy bad it's good"", but just plain stupid, riddled with plot holes, eye-watering awful dialogue and retarded developments in the plot.

An example: your team just witnessed the horror of a nuclear explosion onto a mostly inhabited city, big emphasis on the word ""horror"". First reaction: ""Hey, how about we make a nuke of our own go boom, on a populated American city?"" WTF? I mean: WTF? Who the hell comes up with this sort of stuff?

The cutscenes are boring and overly long. And the attempts at humor fall flat on their face.

Seriously, there were cutscenes where I said out loud ""What?"" thinking I misheard. I never, ever talked to my computer before. I can only assume that, to keep in the spirit of the ""everyone is special"" doctrine (lots more on that below), they outsourced the writing to a team of mentally disabled 9-year olds. And the Bethesda peeps then took out the most clever and best bit from that unholy retarded storyboard and presented it as their own. That would explain how come everyone in this game, including the main character, acts like a retard.

(I admit that was not a very political correct thing of me to say. Maybe I should apologize and say that I didn't mean it ... but I'm a bad liar so I won’t be doing that.)

Speaking about politically correct ...

This game is so overly politically correct that it is cringy. It actually hurts the game, as if the developers decided to move everything aside if it would make the result even more PC.

And that result is an utterly predictable and forgettable stereotype of a game. All colours and kinds of people are living in perfect harmony like a big happy family, talking about feelings and sipping herb tea and shedding tears together over memories lost. Of course a strong black female leader pops up out of nowhere, hoodrats turn out the most clever computer operators, women are all strong and independent (unless they’re Nazi’s), interracial relationships are promoted and everyone who is white is pictured as a coward (that is literally said in the game by the way). The ""good"" white guys on your team are on the other hand depicted as either (drug-addicted) lunatics, or a guy that worships a toilet. He literally kneels and prays to a toilet! I actually feel more stupid after some of the cutscenes in this game.

Yes indeed, the game is so politically correct that the game is actually racist. No joke: our protagonist screams out lines like: ""White ass Nazi facist"".

Yes, Nazi's that are also fascists! Someone flunked history 101.

Yet at the same time ... the game goes completely out of its way to portrait this perfect multicultural team as a bunch of incompetent cowards and lazy slobs. They barely do anything except talking hippie-bull crap, while leaving it up to you to solve their problems. Another example: they have a massive nuclear submarine at their disposal. The only thing they do with this powerhouse is making a massive mess of it while you're away.

Sigh.

I mean: if you sacrifice the entire story, dialogues and cutscenes of your game in order to show that stereotypes are bad, then I’m sure you’re not supposed to play it out in a way that only confirms the traditional stereotypes, m’kay?

Oh ... oh ... oh ... I still need to bring out my love-hate (well, actually only hate) relationship with the protagonist. He is the most annoying and uninteresting character on a submarine full of uninteresting characters.

For the first half of the game, BJ is an annoying crybaby who sputters sad one-liners just because a Nazi looked at him disapprovingly, there wasn't enough milk in his cereal that morning or he put on his skirt back-ways or whatever. And even in the second half, when BJ gets the courage to exchange his purse for an extra rocket launcher, he still behaves like a spineless doormat.

“Anya grant me your wings!” Hey, it's like I'm playing May Payne 3 all over again.

You know what BJ? I don't care about your emo mumbo-jumbo, I don't care about your socio-politic views, I don't care about your kid and I don't fucking care about your dog. All I want to do is shoot some Nazi's in fun and creative (preferably also very very gory) ways. How the hell you you screw up a game like Wolfenstein???? This is Wolfenstein, this is the grandfather of shooters, why did they try to make it into a high-school soap opera?

You know what: the entire game I thought that the final sequence would be: ""Blastowicz wakes up from having passed out at the end of Wolfenstein The New Order. Phew, he things to himself, it was all just a bad dream."" No dice.

PRESS E TO WIN FINALE??????? God-bloody-damned! Why, God, just why?
