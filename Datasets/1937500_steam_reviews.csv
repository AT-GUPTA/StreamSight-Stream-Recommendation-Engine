--Over the course of the game, you'll probably send 100+ groups of teachers to get training. At bear minimum, my suggestion for the game would be to have a ""Repeat Trip"" option to cut down clicks. 

--The interface for selecting which lessons get taught to your classes is terrible. The controls are very imprecise and slippery. 

--It seems hard to keep track of which additional class facilities you'll need. 

--Pretty much nothing in the game happens on its own. Like, in Sim City, if your education score is low, you place a school and fund it and then the situation will gradually resolve itself. Or, in most games, employees will passively improve themselves a lot with experience. In this game, very few employees scale upwards, and what little scaling upwards happens, is because you send them to get proficiency boosts and then you send them to training. 

--Proficiency problems with teachers seem unintuitive. There seems to be some problem around large class sizes, but I have no idea when the problems start. 

--I'd suggest allowing players to disable disasters. They're not fun at all and aren't great for the pace of gameplay. Spot-checking like 20+ rooms to find out which now have holes and dents in the walls is not great gameplay. 

--The game automatically resets to 1x speed at the start of each new day. 1x is pretty slow in this game, so this feels anti-fun. 

--I think it'd be cool if we had more control over our starting characters, like which class your headmaster and the assistant can teach. Some randomization over which student groups are nearby might also help for replay. 

--Things which I'd like to be reminded of: a teacher making a demand, or an available music/sports competition I'm eligible to participate in. Or there's a facility I need to build to hold a class this semester. Or a facility has closed itself because it no longer has door access.

--Things which I'd like to be reminded of less often: anything from rival headmasters. Speech opportunities (they take too much time/clicks for too little benefit). 

--I like that the game is very flexible on sim pathing. 

--When a repeatable technology is completed, the game automatically goes to repeat it. This is great automation. 

--Instead of having players send like 100x busloads of teachers to get +10 training proficiency 3 at a time, I'd suggest also adding a more expensive +25 or +50 training proficiency option. Or maybe radically rethinking the training process to be generally more passive and less click-intensive. Maybe teachers might naturally improve themselves with experience and the proficiency score determines how quickly that happens? Maybe the training room could auto-enroll teachers like the Student Council auto-enrolls eligible students? (Maybe the player could get a limiting factor like ""Spend no more than ____ $1000 ____ on auto-training sessions"" or whatever).

--I'd suggest generally increasing the points awarded for graduating students or decreasing the points required to level up aspirations. 

--Sports classes (mainly in level-3 Orange Performance Academy) are currently bugged to report that like everyone will fail your classes. But the actual pass rate will be higher than projected (there's some sort of known issue there). Even beyond this bug, teaching sports seems a lot harder than the other subjects. I'd guess my sports students are like 5x as likely to fail the test (maybe 5-10%) as their science/lit counterparts (1-2%). Also, sports facilities are the hardest to place (must be outdoors and really big relative to student count). 

--It doesn't seem like there's a way to determine which community a student comes from? So, if there's a problem, I don't know which community to invest into. So far, I've only been able to find which college a failing student is targeting, which doesn't tell me very much if you have like 5 of your communities targeting the same college.

First, let's do a quick review on some of school management game that I played:
Two Point Campus - Great graphic and animation, many mechanic but feel plain.
Academia : School Simulator - Simple graphic, similar to prison architect, but fewer mechanic.
Pocket Academy - Cute and charming pixel art style and animation, but very shallow mechanic and limited option since it is focusing to be on mobile.

So, when Let's School first show up, I'm very skeptical about it. It took me a few months before I decide to get it. But once I start playing, oh boy, it is very addictive. The longer I play, the more and more mechanic I discovered. And it got tons of them!

Needs, relationship, training, stats, items, classes, responsible position, research, parking lots, z-dimension building, other school diplomacy, competition events, seasonal events, community upgrade, selection which product to sell, garbage cleaning, fire, earthquake, room upgrade, club, dormitory, and more.

And you know what I love the most? The management system in this game!
It let you create an organization chart, where you (the headmaster) is at the top, and you can see the tree down of each subordinate under you, each person have their own management value, assigning to much responsibility under them will cause stress, but each one below will get management buff from the one above.

So, it is incredible fun to drag and drop, split, combine, assign person to each position based on the facility that you got in your school, try to find the best organization chart that benefit you the most, and I never see any game did something like this before. It make you feel like you really manage a school as whole and their relationship in each department.

Still not everything is perfect, there are some rough issues. For example the animation is far from smooth, you will see people waking walk through object, teacher put their bag floating in the air on the deck, etc. Some translation need to be clearer, and I spot a very few place where text is still Chinese. I did found a few bug, where people stuck sometime, but reloading the game will fix it.

Nevertheless, I can overlook all that flaws with so many fun mechanic to play and great performance despite 300 people plus uncountable cats running around in my school at x4 speed, it still working well without lagging issues.

As of my review right now, I got all achievements in around 75 hours (except 1 because of new update patch), I would said that this is probably the best time and money spend decision that I ever made in a while.",1708854416,1708854427,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wondered if maybe this game would be a little too simple and then suddenly it was twelve hours later and the sun was coming up. It really hooks you in and doesn't let go. There's a lot of the more granular details I wanted in a game likes this, and because they tell you flat out ""Do this or your students fail!"" there's a goal that you suddenly find yourself striving for. It's a deceptively complex simulation that really rewards a player into the management side as well as the construction maniacs among us (yes there's a sandbox mode).

My 50+ hours I put into over the course of a week or so is relatively evident of that. With that said, I couldn't shake the feeling that the game was overall incomplete. This game feels much more like it should be in EA rather than a full release. For starters, the least ""complete"" part of the game I feel is the club system. It's a school, and schools have clubs. Most schools have lots of clubs. Especially one's that have tons of students. You get 2. Basketball and Music. (3 if you count student council, but they don't do much other than attribute management points to said clubs.) When you start researching every tabs has tons of different options for including areas of the school. In the club section there are 4 things to research. The 3 aforementioned clubs, and decorations for your club room. That's it. There definitely should be some kind of expansion on this mechanic. 

Another thing that made it feel incomplete was the lack of variety in the different games and in my opinion vastly reduces replay value. You always start with the same 2 topics. Humanities and science. There are 4 total, but you never start a game with art or sports as one of your topics. Ms.Lin (your advisor at the start of the game) is always a humanities teacher, and the headmaster (You) are always a science teacher. This actually works out nicely for me in particular, being a science graduate, buuuut it would be nice to see the player be given the opportunity to choose their starting attributes. As a result, the starting town you get is always the same, just with slightly different names, occasionally different traits, and different tuition values. This always makes the start of the game (normally the first week or so) feel very samey. Staying on the topic of lack of variety, the overworld is another thing I find lacking. So you have 3 schools that you can choose from. A pretty standard school ground, one that is surrounded by streams, and one that is located in a cold snowy mountain. In my first game I played in the second map I listed. After you reach your first school reform, you can explore the over world map, where you can find new communities to recruit kids from, and other schools to trade with. The trading between schools is extremely barebones though, so I rarely touched that. At the top of the map, there is what appears to be a tap that says ""Urban"" implying that there are other locations. There isn't. I thought maybe when I tried the snowy mountain map, the map would be slightly different. Nope, it is exactly the same. Still the Urban map. Same schools, just moved to a different spot and slightly different communities to recruit from. 

Last thing I would like to point out were minor annoyances that I experienced with the game. I feel like once you reach a certain point in the game, your growth beings to vastly outpace the rate at which you obtain resources. These leads to just fast-forwarding to the end of the week so that your students can take your test to get an injection of money or the little attribute tokens for the 4 class types, so scaling feels a tad bit off. Another thing is the pop up messages in the bottom left. I don't need to be notified multiple times a day that there are new applicants or the 50 delinquent acts that happen a day. If I want to expel a student (Spoiler alert: I don't) or need to hire someone, I will. I don't need a notification for that each time, and should be able to turn them off. On the note about delinquency, another big issue with the game is how the security facilities work. So once you start having trouble-making kids, you have to start manually assigning teachers to break it up. That is at least until you have a security detail and cameras set up around the school. However, I began to find that my security office was occasionally too far from these incidents to go handle it. No problem, right? Just build another office closer to the problems, hire new employees, and no issue. Wrong. I give the new office a TV so that they can use the cameras, and...nothing. It always defaults to the first office, and there's no way to alter it, making the new office on the other side of campus effectively useless, unless you want to go back to manually assigning employees to delinquent acts. The last glaring issue that I felt playing this game is the lack of tool tips. Most items are pretty self-explanatory, but there are a few cases where you need to know certain things, and the game does not provide you enough information. Early in my play-through I found myself with a obesity epidemic sweeping through my school, and I could not figure out why. Apparently a burger sold in my cafeteria makes everyone fat, and thus you have to find the school with a particular item to trade so you can slim people down again. And eventually take both off the menu so that they can't order either. Except, once you do this, everyone becomes ""weak"" and thin like skeletons. Once you start having this fluctuation in weight (at least in employees, they students will eventually graduate and leave) it's almost impossible to get them back to normal weight. A lot will either be fat or skinny, with a few sitting in the middle. 

So, do I recommend this game? Eh, I got it on sale, and I think it's worth it at a reduced price if you enjoy sim/management games, but even at a $20 full price tag, I don't think it's worth it. So, if this sounds like a game you'd like, barring any major future updates (which based on the company moving forward with other projects, I find unlikely), wait until a sale to pick it up.",1707947257,1707947257,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Interestingly, these extracurriculars not only allow in-game students to participate, but also allow us as players to manage those extracurriculars.

Basketball: One of the extracurricular activities that we can manage is basketball tactics. We can manage the tactics and other aspects of how we play against other schools at certain levels of competition, which adds to the excitement of the game.

Music: As someone who has a long experience playing FL Studio and various musical instruments, I really like the features provided in this extracurricular music. We can make music, though unfortunately only for a very short duration. This prevented me from achieving my goal of covering a song that I had prepared. However, overall, this feature is quite good.

I hope that in the future, the club system in this game can be expanded, not just limited to basketball and music. I hope to see the addition of other extracurricular activities such as soccer, baseball, or even arts such as literature.

Of course, we're all waiting for the opening of Steam Workshop access for Let's School and modding capabilities in this game is highly expected.

I want to start with something positive, I love the game and this game have the potential to be very amazing with proper development. The recent update about club is nice, I love it. I can decorate the school however I want, I can accept a specific kind of students to build a theme school, like a sport oriented school, or maybe science. There's a lot of facility, furniture, and decoration, also with the new update I can pick whichever building design I desire. I just love the freedom for my imagination. About the difficulty level, I think it's appropriate. The hard difficulty is just hard at the beginning with money management, other than that it's not hard at all. Overall, I love the freedom i have in this game.

But, I feel like the game is not complete.

Like why the schedule can't be fully repeatable, why is there no way to check which students have how many demerits point, why I can't assign multiple admission to single class, and many other little things. Also some of the translations are not translated properly. Some room facility are impossible to maximize in level unless I spam a single furniture or decoration.

Let's School is a school management simulator that I won't call ""School Tycoon"" because there's no real campaign mode. Instead of the flood of scenarios you get in something like Two Point Campus, this has two maps, a bunch of difficulty settings, and three victory goals that you'll try to work towards. It certainly doesn't have the replayability that a more varied campaign would offer, but working on one increasingly complex school for the whole game also helps it avoid the repetitive tedium that killed Two Point Campus for me. Both games have a similar concept, but this is far and away the better game.

The most basic loop you'll go through begins with building a classroom and assigning students from your feeder communities to it. These students have a three year goal of learning enough about two specific subjects, and you'll next assign teachers and classes to their class schedule in order to meet those goals. After that, you might find that the new students have pushed your bathrooms, cafeterias, management admins, or even HVAC over capacity and you'll need to build more of whatever is now lacking. You can send your classes on field trips to nearby communities in order to scout for more students, and those new students you find will have more ambitious goals and more complex needs. Meeting those requires doing research and upgrading your existing facilities, which you'll need more students to pay for. At a high level, that cycle continues until you win. 

Speaking of winning, there are three ways to do it. One route finishes when you graduate 20 students with the highest level goals, another needs 250 concurrent students and very high student/staff satisfaction, and the last needs 12,000 building score and having built an advanced wonder. These all sound fairly different, but because of the way the loop I described above works, I think you'd have to try pretty hard to complete one of them without being close to the other two. The best students need so much stuff to graduate that you'll need an advanced building and a lot of other students to fund it all, it's hard to have 250 students without a large building and a decent number of 5 star students, and if you have a 12,000 score building, you've probably filled it with something close to 250 students. The lack of variety here is the game's weakest point. That said, it's still receiving significant updates and it's possible that it'll have more variety between playthroughs in the future. 

The other big problem is the difficulty. Although it is reasonably customizable, if you're playing on the default settings, there's not much that can realistically stop you unless you just try to build too quickly. You can tell in advance what you need to do to graduate all your students with perfect grades, and doing that will give you more students and more money to keep the loop going. Occasional disasters are the only things that will mess with your plans, but earthquakes are mostly just annoying and fires will almost never happen as long as you've built a bunch of cheap safety items. This would have benefited from something like difficult short term bonus goals or more variability in student performance to add some risk to the game.

I really love almost all about this game which for me recently became a star among tycoon games.

So you begin by admitting a few pupils and with a few poorly specialized teachers and, step by step, you'll get to build many, many buildings: classrooms for science, literature, art and sport, stores and supermarket, cafeterias, specialized rooms for every taste, offices, modern spaces of learning like computer classrooms and projector rooms, dormitories and even wonders.

Everything is unlocked by research, even the maps which give you access to more districts from where you recruit your subjects. You can also train your employees.

The disasters, earthquakes and fires, are mostly annoying, but you can lose a lot of money because of them.

I'm enjoying a lot playing this game that turned out to be a very nice surprise, being not too simple and not too complex or frustrating. It has a great sense of progression and I love to see how my (now) huge academy is extending and taking shape.

Pros:
- very good tycoon game
- somewhat funny
- very engaging and satisfying progression
- relatively complex, with many buildings
- replayable because you have three kind of goals (quantity or quality of teaching and aesthetics)
- lovely graphics
- cute cats and pandas
- relaxing on slower speeds
- a lot of content and devs are planning to add more

Cons:
- you can't really change the name of the classes (it only puts yours between brackets) which I find a very odd design decision. If you try to change the classes configuration, expect to acquire some strange bugs (like classes with the same name or randomly switching names every day).",1705851905,1705851905,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's an occasional bug here and there. When i wanted to walk around the school in headmaster-mode, my charachter clipped through the floor. I regularly couldn't see the stats screen of pupils, but that usually dissapeared with a restart. Also some lag when you have more than 300 pupils, but that's very endgame, so not a dealbreaker to be honest.

To be fair it's possible I just didn't play TPC long enough, but I put around 6 hours into TPC and it never quick clicked.

⭐OVERALL: Worth it, especially for those that enjoy polygon-like graphics, simulation and management games.⭐

Difficulty: Medium to Low. 
Game takes a little bit to learn the various management of the school. Despite internal guides, you are bound to make loads of mistakes in creating your school. Eventually, you'll pick it up! For me, this doesn't detract from the game overall and is one of the interesting features you'll want to learn.

Graphics: 3/5 
Reminiscent of older games that utilise a the whole 'polygons-for-humans' visuals. Not everyone's style, but super enjoyable if it is. Fun environments, and different visuals to unlock each 'year' your school progresses through.

Game Play: 4/5 
Playing the game is addicting- you'll think, ""oh just a couple of hours for now"" which will turn into the better part of a day spent on Let's School

Pros: 
- Nails the East Asian high school vibe well
- Good performance even at relatively high student numbers
- Few bugs encountered for its current stage of development
- A fairly robust building system

Cons:
- Students feel identical: their aspiration (i.e. the place they want to go after graduation, which directly influences your management choices) are always the same if they come from the same recruitment area. Their talents are always tailored to their aspiration too. Some randomisation here would definitely improve the gameplay loop.
- The exam system is...weird. If two students score the same on their exam in a given subject, but one has a higher level aspiration requiring a higher final score at the end of year 3, he might still fail because the target is higher for him for some reason. 
- Relationships between students and teachers is as present as a system but underdeveloped at the moment

Overall verdict:
Still a pretty good school game overall imo despite its flaws. The club system looks promising, but its still in an early build on the beta and could definitely use some work.",1703591125,1703591125,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are quite a few annoyances in the current version of the game I'm playing that make the experience ever so slightly irritating, I encountered these with 8hrs of playtime and multiple sessions.
- Game immediately crashes when you accept data collection for some reason, game starts perfectly fine when you decline although it asks you again everytime you relaunch the game with no way to turn it off.
- Had a bug were for some reason when I click on the students it didn't pop up their status until I reloaded the save
- Had a bug where I got softlocked and couldn't place anything after resizing a building and clicking a movable object until I reloaded the save
- Have a bug on the scheduling page with the special courses where it overlaps with normal courses and the problem persists even when restarting the game
- No way to mirror a blueprint you copied, at least as far as I know
- Some events have no explanation on how to do them, not even a hint. (Like how to do cleaning chores, you'd have to unlock the specific research first and then set it on the schedule afterwards)
- People getting stuck in empty buildings

And quite a few more very minor ones. Despite these flaws though the game is still [i]really[/i] fun! It takes a bit of getting used to and you have to take your time or you go bankrupt quite quickly (I'm playing on hard mode so it makes sense). It's quite well paced with new stuff introduced to you slowly but surely.

I bought this game three days ago and have 51 hours. I play every free moment I get, it's addictive.
There are bugs, most of which can be fixed by a going to the main menu then immediately back into game. Outside of that, it's a management game lover's paradise. There are some aspects of the game that can make management tedious (to check contraband/demerits for expulsion, you have to click on each student individually. I've got 400 students, I'm not doing that even if I want to.) but it has nothing on all the positives afaic

The pacing is great, the class system is decent though I'm hoping it gets even more in depth in the future. Clubs are  apparently coming soon so that should add even more content but, as is right now, I think I'll finish everything I can do in game around the 60 hour mark.

I've already played 32 hours and I have had the game about a week. (I also work too) The game is quite fun, and there are a lot of small details that make it interesting. This game could really be absolutely amazing one day. However, with that being said, it's not an amazing game quite yet. 

Here is what I like:

-Students have decent personalities
-There is quite a bit of content so far
-Map is quite large
-Good tutorial
-You can really be creative
-Game play is generally fun
-Career mode is essentially endless after ""winning""
-Sandbox mode for those that want it
-Great map/game customization options even for Career mode.

Here is what I dislike so far:

-Fences have no collision. Meaning students walk right through them. (This one really drives me bonkers, because it defeats their whole purpose.)
-Staff members constantly threaten to quit due to pay, even when they're extremely satisfied with pay.
-Staff members constantly ask for raises.
-Earthquakes are more annoying than anything when trying to fix damaged walls, I've accidentally deleted whole rooms or items in rooms by accident. We need a ""undo"" button for this reason
-Needs actual janitor staff type
-Teaching Policy needs to be available from the start. We also need to be able to blend ""regions/towns"" into one class with said teaching policy. Currently, you can only do one region/town at a time per classroom using the teaching policy system.
-Students need to have the freedom to choose their own outfits if you want them to.
-Emergency Drills need to automatically repeat every semester.

You might ask ""Why do you not recommend this game if it's really good?""
Well thanks for asking hypothetical person.
The reason I don't recommend this game is there are a bunch of what feel like incomplete features and many, many (sometimes game breaking) bugs.
A short list of what I mean...

Incomplete features:

Teaching Policy
The whole Teaching Policy feels incomplete, like why can't I make multiple different admissions communities use the same class or have an overflow class if the main classes fill up?

Scheduling
Why don't special courses repeat into the next semester?
Why can't I fill up a day with the same fundamental course without having to click and drag it onto the slots?
I know you can click the course and that will fill in the next slot but what if I want to work on the Thursday before the Monday-Wednesday?

Expelling students
There is a little popup on the bottom left when a student has accrued enough demerits saying you can now expel them but unless you click on that popup you don't know what students have enough demerits without going through student's one by one. Unless I am missing something in the student viewer, there isn't any way to find these students without clicking into each student and checking manually.

Bugs:
There are a lot more bugs than what I will list here but I want to highlight a few to make my point

Make the game better:
When you launch the game you get a popup saying do you want to help make the game better. I don't know who else this happens for but when you click the button to say sure I will help it hard crashes the game and you have to alt-f4 or close the game with task manager. So unless you say no I don't want to help, you cannot play the game. Also this popup shows up every time you boot up the game.

Class numbers:
As someone who really wants to micro classes and courses and everything. I like having teaching policies where they go from class 1-1 to 2-1 to 3-1 or from 1-2 to 2-2 to 3-2. but currently how the numbers are assigned it looks at how many year one classes you already have and assigns it to the highest second number you currently can. so if you have classes 1-1 and 1-2 it will assign a newly build class 1-3. this wouldn't be an issue but when you change the 1-3 class to try and make it 2-1 it looks at the second number (in this case 3) and says is there a class 2-3? if there isn't it stays as class 2-3 and won't change to 2-1 or have any way to force it to change. This bug is more of a quality of life thing than a game breaking bug so its not as bad but it is very annoying.

Weird building interactions:
Whenever you try to build something, it checks if you can actually place it there. Seems fairly straight forward, but there are many times when you can build something if you change the order of when you build things. The first thing that comes to my mind is toilets and hand dryers. If you place a toilet stall down you can place a hand dryer on the wall where the entrance is which seems like it should work that way. If you place the hand dryer and then the toilet stall, the stall will not be able to be placed because the hand dryer is ""blocking"" its entrance. There are other examples but this it the first that came to mind.

Popups for students sleeping/being disruptive in class:
Sometimes (seemingly randomly) you won't be able to select students, the only way to fix this that I have found is to completely restart the game and sometimes that doesn't work.

So my TLDR:
Currently the game is not in early access which makes me worry that they aren't updating/fixing bugs. The last update was November 7th (at least according to the steam library feed). So I am hopeful that they are continuing to improve the game. but as it is there are too many bugs and incomplete features for me to recommend this game. I really want to recommend this game because I really really like it but I just can't.
Hopefully the devs see this and work on making sure all the bugs are fixed and make features feel complete.

EDIT: It does seem that the devs have a discord where bug reports are being submitted, this makes me more confident that updates are being worked on, but for now my review has to stay as a not recommend until bugs are fixed.",1702233660,1702863471,False,215,5,0.869285702705383301,2,True,False,False

Once you have an idea of what you want to do with the game, it becomes fun and if you don't know, working towards the goals is plenty satisfying.

I've encountered a few issues with the game but they are not game breaking. Highlighting and selecting certain things can be a little annoying at times. There's some UI issue at times when I try to exit out of a plan/build phase as well.

Though in saying that, any problems that are in the game (gameplay wise), you'll be notified at least what's going and how to resolve them which is plenty useful. 

It's a great game, I've lost track of time playing the game and I believe that's a good thing in terms of immersion. Lots of quality of life improves do get added over time. If you're on the fence about it but are interested in the game, I would recommend giving the demo a go.

Imagine my surprise when this is actually a perfectly workable game. There are some weird things here and there and some room for improvements, but it's functional and quite fun.

Starting a sandbox game without any prior knowledge, apart from having been to school myself, it's not impossible to grasp. There is even a minor tutorial of sorts in the sandbox, but just clicking through the various windows and resolving the problems the game informs you about teaches you most you need. It's not all intuitive, but most of it is and despite some mechanics being a bit overly micromanagement it can be handled if you pay attention.

There is a slight imbalance between some mechanics being overly deep and others being a bit shallow. The whole wonders you can build I don't get what they are meant for, they don't seem to get used at all, much like the outdoor things. That you have to water your staff to make them work effectively is a bit strange, especially when they require water specifically and not just a vending machine for soda. Though the problem with that is more down to the way the build menu is organized and structured, lacking a bit in overview when you constantly have to scroll. This could really benefit some ui scale slider to reduce the ui scale and make more space in the build menu to show more items at once or add more categories.

Hoping for a two more subjects making it in at some point so it's not just 4, which seems a bit lackluster compared to the rest of the game. Also the finance view needs a redesign, it's basically impossible to tell at a glance what is costing you money and what brings it in, even collapsed, when you basically omit all meaningful data, you only get a rough idea of the situation.

Some of the items don't fit right in certain orientations or against walls, which makes them look odd and the average scale of people makes them so tall and wide that it ends up looking quite funky. The build area appears large at first, but if you want to build a larger campus with multiple buildings and facilities the space is actually quite limited. Hopefully some bigger maps in the future.

The management aspect is really neat. Having to organize departments and working out a good structure makes sense, feels realistic and empowering. Just wish there was more indication of whether or not a management structure is helpful or not; some form of management quality percentage would be nice.

Have to say though I did not expect even the small minigames and other mechanics to work this flawlessly. It's refreshing to play a game that might look like a yet another indie mess thrown together to fill a niche be actually working so well. Is it perfect? No, but if updates continue and some of the rough edges are polished it really could become a real gem. It reminds me a lot of the golden era of these tycoon games from the early 2000's when it was still about realism and engaging well-rounded gameplay. You don't need the best graphics when the game is fun to play. Graphics and models can be changed and modded, but that doesn't happen to games the play like garbage. It's only the games that are fun and invigorate creativity which build a fanbase that supports them.

I really hope it will get the attention it deserves and the coming months and years will make it just better. There is already such a great basis here and so much stuff done well, leaving only minor things to clean up and polish to achieve cult status. Sounds overly flattering? Nah it's just that well made compared to all the other garbage on Steam. For $20 it's a perfectly okay price.

The visuals are quirky in a good way and there is rather complex research and building system that you must navigate through in order to reach the end game. As you continue to play you need to get more money to be able to operate higher level facilities, this then requires you to take on students that pay more per term but have bigger goals to meet than students you would have taken on previously.

It can take a surprisingly long time to reach the endgame but I didn’t find myself getting bored and enjoyed the slower progression. It never got too difficult either, but I didn’t find that this was a bad thing and I imagine many people playing this will be looking for a more laidback experience like I was.

The game immediately envelops you in a warm and cozy atmosphere. The graphics and overall design contribute to a relaxing gaming experience. It's the kind of game that makes you feel at ease as you embark on the journey of building and managing your dream school.

One of the standout features of Let's School is its simplicity. The game mechanics are easy to grasp, making it accessible to players of all levels. There's no steep learning curve, and you can jump right into the fun without feeling overwhelmed. The straightforward nature of the game adds to its overall appeal.

This game successfully combines the strategic elements of a tycoon game with the joy of building and managing a school. The game keeps you engaged with a perfect balance of challenge and enjoyment. From creating classrooms to organizing extracurricular activities, every aspect of running a school is thoughtfully integrated into the gameplay.

While itg offers an engaging experience, my only minor complaint is the limited map options. I found myself wishing for more diverse landscapes and additional areas to expand my school empire. I hope the developers consider adding more maps in future updates to enhance the longevity and variety of the gameplay.

In conclusion, Let's School is a gem in the school simulation genre. Its chill vibes, simple mechanics, and well-crafted gameplay make it a joy to play. Despite the desire for more maps, the overall experience is positive, and I look forward to seeing how the game evolves with future updates.

I'm not too into management sandboxes, so from that perspective it may be lacking. I literally wouldn't know. But at least from what I can tell there's lots chew on here and plenty of room for customization. I find the scheduling screen to be particularly engaging. (as weird as that sounds) The building mode is great too, making rooms and expanding the school is like crack rock idk how else to put it.

The art is great, this game is a such a joy to look at. Even my relatively shabby building work in games like these Is fun to look at. There are four seasons so there's a good amount of visual variety.

Managing teachers is ingeniously done, It keeps you on your toes and I think the ramp up is satisfying.

That being said there are some glaring issues that I think could be resolved to push this game from good to great.

For one, I think there needs to be a higher variety of customization options for NPCs, the customization is fine, but basically right away you have identical looking students and teachers. Just maybe ten more options in each category would go a long way here. Let me us set a wider variety of wearable uniforms or let us have a no uniform option or and add a variety of casual clothes that NPCs can wear.

Late game is full of prefab rooms/buildings, I was looking forward to building my own library but instead it's a prefab. It'd be nice if there were options that let me use my own rooms for buildings instead of prefab ones.

More starting maps would be great too. 

It goes without saying but a game like this would heavily benefit from some level of official mod support. That's the line a lots of these Indie management games thrive on, it would be be a benefit to both the community and the game in the long run.

Seriously a fun game, easy 8/10 from me

Let's School is a game developed by Pathea Games and published by Pathea Games and PM Studios, Inc.

The game offers some nice graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

Let's School overall, however, is an okay game to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a good sandbox simulation game and to play in short bursts

You play the head master of a primary/intermediate school semi quasi Chinese school. 

Build a school: The best part of the game, you build your school, either go wide or go tall. There are a lot of different types of class rooms and administration rooms and a few construction styles. You can build some really pretty schools with the tools provided. 

Manage a school: Hire staff, create a schedule and then start enrolling children. You then have one week to teach your kids before they have exams. The start of each new week brings a new season, which changes the environment visually and changes the students behavior, which is a nice way of keeping things fresh. 


Game length: Career mode involves money you run out of money, you lose. That’s fine. However you also have to research different class room types and various other things. That’s fine too. However towards the end of the tech tree it takes longer and longer to research anything. It’s designed to add difficulty sure, but it also felt like an intentional means of padding the run time. 

Another method of padding things out is expanding your ‘school range’, needing to send students out on expeditions to find new communities. The whole concept was just bizarre, and once more time consuming.  


Animations: At 3x speed you’re not going to notice these things. But playing at regular speed you’ll notice the animation quality is lacking. Lots of clipping through walls, doors, other objects, sims move in robotic fashion and some animations are just plain missing. All of these things are minor but if you’re an attention to detail person this may irk you.

-some 5 to 10 buck DLC so the developers can gain extra money and also have a reason to update this game
-Custom timetable management like the one to set set for breaks and periods and other thing in the timetable
-seeing each of your teachers timetable to see which classes they have
-speaking of timetables i'd love to see more periods during the even 5 classes and a morning meetup would be Awesome
-setting custom classes for periods for you Students E.g 1st period they have class 1-1 and the second period they have class 1-2 to add an extra management use to the game (I still think you should be able to set a class for the whole year to a class but it would just save space when let's say class 1-3 is gone to Physics lab and class 1-1 can use that room)
-and just more things to research as I really do think its a fun aspect of the game


At the end of the day it's the developers choice to update the game but as this just turned to one of my favourite games I'd like to see some new thing

Think Theme Hospital in a school setting, except they've worked out how to enable multiple floors and the students don't get Bubble Head. Management is a case of juggling timetables and activities, ensuring enough classrooms and specialist facilities (eg: chemistry labs, toilets, staff room and so on) exist to fill the needs of the teaching and then filling the remaining space with cleaning supplies. Some aspects are a little clunky, especially class management, but once you understand the Japanese system of three years, each denoted with a number, and then classes having a number afterwards,  it makes more sense (so 1-1 means the first class of the first year, 3-4 is the fourth class of third year).

Building is probably most of the fun, along with the usual wait for research unlocks. Most of the environments are charming in their own way, with a unified aesthetic that works well, but the inability to interior decorate does grate a little, especially as the available carpets look so bad. I've also yet to work out whey pupils and staff will just walk through fences...

What Let's School nails is the ""one more minute"" hook of the management genre. It's 1am before you realise it's time to go bed, with just one more cycle tempting you. For the price, it's an excellent little game with a few ongoing bugs and issues, but if you like management sims this'll scratch the itch.",1700142152,1700142152,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

OK, fine, you want to know why you should (or shouldn't, idk it's your life) buy this game.

Well, for one thing, it's a rock-solid entry into the Tropico-like (or Prison Architect-like) subgenre of builder game. If you've played and liked games like that, this is one more.

For another, it has got a _ton_ of character. Because its developer, Pathea Games (best known for the My Time series, including my 2023 Game of the Year My Time At Sandrock), is based in Chongqing, China, they've gone with a distinctly Eastern vibe and style. The game's default currency is Japanese yen, and while you don't have to be a weeb to fall in love with the quirky visuals and ""every high school anime you've ever seen"" vibe with the students (I'm not a weeb, and I still smiled more than I perhaps should have), it does help.

So there you go, really. This has something to offer just about anyone who's even tangentially interested in its subject matter.

I do have a few small nitpicks—the translation leaves something to be desired (and some of the text is left in the original Chinese, but they're working on it), the mechanics aren't well tutorialized (if you've never played a game like this before, you will probably slam your head hard against it and bounce off its mechanics; go play Tropico 4 or Prison Architect first), and if you don't like pixel art, you're not going to like the simple visuals.

But absolutely none of those things are enough to put me off recommending this game. It's excellent. Worth every penny of its $20 price tag, and better still if you can get it on sale.",1698050485,1698050485,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a management sim where you build a school and take in students with different aspirations, and have to structure your classes around the students needs. you can automate student class assignments. 

I've beaten it on easy, medium, and hard now, and wish there was more game. But I can't complain, having gotten over 75 hours of play out of this game. It's been engaging. It does lag a bit sometimes in very late game stages. i'm going to play it at least one  more time.

There are a couple of bugs though. For instance, the fences don't actually keep students out and they just walk through it. Also, some things aren't translated like students I can trade for. However, if you've finished it once, it's really repetitive which makes it not really fun anymore

I also have a few suggestions; in the furniture section, I wanna select only star items or aesthetics but now I need to look through all of them. It would also really help if I could link multiple schools to multiple classes since some of them have the same things they need. I kind of wish there was an option to bulldoze all the items in a room and not just the entire room. As I unlocked things, I wanted to redo everything and had to delete it all manually.

Anime style school
Sims style building
Can rename nearly everything with funny consequences
Plenty of replayability, plenty of options and growth potential. 
Price point is fair

Con's

Tends to overheat CPU/GPU - make sure to limit FPS
Some performance issues
Some text isn't translated (yet)
Tutorial doesn't cover everything
Some events were confusing to complete

Closest thing you'll get to a anime school simulator, its got everything from school festivals to deliquents causing problems for your overly stressed and over-worked teachers.

Plenty of options, research to unlock new classes, buildings and even clothing options for your students.   Not to mention plenty of events, some of them bad such as earthquakes and fires breaking out,  its interesting and enjoyable, sure its got a few quirks and some minor issues such as not being fully translated, I ran into a few pages of untranslated Chinese text and a few problems which didn't have any easy solution or wasn't covered in the tutorials but overall, its not too bad and the price point is Ok too.

Having finished both scenerios available, its missing content for sure and honestly?

Every time I start a new game, the first 5 characters are always the same.

The game allows you to hire additional people, including the first 3 teachers + 1 cook, just like us. Makes us start playing the game with these 6 people carrying the whole game....
This means that the starting teacher given to the first 6 players will come out the same every time you start playing again.
Click to hire the first 4 people. No need to think too much..cheapest and most worthwhile..(never think of firing them)

Just more replay ability options, because when you do one play through you already did everything you could do in the game. Unless you want to design schools with different blueprints. Just wish there was an option to be able to do something new each time that does not entirely rely on blueprints or students alone.  They could make different themed classrooms for example.

-----
Micromanagement toward the end is a bit annoying. (Management Tree, Assigning Classes)
The management tree is awful, you find yourself scrolling back and forth to move management offices, and sometimes you can't even click a class/resource to move it on the tree.
There are only two maps.
The game is incredibly easy, they need to add new mechanics to make a game over possible. The only event that was some what catastrophic was an earthquake that occurred before I updated the building material from wood to steel.

I had to start this game from scratch three times before I was able to get a grasp of all the variables. But now that I have it has been a great game to play. It is really satisfying to get your school running smoothly and looking great. 
There is a whole lot of customization. You can have separate uniforms for each class, design your own logo, give each class and room a different name, also with their own logo, and you can make your school one giant building or a lot of little ones. There is also this part after a class graduates where you take a picture with them and you get to choose your pose and facial expression. That's fun. 
All the animations for the students and teachers are fun to watch, and it's cool how each student and teacher has their own portfolio. You can watch the students interact with each other and commiserate.
There is one singular song in this game, so playing for long enough can get a little mind melting. You can always turn off the music and listen to something else, but it is nice to have something in game to vibe with. 
Moving around can get a bit frustrating, but that may just may be me being used to Sims controls/not used to PC controls.

And believe when I say deep I mean it! To give you a taste of the complexity let me explain what you need to do to properly teach a student:

First of all you need to explore an area on the map. You can do this by sending a class on a trip to this area. If the trip was successful (there are text adventure style obstacles on the way) and your school meets all the requirements (train station, dormitory etc.) you can open an admission office in this area. Now you can support the neighborhood with money or teaching points so more students will apply. If you have enough students you can open a class. But not every student has the same needs. Depending on the college the student wants to go he needs teaching in different subjects so you need to plan your classes and their timetables carefully. You also need to hire teachers that are capable of teaching said subjects. And be careful that you have enough management capabilities for all your classes and your teachers.

The game has an amazing feature that allows you to create management hierarchies in an organization chart in which you need to organize all your management offices and their subsidiaries and decide who is leading a certain office, class or research lab and how much management capabilities you as headmaster want put into this certain subsidiary.
This organization chart style management works really great and a lot of city builder style management games would really profit from this!

The game is a little rough in some corners and although there were no game breaking glitches or softlocks or something I wonder if early access would have been the better choice when releasing the game in this stage. The translation sometimes doesn't make sense, there are a few glitches here and there and although some areas of the game are filled with content others would really profit from a few more items. Like why are there 12 styles of windows but the lemon tree is the only indoor plant I can place? Believe me I have that fools garden song playing on repeat in my head for weeks!

Other than that I have nothing negative to say about this game. The game does a lot of things really right and is amazingly innovative genre wise in a lot of areas. It's mostly really well balanced!

I had tons of fun in the 50 hours it took me to complete the campaign and there are still a lot of things to do. I think I'll need 20 additional hours to upgrade my school to look like I wan't it to look and reach the other two winning conditions (You can choose one winning condition for the campaign when starting your school but after finishing one you can of course still work on remaining two). There are also a few areas I haven't explored and school features I haven't gotten into like the dormitory so all in all you can easily get 100 hours of fun out of this game!

Processor: Intel Core i5 -7500 | AMD Ryzen 5 5600X
Memory: 16 GB RAM
Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX1060
*My setting :
Ryzen 7600
Memory: 32 GB DDR5 CL32 6000Mhz
Graphics: Nvidia GeForce RTX3060Ti
The last i checked, Ryzen 7600 is just as powerful as Ryzen 5800 for gaming, but less for creative works.
So at the beginning of a new game i set the graphics setting to MAX
I got 70 fps, and it stutters, the fps went up and down.
OK i get it, somehow it is GPU heavy... I asked for how to make the game run 60 fps.
I set everything to lowest possible. Good, the game run smooth.
It doesn't looks much different with Max setting IMHO, just less (or no in my case) foliage and shadow.
Until hitting the endgame. I have like 100 students and 25 teachers.
It stutters, OK now it hitting my CPU. It went down like 50 fps. And doesn't feel smooth at all.
I'm not claiming I know how to make an efficient game programming, but the performance I do feel substandard than games in the same genre. I love building games, it feels like you name it, i probably has it on my library.
Including RimWorld people often sought the similarities.
I think it is closer to Prison Architect than the RimWorld, as it doesn't have one thing integral, a story teller.
Also you can't have limited control over the NPC like the RimWorld. 

There are things breaking the immersion.
1. Like the NPCs stuck at the school gate when raining. The animation is like want to open an umbrella but they don't.
Repeating all over.
2. Students bypassing the wall like a ghost just to buy something from the school supermarket.
3. Suddenly the students can't access the drink, toilet, and food. It just at the next door and i have like 50% more than the maximum capacity...

And what i hate the most is the way the class is always randomized every new year....
I've named the class like Evergreen 1, Evergreen 2, Evergreen 3 each to note their grade.
But the game just ignore that and randomize it all over again, including the class name...
WTF lah.
Later, we could automatize the class selection for each district from where our students went from. So, for example now i could select the Evergreen 1-3 to be the select classes for any students from Archimedes district. Good, it will still be randomized but at least I'm hands free now.
Good?
No, because each district can only cater like 15 students at high popularity. It is like half the class capacity.
And for idk reason, it can't be more than that.
And they will hog the lab all by themselves. So for a district, you'll need :
3 classes for each grade.
6 labs for specialized study program
Mind you there are some labs that can be only build once like the computer lab, and the student lounge.
And then what? Build it right ?
Yes, I build a building each for each district.
To get all of these up and running, i'll also need like 6 managers to cater all the enormous number of facilities. Yes, even the toilet, food store, cafeteria, playground, bike parking lot, etc. they all need managerial capacity.
So at the end it is like I need around 10 teacher to cater 10 to 15 students. How it is not mind boggling. Better using personal tutor than this.
The Student to Teacher ratio is getting ridiculous.
Some of the Teacher is better renamed as Manager or a Worker than teacher.
Some of them don't need to teach at all, like managing the shop, cafeteria, security?
They can manage and teach at the same time but why? Without them, i didn't lack of teaching capacity. Because there're still managers, and homeroom teacher. I still end up profitable despite all of these ridiculous things, which is also mind boggling.
My balance was like +180K with -60K expense. Played the standard difficulty, idk how it went at harder diff.
My Cafeteria, School shop, and Sweets shop each generate more revenue than the student tuition fee.

And the last straw is how everyone getting chubby at the end.
Like everyone.
I hate how they looked when chubby and giant at the same time.
The Character is like 2 times the size normal, including the umbrella..... The umbrella looks squeezed up.
And when my main character took the commemorative photo? It looks awful.
And oh, some students just refuses to sit they sit, stand, sit, stand all over again. The hell is this.
Someone said, oh, sell Tom Yum Goong at the Cafeteria. It will counter the effect.
Fine it did work..... too well. Now the NPCs are Weak.
Now the NPC looks like a straw man... Face palm....

Also i want to point the chara customization? It only works at the beginning of the game.
And the game doesn't have workshop content.
So i must deal with all oddities happened, and the poor game performance at the late game.

The game is cute, it looks pleasing. But the game hates me.

Edit 1: My memory CL was wrong, went looking the box.
Edit 2: The game have better performance now.
So in comparison, it was like 150 occupants (students and teachers combined, minus pets) before stutters,
after an update it raised to 250 occupants. And now i could say it can handle 350 safely in 60 fps, using my PC. And i'm playing the graphics at medium or high without worry a nuclear meltdown right now. This alone, changed the not recommended to recommended but I took my time to test things out before changing the review. I started a new game solely for that, a school with a lot of students.
1. NPC stuck when raining has been fixed.
2. Bypassing the wall has been fixed.
3. Idk it has been 100%, but i think it has been fixed. Some students still have difficulty to reach their needs. But not as catastrophic as before.
4. Class still cannot be locked.
5. Student to Teacher ratio has been better. Now, more student will enroll from a district. Still a bit weird that we don't have Janitor, tenants, or Security which aren't teachers.
6. I still hates chubby, giant, and weak appearance, but the occurrence has been toned down, by lowering the food chance to get the status. I wish i could eliminate them all together.

All and all I'm happy to change the review to Recommended.
Although some things like the advertised clubs, workshop content, then class locking, and no (pet, chubby, giant) statuses are still a minus factor to me.",1690599166,1693247419,True,0,0,0.464053750038146973,0,True,False,False

The graphics are cute and simple which brings its own sort of charm to the game and the game play itself can be a little tricky if you don't know what you are doing (as in it is not really explained well) but once you have got it down you a breeze through it.
As I said, I have enjoyed playing it and I look forward to seeing how it grows. I do have two little things I could nitpick at and that is to do with classroom year numbers and if you delete a classroom, it misses a number i.e. 1-1, 1-2, delete classroom 1-2 and make a new one, it now becomes classes 1-1, 1-3.
The second thing is the class years jump around. You could have 1st years on the bottom, 2nd years in the middle and 3rd years on top but once those 3rd years leave those classrooms become the new 1st year, the middle becomes 3rd years and the bottom becomes 2nd years.

Things just seem to happen in some parts and that's honestly ok, it's a bunch of snags but the whole game itself is amazing. I'm sure with a comprehensive polish this game will far surpass alot of similar management games in it's genre. 

The fluidity of game play is 9.5/10 - very replayable mini gameplay loops. Get more students, learn to manage that in a increasingly larger school. Funny animations - funny interactions with NPCs - therefore the core of the game is fantastic. 

Placement, planning of rooms, and associated UI is a little rougher - 7/10 - very rough around the edges, but core is very good. But not too much fault here - UI is still very difficult but I hope it's looked into more. 

Visuals are like 8/10 - I get some of the animations are a joke but I'd like to see more pathing animations put in. Students still walk through walls every once in a while.

Game is great, but probably wait for an awesome Steam sale before purchasing.. maybe 30% or more.

Game came out with a lot of bugs, but aren't really game breaking. I have not encountered a game breaking bug, mostly graphical which is annoying.

I love to entertain myself in making a great environment  in city builders, one that really feels realistic and alive. While I can do that in the game, it does take a lot of effort to do so since the pathing behaviors of the characters in game are still flawed.

You can spend hours and hours in building your pathways, entrances etc and no one would use it. The AI now has the sims using the shortest path available to go to specific places, even if it's the tiny little crevice in between school buildings. 

I have found a way to prevent that by overusing bicycle parking lots, which is the effort I was talking about earlier.. But adjusting the pathing AI would do wonders... Would make all the designing and planning worth it.

If you are into just managing your school to get the maximum benefit for revenue etc, it can easily be done if you want to.. But game can be over in 3-4 hours this way. 

If you want to spend hours and hours planning and designing like I did, don't bother. Game is a 10 hour game max. I have spent 129 hours on this game just to end up being frustrated because my sims aren't going to the paths and doorways I set out for them unless I block off tiny crevices in the most awkward of ways.

I am still recommending the game because it is a lot of fun when you start, I am hoping that Pathing updates are done and as well asset editor updates are done.

As they get good grades and graduate your influence in those communities grow. There's a management system, research; basically all the basics. But as of right now that's about it.

There are many things that are lacking currently.
- The research tree is rather small.

- The building aspect of things is terrible and needs improvement. Rotating items in game is the biggest issue when it comes to building. You're also unable to center things if your room is odd-numbered (most items take up two tiles). Not to mention if you move rooms around, the camera acts funny like it's almost as though you're not moving the room with your mouse (which is how it should be), instead you're moving the room based on the W/A/S/D and where the room is relative to the camera placement at the time of moving the room. It's weird. Furthermore, the things you put on the walls of the room stay where they are even after the room is moved. So if you have decorations on the walls, they'll stay floating in the air until you demolish them, or until you get frustrated enough with being unable to place something the way you want it because something that's floating in the air is stopping you. Oh not to mention, despite most of the objects being two or more tiles, when you rotate something you're rotating the object on an axis, which makes placing large objects like stairs VERY frustrating to place.

- Once you've built the infrastructure to make a successful high school, the game becomes too easy.

- The management side of things, where different teachers hold different management figures is particularly frustrating because they're limited by their own ""management figure"", so you end up having to make eight+ management offices. In my current save, I have ten management offices for roughly 350 students. Not to mention, for whatever reason, these management offices have this weird fluctuation thing. I simulate one day and everything is fine, everything is below the max management number for the management office. But turn to the next day and for whatever reason I have two management offices that cannot handle their capacity, although it was fine the day before.

- I also dislike how whenever a group of students moves to another year, the room they occupy goes with them. For example, if you make a classroom for Year Ones, that classroom will stay with that group of high schoolers meaning that you will need to create a new room for a new batch of Year Ones. This is annoying especially in late game because if your high school has its hands in every community in the game, you're constantly having to make new classrooms to accommodate all the new Year Ones. I would have liked it more if I had to make a new classroom for Year Two and Year three, so that I can keep my floors organized (Year 1 = first floor; Year 2 = second floor; Year 3 = third floor). 

This game has good fundamentals, however, it's still very new and I know that there will eventually be updates that will makes this game better. But as it stands right now, I wouldn't recommend it just yet.",1692230862,1692230862,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sure this is a Japanese theme school organization and sim game in elementary school (grade 1, 2, and 3) or maybe it was compressed enough to be those year levels instead of highschool or senior (idk) also i considered it a elementary school since it has high demands on hand sanitation not to mention Comfort Room/restrooms are the place where you wash your hands not somewhere you'd place somewhere random to meet ends, hanging lunchboxes that were high demand in the mid game and a playground. sure lets keep those elements in mind.
 
Hanging lunchboxes are on high demand during the midgame due to the admission of students mostly bringing lunchboxes instead of buying in a canteen, sure you can avoid them but most of the time you'd be addmitting anyone at this point when you go along and you're confident that they'll pass and discipline them enough to be a outstanding student, but making your classroom or somewhere else be placing those hanging lunchbox everywhere. It doesn't makes sense to me if its possible if you can just place it beside your desk, or within the person's bag which will save space and aesthetically pleasing

Hand sanitation, sure cleaning hands are ""good"" but how come that it is one of the major requirement for building a campus where there's accessible bathrooms that can be used for sanitation. Or a greater option will be having a shop that can sell sanitizers that can solve this.

Playground, this is something you can solve with an arcade room, but some people wants a realistic feel of a Japanese school, and there is a rare case there's an arcade within the campus itself, sure playgrounds are great and there are also other decorations that can solve this issue but i don't see it as a feature that could make the students rebel for more playtime like is this like a sweat shop?

Walls, this is a big issue for me, some walls or fences are just useless, they're not limiting the access of students within the area, especially when you're making a campus with strict pathways especially when you're trying to funnel students to a metal detector before going into class. So far metal detectors doesn't detect anything like guns, we're not in the US but it is realistic to have those walls be inaccessible to students.

Security is when you make the students more disciplined and also finding bad students getting caught, but there is one feature on security that feels useless and also not placed right and those are the metal detector doors. Those metal detector doors are placed within a wall not a separate to a door, its the door itself. metal detectors are placed after a door or entrance, just like in hotels, malls, or universities, this should be a separate feature instead of being one with the doors and windows category.

Lights are a bit more dim than it should be, sure the light levels are important and also depending on the kind of lighting it should be brighter and also more necessary, but most of the lights are dimmer than it should, making well lit hallways feels like there's always a deadspot no matter what kind of lighting you add.

Auto scheduling doesn't solve the ""auto"" part, which is just a lazy thing to do, but if you're managing a campus of a thousand students, it'll be a complicated tedious task.  instead you'd be pressing that ""auto"" scheduling would help in these kinds of situation. but sadly still need improvement.

The outside fence is something you can't remove, making parking lots and bicycle shed lacks a bit of immersion. 

Research is still not enough, you'd be finish on year two if you know what you're doing.

Loans are way too forgiving, making the loan as a savior than a risk which is more of a risk realistically.

Cherry/sakura trees are rare and once you remove them its gone forever, its sad.

tiles are very blocky, and there are tiles that are blending with each other which is great but i wish this is applicable to some tiles and also having like a canal beside a sidewalk? maybe in the future.

The steel wall can make the posters disappear, especially the promotional posters

Some of the decoration glitch through the wall, but not entirely, just the sides like the cleaning ones and the shelves.

Elevators are soo op, making the students just tp to one place to another

So far thats all. sorry for the broken english and grammar. Nonetheless I love the game and I'm very excited what this game has to offer in the future

It simply becomes overwhelming without proper pacing. Once I did pace and plan my game, it became much more manageable. This should not be a requirement though.
The end game is still lack luster and requires content. The biggest requirement for this game for me is having unique interactions between students and teachers. As many as they can be so it'll be interesting to simply look around the school.

Here are some of my recommendations and Suggestions
-I require more planning modes. I played my game with 100% refundable so that I could build anything I want then when I learn that I build it wrong, I can simply 'undo' and sell. Copying rooms is a great tool but sometimes it doesn't fit the floor plan and you'll be forced to sell everything. Losing money due to that sucks.`
-Item movement improvement. It is so annoying having to hold left click before moving an object when you have to move an entire row of objects one block. It is so much easier to just sell then build again which you will lose money if not 100% refundable.
-Bigger Lands. I personally don't like building up. I like building wide but with all of the facilities and wonders. I barely managed to fit them all. I want to build paths, maybe a personal building for each education type. A separate dorm building. The land is simply too small and the wonders are too big.
-Bridges. I built a bridge connecting the 4th floor of two of my buildings using platforms and it looked terrible. Either I didn't explore it enough or the tools are just not there yet. 
-Money Research. After researching everything in the tech tree, the research room and its researchers become useless. They should be able to research and earn money instead.
-Trading. Why is there a limit to the amount of cash and education points they have? Especially when they seemingly have unlimited when you go back to them. It is so annoying to trade 300 education points for 15000 cash multiple times.
-The fundamental game is bad. What I mean here is that the game has fundamental problems that could be fixed in many ways or simply change entirely. 
An example is the teaching plans. Although it automates applicants and sets them into rooms, forcing each admission office to have 3 dedicated classrooms suck. This forces schedules to overlap and require the player so much more teachers which eats away at the profits. This technically works since teachers also staff the security, shops, and cafeteria. It'd be better to have different job types with their own stats but that would lead to several teachers not being assigned to anything. We could allow a mixing of students in the teaching plan and provide a secondary room when the primary room is full.
This could also be fixed by changing how admissions work. I know it's part of the progress but having an entire class only have 6 students after I developed its teaching plan does not bring me joy. Maybe change how student application works. Add more details to the students and variety in each location as well as making more of them. Force us to accept bad students due to requiring money and allow us to pick and choose students that provide more benefits when the situation is steady. It should be okay to not accept all students.
Better yet, we could choose all students and then we'll create a separate delinquent building where all the bad students are and give them special classes in their curriculum. This creates more variety in gameplay and some roleplaying, ie assassination classroom type of building separation.
We could also just have random students with different goals in a single administration office. It shouldn't be that bad to start the game with an extra art and sports teacher.

I didn't explore this much but the Headmaster POV should be capable of usage. We can interact with objects, students, and teachers but there was this one spot that was dirty and I really wanted to clean it myself using cleaning equipment nearby.

All in all, good game but I don't see much replayability as of now. Will be waiting eagerly for future updates.",1692080127,1692080127,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The most difficult part is keeping management levels high enough without building a million management offices. Knowing how to lay things out is a little difficult the first time, because you don't know how big rooms will end up needing to be after your school grows. Balancing schedules gets easier if you plan your student rosters well.

If you like city builders and other management sims, this'll be worth the 20 bucks for 15-20 hour run, but the game feels unfinished. Not in a ""this is an unplayable glitchy mess,"" but more in the sense that it clearly has content and QoL that has yet to be added.

-The game talks about clubs, but they're being added in a later update. Obviously this will change later, but it felt very weird to have a ton of facilities and sports available and not being able to make any clubs or sports teams,
-Auto-teach AI is terrible, often forcing me to rearrange the schedule anyway to accommodate for some students' needs
-Headmaster and Ms. Lin can only ever raise their proficiency to around 40 before they become a waste of time and resources. Considering how prominent and present they both are, it would feel better to have a way for them to raise their training threshold or just simply start them at a higher base.
-The default refund value for stuff is 80% for some reason?? If you misplace something that's just a net loss of money. 100% should be the default
-Only two locations, and one of them has the headmaster's office in a very awkward location behind the school
-Rooms often have size requirements that do not match the actual room you need for them (the debate room is a big example)
-Game doesn't punish you for filling rooms with nonsense in order to satisfy needs and aesthetic requirements, potentially leading to situations where you have immensely cramped areas if you're concerned with preserving as much space as you can (which you'll want to do early on)
-Tons of bugs still need to be patched, even after hotfixes.

1) It would be nice to see what items are the best selling from the store tab, just a more practical function to decide what to sell to students. 
2) I find it hard to fins the students who have demerits more than 4 times because the names of the students are SOOOO SIMILAR (I play in traditional Chinese, when you have more than 200 students you cannot easily locate who to persuade withdrawal) Please create a sort for demerits on student screen.
3) It would be nice to add some joint school competition elements, maybe music or sport competition, which could result in students boost or relationship effects.
4) Adding different objective/survival mode would be great, specific goal oriented, sort of like challenge of managing a school with bad students, or build a sport excellence school, or survival mode of reaching certain amount of cash flow. 
5) Other than in principal's view, maybe students view could be nice too, player can be that specific student to be in school.
6) Bugs exist, my students were occasionally stuck at the science tower. Please follow up on those.

It's a really great game from Pathea. I was addicted to My time at Portia like Let's school but sadly not Sandrock for me. Please keep it up Pathea crew!

Honestly there are no real negative things, just some quality of life features, but a few things I would like to see maybe reworked:

The Management System:
It's a little clunky. When you get to ""endgame"" it's really hard to sort through it and assign certain classes and other things to the managers. If you didn't plan it out from the start it can take quite some time to everything organized.


Let the students change classrooms:

Things I would love to see in the game:

1. Longer terms/years, even if they make it a customisable option. Even two weeks per year would be a big improvement.
2. More schools to choose from! Having only two possible builds/locations is a real restriction as the layout of the plots ect. really affects how the game plays out. It would also help keep the game fresh if you had, say, five schools to choose between.
3. Clubs, which the devs have already confirmed that they are going to do. 
4. I would love it if the different districts didn't always have kids with the exact same aspirations, ect. E.g would be nice if all the Theatre Boulevard kids weren't all bad tempered bullies that want to get into acting. 
5. I would love it if there was some way to lock the grades of the classrooms. I understand that this is meant to be a Japanese style system where the Classroom automatically goes up every year, but it really is a pain to have to reorganise them manually every term. I personally like to build my schools in such a way where the relevant grades and special classrooms (e.g Biology Lab, Debate room ect) are in their own buildings. 
6. More scenarios, more goals, more furniture/carpet, more outfits and hairstyles for the Headmaster/Headmistress, more food for the cafeteria, more cats variations, just more more more!",1691494378,1691494378,True,4,1,0.565217375755310059,1,True,False,False

It kind of reminds me of some of Kairosoft's titles--however, this game is refreshingly complex compared to many of its rivals. For example, each facility placed increases administrative strain on you, the Headmaster--so you are compelled to create administrative departments, led by qualified school staff. And you get to name those departments, and give their leaders fancy titles. This can eventually lead to a sprawling (but oh-so-satisfying) bureaucratic apparatus of departments answering to departments answering to departments. Imagine the paperwork!

I have to give serious props for the graphical design, and attention to detail. There are small things, like how each student has a book bag that they hang on their desks during classes, or how only certain students will actually bring their own lunches, and when they do, those lunches actually appear on the wall as objects. Or how the various forms of transportation students use to get to your school---by train or by bus or by bike---are rendered. It's all very... cute! And the art style is simple, vibrant, and comforting. 

Of course, you can tell that it's not strictly feature-complete. The end game is pretty aimless, for example. The game could do with some more challenge, especially once you overcome the initial financial difficulties. It is currently way too easy to schedule classes to guarantee everyone passes a given semester. And some mechanics--like school security, guidance counselling, extracurricular activities, and student relationships, are only half-implemented. But the potential is certainly there.

As it is, Let's School is a lovely school management simulator, with great visual design, a lot of charm, and an okay simulation. Its difficulty leaves something to be desired, and its as-of-yet unimplemented features might turn you away, but honestly, I think it's absolutely worth the price on novelty alone. I have never attended a high school in Japan, nor any other country for whom this game was obviously inspired by. But I can't help but leave every session of this game feeling oddly nostalgic, like I've just relived a pleasant memory. Soooo... yeah!

The first thing to note is that the developers are Chinese, and therefore the school simulation reflects that of their culture. IMO, the UI still needs a bit of polish for a western audience, but it may seem perfectly logical for the dev team. 

I do like the ability to move and copy entire rooms around, that makes things very easy to reconfigure as you start to get more students, but moving students into different classes to focus on their aspirations and course load seems awkward. One other thing that I would like to see is pausing the game while in the build menu, or having pop-up windows suppressed when in the build menu as there are times when a pop-up will prevent you from placing or moving an object to where it needs to go.

I loved demo version, but I played on an old PC that had trouble keeping up with the game. Now, with the new pc and 16 RAM it's even more amazing. 
Even though on the new PC game havent't crashed once, I greatly appreciate auto save as I don't have to think about saving while playing.

Was bit worried that all the good parts were put just in the demo. Nope, so much more greatness. You basically can build boarding school if you want.

One thing I dislike is build mode. Specifically roofing. On one hand I appreciate that the menue in build mode is slimmed dow by putting carpeting, collumn and roofing options in separet selection that you see once pressed on the for example roofing,but at the same time it means more clicks as each time you end up going for a selection. Also, I'm not paricularry interested in spending a lot of time making roofs, so auto roofing or something more intuitive would be appreciated.

I love how interactive it is and the dynamic changes it takes when approaching builder simulators. Being able to interact with the students through the headmaster role and the teachers is something I was not anticipating. I appreciate this because it feels more real in a school environment. 
The building system is very easy to navigate and easy to understand. I love the different styles available to choose from. I wish you could change the floor colour or style, if someone does know how to do this, please let me know because the brick building with that ugly ass teal is not winning hunny. 
Unlocking new things comes easily but not in a way that makes the game boring. Changing colours of these items would be something nice in the future, but the one styles/colour of these unlock-able items does not take away from the game. 
Something I would love to see later down the line is more grades in the school, or you get to choose if you want an elementary, middle, or high school. I think that would be a fun addition to the game. 
I would also love to see a non-binary option in the character creation would be fun as well, and inclusive of course!

[h1] This is my first time reviewing a game, so I’m just gonna highlight noteworthy things (that imo make or break this game for someone): [/h1]

- [b] Designing buildings and facilities [/b] ; to get this out of the way, the building function doesn’t go down to the nitty gritty details, but it’s still pretty good customisation regardless ― you just gotta think in a chonky mindset; what I loved the most was planning what facilities I’d like to build next + where, and saving up funds to build it :D 

- [b] Not everything is intuitive [/b] ; another plus for me because I love learning about the best mechanics to things in a game, so figuring out how to get my teachers to earn a specific license or how to improve my students’ learning was exciting ― the discord server has a lively community so if you run into any questions feel free to ask! I just found it more fun to learn things alone

- [b] Choice to min-max or be aesthetic [/b] ; exterior wise my school is gorgeous, but interior wise.. uhhhhh yeah I’m a little guilty of min-maxing some classrooms (like the students can walk through furniture who cares :/ ) ― but the ability and resources given to you to make your school aesthetically pleasing both inside and out is definitely making someone out there very happy

- [b] Can get laggy [/b] ; I have an old stinky laptop so it’s no big surprise to me that a game can’t run perfectly, but it definitely caught me off guard when everything started out so smoothly… let’s just say that I dread seeing my 500+ students and 200 staff now…

- [b] Can get buggy [/b] ; this game is new! expect it! some bugs are more enjoyable than others, but don’t worry the team rolls out bug patches pretty quickly ― goodbye talking umbrella cat, we just weren’t made to be :(

- [b] You don’t have to be a perfect headmaster [/b] ; there’s no consequences to running the school however you’d like, just don’t run out of money (game ends and you have to restart from last save file) ― call me a bad headmaster, but I don’t care if bullies stay in my school after 7 demerits, they’re rich so I’m moving them to their own building with a stupid amount of security cameras so I don’t have to deal with them lol

- [b] Watching students interact and learn [/b] ; y’all I have so many gay couples in my school idk what I put in my water ― watching your students chat with each other is cute, there’s confessions that happen and you get pinged to watch it (totally not stalking yup yup), and seeing your kids earn full education stats feels so good

Basically, I encourage you to give this game a try if you love micromanaging and can deal with some bugs for now  <3 This is a good game to take seriously or to mess around, it’s your choice! You’re the headmaster!",1691290830,1691290830,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fairly casual if you want to play that way, but has the ability to go higher with your aesthecic construction and path to your goals plus starting in communities of different conditions after your first schoo.

Gameplay is forgiving for beginners due to the ease of rearranging things (moving a gym is easier than building a bike rack), with the tactics being more about getting the money and resources (in this case accolades for student success) faster so you can build the stuff you want faster. I only lost one when playing the demo, but definitely got better and better as time went on. At the end of my first school I was ready to go for challenges for sure. 

You can restart on harder conditions, or try to build specific kinds of schools which is where your replay value comes from. Prison-like school with zero mercy, slum school with the bare minimum, traditional Japanese styles, modernistic and futuristic, and emphasis on certain fields like artschools, scientific centers, literary centers, or athletic centers specifically by being selective about what communities you draw students from.

[h1]The game[/h1]
Let's school is a simple management game with a really nice atmosphere.
The game lets you create your own school director which you can choose to walk inside your school with in third person mode. You can decide the dress code for your students and create a school emblem. You have been chosen to build a school up from scratch, the only thing you've got is your trusty assistent and an empty, broken down, building. The game is mostly focused on managing the people so that the students are able to get the best grades and pass their exams. This will make you get rich and unlocks more possibilities.

[h2]Small recap after playing[/h2]
At start of the game, the tutorial can use a few tweaks, but it clearly allows you to understand the game with ease. To be honest, the game is a bit too simple, for the ""difficult"" events that makes your students possibly fail or succeed are not that gamechanging at all. The biggest difficult task at this moment in the game is managing your school rooms and their managers. But that's only for a bit before you can easily train all of your staff members, get your students to perfect grade and earn a lot of money. 

The game has great features and it really lets you zoom in on needs of both student and teacher, but it can really use a lot of improvements before the game gets challenging like some of the two point games or well.. any other management game out there.

[h2]Pro's[/h2]
[list]
    [*]Cute, happy, easy to learn
    [*]Great atmosphere and lovely music
    [*]Different students with different educational needs
    [*]Third person mode, walk with your director through your school
    [*]Customizations before and after the start of the game, you can decide the clothing options for students of each class
    [*]A world to ""explore""
    [*]Big research tree (but it really needs to get bigger)
    [*]A lot of cats
    [*]The developers have a road map so that means there is a future
[/list]

[h2]Cons[/h2]
[list]
    [*]Too easy after a few graduations
    [*]Too easy to make students succeed their exams
    [*]The game has a few minor bugs, but they are getting fixed
    [*]No option to make all girls or all boys schools
    [*]No students with more than 2 academic needs, they should add modes that make you start a ""regular"" school.
    [*]Interactions with other schools are a bit numb

There's a lot of little bugs and glitches here and there but not major that is unplayable. One glitch that is pretty annoying to me at the moment, is when some of the students/staffs get stuck in unreachable places and there's is  no way to pick them up and set them down elsewhere but to build staircase or have a door for them to access it. 

Definitely take your time to go through tutorial and learn the game. There's the management side of the game (like managing your facilities to reduce the headmaster's workload) that wasn't included in the tutorial and I had to figure it out myself.  Sandbox is also a challenge, I do wish there are more decorative items in the future and also access hidden/unlockable building styles. roofing was a tough one with the limited option. 

Despite the little cons that I have, I still do enjoy this game. It's been a while that a management style game can make me get totally immersed in. Overall I would rate it 8/10!

In all fairness it's more tailored to what I imagine Asian Highschool life is like and didn't really reflect the Australia Highschool system, but that being said I was able to use my IRL knowledge to help me problem solve throughout the playthrough which made this game pretty interesting.

The game isn't that hard. Even in difficult mode I was able to finish the game pretty easily. That being said the challenge of this game was satisfying my OCD when it comes to class timetables teacher management and optimal classroom building and layout.

I started playing the game pretty much the day it was released and in the short window I've already seen some good updates to the game. I definitely feel like this is a title too keep an eye on. That being said, if Simulation games are you're thing, its worth checking out.

- In the future I would like to see better use of the ""Teaching Policy"" feature. Currently it resets the class study plan every new intake. The problem is the ""auto"" feature can over-train your students forcing you to research new curriculum to keep your students busy. More control over the pace in which the subjects are taught in general would be nice, but even just saving presets that you can copy and paste every semester would be nice.

- Most other issues I can think of are probably just a reflection of the games early development, like the ""earthquake"" design having no impact and barely even noticeable if you arent looking for it. I've seen the developers are already working on changing this though so I don't think its a big deal.

- More meaningful interactions with the other schools might be nice. Or a way to revive a fallen school would be good. Esp if you want their legendary teacher, but the school closed before you could afford them. 

I could list a bunch of potential improvements, but this isn't to say that the game isn't good as it is.

I detracted from my score since it doesn't appear you can swap out the WASD controls for the Arrow keys (which as a left-handed mouse user is pretty annoying), the hiring process can be a hassle since it seems you can only prioritize hiring by subject type (and you use the teacher candidate pool for all your staff hires, even for positions that don't directly relate to teaching), and money seems to be a pretty consistent bottleneck to expansion in a way that doesn't feel paced with everything else. These are ultimately pretty minor issues though, and can be worked around.

 There are a lot of quality of life features that help make most gameplay satisfying, like being able to move rooms or cloning them as needed, and with just a little more work this game would be perfect.

It might look like I don't like the game from my comments, but there is workshop planned and regular updates right now with a promising roadmap, so I do believe this game will eventually hit a higher point very soon.

Personally I was hoping it'd be more complex, and there are a lot of systems that are bare bones. Things like students in one neighborhood all having the same goals and class requirements, modifiers that do almost nothing in the game like genius or forgetful, teachers that should have modifiers but don't (celebrities and rare spawn teachers), are just a couple of examples of not a lot being put into a system.

Celebrity teachers are way to expensive for how good it is to just hold onto teachers and get good managers / upgrade classrooms. For the money it costs to get 1 celebrity teacher, you can get like 5 new teachers and upgrade a classroom to max stars and still have money leftover.

There's a lot of cheese strategies to do in this game. Cleaning in this game is not punishing at all unless you completely neglect it. You really don't need to unlock the cleaning bots if you just place brooms in every room, because all staff members clean and you're going to have a ton of them walking around anyway. There's one poster that gives +8 stars to a room and decoration points, so instead of increasing the size of a room to allow for better furniture or decoration, you can just cover the walls and windows with this poster.

Decorations in this game are not good for min-maxing. I like decorating my classrooms to look pretty and unique, but I like min-maxing more, and all my classrooms are copy-pasted and crowded but that's what is optimal.

Security is so bad in the early game, but it doesn't even matter since you can manually stop truancy and it's really easy. There's too much punishment for expelling a kid (money lost vs no gain). Not saying you should implement gangs, but like maybe having troublemakers in a class should bring down overall conduct.

Stacking managers is too powerful. As a joke, I had a sub-manager under my facilities director just called the Toilet Director. In my late game school he personally saved me about 90 points in other categories with good perks and eventually also became in charge of tea rooms.

Water is too big of a priority. I hate making a tea room, just for me to slam down two big tea stations an hour later because I decided to admit 15 extra students.

The UI/UX could use a lot of work, there are times that I'm often fumbling around in menus looking for teachers to train, but getting to the training menu takes a while and I was trying to find some shortcut.

Just a couple of things to note above, I have more suggestions and issues with the game. I do programming / programming design professionally, so when the workshop comes out, I'll probably end up making mods that adds a lot of QoL and makes the game overall more difficult. But this game does have a lot of potential if it keeps receiving the care that it's currently getting.",1691149887,1691149887,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

You can build really high or wide, but be sure to remember that it might make your fans work overtime. 

There are lots of fun options for chaos too if you enjoy that kind of gameplay as well as relationships, though I have been too focused on the building aspect to get into that. They are also adding workshop access so soon there will be more decor options as well. 

Biggest draw backs: There are a few little things like the tram station or the fact it doesn't tell me students are missing a room to have class in until later, but these are minor irritations.

A lot of improvements have been more eloquently proposed by others before or is on the roadmap, and the devs are receptive to it. A thing I would wish is for the ability to upgrade some of the early game decors - while lights and more necessary equipment have straight up upgrade and replacements, a lot of the decors don't and thus as space is a valuable resource it is more meta to just spam certain more space-efficient and high stat decor instead. Speaking of space efficient, sports facility can use an improvement since they are very large size, has little class size and can only be built outside (so thus can't be stacked) - leading to sports school having immense size bloat if they want to serve a larger population (thus making it difficult to create sport schools early game or make a multi-disciplinary school with the limited space you have). Perhaps they can be rebalanced or have the maximum school area bigger. Also, the ability to make multiple classes share the same facility in a period if their class subject line up would be nice. And an important point is to read every item description (especially shop items) when plopping them down - things that may just seem like flavor text may actually not be flavor at all!

Also most of the staff and students is now spherical because of bubble tea and burgers, and my attempt to get them to go on a diet hasn't been very successful.

All in all, it is a very promising and surprisingly addictive game, and I eagerly awaits to see where it go  especially with the future roadmaps for clubs and extra curricular activities!

There is some clunkiness in the game that I'll just mention here:
- How can I view students by their demerits? It seems like I have to remember their name, then find them in the student list. 
- When building a room, there is 2 delete buttons. One deletes the room and everything in it and the other just deletes single items. They look the same, just their position is different. Luckily there is a confirmation on the former. 
- When copying a room, better hope you copied it near the center of the screen. Because if you copied from the option on the menu on the bottom right, you will quickly run out of space and drag your cursor out of the window.
- Trees count as objects that stop you from placing outside buildings. I kinda get it, but it is also kinda annoying. 
- The management/department view doesn't zoom out enough imo, so you have to slide items over, then pan the screen and then slide them the rest of the way.
- Whenever a classroom is unavailable, there isn't much notification except for the students being upset. Then you have to open the classroom schedule and look to see what room it is. If you have none of the rooms built at all, it will tell you, but if you already have it and just need another one, it will not say what you need on the quick view. 

There is some more, but that's what I can recall on the top of my head. I have still enjoyed the game though,

After you researched the 3rd reform, you get to unlock Teaching Policy under courses. Teaching Policy is an automated system where you are able to automatically enroll new students into classes. This is a godsent given how there are students coming from 13 communities late game (based on my run) and how you would have to manually enroll them into classes. However, the flaw of the system is that it only allows students from ONE community to be enrolled into ONE class automatically. The game doesn't allow me to set the same ONE class for multiple communities. For example, students coming from Verdant Valley and Groundshire shares the same ratio of knowledge points (50% Humanities + 50% Science). Hence it is a no-brainer for them to be implemented into the same class. 

However the game only allows you to choose one out of the two communities and you would have to manually enroll the other. This really is a huge MISS in terms of implementation because essentially the game is telling me that a) The automation system itself is not working as intended(?) or b) that I am playing the game wrongly and am supposed to be building 1 class for each 13 communities to allow for full automation. 

So I built a total of 39 classes (13 communities x 3 Years) and let me tell you it was total chaos HAHAHA. The amount of management, hiring of teachers and additional repeated facilities that I have to built to accommodate 39 different classes was something else. Yes the automation works perfectly when i create a class for one community but ultimately I don't think that it is a realistic way of managing a school. I hope that I can get a clarification from the dev regarding this issue but until then I guess i will suffice to manually enrolling my students",1691088785,1691088785,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-after completing the research tree, research offices became useless maybe extra research points may give school an overall teaching buff. (smt like %(research points/60))

When you get a monopoly on schools the other schools start to close down, which I do dislike since there's things that they offer unique to their schools.

At the beginning, it feels like it's going to turn into something very promising, then it never quite gets there. It's not like the school version of Prison Architect that it might seem at first.

Here is the biggest fault of the game:
The game tells you the exact marks a student will get for the weekly test at the end of the week.

Not an estimation. A hard Yes or No. So... So the only thinking here is, setup a schedule where they will pass it. Which is, relatively speaking, extremely simple. Nothing comes up during the week that changes the plan or you need to get some kids tutored or whatever. Were they passing on Monday? Then they'll probably be passing on Friday.

This just removes a lot of potential for fun situations, even replayability, as it puts most players in the same situation: every student passing every week. A perfect class for everyone all the time. 

Honestly, the biggest thing at fault here is the Neighborhood system. In order to recruit students, you need an admission office in a neighborhood. Only problem is, EVERY student in that neighborhood has the same education goal and a single education type (usually two subjects of either equal or unbalanced portions). So you just make a class per neighborhood, or at the very least merge overlapping study goals. And since the schedule tells you on monday if you'll win on Friday, you can see why this is an issue.

If this system was GONE the game would be much better. Because all students would need a generalized education, but certain kids would need more of a certain subject, then you could utilize the class system, which would be a lot more engaging and you wouldn't auto-win every test. Which makes continuing the game really boring, just auto winning every week, and knowing full well ahead of time that I'm gonna auto win. No kids are ever different, just, are they from X district and in X district's designated class? Then win.

While I'm here, here's a list of nitpicks which, as a whole, take down the experience quite a bit.

-Master Audio does not effect certain sound effects (the popping from earning education currency), nor does the Sound Effects bar OR the Sound FX bar, and I have no idea what the difference is between these two and why all three of them do nothing for the popping sounds. Guess I ain't watching Netflix without quitting this game, POP POP POP POP POP.
- Either school clubs aren't implemented properly, they don't work, or it's not adequately explained how to form and manage them. (Edit, they're not implement but in the roadmap - but it shouldn't be in the tech tree ingame til it's done tbh)
-Excursions only ever have 2 stops, regardless of distance, and these events start getting copy-pasted quite frequently.
-The implication that you send 25 kids on a walking excursion to a place over a day's walk away is absolutely insane lol. No bus excursion even though there's a schoolbus in the parking lot building? Weird as hell dude.
-Animations that repeat are very janky. Anything involving desk work makes the teacher's briefcase clip into their own head.
-Every kid has the same color backpack. Removes individualism, makes class color palettes boring.
-Speeches aren't very good. Not much to the minigame, not much room for experimentation, and very small buffs make it almost pointless.
-A great deal of furniture in rooms is either seldom used, or never used. Such as a few of the playground implements, or any of the workout tools. I couldn't even tell you if a lot of these even have associated animations, and if they do I never saw them.
-Security cameras are unlocked in the LAST tier of upgrades, which means you have to micro-manage every bullying event that happens for about an in-game year's worth of gameplay, which is about 10-20 hours. This sucks. At the very least put some low powered ones in the lower research tiers.
-Transferring students out of a class into another one is a generally painful experience with the current UI.
-4x4 and 5x5 stairwells don't seem to have a way to extend over multiple levels and ABSOLUTELY should. (Reportedly fixed, good guy dev!!)
-Students enter a mode where, if not interacted with by click then they will not learn anything and misbehave later on, and there's literally no way to reduce or automate this, and it's a massive pain in the lategame.
-The first area had a unique student pop up in both of my two playthroughs, and I've never again seen that happen lol.
-Competing schools close down, but I couldn't tell ya why, what threshold they have to pass for backruptcy. They also take their school-unique items and other benefits with them when they go (without warning) which is a kind of a dick move.
-No easy way to look at the selected period's best teachers, and where they are at that time.
-Scheduling for specialized rooms seems kind of Wild West.
-There's a 4X trading minigame with the other schools that I guarantee you will never interact with.
-Victory conditions are all bad and all easy, and Population Victory is far and away the easiest by seven thousand country miles. You will have 250 students (the highest for Pop Vic) significantly earlier than you're Educate 15 5 star students or have like 12k building worth and an Advanced Wonder.
-Students don't have enough to differentiate them, and more importantly, they are way too easy to universally satisfy.
-Regular Wonders say ""has 3 phases"" but it's literally only 2 phases unless you count ""is now built"" as a phase, which you shouldn't.
-There's no other staff for like cleaning or service jobs, it's teachers all the way down, which, I worked in a school, that's not how schools work.
-They have a height scaler, and yet kids don't grow between grades. Feels like a missed opportunity.
-Students have no collision with one another, which means layout is utterly unimportant cuz they can just clip through one another. 1x1 hallways no biggie, and I never saw a crowded debuff.
-You unlock a thing to automatically enroll students into specific classes, HOWEVER they don't let you recruit multiple neighbourhoods into the same class. This is pretty annoying, because in my current playthrough I have 3 neighbourhoods with an identical class ratio. So I have to manually recruit them or set up 3 classes for every year group with the identical timetable. It's really annoying.
-Speaking of clipping, why did you bother making cars that drive on the road if they are going to not stop at the crossing and clip through the students crossing the road. Vehicular child murder every day out here. Such egregious clipping is just really ugly.
-Moving a room seriously disorients the mouse controls, which usually goes out of the screen if you've got 2 monitors, and if not it still usually results in a stuck classroom due to the mouse being hard-stuck in one corner.
-Foundations can only be built in a 2x2 grid. One of the prebuilt faculty rooms literally doesn't come in 2x2 lol, and tbh it's just a little limiting in general.

And probably more I don't remember right now. I reached steam review character limit anyway lol

After the first term, the game gets a bit more in depth. Then it just stays that way, forever, and when your first dudes graduate and they go ""lol perfect marks for everyone, anyway, do that but again and forever"", I decided, yeah I don't think I'm having fun anymore.

It's neat, well implemented despite its flaws. But they need to drop neighborhood's simplifying the gameplay to ""one class per neighborhood"" or nobody's going to have any fun with the unchallenging auto-win testing and 100% accurate test prediction system. And since that isn't happening, you can probably skip it for now.

The game is fun, the price is pretty fair, and there's plenty of content.

But it is still somewhat unfinished. Some of the content was delayed, which is OK for stuff that are optional, like school clubs (although it is still very weird to keep the UI elements of it in the game, including the research tree telling you it is unlock-able when it isn't), but it's less OK for stuff that doesn't function correctly, like having a security building that you cant staff with actual security personal. You can place teachers there, but they don't actually do anything.

The tutorial is also pretty lacking, and there is no real ""endgame"", which isn't that bad for a ""creatuve"" type of game but it does hurt it.

The biggest problem is just the bugs. They don't make the game unplayable, but there are simply too many of them, and they make you question if the game even works the way it's intended, it's impossible to know if certain things really do what they say they do, or even do anything at all, either because of a lack of information or, again, because of bugs.
The easiest example is the Teacher's desk: it has a green area in-front of it which you would think is where it is ideal for students to sit, but nothing in the game explains it, and when ignored nothing seems to change. I got 4 different answers from different people as to what it does (or if it does anything at all) and this problem shows up many, many times.

On the bright side, the developers have already released multiple bug-fixes and they are planning on adding the content that was cut from the initial release, but I really wish they would've just delayed the game, or at least just make it an early access?

Overall the game is still fun in my opinion, and if things continue the way they do right now it might get much better. If it interests you and its on sell, I recommend. Otherwise only buy if this is the type of game you absolutely must play and have no good alternatives left.

Good management-type game with a school setting that is delivered in a reasonable way. And I do not intend to make the game sound bad by calling it ""reasonable"" - it is a strentgh of the game. Various aspects of school life found their way into the game. It allows you to design shedules for classes, train/hire/motivate staff, influence relationships (bullying, friendships, even love interests), trade with other schools (special objects, policies, staff, ...) and much more. But it typically doesn't force you to do so. You can micro-mangage all that stuff, but the game doesn't hesitate you to do so.

TL;DR: If you like managment games, enjoy the setting and don't mind casual (meaning: not-that-hardcorde-type) games - it's worth a buy. 20 Bucks seams pretty reasonable to me :)



Pros/Cons:
+ Micromanagement: Not really a ""must"", but a ""can""
+ School-Setting well done, yet not overwhelmingly complex
+ plenty of options to design your school
+ serious (not Two-Point Campus) (except the chemical laboratory, urgh)

Only complaint is that there appear to be a handful of features in the game that don't yet really do anything or have any affect on the gameplay or just haven't been added yet. Example: You can unlock 'clubs' or 'extra-curricular' but no such thing seems to exist once you've unlocked it. Also, kids can bully and be bad but their bad behavior seems to have zero affect on anything and expelling the kid does nothing but make you lose out on their tuition or reward money.",1690937321,1690937321,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And that's about it. Once you understand the marks every student needs to pass and you match the estimation, this game is just cake. 

The goal is clearcut, but I think it's just a little too clearcut. There are a lot of quality of life things that I think is also fully necessary. Having 280+ students and having to look through all of them to see who's sleeping is just...Really frustrating. 

Game's fun. Honestly, it really is a lot of fun. But it definitely needs some more variety right now.

They go on and on with all the minor to more important issues and while I have a positive outlook on this, it is because I like games I can play a 40-50 hours, get done with it, and move on without a single regret of the money I bought it for. Which, I feel this game does. 

The grind is rewarding but while some people are looking for surprises that removes the predictability, I like there's some added control to it. I like that I can focus on developing the aesthetics of the school. However as outlined in some other reviews, I wish I'd see the kids on the Tennis court or the running track. You need to explore neighbourhood to get other type of students that will join your school. There's a system where you can trade science/money/students and the game does a poor job explaining how this works.

I wish there was a little bit more mini games or have schools focused on sport or art then develop more that aspect of it. I just see so much potential to bring back players that was pretty much done after 20 hours.

The troublesome kids gives a lot more money and the only thing you need to do extra is punish and reprimand them and add little bit more staff on Security to prevent bullying. The moment you're done unlocking stuff it's just... not as exciting anymore and you don't have a lot of incentive on continuing your game.

Building, Management, and Simulation aspects were blended very well.
Surprisingly in-depth school management system, but not too complicated.

Overall, well polished game (no major game-breaking bugs so far).
Cute graphics. 

[The Bad]:
Clunky object rotation (ugh).
Overall UI has room for improvement.
Some of the animations are little wonky.
Could expand on neighborhood system or how students are recruited.
Not hard to have students pass the weekly test, could get repetitive.

You have to make timetables, manage and train staff, increase levels of satisfaction within the school and neighbourhoods surrounding it.

It's a pretty simple game, but there's always something to do. Money is easy to make, but I never have lots of it. Considering how much area there is to build on in this game, I think it'll be a long while until I'll make enough to be able to expand as far as I would want.

In the beginning you start with a single class of Year 1s. You have quite a bit of money, but it doesn't last long as you'll want to upgrade and expand, build new rooms, hire more teachers etc. 1 Week = 1 Year. Every Friday there's an exam and students move up. So in Year 2, now you have two classes (Y1, Y2). The following week three classes (Y1, Y2, Y3). By now you will have to have researched advanced courses so students in Year 3 can study more and pass their final exams. Then you have graduation photos and make lots of money, if you did well, which is good as that will allow you to invest into more buildings.
Upgrading buildings is simple and there's lots of flexibility. Genuinely, it's super calming and enjoyable for me.

Timetables are pretty straight forward too and once you make one for each of the class, it doesn't need to be touched too much, because the game tells you if students will pass exam by the end of the week or not. It simplifies the game, but makes the rest of the school management fun and not too overwhelming, because honestly, there's always more stuff to do. Send students on trips. Find new schools. Open up more admission offices. Get more kids into your school.Make more money, expand your buildings and keep hiring more staff. Students might be bringing in banned items, they might be fighting or sleeping class and everything sort of needs your attention.

It's light-hearted and failing is not impossible, but it's not easy. You will most likely be able to proceed with this game as long as you put effort into your building and keep a close eye on things happening around you. The tutorial is pretty damn good and intuitive. Introduces you will all mechanics as soon as they become relevant.

Simple on the surface this game has a lot to it buried just beneath the surface and you can quickly find yourself overwhelmed if you are impatient. But if you stick it out and take on challenges as they come, you will get there. The key to this game is Training. As soon as you can build a Staff Training room, do so, and use it constantly. Especially for Research staff, another key, never stop the research if at all possible. Yes, some of your staff will be in a near constant state of low morale but just keep training them in Research and Management until they grow out of it. Another tip is to keep a constant watch on your class rooms schedule. Just because all students are passing at the moment does not mean they will be the next day. This is another reason you will have to Research all the time. To get those courses your students need, but don't worry if a few fail here and there, its all part of the learning the game. And all in all this is a good time sink of a game. You'll be spending hours on it before you realize.",1690823749,1690823749,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a little rough around the edges, and how difficult and in-depth it goes it could really use a few QoL UI changes and probably an advanced tutorial, but I didn't mind figuring things out myself at all. This is a busy, difficult, micromanaging game with excellent visuals and a lot of heart. There are SO many mechanics, but it still manages to feel cohesive and enjoyable. The building is great, the game is endearing, and I honestly can't put it down. People comparing this to two point campus must be joking- I found that game so laughably shallow and dry. This is completely different, in a way that's actually fun and makes you care about what you're doing.

Career mode is quite difficult, with steep difficulty increases and a LOT of managing that the UI at times fails to support- especially with staff- and many mechanics you have to figure out from failure and just getting a better grip on the game. The difficulty is a little deceptive- you are actually fully in control of the pace of the game. You choose when to admit new students and what students those are, you hire who you need, and build at your own pace- which is important because money is tight. The game by default really encourages you to keep growing (leading to more difficulty) but you are 100% in control. 

That being said, if you're looking for a chill management game, where you don't have to deal with ""hidden"" mechanics or put a lot of energy into figuring things out, this definitely isn't it. But honestly for the price point, getting the game just for sandbox mode is a great option, the building is simple but great. The difficulty of career mode can also be customized, so you can make it easier if you find it too overwhelming. I would absolutely recommend this game to pretty much anyone looking for a new management game, both on sale and full price. It's probably my favorite game right now!

You need to build structures first, so some planning ahead is required, but then you can freely move rooms around. It's of course not realistic but makes squeezing in another classroom or reshuffling layout fun instead of feeling like work. Organizing classes and managing is also very well done. However I think its a bit too easy with pre-class buff. I've got kids in 2nd grade already with 100, 100 in their respective fields. Higher level classes require special rooms, different kids focus on studying different domains, so there's some juggling around but without even reaching tech tier 3 or any exploit I've perfected academic study? I think it would be good to tweak it so ""well optimized school"" gets good results but not over 100 in both fields before they even start 3rd grade.

There's a lot to build, luckily the game allows you to also build up instead of only building sideways like in rimworld. 

You need to set a curriculum for each first year class (they will just keep their old one once they go a year further) and you need to plan the lessons well, based on teacher availability (if you can't hire more) and based on how many of them will pass the finals. The school year is a week long and on each friday evening the students take the exam. They have different aspirations on what they want to do after graduation. Some want to go to a science college (forgot the name xd) and thus need more xp from science class. The city will also pay you the better they do on the exam plus you gain reputation in the regions the good students are from so more will apply.

The students also differ, some are forgetful and thus have reduced xp gain, some are rowdy and make a lot of trouble etc. Some are also richer than others and pay you higher admission fees. Rich parents though also have higher expectations from your school, not only on how well you teach but also on how good the star rating is (I think). The better a room is equipped the better it gets rated. There is a research system so you need to research new and more modern stuff.

The game has some drawbacks I found, it's slightly unpolished though I didn't encounter any major bugs yet and the performance could be better, at least it likes to overheat my pc (very easy to do if gpu usage hits 60%) though I can run it by fiddling with the graphics settings

All in all I can recommend it fully

You compete with other schools in other districts for students. Those districts are explored by sending a class there to do a field trip.

Just don't make the same mistake I did and accidentally add a dozen pandas to your school. Cats and pandas took over my halls.,1690747367,1690747367,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am a huge fan of strategy / colony sims (Age of Empires, Tropico series, etc.) and was really interested in this game with it's school premise and cute design. Lots of decisions, mechanics, and strategy as you build-up your school and win in one of three ways: academics, population, or building score. Very cute and I see the potential!

Cons:
I had a few game-breaking bugs in the span of two days:
- The tram station does not work and the students/teachers get trapped there.
- The cloud syncing stopped working and I lost ALL of my progress.
- The autosave feature caused my game to crash.
- Students are getting trapped in certain areas and their needs fall - which eventually causes them to drop out and you to eat the cost even though you need them to win.

I am writing this review during the first few days of this game releasing and even so, while annoying, this game is thoroughly enjoyable and I cannot wait to see it update!",1690744073,1690744073,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I didn't know this game came out until I saw it in my discovery queue and not gonna lie I though I was only going to buy three games this year from steam... well now it 4. go play it and also remember you can let the kids suffer.... don't do that unless your some kind of psycho then do it.

It is a little rough around the edges, there are a few bugs, and some weird pathing and clipping issues, but nothing severe enough to detract from the enjoyment of the game. 

Things I like: 
+ The general vibe is very relaxing.
+ The game encourages you to adopt a cat, which you can name. The cat wanders the campus grounds and takes naps on desks, it's just great.
+ The world is full of little details. I enjoy just looking around the map/level, watching buses go by, people walking around, leaves falling from trees, etc...
+ The characters, both staff and students, are fun to watch go about their days. They get into arguments, form friendships, form secret gaming rings, etc...
+ Headmaster mode: you can walk around your campus as headmaster, interacting with objects and encouraging staff and students.
+ Vertical building is well implemented.

Things I hope get added:
+ More customization options for characters (uniform colors, etc...)
+ Sensible pathing. Characters will walk straight through bushes and fences, not use paths you lay down, etc...
+ Some of the game mechanics are very confusing at first. The tutorial could be stronger to help alleviate this.
+ The initial flow of the game and research tree necessities feel a bit rushed. The game is very punishing if you don't prioritize researching the first tier of academic course improvements for instance.
+ More cat interactions. Cat food, litter boxes, giving it treats, etc... Maybe a cat mode like the headmaster mode?? 
+ More student / staff behaviors, events, and animations

Overall, it's a delightful game that is easy to sink time into. I hope it continues to improve because I can see myself playing this for a long time to come.",1690733955,1690733955,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The good stuff:
~You get to manage the school how you see fit. From building/planning rooms for your students/teachers. Manage/sort 
  your students and teacher according to their designated skills. It gets more difficult when you unlock new students.
~ You need to be careful of what type of food or beverage you sell in your school. I forgot to read some of the food label
   and now some of my students/teachers are chubby. (Including my MC) (@_@)
~Toilet is important. Trust me.
~Hiring teacher is crucial. Especially when you need the one with specific traits. Like Management.
~ How I deal with delinquents.....separate them from the goodie two shoes students and add the security office beside their 
   class.
~How to initiate romance among students/teachers? Put more doe statue.
~ How to make side money? Community Service. 

Things need to improve:
~Ui need to be fix on Management board, Service range.
~ Ai behavior need to be improve as students with Forgetful trait somehow forgot to pee/eat at school.
~ How to remove pet? Is there a button? There's a bug where when click a pet egg, it spawn more then one pet. I got 7 
   Pandas roaming my campus and while it is hilarious it can be quite annoying. 

Future updates I would like to see:
~ More decoration like plants, object, foods/snacks.
~Teachers with unique behavior  traits just to spice things up. 
~ Different location to start your school. There's only two. 
~ School Vs School competition. Like Sports, Debate, Singing. You basically sent your students to compete with other 
   school.
Final note:
This is a good game and I enjoy playing it. I like the simplicity of the graphic and the core gameplay. You think and decide what to do with the situation for your school. This is FUN.  Remind me a lot of Theme Hospital.",1690719573,1690719573,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a real gem of a management game. I like how it incorporates rpg-type elements and also has charming, quirky moments that remind me a bit of playing the Sims. I've gotten invested in managing my schools (and making them pretty), and this level of easy investment reminds me of Rimworld. Would recommend for people who enjoy Sims & Rimworld, btw.

It’s pretty cool so far, only played a little yet, but that was satisfying and it run smooth.
Can customize the director, your school icon and name, build and decorate rooms/outdoor, setup schedules for every pupil. 
And probably a lot more - need to play more. :)

It as well offers a lot of settings to adjust your experience.

In it's current state, the game has lots of potential and i'm having A LOT of fun with it, best part of all, the company have said there's more content to come with the introduction of the steam workshop and other features that'll only make it better. 

I would recommend giving this game a try if you're undecided, my only real critique would be the game could benefit from more soundtracks as the music can be a tad repetitive currently, but it's not like I can't mute it and play my own music instead.

Unlike this game, which handles the same concept of creating a school, but instead of a copy-paste clone of a previous game, it's a small-time anime'esque evolution from a wooden hut to a concrete bunker straight out of your favorite anime.

It's a great game. It's already very deep and complex but not overwhelming, which management games often are. You unlock things as you go which is always a pain when you need to go back to replace prior builds, but it's relatively painless in this game. You will see a few odd typos or ""Description goes here"", but that's barely an issue given how complete the game is. I wouldn't assume it to be a 1.0 game out of Early Access, but if the support and development continues I've no issues with considering it officially released.

These are my complaints, which are minor:
1. Once you get to about 5 or 6 managers, the managements screen can get items that go off the side that you can't move because the screen doesn't go over far enough. (or it bounces back before you can grab them)

2. The Hamberk Security Academy kids are so disorderly, you can't have a whole class of 30 of them, or the homeroom teacher stresses out, so I split them into 2 classes. I just unlocked the Teaching Policy tab of the Course Menu, and I can only set up the automatic enrollment for 1 of my two classes, so it would be great to be able to set multiple classes for each town to enroll in.

3. Likewise, I have been putting all my 2 and 3 star Science and Humanities kids in the same class, and it would be great to be able to enroll multiple towns into the same class.

Here are some suggestions:
1. The Course menu should display a warning icon if you don't have the correct facility for a class, or you haven't unlocked the proper technology yet.

2. It would be really neat to have a hotkey to toggle between students when you're viewing them in the students menu (and staff when you're in the staff menu). When you get up to 200+ of them, they become very time-consuming to sift through.

3. I think it would be more interesting if all of the students from the same town didn't have the same aspirations and traits. For example, could there maybe be a Hamberk Security Academy kid without an explosive temper?

As I said, the game is fun and interesting, and I still have a lot of stuff to discover. (still don't know how to get a tram stop!). Overall, I recommend.",1690644171,1690644171,True,22,1,0.740997135639190674,3,True,False,False

At the time, it seemed a little more shallow than other similar games and I was hesitant to consider purchasing. Now that the game is released, I'm so happy to say I was incredibly wrong. Having also played Two Point Campus, this game honestly blows it out of the water. TPC tends to feel far more tedious and less relaxing, to the point I haven't played it since launch. Let's School improves on many of the things TPC failed at and allows for a far more rich and charming experience.

The game starts slow, but definitely not boring, and after a few hours you'll be ramping up and managing so many little things that you won't know what to do first. Research feels rewarding! After your first year, if you're anything like me, you'll be scrambling to research the different courses and getting them up to level in time before your students need to sit their exams. It's just genuinely fun to actually have to think and foreplan this.

My only gripe is how the Sandbox isn't a ""true"" Sandbox. I wanted to go in and try and build a School and quickly found that the settings didn't allow you to set your school level so getting the likes of staff with Service qualifications was impossible for the cafeteria. A tweak for this would be amazing!

Can't wait to see what the team behind Let's School do next! <3

A couple of things I'd love to see:

1) Filters in the buy mode! When you start unlocking higher tiered furniture the catalogue becomes a little messy. It'd be nice to be able to filter through the newer stuff so you will only see them!
2) Options for indoor wallpaper and flooring
3) Colour variants for items
4) More decorations
5) A way to reject applications from Students.

I was constantly caught in the intriguing web of managing my virtual school and lost track of time more than once while playing.

The freedom to design and structure your educational institution, along with the extensive range of educational equipment to choose from, promotes a sense of inventiveness that is both challenging and delightful. This unique aspect of the game successfully stimulates the players' urge to continually enhance and upgrade their facilities.

The feature that sets Let's School apart is the diverse personalities of the students. The need to balance their various interests, meet their essential needs, and maintain the school's reputation proved to be a richly layered and satisfyingly intricate task. Overseeing the teachers' recruitment, teaching methodologies, and personal progression, added another level of engaging complexity.

The detailed and well-planned discipline system of Let's School requires you to keep a watchful eye on your students, ensuring a safe and healthy learning environment. Handling real-world issues like absenteeism and bullying adds a touch of reality, making the gameplay even more immersive.

The game's unique ways of representing student stress, such as the surge in eyeglass usage and weight issues, were an ingenious touch. Ensuring adequate sanitary facilities was another critical aspect of the game that added realism and a sense of urgency to my management role.

The game's appealing aspect is the constant desire to add more furniture and refine the aesthetic appeal of the school. Offering elective courses and running various school events provide a meaningful impact on students' lives, which was rewarding and fulfilling.

In conclusion, Let's School is a standout management game that impresses with its immersive gameplay, in-depth detail, and challenging school-running mechanics. It's an engrossing experience that you won't be able to put down for hours.

It just screams with passion and attention to detail. The game-play feels similar to dwarf fortress, two point hospital and similar-games, and I feel they nailed the presentation with the aesthetics, not only is a school theme super relatable setting, but it also caters to the 'anime' feeling of this game, even goes as far to include references to anime TV shows like ""Nichijou"".

I've been playing multiple playthroughs and love the gameplay loop of min-maxing my courses and teachers, I noticed that some features of different facilities felt like they could need more work, but that has been addressed in the roadmap.  

For the devs, what I truly wish is just more of this game, QoL (quality of life) fixes like being able to change names of even special students/teachers, (It could give you a prompt that the character whos name you're changing is an important one if necessary). Adding just arrows on the corners of the exploration map so it feels more intuitive to move the map rather than only middle mouse button (I've seen people write bug reports about unable to move map only to miss the fact that its movable with middle mouse button). Also more customizable uniforms, please add a uniform similar to uniforms in anime ""azumanga daioh"" or/and let us change the primary color of the uniforms. I also wished to see more of student relationships, for example a student building a harem of students and then there's love drama in-between them, but that's just my personal wishes. If there's problems I'm at least hoping to be able to customize uniforms and different cat models in the steam workshop :p

To wrap it all up, I want to say thank you to all the developers and people working on this game, it a fantastic game and I'm happy to be supporting this product!

-having more things to research
-having multiple pet dogs as well (kinda want to see dogs and cats chasing each other would be nice)
-a way to deal with multiple troublesome behaviors (sleeping in class, etc.) in multiple classes without constantly checking each class and clicking on it to punish or reprimand them.
-more facilities
-customize the fence around the school (haven't tried this cuz i usually run out of mony so idk if its in the game)
-also longer text lines when entering department name

Review:
As I get older I become less and less attached to games. The previous exception to this rule was Valheim, my friends and I busted through that game and the bosses on it's initial release and now I have 600 + hours in that game. 

Let's School has created the newest attachment to a game I have felt since Valheim. I have been desperately looking for a school sim game for my nostalgia of School Tycoon! On top of that this game lets me live my weeb dreams and create the Japanese school I always wanted to attend!

All that aside it is a new game.
There are some minor bugs and I have had to reload my game a couple times, no biggy. The developers have been putting out regular updates are very active with the player base, especially on their Discord. I believe this game will be one of the best School Sims that has ever existed, and no I am not exaggerating. 

The art style, music and emotes of the characters are all very charming. The simulation can be difficult and rewarding.

I wasn't expecting much when I saw the cover of this game. However, I decided to download the demo and give it a try since it's free. In this game you're able to roleplay as a principal and build your own school. There are many difficulties awaits you, including students behavior (Bullying, sleeping...) and natural disasters (Fire, snowing...).

The reason why this is one of my favorite simulator games is because unlike other games, this one has so many outcomes and it just never ends so it's really worth the money. I'm not sure if you guys played internet café simulator 2 before, but it only took a day for me to unlock everything and get the best equipment. 
In this game you're able to focus on the aesthetics even if you got everything unlocked. Unlike internet cafe simulator which has limited space, this game has a open world where you can build anything everywhere. This game has so many possibilities and outcomes, even if you have unlocked everything, you are still able to improve your school and receive more applications.

The interactions with students and teachers is also another reason why I would recommend this game. The interface is built really nicely and looks really polished. You are also able to look at the student view and experience your own school as a student. The most interesting factor of this game is probably exploring different places around the country and unlocking new types of student who studies different subject and have different ambitions. It is always exciting to build a new classroom with different courses for new students that you've discovered around the country.

One of the downfall of this game is probably the tutorial. I feel like it's not enough for players to be able to understand what they're supposed to press on considering the fact that there's a lot of windows and options. However, once you've played the game for a while you will be able to obtain more knowledge for the game.

One of the toughest things when building a simulation game is capturing the same spark and drive that would encourage someone to take on that job in the real world. Let's School hits the nail right on the head in that regard by combining an incredibly charming art style with genuinely sweet and adorable interactions that let the player really feel like they can take care of their students.

In terms of building mechanics, the game follows the style of Theme Hospital, Two-Point Hospital, Two-Point Campus: build the building itself, then create room blueprints full of interactions for the simulated students. The amount of furniture available is fairly deep, with multiple quality levels to choose from, but rather narrow in scope. A lot of room for expansion could be reasonably expected.

A student's academic year will last one week, with three levels to advance through. Those familiar with the inner workings of middle schools - Japan's education system in particular - will catch on quickly to the game flow and expectations. Players will need to manage staff and timetables to ensure their students are progressing through the courses that are set out for them by the communities they hail from. A good sim game will let you get into the nitty-gritty of things where you want and automate the rest - something that Let's School does with varying success. For example, while I enjoyed creating custom, carefully balanced timetables for every one of my classes, it was quite frustrating to see my work undone as automation systems overwrote things.

Serious sim players may find the game rather easy and lacking in complexity, but Let's School's strengths lie in its charm and aesthetics. There is still lots of room in which the game can grow - expanded tech trees, wider array of furniture, and more varied class or course options to name a few - but Let's School offers a solidly built, charming simulation of running a Japanese middle school that will hopefully leave players with that soft and fuzzy feeling of helping kids.",1690522661,1690522661,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game-play parallels others games in the genre: meet the needs of your populace by building structures and designating rooms for various purposes, while also furnishing them appropriately so that they function properly. If you've ever played games like Prison Architect or the Two Point series, you'll generally understand the game-play.

What makes Let's School unique from these other iterations is the art style; a pixel, blocky, cutesy aesthetic, and the depth to the school management. There are various students with their own goals and ambitions and your goal is to develop a curriculum to allow them to achieve that success. You not only need to manage students, assigning their teachers and classes, but you also have to recruit them, compete with rival schools, and ensure their needs outside of the classroom (recreation, temperature, food/drink, etc.) are met. I'm only briefly into the campaign, having graduated my first class (all kids trying to get into a low-end marketing school, all passed) but can definitely see this game developing into a much larger management sim where the staff you hire and rooms you develop becomes crucial for students trying to become some of the best in their field. 

In Let's School you develop your academy by researching innovations. These can be things as simple as a cafeteria, to more complex subjects, such as high-end, specified course programs. This element of the game pairs well with classroom management as you can be left scrambling with research to ensure your school's needs are met as your educational ecosystem grows larger. 

I don't think the game is perfect. While I developed bonds with some of my students, I was often left feeling very disconnected from most of them, although I'm not sure if that is part of a point the game may be trying  to make. There was a graduation photo which was cute though. Additionally, there are a few little things that could use improvements in the UI and more decoration/customization options would be appreciated. 

While I've only played briefly at the time of this review, I wanted to flag this newer game that I'd argue deserves your attention if you're a fan of this genre.

*Gameplay Controls*
Pros- Relatively easy and there are keyboard shortcuts that are pretty universal across PC games. Intuitive in nature if you have played similar time management games. Clear icons assist with easy navigation and multiple pathways to get to the same core components of the management pieces of the game. There is tons of space and clear systems within each “area” (e.g., building, building schedules, research, etc.). There is a straightforward “Headmaster’s Manual” that gives additional context.

Cons- The responsiveness of mouse clicks on people is an intermittent problem. I’ve clicked on people and their individual profile card doesn’t come up. Sometimes clicking someone else and clicking back to that person works, sometimes it doesn’t. 

*Graphics*
Pros- Personally, I love this art style and the clean and simple items make it easy to know exactly what and where everything is at a quick glance. Clear icons that pop up and hover over different rooms/areas really help when looking across the entire map. 

Cons- The characters do not abide by the laws of physics (walking through barriers (e.g., fences and railings, cutting through staircases) a.k.a shortest route.

*Objectives*
Pros- The game gives the player the option for objectives and has very clear tracking systems and multiple built-in objectives and rewards (like all students passing exams)! This provides layers to the gameplay, keeping you hooked. Reaching objectives involves lots of research and the research dependencies and rewards are cool and a part of the planning process for your gameplay.

Cons- N/A. Expanded or new objectives in the distant future would be great.

*Replay ability*
Pros – Simply, yes. You can create and do whatever you want, you could play for a lifetime if you wanted.
Cons- N/A

*Difficulty*
Pros – You can customize your game for the difficulty level of your choosing but the game by itself is a welcomed challenge. Making sure the people management, schedules, and facilities are up to standard is the core part of the game. Expanded aspects include exploring locations near your school, building relationships, promoting, and securing new admissions, etc.   

Cons- Only teachers can be hired- which means having teachers assume the facility roles (cafes, security, researchers, storekeepers, etc.). It would be nice to have teachers and facility staff to improve the immersion.

*Building Mechanics*
Pros – YOU CAN JUST CLICK OR LONG HOLD THINGS AND MOVE THEM DIRECTLY IN LIVE GAME WITHOUT HAVING TO PAUSE OR EVEN GO TO BUILD MODE. If you have been playing any type of build games for a long time, you know this is a great feature. It is so simple to build and there really isn’t much else to it. Like with most games, it tells you what is required within the objects area, and you can search for items as well.
 
Cons- Unable to shrink facility zones (the actual standalone building structure), made planning structures a bit more difficult.",1690477622,1690477622,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[b]A Unique Blend of Management, Base Building, and School Life Simulation:[/b]
""Let's School!"" isn't your usual character-based simulator. This game harks back to the glory days of top-down simulation games like ""Cities: Skylines,"" or ""Sims."" Your perspective is that of a god-like, omnipresent headmaster, curating a wholesome environment for education and growth.

[b]Building Blocks of Education: [/b]
The game hands you the blueprint of a rundown school and says, ""Make it grand!"" With a creative suite of building tools and options, your imagination is the only limit. Whether it's career or sandbox mode, each choice you make will echo through the school halls, shaping the lives of both students and teachers.

[b]Graphical Simplicity, Gameplay Depth:[/b]
Though the visuals might seem basic at first glance, they conceal a depth of gameplay that is truly captivating. The charm is in the details - the vibrant school life, the authentic sound effects, and the compelling management dynamics all contribute to a rich gaming experience.

[b]Areas for Detention: [/b]
While ""Let's School!"" earns high marks in several areas, there are a couple of subjects it could improve on. The management system, though robust, can feel a bit overwhelming, and the game currently lacks mod support. Nevertheless, these are minor detractions in what is otherwise a truly engaging gaming experience.

[b]The Final Bell: [/b]
""Let's School!"" takes the simulation genre back to school and graduates with honors. Though still fresh on the scene, it shows significant promise and offers a fun, in-depth simulation experience at a reasonable price.

I so highly recommend this game. I fell in love with it during the demo and beta. For me, this game is an unforgettable experience",1690474929,1690474929,True,3,0,0.559748470783233643,0,True,False,False

Now it's worth mentioning that this is more of an Asian school system, so for us Americans we might find a few things odd (tea room?, no student lockers, students stay in a classroom and teachers rotate), but this is honestly one of the most satisfying simulators that I've played in a long time.  There is a good balance between micro- and macro-management.  The tone of the game feels optimistic, but isn't cheesy, which I've come to enjoy.

Play the demo to get a good feel for the game, but realistically, at the low price that they're asking, this game is more than fairly priced.  What's more is that the developers have been pretty active in listening and responding to feedback, which I find surprisingly refreshing.  I think you'll be as pleasantly surprised as I was with this game.

For the future, I'd hope to see maybe some sort of DLC or update that adds some American school flavoring (probably scheduling).",1690464974,1690464974,True,2,0,0.543726265430450439,2,True,False,False

Just made it to the students reaching 'year 3' and a guy paid me to take in some mob family kids.

I've been following this since it's announcement last year, and the developers are really great in terms of taking feedback and listening to the community. For starters, the tutorial is a lot more structured and truly eases you into the game. Lots of UI elements were tweaked with the help of the community, and in general the game is a lot more easier to understand with all the complex systems it throws at you.

For a lot of players, the aesthetic of the game is a strong reason to try it out. It's super charming, and it translates in wanting to create a cute school that you want to just care and nurture.

I'm in!

So it's a school simulator. You are a new headmaster who takes charge of his old school which has become so run down and dilapidated that it's almost hilarious. Now it's your job to pick it back up and build it into something amazing and grand. With two modes, career and sandbox, take charge of your school and turn it into something awesome. That's pretty much it.

With a robust management system (perhaps too overly complicated i might add) and with cutesy bubbly music and sound effects and graphics, the game is pretty awesome all around.

It's a bit rough around the edges still which is unfortunate, with the tutorial not teaching you enough about its complicated management system, a few issues with camera controls and the snapping function when building and editing. It's still a pretty fun little game at a very appropriate pricetag.

If you're into games like this you won't be disappointed. I experienced no bugs or glitches either which was nice and it also comes with character and school customization options to really make it feel like your own.

I don't know what else to say here but if you'd like more information you can check out the video on my YouTube channel (link below) which probably has more information paired with gameplay footage. Please check it out!

Each student in the game has unique interests and aspirations, which creates complexities and challenges for the player.

One of the main aspects of the game is maintaining the reputation of the school. You have to meet the basic needs of the students, control the learning load and manage aspects such as clothing, food and travel. This requires good time and resource management to ensure that the pupils' education is optimized.

However, the Let's School game is not limited to the usual duties of a school principal. You also face various challenges outside the school. Mysterious dangers and potential threats can disrupt normal school life and create unforeseen situations. You will have to respond to such situations quickly and effectively to keep the school running smoothly.

The architectural design of the school in the game also plays an important role. You have the opportunity to plan and build various functional objects and use hundreds of pieces of educational equipment. This allows you to create a unique and aesthetically pleasing landscape of your school.

The overall assessment of the Let's School game is positive. It offers an exciting and challenging school management experience, combining balancing different factors and solving problems that arise both inside and outside the school.
