Plateup and Overcooked is the best comparison I can make to this game (but not exactly the same). It has challenges on the levels you completed and it hasn't gotten old to redo them and try to do better each time. 
I love the characters as well. The animals all have their benefits and they have exp to level them up. I haven't seen what the characters get so far, but I'm slowly leveling up my Wolf to see if he goes faster or slips less (they also have negatives to them. Wolf is more prone to slipping on spills)
Decorating your house is also cute and fun. You earn money with each run you do and can slowly gain buffs to help yourself complete the challenges with some extra help. 

Overall, its a charming game to play. I have played the demo with friends over and over until the game released and then continued to play 8 hours so far with them as well. Its almost addicting xD I'm excited at all the different drinks we will get to make eventually and how I know we will yell at each other for messing up xDD Its Uno night all over again except this time we're on the same team xDD",1708899274,1708899274,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,True

I think the 2D style makes things alot easier to navigate around.

Have only played solo so far, but further levels require at least a friend to join you via local or online play. 

With more updates to come through in this EA, I literally can't wait.

Highly Recommended",1708861200,1708861200,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Some of my positives I can say about the game:
- The high-focus stressful game I like when I play overcooked.
- Each sector has their own unique beverage with different way to prepare.
- Each level has more difficulties to unlock and choose.
- Different characters with slightly different stats, strength, and weakness.
- The keyboard control is unique, I kinda prefer it than the controller.

Some of my critics that I would love to see improved:
- Sometimes the environment would cover some stations. (e.g. some wall or shutter would cover part of the table and storage)
- I can't differentiate different cups sizes when it's stored on the big racks. (maybe add the cup size beside it?). 
- I also can't see the quantity of items stored in the fridge. Just put the numbers on top of them just like when I put the item on the tiny rack that I can buy for upgrade.
- The demonic contract penalty that increase stress every period of time is kinda unfair because I can only decrease them with items from the bookman, but that's depend on luck if they will sell stress-decreasing item or not. If they're not, then I guess I have to get 5-6 stress even if I did everything correctly. I always avoid high-level contract offers to avoid those penalties but you can get them any day randomly anyway.",1708849642,1708849642,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Keeping an eye on your stock, ordering the right things and then putting them away make this game unique. In order to make the increasingly complicated layered drinks properly, you'll have to do lots of prep work which can get very specific in how they are done. It continues to add small details to watch out for as I advance, like slippery floors and different types of customers. Not sure how far the early access version goes, but so far there's lots of levels and the harder challenges might take a few tries. There are also multiple playable animals with unique play-styles, which can level up and gain skills.

However, Overcooked is a real-time racing game. ""Feed the Cups"" can be said to completely recreate the hardships and complexities of running a real-world shop, something I can relate to from my experience working in a Korean cuisine restaurant as a slave (T^T). I heard that the developers actually managed a beverage shop in real life, which explains why the game's details are so rich.
