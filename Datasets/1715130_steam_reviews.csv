[hr] [/hr]
[b] Explanation: [/b] 
  I've been a fan of this game since I tried it in 2010. It was she who made me leave PS2 for PC. So I played the 2007 original (luckily I have it) to be as objective as possible. I played both games on ""SWAT"" difficulty in hopes of fixing the problems that the original 2007 version had.

[b] First impression: [/b] 
   It's cool to go back in time. Such familiar cards, as if they had never left them and the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ balance of opponents (the enemy in the cap can withstand 5 blows to the head or dies immediately) Eh... MEMORIES!!!

[b] Half of the game completed: [/b] 
  Controlling the suit from part 2 is very inconvenient (for the reason that the developers didn’t just cut out one mechanic and replace it with another, but put two on top of each other (they conflict with each other), so I returned the controls to the completely original ones (although I think the controls are the second part is the best). The problem of the original with the strange use of processor cores has been solved, but added “probably for balance” optimization problems have been . Played on graphics settings (CAN IT RUN CRYSIS?) with Ray tracing and immediately my video card (2060 super) transferred me from the native resolution (4K) to FullHD. On FullHD, stays around 57-53 FPS. In a battle and with high dynamics, it drops to 47-44 FPS. You can turn off “Rays”, then you will get +10 fps, but the shadows and lighting greatly lose their beauty, and sometimes even the shadows of the guys, which hurts the eyes. You can also turn on ""DLSS"", you will also get an increase of +30-40 FPS, but the picture loses a lot in detail and smoothing. I played with on ""Rays"" and ""DLSS"" are disabled. So the minimum optimization requirements are still lacking. The enemies hit much harder than in the original, it feels like I'm going against them with my bare ass, and not in an armored suit. Also, the suit’s energy is consumed faster, so you have to sit out more often to charge (a little annoying).

[b] Completed the game: [/b]
   As expected, I beat a game from my childhood that isn't as amazing as it used to be. A very strangely made remaster. Updated textures and shadows were added only to certain elements (vegetation, ground, water, rocks, lighting and costume), and everything else was forgotten. And it looks strange when there is a cool detailed costume on which shadows and lighting play, and the face of the Prophet or Psycho is the same as in the original (was it really difficult to add details). For my personal taste, the picture is also very oversaturated and the atmosphere of some locations is lost. Everything else is the same as before.

[b] Verdict: [/b]
   A remaster of a game that many wanted but ended up underwhelming. I would advise you to play the 2007 version (if you can find it) and experience more sensations from childhood, and modern builds will already give more fps than before (I got 85 in 4K with a drop to 72 FPS). I expected more from this game, but unfortunately it disappointed me. So I cannot advise an ordinary person (not familiar with the series) to buy it, and to an ardent fan of the original I can only say that it is at your own peril and risk.

If you got here, then know that you are the BEST!!!

Yet another ""remaster"" that has enshittified a beloved classic and neutered it. If you REAAAALLY want this, try and wait for 90% off sale. Otherwise avoid it. 
If you want a truly remastered(ish) Crysis, I would suggest firing up original one with Tactical Expansion Mod, awailable here: https://www.moddb.com/mods/tactical-expansion-mod
For optimizing original to run on newer hardware, refer to PC Gaming Wiki here: https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Crysis


Pros: 
Newer CryEngine (3, I think) gives you better graphics, and nominally better optimizations: but I haven't seen much difference between original's maxed out and Remaster's High setting graphics.
Onslaught Level gives you as initial spawn tank with infinite main cannon ammo, unlike original where it was limited to 25-30 shells, if I remember correctly.
Achivements, maybe, due to most of them being tied to story progression, with only about 5 or 6 referring to various gameplay and physics shenanigans. And most of those are achiveable on first playtrough. For Achievement hunters, do not expect to sweat too much if you want to get them all.

Cons: 
EVERYTHING ELSE.  
Mods? Fukken gone.
Multiplayer? Fukken gone.
Warhead expansion pack/sidestory? DOUBLE fukken gone. Seriously, you only get first Crysis, and it is playable trough in 6-8 hours, I have about 8.5 hours of game time at writing this, and had made a playtrough on Medium while suffering from cold, so thus was not at 100%. 
Sound: some details are better, as well as audio cues about suit status being more prominent, but other are at same exact level as original.
AI: braindead idiots, with occasional wallhacking spots of ""briliance"". (I also play Star Citizen,game based on heavily modified Cryengine off-fork and even with SC's servers running badly, AI there is still miles better and more lethal that here.)
UI: worse. Older player may remember how you could choose between different colors for HUD and menus, and EVEYRTHING would be adjusted for color. Well, not in this remaster. Original's Olive Drab Green still remains strong in game and on menus.
I also noticed stutterings, mostly on Assault and Onslaught levels, ones that are massively sprawling and stretch for kilometers. SO, my guess is, the game has not been nearly as well optimized and it could have been. 

Closing: I only bought this because it was on 90% sale, and I still feel ripped off. Remaster that is more of a sloppily done port to newer hardware and OS rather than proper remaster. Think long and hard if you really would like to buy one.",1708375539,1708375539,False,6,0,0.585226774215698242,0,True,False,False

 { Graphics } 

+ it is a Remastered version of course it gonna look good. The lighting and shadow is good with highly detailed environments and impressive visual effects , i love how the dev make the option "" can it run crysis "" in the graphics setting refer to the meme back in the day 

 { Gameplay }

- This is the aspect where Crysis 1 suffer the most, the gameplay is straight up trash and "" no fun allow ""

- The game let you play as an US special forces soldier with a million dollar nano armor suit, but for f*ck sake you feel just like a normal soldier , you die after 3 to 4 shoot so does your enemies , at what point does the suit make you more superior than them ,oh yeah the suit has enhanced armor mode so you can take an extra 2 bullet do you hear that you can tank up to 2 MORE BULLET BEFORE YOU DIE . The suit also provide you with invisible cloak but the stealth system is so f*ck up that it make the invisible mode useless , it drain power so much you can barely sneak through enemies, OH you want to take the enemies one by one sorry ! but the moment you pull the trigger the cloak disabled and energy turn to 0% WHAT ??? . The only thing decent about the suit is it allow you to sprint very fast and it change color depend on the mode you active 

- The AI is soooo broken , enemies probably have 100/10 eyesight since they can spot you 10km away , sometime they can even see you through invisible cloak . In short to mid range enemies accurate is insane,  they tend to spray the entire magazine on you and like i said earlier "" you die after a few shoot "" . The enemies movement feel very unnatural they dodge bullet like NEO in the Matrix . 

- Gunplay is clunky and dated, i don't mind if the gun have recoil well it supposed to have recoil but i do mind when the gun sake like crazy every time you shoot, don't you think an US special forces soldier with nano suit should be able to handle a bit of recoil ?

- I love the amount of freedom you have in the first 6 mission. You don't restricted to a path but the dev fail to make the map fun to explore. Oh you can go any where but the only thing you find is stupid enemies, wouldn't it be more interest if you put some thing for player to find like unique weapon , audio document to expand the lore or rescute some marine being capture instead of DOWNLOADING SOME DATA

 { Story }
- At this point the game is too bad for me to even care about the story. So basiclly you go shoot North korean and alient
- Character is not memoriable since they all f*cking die after a short time they on screen, oh man ! me and the gang gonna pull up to North korean island and blow some sh*t up can't wait to get to know more about my team oh wait ! they all DEATH 30m later

 { PC requirement }

- You gonna need a decent laptop/pc to play this game 

 { Bugs } 

- i don't notice any bug

 { Should you buy it ? } 

- Even when this game is on sales i don't think it gonna worth your money

 { Final thought }

- Crysis 1 is too overrated , maybe it is good and revolutionized back in the day but in today standard it is just a bad shooting game with weird design and wasted potential. i bought Crysis to be a badass killing machine and this game fail to deliver that",1708348968,1708348968,False,5,0,0.568820178508758545,0,True,False,False

[h3][b]Conclusion:[/b][/h3]

Crysis Remastered brings the classic shooter into the modern era with significant graphical updates and support for the latest display technologies, including HDR. The game's innovative suit powers and diverse combat scenarios remain as engaging as ever, providing a gameplay experience that is both challenging and rewarding.

The remaster enhances the iconic storyline and setting, allowing both new and returning players to experience the game's narrative in a visually stunning manner. The addition of modern resolutions support ensures that Crysis Remastered looks its best on contemporary hardware.

However, the game's transition to the modern era is not without its flaws. Notably, the VTOL mission presents a significant challenge for PC players due to control issues when using a mouse, necessitating the use of a controller for an optimal experience. Additionally, the game suffers from a variety of bugs, including sound issues that detract from the immersive experience. Sound effects may get stuck or disappear entirely, and invisibility glitches can break the gameplay flow.

Performance-wise, Crysis Remastered demands more from systems than expected, considering the technological advancements in gaming hardware. Players with high-end PCs may find the game running poorly, even when other graphically intense games perform flawlessly on the same setup.

In conclusion, while Crysis Remastered successfully revives a beloved classic with stunning graphical enhancements and maintains the core gameplay elements that made the original game a landmark in the FPS genre, it is hampered by technical issues. These include control problems, bugs, and unexpected performance requirements. Despite these setbacks, for fans of the series and newcomers alike, the game offers a worthwhile experience, albeit with some caveats.",1708184667,1708184694,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

***Pros***

-Story is linear and not bad at all.
-Environmental graphics for a remastered classic is surprisingly great (the islands, palm trees, and snow maps are so nice)
-Gun play is doable even for today's time, pretty much CS (CounterStrike) kind of gun play. 
-Movement is fine for an old game, just imagine playing Garry's mod or even CS except u can run and jump.

It's a 10/10 classic banger if there wasn't:

***Cons***
-Several CTD (crash to desktop) instances when dying and reloading a save checkpoint
I verified integrity of game files and it fixed it, before that, I tried restarting the mission but that didn't help.
-Not too bad of a con but, no stealth take downs are in the game, and a cloaked melee def cannot be a sub for that

-(Delta only) Feels entirely dependent on how long u can wait for ur energy gauge to be full to cloak or armor up. 
You def cannot pull of the rambo route without the AI shitting on ur health if u peek from cover for 2 seconds.
 
-(Delta only) AI are jacked with their wall bang aim and miles across the map detection range. You could be cloaked, hiding behind bushes, a tree, or cover, and these mfs will STILL detect u the moment u step out. 
I was stuck restarting checkpoints at least 30 times on the jungle mission that had korean snipers and their patrols on both sides of the map.I only learned, after dying 30 times, how far they can potentially see u and where u could actually cloak and run around to sneak past them and murk them.

***SPOILERS***
- [spoiler] VTOL mission: Idk if others suffered this but I kept getting dragged into the tornadoes even if I rotated and veared far from them, the afterburner spd boost was nonexistent, and I had to restart the mission twice bc the leading jets left faster than me and I got lost on where to go (P.S. the map was scrambled and to succeed the mission ya gotta follow the AIs and watch where they go.) [/spoiler]

- [spoiler] Final Boss Fight: I did eventually beat it, but holy fuck did it have such dumb mechanics (it'll constantly tentacle grab u if ur close, it'll spam projectile nuke or even ice beams if ur far, and the additional mobs that fly around just bite ur ass like annoying mosquitoes.) You will constantly hear helena say smthn like, ""Fight close to it, I'll weaken it"" and then nothing ever happens and you just have to go full BRRRR with a minigun to get anywhere.

Positives:
Looks absolutely astonishing, especially in the hyper-atmospheric and detailed alien structure levels.
Fairly small download size for such a good-looking game, and system requirements aren't too bad either. Turns out it can run Crysis!
Decision to stick to a relatively manageable and linear progression path in such a large play area, rather than go full-on open world, is to be applauded, so not much unnecessary busywork or meandering.
Gameplay is mixed up with armour and cloak abilities engineered into your nano-suit, letting you go stealthier if you want to, or help you out in seemingly impossible situations.

Negatives:
It's short. The end credits (which are interminable) feel longer than the game. For completionists, there's no excuse for that. 
I wasn't able to use the mouse to steer the vehicles, like I could with the Halo games. You may have to make do with arrow keys or get a controller.
Foliage, no matter how dense, does not seem to hide you from enemies well enough, and yet it's difficult to see them.
Feels slightly bland and generic at first, like a typical AAA shooter (but persevere with it and you should have fun). The unimaginative story doesn't help.

[b]Greetings, mere mortals.[/b]

It's I, Starscream, once again, to share my recent experience with Crysis Remastered on my new OLED TV. Previously, I extolled its virtues, but alas, after this recent encounter, my opinion has shifted.

The original game was akin to wearing a golden armor, reminiscent of my legendary exploits in the Transformers episode, The Golden Lagoon. However, what I've noticed in this remastered version are not upgrades but downgrades. The lack of plant physics is appalling. In the old game, you could interact with foliage, pushing plants aside as you moved through them. Now? You simply clip through them like a malfunctioning Decepticon.

And the nighttime, supposed to be an immersive experience with ray tracing, falls utterly short. Instead of darkness, the night is as bright as an energon cube, ruining the tension the original game offered. The flashlight no longer serves its purpose, leaving me disappointed and vexed, much like Megatron after a failed conquest.

[hr][/hr]

In conclusion, Crysis Remastered on my new OLED TV is a letdown. It's like encountering a malfunctioning Seeker in the midst of battle. The downgrades from the original, particularly in plant physics and the lack of darkness in the night, have soured the experience. I'd have to give this version a Starscream-revoked rating of [b]3/10[/b], purely due to these disappointing deviations from the original game's immersion and mechanics.

If you have played this as a kid and are looking for the nostalgia then it certainly is worth the time. I would suggest looking for it on sale or a part of the trilogy collection. No major gripes, game looks gorgeous even on high with DLSS set to balanced. Game ran smooth as butter for me and no major graphical issues had arisen during my time completing the game.

Some slight annoying but ultimately non-offensive bugs did occur. One being that playing on my curved monitor during loading there was visual flickering in the unused space. This was not always the case but was just random at times. The other being when I did my first play-through on the hardest difficulty to 100% the game after completion of the last mission the game had only counted the later half as complete on that difficulty. Some people have had the same issue in the past but I was able to mission select and complete levels individually for them to count. Not a terrible issue but took the extra hours to complete all achievements. If you are a completionist I suggest checking level difficulty completed as you go on.

Overall a very solid game and a fun little trip down memory lane.

[i]- Had some weird bugs (which many had, no matter the GPU you have, as I found out later), disable all ray tracing. I had some gnarly crashes while in the main menu, having over 2000 FPS in the menu, GPU starts to coil whine as all hell and then it crashes. Setting the game to Medium stopped the GPU coil whine - in the damn menu. More on this later.
- If it crashes it'll reset to default all your game (controls, video and audio settings) settings probably
- Ending sucks ass
- This is a remaster of a console game, not the PC classic.[/i]

If you plan to play this, please read PCGamingWiki page first to see the potential issues. In my case, I've cranked my GPU to 100% during numerous tests before this game, not a single coil whine. Which means game itself is trying to do something that it should not do. Especially is worrying that I had over 2000 FPS in the main menu, which could be the part of the issue. While the game worked fine 99% of the time, that first crash and then another during the last fight made me a bit suspicious if this game can nuke you GPU, Amazon's MMO ""New World"" style. I'm pretty certain it's the ray tracing settings, apparently even if you turn it off, it might nor be actually turned off. More on that on PC gaming Wiki page.

[hr][/hr]
[b][u]Story[/u]:[/b] There isn't much with story as it is like classic alien invasion story along with another enemy faction in the middle. You just find about alien existence through your campaign while fighting Korean army.

[b][u]Graphic and Presentation[/u]:[/b] This is the most impressive aspect of Crysis. Design, geometry, topography, object placement, enemy placement, effects have been done to its best. In comparison to classic version, there can be seen some improvements with water quality and rays going through palm leaves. Enemy models are not much of an improvement but definitely not bad. Alien design are not bad, with tentacle and exosuit.

[b][u]Game-play mechanism[/u]:[/b] Nano Suit is the primary highlight of Crysis. Our ability to have super speed, strength, max armour and above all the Cloak mode makes this a fun stealth action experience. The freedom to approach and achieve objectives is something I really enjoyed in this game. Bushes and boulders breaking line of sight is implemented well in this game. Gun-play mechanism is another aspect to highlight. Ability to modify mid combat gives range to strategy based on guns you are carrying. Although variety of weapons aren't too many it still holds up with the mods that are applicable to guns. Minute details like shooting trees and letting them fall on enemy or distract them is really impressive. Throwing objects or enemy themselves are some of the fun elements I found enjoyable in Crysis. I like how they improved upon classic to new suit option where the energy consumption is low and switching based on activity creating less need to focus on suit control and only hotkey to activate cloak.

[b][u]Sound[/u]:[/b] I largely relied on suppressor and the sound is what we would imagine for a silenced gun, not sure if that's what a suppressed weapon would sound like. Distinct sound for weapon and reload is a minute detail. Explosion has a different sound comparing to size of exploding object. Ambient and underwater muffled sound are some minute detail that i hardly noticed.

[hr][/hr]
[b][u]Overall experience[/u]:[/b] This was a fun with occasional glitch i found where dead enemy stayed in T-pose and sometimes gun mounted boats could see me through boulders and shoot as well. I enjoyed stealth the most. Replay-ability is something we can do if we want to play in a different style or improve upon previous play-through.

The original is not an easy game and the high-tech nanosuit always feels like it is no thicker than a piece of paper, especially for my younger self who was a much less experienced gamer. Some weapons are difficult to work with because of the range and recoil, and damage seems wildly inconsistent, like a helicopter could eat 3 shots of RPG like nothing.

With the rebalance in remaster, nonsense like that no longer happens and all weapons are more manageable and fun to use with consistent damage. Difficulty and playtime drop as a result (15 vs 7 hours for the first playthrough), but it is a major step up for the experience. On the flip side, the necessity of stealth largely decreases, and I find myself always in favor of direct combat with the game becoming easier, so I say the remaster is less strategic and more simple shooting fun, though higher difficulty should revert that.

Perhaps because of the rebalance and the lower difficulty, or the developer made some changes in levels (I am not sure if there are any), or just me became a better gamer, the remaster doesn’t have a lot of frustration the original has, which is why back then, I was not a fan of the more open level design of Crysis 1.

With the frustration gone, I started to appreciate the more open level design allowing more freedom to decide how to approach objectives. I also become appreciative of the level variety that has car, ship, tank and aircraft levels arranged in an organized manner like Halo, which the second and third Crysis no longer have. That said, it is still confusing AF on how to kill the first boss in the final level as the game still doesn’t give clear instructions.

It is disappointing that the remaster doesn’t fix the biggest issue - AI. They are still dumb AF and they still have hypersensitive detection as the original - the lush vegetation makes it difficult for players to spot enemies, but they have no trouble seeing through, reminding me why the OG is so frustrating.

The OG has great graphics for its time but is not comparable to modern games. The remaster updated but didn’t overhaul graphics, and what really noticeable changes are clearer water, bluer sky, greener vegetation and more saturated color tones, which make it less photorealistic than the original. While doing so, the game introduces a contrast issue causing dark areas to be very hard to see, but without offering a proper tool to calibrate.

In conclusion, the remaster indeed is a better version of the game, but I don’t think the improvements are substantial enough to warrant a re-release (an rebalance update to the OG is probably enough). It is more of an eye-grabber for Cry Engine and future sequel. But if you have the original, you can get the remaster dirt cheap now, so why not?",1703391493,1703879889,True,13,0,0.655249834060668945,0,True,False,False

Seriously just look up a guide when you enter the mountain until you're out. After you leave the mountain, vehicles are less common but the gunplay becomes much more enjoyable partly because you get OP guns and enemies are a lot more versatile.

-graphics look worse a lot of the time and it's not faithful to the original art
-downgraded physics especially when it comes to vegetation that does not react to explosions anymore
-broken grenade selection and throwing

-can't turn invisible while driving a car forced into armor mode
-sprinting while prone now makes you stand up and sprint instead of the fast crawl from the original

-the checkpoint system and no quick save or even manual saves of any kind
-some changes to the equipment you can get in some missions
-enemies without guns just running around in the tank mission with no way to attack you

First, let me get a big thing out of the way. This version is based on the Xbox 360/Playstation 3 port of Crysis. This was likely done as those ports were done on CryEngine 3, while the PC original runs on CryEngine 2. Unfortunately, this brings some sacrifices. The enemy placement and number in levels is different from the PC release. and the AI also behaves slightly differently. Certain visual features are missing or replaced with more performance-friendly and in some cases less impressive looking counterparts. The infamous ""Ascension"" mission was missing at launch, and was only added in a patch later down the line, and there's a widespread bug in that said mission that prevents mouse input, requiring use of a controller or a program to map mouse input to controller input. In terms of general visual quality and design, it's a real mixed bag. Some stuff looks really good like the overall lighting composition, water looks great, it's not a bad-looking game by any means, but then there's some iffy stuff. Most, if not all. of the geometry and meshes, are exactly the same. This means many objects are still very obviously jagged and low-detail. The colors in the Remaster are also far more saturated, most notably in the missions taking place in forests and jungles, the grass and leaves on the trees are a richer, brighter green, which gives the game a less photorealistic look. I definitely wish there was a mod that changed said foliage assets to a more natural hue. (This is more of a personal nitpick rather than an objective criticism, however) Performance and tech-wise this remaster is actually a pretty dramatic step up. Anti-Aliasing looks far better than the 2007 game's primitive MSAA solution, leading to far less flickering on stuff like foliage or distant detailed objects and textures. You can push out the game's rendering and draw-distance a lot more, at the incredibly demanding ""Can it Run Crysis?"" setting, the game's LOD and Foliage rendering are pushed out to the max level and every object is always rendered at full detail, no matter how far away it is. Unless you have a super-beefy PC this option isn't really practical and is mostly meant for future-proofing the game. In terms of performance, the remaster is just better than the original game. Just the fact that it partially takes advantage of multiple cores and threads is huge, and for anyone with an RTX card, DLSS is also an option, so you get much better performance at very near to native image quality, and sometimes even better. All-in-all, there's a lot that's been improved in this remastered version but there's also a lot that's disappointing. This means that there's no real ideal version of Crysis. If you go with the original you miss out on the improved performance, AA, and lighting. If you choose the Remaster you lose out on the arguably better artistic design in many areas and missing or worse-looking effects. Because of this I can't really give a recommendation on which is better. I played the Remaster first and had a great time but after also playing the original for a bit some of the features that version has are sorely missed in the Remaster. I'd say if you want the extra performance play this version, but if you have a really beefy CPU and don't mind some framerate dips then go for the 2007 original.",1648780858,1702851266,True,0,0,0.413537025451660156,0,True,False,False

Let's start with some gameplay views: The nanosuit now functions a lot like the way it does in 2 and 3. Default is Strength mode and the suit regenerates energy only in this mode. Armor mode passively drains energy aside from taking hits. 

The good news is, this can all be reverted by heading to Options --> Game Settings --> check mark Classic Nanosuit. Suit shortcuts is also something you may want to look at, as enabling Classic Nanosuit mode makes you unable to use the toggle keys to quickly switch modes. A mixed bag, but my preference is using the Classic Nanosuit.

As for the rest of the game. Quite a few graphics glitches are noticeable in many environments. A.I. behavior is not as refined as before and can end up behaving very strangely at times, or stuck in a spot especially if you reload a checkpoint near a patrol.

One pain point for me is that the game does not play all the dialogues properly. Like the in the final part on the aircraft carrier and in the mines there are missing some dialogues. Technically they are there in the game but the game proceeds too quickly before they can play. Can be rectified somewhat with some xml edits but we shouldn't have had to.

Biggest owie for me is during the final fight on the carrier deck against the mothership. Very often one of two things or both will occur: 1. Psycho and Helena don't disable the shields even if all hostiles have been cleared, and this can happen for either of the ""arm"" shields. 2. The boss will be stuck continuously using its freezing beam for several minutes non-stop leaving you on a constant loop of being frozen, unfrozen and refrozen even on the easiest difficulty. Eitherways you have no choice but to reload the checkpoint.

So, if given a choice, I'd recommend you get the original Crysis from GOG which incorporates a fix for the executable.

I will say this much for the game though: the looks have definitely been touched up and a lot of places and objects are certainly more detailed and more beautiful. VFX also improved. But yes, buggy.",1702575443,1702575475,True,1,0,0.499327510595321655,0,True,False,False

However, strictly talking about the first Crysis Remastered Game, I cannot advise you to buy it.

What is the problem?

The Crysis 1 Remaster is based on the Xbox 360 Release Code, and therefore is heavily downgraded in a lot of areas. (e.g. Vegetation doesnt even react to your explosions anymore.)
It also just runs bad. Lets face it, its not a debate. The game has no noteworthy upgrades besides a very basic raytracing implementation and some lighting upgrades. Playing the original game heavily modded with similar upgrades, is still running - twice - as good as this remaster. How can such an old game only run on 70 fps on a modern mid-end machine? (RTX 3080, 5600x) I used to play the original game on a 7800 GT with an Athlon XP 3200+, just think about this for a moment. Im not even talking about the ""Can it run Crysis?""-Meme Graphic-Mode, that has practically no noteworthy difference then just running the game in a slideshow.

While not so important for me personally, as I dont think a lot of people would still play it today, its also missing the multiplayer part of the original game. Something that should be mentioned.

It also doesnt come with the standalone addon Crysis Warhead, and there is also no Remaster-Version in general for Crysis Warhead. Something I think is needed, considering the price-tag for this remaster.

So as long as you are not buying it for the integrated nanosuit-hotkey mode (Introduced in Crysis 2 and 3), or the achievements, you are better off with the original game. You can get the original game on origin for like 2 dollars, or on GOG for like 5 dollars. Also buy the original Crysis Warhead.

Realising that you aren't supposed to ghost your way through levels like Metal Gear but instead use the cloak to hunt your enemies like the predator turned this game from one I could never enjoy as a kid to one of the best FPS experiences I've ever had in my life. everything just improves once you figure out the intended uses for the mechanics.

It's also so fantastic that the levels essentially just give you a semi-open world, an objective, and lets you loose to figure things out however YOU want. after properly playing through this game multiple times and 100%-ing it I came to the awful realisation that there's nothing else like it out there. 

of course there is the third act to talk about but I didn't really find it all that bad, sure it's nothing in comparison to Act 1's predator game play or Act 2's Halo-like vehicle segment power trip but it isn't garbage like I've seen some people say about it; It can be a bit of fun to doom marine your way through a bunch of alien scum.

Anyways play this game please.

'm not usually a FPS person, but I wanted to run around and kill things. I don't like the super dark, dingy look of so many FPS games though, and I can't stand being constantly trapped in tiny passages or in underground buildings. I'm not very good at these games. 

Crysis works well for me because it's got a lovely outdoor setting, not claustrophobic at all so far. It's also got an easy mode for people who love to murder but aren't very good at it. I still die, but not that much... There are four difficulty settings, so for you people out there with skills, I'm sure you'd find the more difficult settings fun. 
This game is not overly complicated. I don't understand anything about guns, so it'll take me some time to figure out which ones work best for what situations, but it's not hard to switch between them and shoot. If you're looking for a super complex game, this probably isn't it. I just get my missions and keep moving through them with stealth or force or both. 

MAJOR CON:
This game would not run for me at all initially. Steam said it was running, but no window opened anywhere with the game. I have Windows11 on a pretty decent gaming laptop.

The remaster looks and runs great albeit a couple things worth mentioning:

1. On an ultrawide monitor, during loading screens, the sides of the screen flicker and glitch in such a way that I would caution people with sensitivity to flashing lights who are prone to seizures. It's pretty bad.

2.

- When I tried to use the grenade button, the game blocked all my actions unless I got some weapon from the ground.
- No quicksaves, so depending on the checkpoint system to save, was a very bad experience (playing on delta difficulty and dying really fast).
- VTOL for some reason after clicking the boost button, stopped from flying and I couldn't control it unless realoading checkpoint.
- Almost at the ending, my character started to stuttering when walking, so i needed to constantly sprint in order to stop the bug.
- The ""endboss arena"" kept killing me in some strange ways: not on fire, not receiving enemy damage (no visual queues), but having my HP sucked constantly and dying (had to keep walking far from the boss itself).

I've been forced to download a mod to have the first 2 gameplay problems that I listed solved.
Can't say much about the graphics since I can't compare the original from remastered.

Difficulty ★★★★★★☆☆☆☆ (based on highest difficulty)

The remastered version of Crysis 1 does add a lot of new graphical flair compared to the old one. The only reason while it might sometimes feels 'still old' is because they did not reworked the 3D models with more polygons as far as I can tell. But effects and new features are added, more world objects, distance is more clear and complex, and also the game engine can handle now higher FPS more fluently than the classic version.

[b]What I did like?[/b]

* more detailed world on distances
* added Raytracing, DLSS and HDR support
* whole engine was tweaked to provide better effects
* high FPS does look now fluent (old version had issues)
* changed suit control like Crysis 2+3 (classic behaviour is still an option)
* the story is still awesome and the nanosuit does make so much fun to use

[b]What did I hate?[/b]

This game is definitelly just optimized for Nvidia GPUs. AMD users like me get a little bit left behind, unfortunetally, even with strong AMD cards. 

For example on startup, the game complains about and old driver version (Nvidia) and cannot provide DLSS due to this. That is fine, as my AMD RX 7900 XTX cannot handle DLSS anyway ;)

Also some unpleasant graphic glitches do appear, especially related to the sky. HDR messes up with clouds while camera is moving (if HDR is deactivated all is fine, so I suggest to use the Windows auto-HDR option, it handles the game much better), also the stars during night do flicker in artefacts (there is a third-party-tool fix for this), and during night on some areas the adaptive brightness goes crazy. Luckily most game levels were fine.

But what really killed it for me is that this game does NOT contain the addon Crysis:Warhead, which tells the story about Psycho in a parallel timeline during the second half of the game. It is an important and awesome part of the whole Crysis story too. Sad that new players won't experience this unless they buy and play the old standalone version.

[b]Summary:[/b]

Still, the story and the game series is awesome and beside all of the negative things fun to play. If you have a Nvidia GPU, or a stronger AMD GPU which can handle the remastered version you should definitely still go for it and not the classic version if you are interested. But I am still disappointed that the devs made so obvious mistakes. If they going to fix the key critics, I will glady change my review.

Overall – Crysis Remastered is a nice blast from the past. The game, even with the remastered version, is showing its age, however that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Modern shooters  feel very limiting and a bit boring in comparison. Crysis hearkens back to a time when there was a bit more freedom to explore things and to accomplish objectives in different ways. The story line is very of the time and a bit silly.  I experienced a couple of audio bugs, and an issue where I had to restart a level entirely because the Crytek engine kept having an error popup. That was a bit annoying. Looking forward to finishing the remastered trilogy. Recommended.

Crysis 1 remastered is one of the worst games I've ever played. The only way I can describe it is a cheap copy of Battlefield. The guns feel awful, the hit registration is even worse, the AI is terrible - they can either spot you from far away or they are completely unaware that you stand nearby them, sometimes you die from explosions without even knowing what hit you, the ragdoll physics are usually bugged and it results in weird collisions, the vehicles have bad controls and the boss fights are incredibly boring and poorly designed. The graphics are mediocre for a 2021 remaster, there is too much jungle foliage making the enemies hard to spot without using the underwhelming binocular mechanic and without having nanosuit vision (instead, you literally have an outdated night vision), the only way to play on high difficulty is to wait a lot and don't engage enemies, there are no collectibles, no upgrades, no tutorial, only a few side quests that are very generic: Go to point A and press a button, also the optimization is not that great.

Pro’s: 
• Visually the game is still pretty decent, obviously it’s not anywhere near today’s AAA titles. Graphically it’s somewhere in between a PS4/PS5.

• It plays well on deck but it does drain your battery. I get about 2 hours of gameplay on a full charge. 

• It’s a good before bed game, it doesn’t require much thought and you can unwind while playing it. 

Cons:

• Cloaking doesn’t seem to be as effective as it once was, it seems to randomly not work. 

• Ammo for the SCAR is scarce so you spend the majority of the game using whatever crap you find on the ground. 

• Enemies seem to materialize out of no where, while this can make the game entertaining after awhile you end up running by them to avoid the repetitive BS. 

Conclusion: I see a lot of people complaining about hit markers and TTK on enemies. This is not COD and the game was from a different era. It’s somewhat of a cross between Soldier of Fortune and DOOM. It was experimental at the time with a lot going on (with the nano suit) compared to typical FPS at the time. It’s a good game if you remember what it is.. is it worth 30$??? Not really, then again if it keeps me entertained for more than 10 minutes it’s better than most 60$ games. 

TLDR: If you played the OG crysis give this a shot, if you just got your drivers license in the last 10 years don’t bother.",1699077017,1699077017,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So the gameplay will boil down to just go here, kill this group of enemies, over and over. there is a story thats kinda unique but not really interesting enough to make up for how boring the gameplay is. overall its fun enough considering you can get it cheap as hell due to constant sales but apparently the hype was only ever the graphics because theres nothing notable in the gameplay.",1699071784,1699071784,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b] Overall : 5/10 [/b]

Crysis was a cornerstone in 2007, with stunning graphics, huge freedom on how to tackle objectives and a lot of possibilities with modding. 16 years later, this remaster has actually not remastered a thing when it comes to AI, gameplay, gunplay or even graphics. It's the same game, and to be honest you can have better through modding the original game. Definetely a pass!

[b] Gameplay : 5/10 [/b]

It's clunky, it feels heavy, the commands are not reactive (like sprinting and jumping) and overall, the change to the nanosuit was for the worst (changing from armor mode by default to Power mode. Sprinting activating the speed mode, etc). They didn't even try to modernize the commands or the gunplay. Still the same as back in 2007.

[b] Graphics : 6/10 [/b]

The game is OKish in 2023, but honestly, you don't need this remaster. The modded 2007 original version will do better, with lot more possibilities (textures, Time of day, lightning, effects, etc).

[b] Story : 4/10 [/b]

Super basic scenario. I actually preferred the first part (with the koreans) then it goes into a more sci-fi vibe. Nothing fancy. Nothing engaging.

- Some of the worst human enemy AI I have ever seen. Sometimes they spot you easily from a long distance, other times they fail to spot you when you’re cloaked right next to them. Sometimes they struggle to hit you up close, other times they hit you perfectly from 50 metres away. But most of the time, they’re just insanely dumb, failing to use any sort of realistic tactics or behaviour to take me down. They only posed somewhat of a challenge on the hardest difficulty because a few of them could kill me in less than a second.

- Blatantly unfinished sound mixing. Sometimes the guns would fire very loudly, other times I could barely hear them. Music just didn’t play during certain scenes, and sometimes after alt-tabbing, it would return whilst blasting over the rest of the mix, making all the human voices nearly inaudible. 

- Frequent, immersion-breaking animation glitches and physics ragdolls. One enemy vaulted over a barrier that just wasn’t there, many NPCs walked into walls and objects when they should have gone around them, and multiple character ragdolls got stuck halfway through the floor. A few of these are fine, but I’ve seen more of them in this game than I’ve experienced in the 70 or so hours I’ve put into Starfield so far, and that’s a Bethesda game.

- Inexplicable frame drops within areas where no frames should be dropping. Apparently, a gigantic battle can maintain 60fps perfectly fine, but quieter parts of the game where there is far less going on? Tanked straight down to 30fps. 

- Every boss fight was completely laughable. The first one, a human general, ended up crouch walking away from me the entire fight. I’d unload two mags into him, he’d disappear then reappear someone else, then he’d return to crouch walk away from me again. Did this three times and he was dead. Not a single shot was fired at me, ruining what was meant to be the most critical moment of the game up to that point. And in terms of the large alien robots, while they weren’t inherently broken, they were just lame. The massive spider-looking one had no weakpoints, so I just unloaded a thousand bullets and rockets into it until it died. The mothership only had weakpoints, and they were all available at the start so there were no attacks to dodge or tasks to complete before they became exposed. Both bosses can kill you near instantly, so instead of being able to use that really cool suit the game gave you, you’re stuck to popping in and out of cover until they blow up, nothing special about it at all.

Maybe this is just a messed-up remaster, maybe this is how the game always was. All I know is that my first proper experience with this franchise was verging on complete disaster in terms of its technical competency. Yes, the shooting is fun, I enjoyed using the suit abilities, and the early level design is really great. But all of these elements were marred by consistent annoyances that either took me out of the experience or ruined parts of it entirely. You know those videos of games like Aliens Colonial Marines and Fallout 76 that showcase the funniest, most buggy parts of the experience to the world? What you see in those videos is close to what I experienced in Crysis Remastered. Why does it matter if I can run Crysis, if the game I’m trying to run just isn’t an enjoyable experience?

This is made even worse by the fact that these developers had a year to fix the game up on the EGS before it was released on Steam, but it’s evidently been hardly patched since that original release. Furthermore, this is a pretty short game, taking no more than 6-8 hours to 100% the entire thing, so the fact that there are this many issues, in what should be a super streamlined experience, is pretty ridiculous. And let’s not forget that this remaster was based on the console versions instead of the iconic PC version for some reason, alongside the omission of the multiplayer mode and the Warhead expansion.

Somehow, this game has a mostly positive reception on Steam, so maybe you will be luckier than I was. Unfortunately, I can only speak from my experience, and all I’ll say is that I’m happy this torture was over relatively quickly. Fingers crossed that the remasters of 2 and 3 aren’t as completely broken as this game was for me.",1697641817,1697641817,False,18,3,0.603311121463775635,10,True,False,False

Don't really mind the mixed reviews. Most of the things have been patched out and game is stable. Just don't exceed your video card's limit obviously.

Technical stuff aside, there are some minor gameplay alterations as well, like suit mode's from c2 and c3 have been ported here, (although i prefer the old one myself, it's sorta new way to play the game), and weapons having a new and modernised + punchier sound effects. Not to mention if you still like the old suit mode there is an option to switch to it.

It's interesting to play secretly
Diversity. Tank, airplane, gravity.
Setting up weapons, although not to say that there is a choice)
The plot - it is, the standard for combat fiction

-
Shooting is not very good
Explosions against infantry don't work well
Not the feeling that you are a super soldier, rather a super sniper rat)
Fighting aliens is not interesting. Irritate with their mobility and vitality.

Conclusion: 7.5/10 is a standard fantasy action movie for 10 hours.

The main problem of the game is that you play as a super soldier, but you don't feel it, because no one will give you two machine guns and crush opponents standing in an open field. The weapons are very weak, even machine guns. And you are blown away by the wind because the enemies are very accurate, and your armor is made of cardboard. ) But if you play through stealth. Then the game will pleasantly surprise you. The main thing is to turn off the stealth mode before shooting and turn it back on immediately after the murder, so you don't waste the energy of the suit when shooting.",1696810025,1696810025,True,8,1,0.557945847511291504,0,True,False,False

By default, you get a suit more similar to ""Crysis 2"". An easier to control suit with less versatility. It is perfect for console players, but if you're using a mouse and Keyboard i highly recommend switching to the more versatile ""Classic"" Nanosuit.
Options -> Game options Tick ""Classic Nanosuit""(Don't forget to Click Apply, if you just press ESC afterwards your changes will not be applied)
For newcomers having problems with the Classic suit just remember:
M3+Mouse Forward = Speed (A movement as if you would engage)
M3+Mouse Backward = Cloak (A movements as if you would retreat)
M3+Mouse Right = Strength (Imagine a Knight, Sword in the Right hand)
M3+Mouse Left = Armor (Imagine a Knight, Shield in the Left hand)
[b]2)PC Controls[/b]
The default controls of the remastered edition could be described as very ""Creative"".
Like Putting lean left and right on T and H or changing fire mode on 5.
I highly recommend changing the controls to something similar to the original.
I use the Classic nanosuit with these control changes:
Q/E - Lean left/right
H - Change Grenade
C - Fire Mode (I put it on C instead of X because i have big hands)
X  - Customization Menu
STRG - Crouch
T - Melee(Certain Objects like toilet brushes can be used as melee weapons.)
[b]3)Change Grenade bug[/b]
If you change your Grenade through the Grenade-Selection-Window and left click, you will throw the selected grenade;  in my case a smoke. Afterwards the grenade display in the HUD changed from frags to smokes. Up to this point everything is working as intended.
The smoke grenades were still displayed as the ""active"" grenade in my HUD. I was quite surprised when I intended to throw a smoke under myself to cover my retreat, but got blasted into space instead. It does not matter which grenade you have selected, if you press G and are in possession of a frag, a frag will be thrown.
[b]4)Hold Key[/b]
For some things you have to hold the key, just pressing it wont work. I repeatedly pressed F like a madman until I realized that I had to hold F to exchange my SCAR for a Shotgun.
[b]5)Automatic Gunlock[/b]
If you aim at a person who is on your side, you get a red X and your gun won't fire. This includes dead friendlies. The ""Gunlock"" hitbox is bigger than the actual hitbox of the entity. If you sit manually on a friendly tank you cannot openfire since you are sitting inside the gunlock-box. On the Aircraft Carrier I often could not shoot at the enemy, because my dead teammates were triggering the ""Gunlock"" making the end boss fight very frustrating.Ohh the Alien Trooper is right in front of you tearing through your HP? Sorry, I can't let you attack it because somewhere in that direction is a dead body that theoretically could get hit. Oops, you're dead. Thanks game!
[b][u]Artificial Intelligence:[/u][/b]
[b]1)AI Detection[/b]
The AI in general seems to be more perceptive, you are no longer a ghost when activating ""Cloak"" mid combat. Also even when invisible the AI will notice you when you get too close; I noticed that the hard way when I tried to sneak past an ATV (Jeep) and the gunner unloaded his MG right into my face.
The only annoying part is that they seem to ""Lock On"" and sometimes see through brush. Once they are (Red)alerted to your presence they do not care how many bushes, trees, fences, etc. are between you and them, they'll shoot at you with pinpoint accuracy. On the other hand, if they're still yellow, they are sometimes stupidly blind.
[b]2)AI Navigation[/b]
If I recall correctly, the AI navigation inside the Cryengine is mostly done with ""Forbidden Area"" and ""Navigation Area"". The First one just prevents the AI from stepping inside the zone, the second is made for precise Navigation, where the AI can only move from and to placed navigation points and can only enter and leave the zone through placed entry markers. The Navigation Area appears to be not working. The AI is walking against walls, gets stuck in buildings.
[b]3)SmartAI Objects[/b]
In the original Crysis game where invisible AI-behavior markers where the Enemy AI would perform certain actions like smoking or repairing something. Most of these Objects do not work. I noticed it when the guy who is usually relieving himself next to an explosive barrel was missing in the first level.
[b]4)AI Enable/Disable bugs[/b]
The ""spawning"" of enemy AI is done through Flowgraph. Something happens like entering an area and then an AI Entity is switched from Disable to Enable and it pops into the world.
This leads to some enemies standing around in a pose that looks like someone pulled the Plug. Like at the end of level 2 some of the patrolstaff stood on a rock, armes straight down, with their FY71 attached to their right hand, staring into the jungle.
 [b]5)AI Boats are less Aggressive[/b]
In the original the boats in the first level were spotting you quite fast. They may have been a bit annoying but they were definitely a threat. The Boats in the remake are no longer the Hawks of the original, instead they are completely blind. In the 1st Level, I killed the first boat's gunner from the Jammer position and destroyed the second boat with the MG of an ATV(Jeep) from a beach near the KVA Command Post. In both cases the Boats did NOT return fire.
[b]6)CQC Tank[/b]
The battle tanks in the 5th map only fight back if you drive close to them, a few foot soldiers of that map just run past the player, not even attacking when you shoot at them.
[b]7)No Helicopter PTSD[/b]
In the original I remember a surge of helicopters getting in my way. There were so many of them that they were absolutely annoying. But in the remaster, there were only a few of them, I'm not sure if they were removed or the AI just couldn't find their way anymore.
[b]8)Alien AI[/b]
The Alien Scouts(Flying Tentacle Monster) didn't use their Secondary attack even once(Charge Attack, firing an explosive projectile). The Alien Troopers(The little jumpy ones) had trouble moving in the Aircraft Carrier, sometimes being unable to attack.
[b][u]Damage:[/u][/b]
[b]1)Object Damage Nerf[/b]
I might be wrong, but the damage dealt by throwing objects seems to have been nerfed. This is a good thing. One Shotting the NVA-General with a Box was kind of a balacebreaker.
[b]2)Suppression Fire[/b]
I don't remember if it was the same in the original but incoming fire comes with Camerashakes and other effects. It makes returning fire more difficult, I like that.

[b][u]Cosmetics:[/u][/b]
[b]1)Roads(Nitpick)[/b]In the Cryengine, The Roads are drawn with a Pathtool and then plastered onto the map like a decal. But it seems a few of them are floating.

[b][u]Conclusion:[/u][/b][b]I do not know in detail what was changed in the remaster. If I'm correct and my experience is not just a series of rare bugs happening one after another then the AI system has been impaired. Whatever they did jammed multiple ""Tools"" responsible for AI navigation.And if they wouldn't have made the AI more perceptive, this would have been more obvious from the start. I cannot recommend the remaster anymore, if you want to play Crysis, buy the original. Get it with it's ""Standalone Expansion Hybrit"" Crysis Warhead(You Play Psychos perspective), you 'll be happier with these two with lower (If you can say that about  a Crysis title) graphics, than with the remaster. If you're a console player.... only get it when it is on discount![/b]",1634830300,1696333060,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Set in a lush, tropical paradise, the game is a beautiful mix of stealth and chaos. The suit's capabilities, switching between armor, speed, and stealth, are a game-changer (quite literally). Each encounter feels like a sandbox where strategies can be mixed and matched. And then there's that iconic tagline: ""But can it run Crysis?"" This game was, and still is, the benchmark for graphical prowess.

The remastered version? It does justice to the original, amplifying what was already a graphical marvel. The sun filtering through the dense foliage, the ripples in the water, the detailed textures — it's all enhanced and feels more alive.

For all its worth, while ""Crysis 2"" might have stolen my heart, the original ""Crysis"" laid the foundation. It set the stage for what was to come, introducing us to the Nanosuit, the alien threat, and a world where strategy and raw firepower go hand in hand.

So, if you're curious about the Crysis universe and wondering where to start, ""Crysis Remastered"" is the gateway. It's the genesis of the series, and it provides context to the sequels. While it might not be my top pick of the franchise, it's undeniably essential.

- multiple times when the death animation of enemies broke (especially the enemies at the later chapters) and they just kinda stand there until they disappear in an explosion

The original game had its fair share of glitches and nothing was done here to fix them. AI pathing issues like enemies moving back and forth against walls/objects, animation issues like helicopters turning sideways without animation and zipping into a wall and exploding, etc. just stupid things you can laugh at, They aren't as bad during the majority of the game since the way the levels are structured are semi-open with your main objectives being having to interact with/destroy an object, or reach a marker, which means stupid AI behavior can be ignored. However, during the final quarter the game decides to become more cinematic and turns into a linear scripted shooter with aliens where you have to follow npcs, clear waves of enemies or wait for scripted sequences to play out. The game completely falls apart here. Enemies will fall over dead with their AI deactivated when their hp reaches zero, but their full death animations won't play out so they won't register as killed by the game, forcing a checkpoint restart if you're lucky, or having to fully quit and restart the game, or, in the worst case scenario, a full level restart. The final level is especially bad at this, with bugs where the sort-of final boss straight up won't spawn once you reach the end, requiring a full level restart and hoping it fixes itself, or, upon beating it and waiting for the real final boss to show up, hoping a scripted event that leads up to it actually playing correctly and not ending up with the npcs not responding, in which case no amount of checkpoint restarts will fix it, so the level has to be completely restarted and you'll have to hope it fixes itself. 
These issues were present in the original release and no attempt was made to fix them here (there's other minor but annoying issues still present too, e.g. vegetation counting as an object so the main character will place c4 on a bush in mid-air instead of throwing it and not being able to pick it back up). This extends to the rest of the remastered trilogy, but the first Crysis is easily the worst and most prone to game ending issues compared to the sequels. 

The game itself is decent, though even back in the day it went downhill once you stop fighting human enemies due to the change in game structure from semi-open levels to a linear cinematic shooter like I said before. And even then there's some parts during its better levels where it gets kind of annoying to play, such as some pointlessly big barren areas where most of your time is spent sprinting from one place to another. This is one of those things where the sequels are way better despite being more cramped due to their console-focused design. 

In short, get this discounted and, once you reach the final few levels, watch the cutscenes and ending on Youtube. Or don't, since the rest of the franchise never directly follows up on this games ending and it was solved in a tie in comic.",1691491307,1691493492,False,11,0,0.633979439735412598,0,True,False,False

The biggest flaw i see in this game is the open world level design. Open sparse levels combined with basic enemy AI and what feels like unbalanced damage numbers on many enemies makes the game a tedium to play. The gameplay quickly becomes stale and after a certain point i was just running from point A to B ignoring all the enemies just to progress the story. The story is pretty basic with nothing much to say about it.

The game has a few bugs too. There's certain missions like one convoy escort mission where a dead alien enemy's body fell straight onto my tank, making it explode and insta kill me. Another time i got stuck inside a helicopter while my AI allies were fighting outside forcing me to restart.

Crysis in general is a very good series. However, this game when compared to its original, is just a downgrade overall, and here's why: It feels a little lazy? The streamlined suit just doesn't work well, and while the classic suit option is still there, it feels weirdly clunky. Foliage animations are at 30fps, so if you're at 60+ then this will be very noticeable. Enemies also don't make foliage move, and in the early game that's actually quite invaluable since it's one of the few ways you can see them when they're using their environment. 

I did have one major issue with the LAST Crysis game. I couldn't beat it. Technical issues forced me to quit the game right at the end as the boss fight just wouldn't stop crashing, I tried everything I could to alleviate it with no issue. That being said, this one was actually beatable! So that's nice. 

All in all Crysis is a great game, and a very fun game. But I can't help to think that maybe the devs did a way too little with this, and it led to an overall weaker product overall. I enjoyed the achievements, I even got them all...well the rarest achievement (throw 10 items to kill enemies) was literally given to me during the final act due to just....holding a box while enemies died. But overall the Delta difficulty does offer some good challenge. Crysis is a part of gaming history, but since this remaster was released in modern day, it does not stand to any other AAA title released around when this was. 

While I would recommend it, I'm leaving the review as negative since the overall game feels broken. Pick this up on a steep sale, $5-$15 anything more is really pushing it. I picked it up during the Summer Sale in a bundle, and for that it was worth it. But on its own? eh.

(̿▀̿ ̿Ĺ̯̿̿▀̿ ̿)̄ 👍

TLDR: Crysis Remastered impresses with breathtaking visuals and retains the beloved game play mechanics of the original. However, the game is marred by occasional bugs and glitches, while the traversal system and final map could use further polishing. AI improvements are also desired. Despite its flaws, Crysis Remastered offers an immersive experience for fans seeking nostalgia.

With all the said.. Still recommend.

Pros:

Breathtaking Visuals : Crysis Remastered stuns with its meticulously redesigned environments, impressive lighting effects, and attention to detail. The game takes full advantage of modern hardware capabilities, creating a visually immersive experience.

Refined Game play Mechanics: The remastered edition retains the beloved core gameplay mechanics, such as the versatile Nanosuit and open-ended level design. Players have the freedom to approach combat in various ways, adding depth to the game play experience.

Engaging Nostalgia: Crysis Remastered successfully captures the essence of the original game, offering a nostalgic journey that fans will appreciate. The updated visuals and refined controls breathe new life into the classic game play.

Cons:

Bugs/Glitches: Crysis Remastered is not without its share of bugs and glitches, as has been commented on by many players. While my play through was relatively smooth, I did encounter one level-breaking bug that forced me to restart the final level.

Polishing Travel Mechanics: The traversal system in Crysis Remastered could benefit from further polishing. Walking across terrain feels less smooth than expected, with abrupt level changes that disrupt the fluidity of sprinting.

Frustrating Final Map: The final map proves to be a source of frustration. Navigating through small hallways and doors is acceptable, but encountering issues with passing through NPCs or NPC bodies necessitates reloading checkpoints to progress.

AI Improvements Needed: Although the AI has been enhanced, some players may find that it could have been further improved in terms of enemy behaviour and tactical decision-making.

Conclusion:
Despite its captivating visuals and enjoyable game play, Crysis Remastered falls short in a few areas. The presence of bugs and glitches, although not pervasive, can disrupt the overall experience. Additionally, improvements are needed in the game's travel mechanics to ensure smoother movement and eliminate abrupt level changes. Lastly, the frustrating aspects of the final map, particularly the issues with interacting with NPCs, can hamper immersion and progress.

There's a lot to say about Crysis
After playing the game three times and starting a new one again
I can defienetely tell, this game does love its open approach to mission accomplishments
And while the gameplay sometimes feels weak (you cant climb or jump in long range for example also some missions can be unforgiving on hardest difficulty), the neat part about it tho - you can complete the game however you like, using any weapons or any approach you can muster

Previously, I hated this remaster for butchered visuals and broken performance
But, they actually fixed the performance issues
And while I certainly miss some old schoold effects, you gotta give credit for new textures

The plot is still hillarious and soldierly AF
The replay value certainly exists
Music is...epic but not a masterpiece

And the level design - it may be not perfect but it still kinda works.

So, forgive me for previous negative review, I take all my words back, Crysis is great and Remaster was pretty well done
In the end at least.

Warhead Remaster anyone?

Lots of vehicles to control, AA turrets, and a super badass suit with cloaking, fast running, high jump, and an armored mode. Weapons can be mildly upgraded with attachments. A bit of stealth, lots and lots of action, some cool moments and a whole lot of cheesy ones. The korean island setting is pretty cool with super open areas despite the game being linear -- you can tackle things in different ways. 

It's pretty janky here n there -- I didn't experience much jank until later on in the game. Dialogue can get cut off, AI can get pretty stupid, I see the potential for getting stuck in props, etc.

Everything else wasn't too good to me (some of the characters -- mostly your commanders and other nanosuit friends I found enjoyable).

Please, play the original. It requires, like, a single command in the launch options to get working on modern hardware. It runs better, looks basically the same, and you can also play CRYSIS WARHEAD. Something that is MISSING from remastered.

The gun play is solid, the scenery is beautiful, and you have a variety of tools to get the job done. It's a bit glitchy but if I played this in 2007 it would have blown me away.

Once you defeat General Kyong, consider the game over. Congratulations, you beat a solid shooter. What follows is the biggest drop off in quality I think I've ever witnessed in a video game.

The next enemies are not fun to fight, the levels become really annoying to navigate and there's even an escort part. 

The real affront though is the final boss. It has attacks that you can do nothing about. Sometimes waves that you need to clear won't appear. Sometimes the game will crash.....Sometimes the final gun that you get just won't work.

Imagine getting the BFG in Doom or the Spartan laser in Halo for the first time and it just not firing...

After finally beating the boss, the game abruptly ends without the job being done.

Now I will add that in order to really get the most out of the first game you do need to install a custom patch that fixes a few minor but important bugs and I would also recommend updating the version of dlss that is being used by the game so you can gain a little more performance but also slightly better image quality :3",1688566754,1688568674,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

2. poor accuracy but i guess that's realistic or because they dont give me a scope until i get a non-silenced precision rifle. (this is a bit of a nitpick)

3. still...like the first game, not enough energy to sneak through a checkpoint and a guard post into the jungle at a higher position, the checkpoint catches me right by a ledge when cloak runs out, in speedruns you could run and jump this, but most people play it through one time or two times... no need for speedrun tricks. 

4. my Scar disappears when i reach a checkpoint, it's my main gun, but has a tendency to run out of ammo, so i use the AK47 the most... to avoid situations ...like running out of ammo. 

5. will still fry your graphics card.

6. this is a nitpick i have ON ALMOST every game, controls always need to be changed so they work better, like i got Lean Left and Learn Right as CTRL and ALT... whoever made the default controls on videogames... kinda messed up, royally. 

7. biggest issue is how inaccurate the radar/minimap is. i'm using the map and i cant see where the guy is, im standing right behind him, hiding in the jungle.. until he runs into my face, lol... pro-stealth. (at least i found him)

beyond all these nutty happenings, good game. fun and interesting little tale about being a USA merc or something.

Edit:

(i gotta RANT here because i cant believe... they only fixed graphics & crashes...probably most bugs but not the ones that ANNOY ME THE MOST) this game is a missed opportunity if anything, but anyone whining about how the graphics are worse ...dont really pay enough attention to detail in the whole.

((But there are serious issues i cant believe they didn't fix...

exihibit A: the Deck BossFight is the worst in gaming... worse than Shadow Warrior without dash, i cant believe i forgot this... and i cant believe they released this... AGAIN, the first attempt... i reloaded the checkpoint 3 times because it felt off (didnt fix the bug), so i just restarted the level, because the boss kept falling through the map... AND on the 3rd reload, i'm fighting the Mother Dropships 30 of them comining at me 1 at a time every 40 seconds... you start to wonder why you are playying this buggy mess of an ending to a decent game.

boss-fight bugged up  that wastes your time, Just like the original... why aren't people complaining about this if it's the same erros? lol


2ndly the mechanics are easy to figure out but the hotzones are almost impossible to predict <<< which means you die over and over dozens of times (if you dont understand that the game is bugged at the end), until you get that 1 lucky happening where you can get a shot off with the spoiler alert: nuke cannon...

3rdly, i knocked 1 arm off the boss....despite the cheat shots the creatures are hitting on me and im trying to shoot the 2nd arm off, but the nukes are going RIGHT THROUGH THE BOSS'S ARM, so im locking on target 5 times and nuking it but the nukes just fly off the map... ehhh??

why did i pay for this...AGAIN? ))

the game is almost perfect but what it does poorly at the end isn't fixed... & i am holding a grudge this time, i won't buy anymore of their games.  How you gonna have me play the same bossfight over 40 times, and lose because of bugs and bad indication on where the boss is going to attack??? the end is an utter failure of design. period. people only love the game because of Super Soldier / Predator / Aliens films we grew up with...TBH. 



-- Anyways... some stuff I WISH they added to the game:

1) boobytrap barrels... when guads pass by, they die 2) put bombs in cars (like a boobytrap) and push them down..to the guardpost gate...to blow up guards when the car crashes

3) DO NOT DIE when you hit against a Wrecked car...with your Car that has 0% dmg on it's health-bar.  they couldnt make it like your car takes 25% dmg when it hits another car? really? that's too much work???

i dont like instantly exploding when i tap a car with my left wheel, is that too much to ask? this copy and paste crap has to stop. that's why im switching my review to negative.

>.> it's a good game but its failures are quite evident... wish the PrecisionRifle and the Shotgun had Silencers (No Country For Old Men...changed the game, every shotgun in the world should have a Silencer now! pay the hommage), as well as function to powerkick people in the knee, lol or a Spartan Kick, this.. is..

Original Crysis wasn't the most optimized game out there and I saw a cry engine showcase with a part that looks just like the island from the first mission of the game then I heard a remaster was inbound, so I was expecting the quality from that showcase to be the entire game and boy was I wrong.

I'll start at the beginning. Crytek sold their souls to the devil and released Crysis remastered on the piece of shit epic game store as an exclusive for an entire year. I know they are starving for money, but this still stings. Anyways about a year later I got the entire trilogy for 70% off and today, I finally got around to playing it.

Some minor Spoilers I guess…..

And man, this game has issues. From visual minor to severe visual glitches that never existed in the first game to mechanics changes such as in that boss fight against that one guy in the nanosuit when you hit him, he has an EMP blast that completely stuns you and you can't do anything when you're stunned, that was not in the original game nor a feature of the nanosuit. That part made me mad as hell lol. That was a big change instead of a 1 vs 1 duel to the death everything is slowed down massively because you can no longer attack him immediately you have to run around and hunt for a weapon and then attack him while the doctor keeps yelling stop him the whole time which she says a lot due to how drawn out this fight is now and he seems to be made of titanium because he's a super bullet sponge now even just in strength mode.

Other changes include at the end when the big Ceph Walker thing grabs you can no longer face it to attack it to go free you're just kind of screwed if you get thrown too far and you die.

Also, when you're on the vehicle turret even if you turn off hold mouse to aim down sights you still must hold mouse to aim down the side of the turret it's quite stupid.

Regarding all these mechanical changes: a remaster is supposed to preserve everything, just improve visuals and optimizations and not reinvent the wheel by changing gameplay mechanics.

One surprising thing is this game preserved the VTOL mission which honestly, I was not expecting because that was cut from the original game that this is based off which is the Crysis version released for the PS3 and Xbox 360 so in short, we're basically playing a port of a PS3 and Xbox 360 game with some extra additional things bolted on.

This remaster was probably the most important remaster to me, and they fucked it up which is well known at this point. The only thing honestly that was improved was the 8K textures they used for the game, but you can fix that by playing the original with just a HD texture pack and done. Also, I was able to play the game from start to finish without a single crash so that's also a positive because their original game if you play about three missions straight, you're going to crash it's weird. 

There are all kinds of other examples of visual downgrades but a few I can think of is 1) at the starting of the first mission prophets face in the first mission intro had a lot more detail in the original. in the “Remake/Remaster” all the detail his face is just flat and 2) per object motion blur being completely removed that's something else you can see at the intro to the first level. 

This reviews all over the place, but I had to write what I'm feeling right after I finished it. I'm going to uninstall this crap and stick with the original which is far better. They shoehorned in cry engine 3 or whatever version they're using into this game, and it shows. This port/half assed remaster is trash I'm very disappointed. This is also much harder to run, and I don't see much visually to warrant that. The difference between Ray tracing on and off is next to none.

TLDR:  Sadly, I cannot recommend this at all. What I can recommend is that you go either on EA Origin or GOG and get the original Crysis and Crysis warhead they are both amazing open ended sandbox games.

So first of all - the performance. It's crap. On a pretty decent machine (5800X + 7900XT + 32GB RAM 3600 CL14) I get frame drops below 60 at 1440p... I'm sorry but the game does not look that good for this level of performance. The 7900XT is currently the 4th best GPU out there and yet it struggles with such an old game ? BS. Before anyone asks, RT was off.

Then there are the bugs, which mind you, were not present in the og version:
- The AI bugs out quite a lot. I've had situations where the bigger squid aliens would go limp and fall from the sky after killing them rather than triggering a death animation they should go through. They would also not explode, just stay there on the ground. Now this caused me to have to restart a few checkpoints cause their mere existence on the map would cause some mission objectives to not register as completed - fun.
- AI pathing is borked. There were so many times where the AI would have trouble either getting over terrain or even deciding where it wants to go, with characters sometimes spining around on their axis for a second before finally going in a given direction.
- World traversal is borked. I had many problems walking over some minor obstacles. This was especially egregious during the last mission where I hade trouble sometimes going through open doors/hatches because there was an alien lying in the doorway, wtf ?
- The audio is borked. Some sounds wouldn't play. Audio positioning is also crap. Many guns sound flat, hollow instead of impactful and punchy.
- Who the F is responsible for F'ing up mouse control in this game ?! I had to set the mouse speed slider to the absolute minimum and then set my mouse at 300dpi in my drivers to be able to play normally. Now this would work while on foot, however once I got into a tank, I had to speed up my mouse considerably to be able to move the turret in a effective way. And then, when I got inside the VTOL ? I had to put the slider to the middle otherwise the VTOL wouldn't even register any mouse movements at all... How ? Why ? There was no such issue in the OG version ! Why did you F this up ?

Sometimes I still think ""will it run Crysis?"" when thinking about a pc, not realizing it was released over 15 years ago.

Crysis 1 on Delta with Advanced A.I Mod and a graphic config used to be one of my favorite FPS experiences and I’ve played FPS games for 20 Years. And to this day it’s in my Top 5 FPS Games of all time. Its not perfect, like no game really is, but it did so much right and did not dumb down the whole game to be a multiplattform game, which sadly will never happen again.

The first Crysis remaster is a bit spotty and deviates more towards “looking pretty” than it does “looking realistic” and removed things like manual saving. It's a mostly-better version of the original, but it's not a 1:1 comparison due to certain physics and shading features breaking in the Remaster, like vegetation reacting to explosives, or SVOGI drastically changing the Cutscenes in a decidedly worse way at times. Overall though? It's a smoother package, more widely accessible, and the RT is damn good.

I would personally recommend this remaster. I think it's overall, especially with the fan patch, a solid experience that runs well, looks pretty nice, and has friendlier balancing and pacing, and who doesn’t love screwing with Koreans?

The modern nanosuit controls are more intuitive to a lot of players, and the game's AI isn't as aim-bot-like anymore. And unless you're really familiar with Crysis, a number of the bugs won't be noticable.

If you don't enjoy this Crysis 1 remaster though, don't let that dissuade you from trying Crysis 2. Crysis 1 is an interesting game, and well worth playing, but it's kind of a mess, and it's not uncommon for newcomers to be like, ""It has interesting ideas, but I don't see what the fuss is about.""

Although this seems like a replacement its actually not because both games feel different and do offer different experiences so I would still recommend both versions including warhead to anyone who enjoys this. Delta difficulty feels like what It should have been and that's what brings out the nano-suit's game-play potential. 

@Crytek My only comment is a big wish to have some enemies spawn in different locations when you re-spawn, replay a map or start a new game all together, so that it would maintain suspense in replays, because it is ultimately those situations when you go in blind which require you to make the right choices with the nano-suit, whether you should play it slow or not, so on and so forth - it makes for epic immersive game-play and helps bring all the environment around you to life.  I still see much potential for this title regardless of newer installments. Reflecting on your pre-alpha/alpha development builds - that simple military style of the game HUD had/has a special impact on my perception and perspective of the game; that version of the HUD gives it a raw military systems feel of IRL modern combat and It changes how the nano-suit feels. I also always wondered why the dive mechanic was removed - t's very easy to see dynamic spawns and a dive mechanic to work very well together.

With a 3080 TI and a 5900X on all high I get 60 FPS average. There are wild fluctuations as well as sometimes and especially indoors its 100 or 120 or you look at another part of the level and it goes super high. I had to tune it all down to high settings and disable RTX to have a stable framerate that isn't all over the place.

Crazy thing is also that it hardly makes a difference if I go for the highest settings or not performance-wise which leads me to the conclusion that it lacks optimization and makes me feel like I might have a better experience with the original modded.

It was also part of the Crytek bundle and pretty cheap for that. The old content is even worse though with the friendly AI getting stuck constantly and not helping you at all.

Also on a sidenote, one EXTREMELY annoying thing to me is the suit audio being absolutely annoying and there is no way to turn it off. Im not talking about the voice but the audio from it whenever you do stuff.

Hit sounds in general are EXTREMELY loud. If I hit an enemy its loud as if the shot that penetrated his body literally just entered my ear - WHY? The sound design does so much right - guns feel meaty and heavy, the soundtrack is great >like back then< but this stupid and plain retarded feedback from your shots and suit that you cant take off? UGH. The sound is actually very buggy, in some missions like in the alien structure there are spots where my gunshots are 2x as loud for no reason at all. Something is seriously wrong with this ""remaster""

Its also extremely pathetic to remaster a console peasant version in that you cannot even save your game whenever YOU want to but some shitty checkpoint system from 15 years ago decides it. BLEH, but I knew what I was getting into so I was not surprised.

Oh and did you know that in a 2022 game YOU CANNOT CHANGE FOV WHICH IS A DEFAULT BASIC FEATURE SINCE...2010? Probably earlier? 60 FOV only for modern gamers I guess. Imagine implementing RTX but literally having no game designer in the team while you never played Crysis yourself -> this dev team.

TL:DR - Crysis that has its remastered moments with a huge grain of salt. ""Fun but annoying"" is how I feel about it. LOTS of issues with sound and nothing has been done to improve on old problems. Still finished it, fun at times and enough to not make me throw it away. Good game, poor remaster. Lots of bugs.

Extra note: You can change the fov my creating a txt file in your main folder and renaming it into a cfg with certain command lines.

However playing the game at 95 FOV makes you see through some stuff if you lean near walls. JUST WOW WHAT DID THEY REMASTERED? WTF, 95 FOV is an absolute standard FOV for FHD or 2K screens. Literally every shooter since a few years or more have a normal FOV of 85 or 95.

But no this game is only comfy...with 60...wtf

Important Edit: Final boss/part is EXTREMELY buggy. You can die from invisible fire and the boss sometimes just dont take damage while the game tells you to use your special launcher, you only damage it if you go infront of it directly for no logical reason at all. Also if you go infront you die from invisible flames that magically kill you in 4 ticks (1 second each). Extremely annoying ending.

Ryzen 7 7700X
Intel ARC A770 LE 16GB
Samsung 990 Pro SSD...  

So I decided to giver this remastered version a try.   

In most other games, Kingdom Come Deliverance, Far Cry 6, Star Citizen, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, to name a few.....   I'm getting anywhere from 80 - 120+ FPS at 1440p with maximum graphics settings.. 

I loaded this game up and saw there's a graphics setting called ""Can it run Crysis"" and I scoffed at it.   

I set the game to that setting.

Holy shit!   

20 - 30 FPS max, and turns my rig into a Space Heater!   

I lowered the graphics settings one step down, to ""Max"" and that brought things to around 33 - 35 FPS....

Personally, I would recommend starting with Crysis 2 if you are interested in the series and if you want to know about the story, either look up a playthrough or spend an hour on the wiki reading up on the story.

My reasons for this conclusion:
 - [b]The game's campaign is relatively short[/b] (it took me a bit under 8 hours to beat)
 - [b]The finer story elements feel disjointed, forced and random[/b]. There were quite a few times where I was looking at a situation and asking myself, ""Why, why would you do that?!"" or ""How did I get here again?""
 - [b]The story feels... incomplete?[/b] The game ends rather suddenly and at a weird time with no true resolution to the plot. To further add to the confusion, when moving onto the next game, it is as if the characters of this game (Nomad, The doctor, Psycho) never existed
 - [b]Bad / unenjoyable boss fights.[/b] At the start of each boss fight, I found myself thinking, ""Is this a boss fight? Why are we fighting? What just happened to 'x'?"". And the fights themselves were of the type where you didn't know what was actually going on and after shooting at the boss a bunch you start wondering if there is a weak-spot or something that you need to hit to deal damage. A good example is the answer to the 2nd boss is to shoot it with ~4500 minigun rounds. (Because after shooting the boss with the first 1000 rounds and seeing nothing happen you are likely to consider shooting at it more with the same weapon). After every boss fight I just found myself thinking, [i]""Thank you! It is finally over!""[/i]
 - [b]Contradictory game play elements.[/b] This game if full of elements that directly contradict each other's purpose. A good example of this would be the stealth feature in the game, you are incentivised to use stealth in the game, problem being that enemies can frequently spot you at points where you still can barely make out the enemy with a 4x scope. Enemies spotting you is also instant or close to it. Additionally, if you fire when cloaked, your energy is instantly set to 0 (even with a suppressor) meaning you can only fire out of cloak (this does get addressed in later games) this also applies to all weapons, so a shotgun is just as valid as a pistol in terms of energy conservation. Human enemies also only die in 1 hit to headshots and can take 3+ hits to die to body shots. So, if you shoot and miss the head, you have alerted the entire enemy force to your presence. You also have your energy instantly get set to 0 if you get shot so using cloak so using it in a dangerous situation is likely to just leave you without energy and still in danger. All these factors made it so that it was far easier, less time consuming and less risky to just sprint past all the enemies you see
 - [b]Your character has surprisingly low durability.[/b] Despite wearing the most advanced suit of armor in the world, you still go down to a second of sustained fire from any weapon. Even if you use armor mode, it will only block maybe 4 bullets and leave you with no energy and no health
 - [b]Ceph are miserable to fight.[/b] There wasn't a second I fought the Ceph that I enjoyed. They are tanky, there is a lot of them, they are fast, and they can fly. I would find myself constantly looking into the sky wondering where I was being attacked from while being shot at from 3 different directions all while every enemy takes 2-3 shots from even the strongest weapons in the game. The only saving grace was that they dealt rather low damage. (again they are much more pleasant to fight in the later games)

In all, this game's primary effect on me was making me appreciate the other games more for their improvements to the formula",1684941107,1684941107,False,3,0,0.492547005414962769,0,True,False,False

Crysis Remastered is a remaster of the iconic shooter by Crytek. In the latest version, only the quality of the graphics has changed, but as this is my first time with this series, I will review it from scratch.
[h1]The Plot[/h1]
We play as Nomad, a super-soldier who, together with his unit, goes on a mission to the Lingshan Islands to investigate Korean activity, which ends up in a fight for survival against very aggressive aliens. In general, this game can be compared to typical American action/sci-fi movies from the early 2000s. It is a shooter where we do not need to use too much brain power, but the characters that accompany us, the main character and the opponents are interesting enough to generate specific feelings for them. and opinions. Overall, I found the game-pacing to be very good here, the alien discovery intrigue and the final alien encounters are well separated from each other, creating tension and making the encounters more meaningful. All in all, each character has something to add here, and they have their own experiences and motivations, most of them aren't useless so even though we're a powerfull super-soldier, we don't feel like we have to do everything completely on our own.
[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The mechanics of being a super soldier are great. We can run very fast, modify our weapons, and our super-strength and durability allow us to break through buildings and massacre opponents in melee combat. Speaking of buildings, I like that the environment, i.e. structures and trees, are mostly destructible, so the environments are very interactive, which is a lot of fun to just smash and blow things up. The shooting itself is good, some enemies are damage sponges, but overall it's good. The island itself is surprisingly huge, and while it's mostly jungle, the massiveness of the map is admirable. Moving on to the aliens, I really liked them, although they follow the same logic as all the aliens from early 2000s and late 90s movies. Anyway, the game tries to make them original enough. The skirmishes with them are very dynamic, we often fight side by side with normal soldiers, and we fight for survival in very explosive skirmishes against an opponent that has much better technology, and some terraforming capabilities. Pure epicness and the last act of the island evacuation is brilliant. The only problem with all this is the part of the game where we enter the alien base, where gravity is turned off. The environment, although full of detail, is full of annoyingly fast enemies, it's hard to navigate, and the fact that we're constantly turning in place certainly didn't help my hungover stomach when going through this mission.
[h1]Technical Matters[/h1]
Graphically it's very good, but in the tradition of Crysis, the optimization is poor. At least the game doesn't crash to desktop. As for the music, it's okay, typical sci-fi action game music. The voice actors did a good job, but the biggest plus of all this are great visual, and sound effects.
[h1]Summary[/h1]
A shooter classic, and a good game that is basically a game version of old American movies. A lot of good fun that doesn't require a lot of brain-usage from us. While it's nothing super special, I still think it's the best Crysis game out there.

You start out in a repetitive cycle of fighting enemies in the way to your object, fighting enemies at the objective, and disabling a few ""signal jammers"" (which feels like a massively cheap side quest). This wouldn't necessarily be a problem, hadn't the combat been so bland either. Shooting heads doesn't kill, same for close-range shotgun rounds. Long time to kill leads to slow pacing. Pair this with the use of your suit and the time you'll be waiting for it to recharge, and pacing goes down the drain.

That's the first half. Midway through, you're dumped into this obnoxious alien ship, with unclear routes, unresponsive character movement and a couple of aliens which are again, not fun to fight.

And then there's the mission where you pilot a ship - more unresponsive movement and boring combat. Not to mention that all throughout your allies keep rushing you to get to the objective, which honestly doesn't do anything for the game's atmosphere, it's just really annoying.

""The game of the future"" as some said, ""Unbelievable graphics!"" and ""A game so advanced, you need a computer from NASA to run it!""
Now that I'm grown, have my own beefy computer, and the game has a modern remaster to pull it to relevance a decade and a half later - I thought I'd give this remnant from the past a shot and see what I was missing out on.

Mind you, I have no rosy lens or nostalgia goggles when I see this game, and I wasn't expecting to be blown away or witness some legendary epiphany of gaming through this - I was expecting a fun, entertaining game.

It is a shame that I found a great deal of disappointment and mediocrity where I was expecting thrill and fun.

The presentation alone is a specific taste. The mid-2000's was known for this cringe-inducing irreverence and ""too cool"" pretense that saturated entertainment and made games like Halo a poetic masterpiece in relativity, and this game is no different as a product of that era. Characters talk as though they are in a Saturday morning cartoon, everything feels disjointed and dulled as though its intended market was around the age of 10.
While the premise begins interesting, it doesn't take long for things to devolve.
While the marketing material and all of the best gameplay points to an immersive shooter, the truth is that the creators modeled their work after Call Of Duty 2 and 3 - which achieved near parody of Modern Warfare which came out that very same year. Instead of focusing entirely on the solid core of shooter gameplay, the game constantly introduces setpieces and new mechanics that last for a level (Or sometimes only a part of a level) which throw the entire tone off from being an immersive piece into being a wacky, zany comic book from history's dust-bin.

This remaster has done a lot to bring the game into the modern landscape, but there's only so much that a Remaster can do to turn a 15 year old game into a relevant technological marvel. Once I toned Raytracing down, my computer was running more than fine with only a few dropped frames at intense moments of the game - but in the end, there are a lot more visually impressive experiences around today, or even from many years ago. Textures are low resolution, god-rays look like a flat widget, dust effects are cheap. While the game was ahead of its time with things like Real-Time-Shadows and the sort, such comforts are not nearly as stone-cold impressive as they must have been back when Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare was released. Simply put: Its main selling point has failed to stand the test of time, what was once jaw-dropping and ground breaking has become a modern convenience.

When you get into the game, the dissonance begins to creep in like an insidious illness. Within a few minutes, the most optimal strategy will become clear: Use your cloak to line up a headshot, uncloack and shoot, recloak instantly, move a little and repeat.
The combat aspects were ahead of its time, indeed, as the game feels like an unholy mixture of Call Of Duty games blended with Far Cry. But, as one may remember, Call Of Duty and Far Cry games are all about aggression and speed - but Crysis, on the other hand, revolves around a more methodical approach. The two aspects of gameplay are laid out plain to see: on one hand you have an incredibly fast-paced power fantasy with superhuman powers that allow players to become a walking army... on the other there is an ultra-realistic hardcore simulator that wants to break your bones for broth. These two elements clash. Does the game want you to sit behind cover as you're pinned down by a turret, waiting for an opportunity to run to the next foxhole like Call Of Duty - does it want you frantically fleeing into the woods to lay an ambush like Far Cry - or does it want you to storm in like a super-soldier and trash the place? Answer: None of the above, but all at the same time. It's a mess. The most efficient way to play is the most boring.
Something more at the game's core is the Energy System. Everything you do costs Energy: Running, Jumping, Throwing, Cloaking, Armor. And it takes ~10s to replentish. During this time, you will basically have to wait before you continue playing the game. As a loose calculation, I suspect that ~10s out of every 70 that I played this game, I was simply WAITING for my energy to return so I can get back to playing it. Which means that, in my 7 hours of playing the game, nearly 1 HOUR of it was me WAITING to jump, sprint, interact, cloak, or have armor.
To make matters worse - AI is severely lacking. The basic grunts are generally brick-stupid and make for easy fodder, but more 'advanced' enemies later in the game follow a formulaic move-set that players will learn in a matter of seconds, and then have to endure for another couple of hours. It is not an engaging interaction between man and machine as much as a test of patience.
Grunts were bad enough, but the game forces a couple of extremely contrives and laughably bad ""boss fights"" your way at a few points, which are so poor - it begs the question ""Why even bother?""
The most blatant misplay of all was the lack of collectables, secrets, or character growth. Abilities cannot be expanded upon or increased, weapons will always be disposable, no hidden collectable items, no secret power ups, no ""true ending"". It's just the same march from A to B every game with a static player and static gameplay. There are no dynamics in play outside of the visual presentation. With a few exceptions of strange puzzles that don't belong in this game at all.

And in spite of levels appearing open-ended, they are all linear in every practical way.

I used a term to describe the game experience to my wife: ""The Thin Cloak Of Immersion""
I love IM-Sims, where players get into the mind of the character and project an attitude as though the events of the game are real or serious by nature. Playing this way in Crysis, I had an enjoyable time sleuthing past enemies, knocking out foes, and killing rival soldiers when they saw me to best conceal the truth of my nature... but after a meaningless death for a silly reason or another (Falling, random land mine, pressed the wrong button, etc.) the Immersion was broken like tension on a water's surface. Fickle and fleeting as it was, I had fun trying to extract some semblance of immersion, but the truth is that the game is such a trial of endurance - the first sacrifice to play is Immersion itself.
This was a big lesson that I learned from this game - Time is the enemy of immersion. And a game that demands players use TIME as a currency to play, will never draw players in.
The other lesson that I learned from this game is that POLISH < SUBSTANCE. While a well polished product, Crysis simply lacks substance to elevate it over the other offerings in this day and age.

What holds it back is not so much negativity, but mediocrity.
The only thing worse than an unspeakably bad game is one so tortuously boring that it feels like a chore to play.
It got to the point where I was tabbing out of the game to get some remote work done in my spare time.
You heard that right.
I literally was so bored with the game I chose to do WORK over playing it.

~

TL;DR
5/10
Crysis is an Average game. (Painfully so)
it feels like a very ambitious tech demo, but what holds it back the most is that on one side it has a comic book power fantasy, and on the other it has an immersive, serious simulator presentation - and the two clash horrendously throughout the playthrough. In spite of its ambitions to spark a flame that will elevate it into stardom, this game has been left in the cold - buried deep down and forgotten under a mountainous island of superior alternatives.",1682793073,1682793073,False,11,2,0.528794825077056885,0,True,False,False

THIS is one of the examples as why ""good graphics =/= good game"" and one of the examples of PERFECT mediocrity by Triple As; just a paint-over of ""Looks nice"" with a peppering of ""Cool"" stuffs over an outdated shooter that, once just SLIGHTLY played, immediately breaks immersion and gives away the clunkiness and jankiness IN A BAD WAY

Positives
+ Nice graphics (But, technically speaking, if you like pretty graphics and don't mind gameplay, just go watch a benchmark screensaver, since their graphics are SOOOO GOOOOD and you don't mind crappy gameplay, right?)
+ Collapsible/Destructible environment

Negatives
- Unintuitive AI; a Remaster and they make ZERO changes to the AI; no flanking, no ganking, they group up like 7 y.o. kids playing football (even in-game convos suggest ""these guys are trouble"") but hey sure, the ""elite badass"" troops bunch around waiting for a grenade to be popped on their feet, yet they themselves almost never use grenades DESPITE being bottle-necked and killed off 1 by 1 for the last 2-3 minutes and doesn't encircle to gank despite being able to talk.. OH WOW MUCH ELITE, SUCH BADASS, VERY SOLDIER, KEKG
*Go play Stalker Anomaly for an example of Intuitive AI (which, btw, is a 2004 game by a small company modded and updated even until 2021)

- ZERO Multi-approach; ""Oh, a different branching path? SIKE it's just a 10 metre-difference vantage point that gives you a slight advantage over YET ANOTHER of the HUNDREDS of 3-5 people brain-dead mobs
*Go play the Dishonored series for a great example of multi-approach that ACTUALLY makes a difference in story progression, upgrade system, and ending

- Weapon variability; with a remaster, at least you'd consider weapon degradation (just for hardest difficulty is fine, just AT LEAST make an effort to make things different), rewarding exploration with different mods for your weapons, or dropships for your suit upgrades (since, you know, your MOST ELITE JSOC soldiers are in trouble in a remote island). The weapon mods are just 3-5 things that you'll only change 1 every 30 min or so (I only swapped between reflex sight and assault scope for my single-shot silencer AK for 1/3 of the game, simply because switching other mods in other weapons does not bring any difference nor variability to the way i approach objectives anyways)

- Gameplay Loop (or, in simpler terms, Addictiveness); Crysis is basically ""Fight this 3-7 people brain-dead mobs with this slightly cool suit with ONLY 4 functions"" repeated ad nauseum. No effort whatsoever in the remaster to add new gameplay elements whatsoever, improve existing AI or interaction, nope, nothing... even the options to interact with the suit functions feels counter-intuitive (why is there no options to quickly toggle between ""normal"" shield mode with ""heavy shield"" mode on PC? the elite of the elite suits for TACTICAL COMBAT and they can't make this distinction???)
*The perfect example of excellent gameplay loop is Dredge; ironically i just played it before this, a LITERAL FISHING GAME less than 1 GB is so well-designed it's actually MORE FUN than a shooter with ""one of the best graphics"" in terms of gameplay loop

- Scripted scenes; in one of the missions, I'm cloaked, sneaking around the forest, suddenly the detection bar jumps up to max, a group of soldiers insta-appears right in front of me, then stand there doing nothing and the previously max-out detection bar jumps to 3/4 and start lowering... This is just one of the examples of badly designed scripted scenes, and is a stellar example of lazy game design; mind you, I'm not trying to break the game nor glitch it, I'm simply using the stealth-mechanics AS INTENDED lore- and gameplay-wise
*Plenty of games have cleverly designed scripted scenes that feels ""natural""; Sekiro, Deus Ex, Fallout NV, that does not break immersion in such a jarring way


TLDR; One-dimensional shooter with the same ""here's 3-7 brain-dead AI enemies that can't even comprehend where you are even when their friend was shot ONE METER IN FRONT of them"" gameplay loop repeated ad nauseum, a seemingly cool tactical suit that's actually counter-intuitive (in PC at least) designed to impress 7-14 year-olds by visuals

(ironically, the only reason i played is because i remembered back then the only good thing regarding this game is its graphics, and i wanted to reconfirm, in case I'm wrong LOL)",1682734057,1682734057,False,5,1,0.482542484998703003,0,True,False,False

У неї все одно варто грати, навіть якщо це лише для того, щоб відчути цікаві здібності нанокостюма та дивуватися тому, що було і є дуже гарною грою.

Перші кілька рівнів — це великі відкриті середовища, які дають вам свободу підходу до їхніх цілей. Але це вірно лише в самому буквальному сенсі; ви можете підійти до цілей з будь-якого напрямку, тому що ви не обмежені прямолінійним шляхом. Але на цьому свобода закінчується; немає жодних варіантів щодо того, як ви фактично виконуєте поставлені перед вами завдання, або будь-яких варіантів ігрового процесу в стилі «імерсивного симулятора».

Після цих перших рівнів гра стає більш схожою на лінійний шутер. Це все ще цікаво, але це, мабуть, не те, за чим ви прийшли чи очікували.

У найскладнішому режимі гра здебільшого на диво легка, з дуже щедрим відновленням здоров’я та щита та великою кількістю доступних боєприпасів. Здатність нанокостюма зробити вас надсильним, невидимим або дуже швидким означає, що ви можете легко маневрувати ворогами, а будь-яке випробування насправді виникає лише завдяки тому, що ви першим стріляєте у будь-якого ворога, якого зустрінете.

Найбільше розчарування від Crysis полягає в тому, що з більшості зброї нудно стріляти. Існує чудова система, за допомогою якої ви можете змінювати навісні пристрої зброї на ходу, але ви ніколи не отримаєте справді захоплюючу зброю, за винятком, можливо, ракетної установки (коли ракетна установка взагалі не весела?)

Цей оновлений здебільшого добре, хоча є деякі досить серйозні проблеми з балансуванням звуку та моменти, коли звукові ефекти чи музика не чутні, коли вони повинні бути. Транспортні засоби, які знаходяться за сотні метрів, звучать так, ніби вони прямо на вас, дивні речі в цьому роді. Ця версія гри також використовує систему контрольних точок без ручного збереження, що є справді поганою заміною.

Це рекомендація з кількома застереженнями, але здебільшого я добре провів час. Дещо про костюм, який сповіщає про ""Плащ. Заручено"". викликає у мене викид дофаміну, так що лише це було варте ціни!",1681641578,1681641578,True,1,0,0.488997548818588257,0,True,False,False

Crysis Remaster is quite possibly the most unnecessary and maybe even worst ""remaster"" of all time. For every improvement this ""remaster"" provides there is also a downgrade of equal or greater impact. I would recommend you instead purchase the ""Crysis Maximum Edition"" which includes the original PC version of the game as well as the ""Crysis Warhead"" standalone expansion, which has never gotten the ""remastered"" treatment yet.

Why is Crysis Remastered such a mixed bag? Crysis Remastered is based on the console ports of the game rather than the original PC version and uses a newer version of Cryengine. I'm not going to cover all the pros and cons of the graphics as there are numerous resources that already cover that such as this video I recommend you watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxBTgRcHYFA.

Although I recommend the original Crysis over Crysis Remastered, here are some important points that may make Crysis Remastered a better option for you:
- Crysis Remastered has Steam achievements while Crysis does not.
- Crysis Remastered runs on the Steam Deck while Crysis does not.
- Crysis Remastered allows options for simplified and classic suit ability controls while Crysis only allows classic suit ability controls.

NOTE: Keep in mind that numerous things were patched into Crysis Remastered after it's original release, so although it is still not a good ""remaster"" it has been made better than the original reviews. For example, the ""Ascension"" level was not included, the classic suit abilities were not an option, and their were major performance issues, but each of those has been added or improved via patches.

All that being said, I will still be giving this a recommendation, because at the end of the day it is still ""Crysis"" and it is one of my favorite first person shooter games and franchises.",1643924322,1681405684,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For the most part it's still a pretty fun game but the goddamn alien cave was a pain in the original, but forgivable as it was a new thing then. But, as they chose to cut certain parts from Remastered because ""players really didn't like it"" (The Acension level) they left in the singular worst and most frustrating part of the damn game, the ""core"" alien cave. Worse still THEY MADE IT EVEN MORE INFURIATING. They did make some changes... IN THE WRONG DIRECTION adding to the frustration/BOREDOM-THAT-NEVER-ENDS when they could have left it in for story purposes but streamlined it for a less flow and momentum breaking effect instead of leaving the abominable aspect.

I didn't rage quit this game, I bored quit it after wasting over an hour of my life wandering around the cave aimlessly trying to find a way out. SHITTY SHITTY UNFORGIVABLE game design! Now I'm going to ""bored uninstall"" it. Then I'm going to ""bored pan review"" it straight to hell because it's no less that it deserves.

Stay away from this game unless you have a perverse masochistic desire to waste time in the senseless alien cave accomplishing nothing, and you MUST endure this torture if want to progress in the game.

There's just no excuse for this kind of design in a fast paced action game. At least check videos on ScreYouTube and watch the sequence to get an idea if you can endure the suffering first.

Also, as a parting shot, the elimination of a proper save system in favor of a ""checkpoint system"" is a major faux pas! It's an indicator of ""console-itis disease"". I'd like to save my game progress at need because I don't know when mom might demand I take out the trash or my wife may demand I go to my mother-in-law's place for diner.  Instead I'm stuck with saving when the game gives me permission (unlike the original). Sometimes I'm sleepy NOW! Not when the game thinks I should be. Shouldn't I be allowed to save and quit the game at need. Besides, what happens when I want to go back prior the the last checkpoint? Restart level? Great, another 45 minutes of my life gone when I could have simply reloaded a 10 minute save.

Also, one of the things I enjoy in a game is saving a certain point and experimenting with different tactics, methods weapons and outcomes, which is especially true of the Crysis series. Often I'll reload and try a different tactic even If my last tactic was successful.

The spawning system an open maps (very large open maps, but not true open world) make it so every single playthrough is different past the first few kills in the first village area you approach, but that is the tutorial.

It is the BEST first person shooter ever created in my opinion for 2 reasons.  It was a decade ahead of its time and it needed the best pc at the time, but that is not why.  Its innovation, which the series itself dropped in the sequels has still not been rivaled in any game I have seen.  In the field as bullets are flying modification of any weapon you pick up is one thing but a physics sandbox on top of it makes it special, Chop down trees, blow em up, use your super suit to punch down most walls except reinforced concrete and so on.

Open world, every fight based on the spawn system is different in every playthrough and the modification system was great and I was hoping that they would take this awesome baseline and innovate but they didn't.  They regressed making a Crysis 2 and 3 a corridor shooter.

I hope Warhawk gets remade as well, unless somehow I missed that it was part of the remaster as it is the same game from a 2nd character's point of view and different missions.

They had basic vehicle combat and you could tell they planned on flight combat in future release, especially with the surprise enemy at the end 1/3rd of the game, but nope.  Bow and Arrow, different character and boring storyline about the suit rather than the secret enemy hit the sequels.

I will be playing the sequels for my 2nd time since i got them in this package but probably that 2nd time only.  However every year or so I will pop in Crysis and play through it with a different style that time.  As with release there are a few times you crash but luckily it is right at a checkpoint.  They never fixed the save system.

Besides that one problem, you should try it.  Especially now that it is cheaper and remade with modern graphics.

Crysis should have been the template for all FPS shooters going forward.  Realistic, Sci-Fi, modern, etc...  all could have been improved with the systems in Crysis but for some reason or another they made the sequels for a more casual audience that did not want to approach a KPA group will crab crawling prone to sneak in, map the enemy's location (which differs based on several factors beside random, like if you went loud in a close by place or enemy, they are already on the mounted guns and patrolling with intent or took out everything quietly or completely stealthed, with no kills except the tranquilizer (tactical attachment) dart.

I'll straight up say Crysis is a fun shooter with the possibility of a diverse approach to many problems. It nails the vehicle-, air-, and infantry combat of games from the 2000's. The story isn't the greatest but it takes you for a fun ride. With the exception of a few situations, you can go through most of the game without killing anyone, or killing every hostile in sight, depending on what you want to achieve.

Beyond this, this is a joke of a ""remaster"" it has bugs up the shitter, and questionable game design that sometimes breaks the game, on top of all that its terribly optimized and can crash many times throughout because it just has a data overload no matter what computer you are using.

This is a game that I’ve played since 2007, I still have my physical copy of it on my shelf and I’ve played it many times with many hardware configurations, so without a shadow of a doubt, I kinda have a feeling when a scene is rendered correctly or not.

I played this remaster from start to finish with Ray Tracing [b]ON[/b] and it sure does look absolutely beautiful, one of the best looking games of 2007 is still one of the best looking games in 2023, no question about it. But it only looks great in very specific circumstances, for example, in bright daylight the RT technology shines (no pun intended), but in the second half of the game which involves a lot of dark areas and a lot of snow, you’d be hard pressed to tell if RT is still being used if it wasn’t for the performance hit.

The last level was particularly painful for how darn DARK it gets, there’s a certain lab scene that makes it unreasonably dark when there’s like 5 people in the same room, it sure as heck should be a lot brighter with that many people in it. 

Not only the dark scenes get comically dark, but I’ve also found plenty of gameplay bugs, especially in the second half, like rocks that sway back and forth like leaves, soldiers getting stuck in important doorways, dialogues that trigger a second time in a row after going back to where the trigger was, music cutting in and out… I understand this is an old game with very different tech than what is considered standard nowadays, but it sure as heck didn’t feel like it was falling apart like a house made out of sticks and glue with a shiny polish.

And that’s without mentioning how bad they screwed with the controls, Saber Interactive, in their infinite wisdom, wanted the controls to feel closer to it’s sequels, but it only feels like a forced, dumbed down version of the original without the tight feel of the sequels, fortunately you can go back to the original controls, but ALSO they took away the quick save feature in place of a crappy checkpoint system without letting you pick from earlier saves if you somehow get screwed by said system.

I’m in a sort of predicament with this review, I do not recommend this remaster because of how buggy it felt throughout my playthrough, but I also hesitate to recommend the original release instead because of how hard it is to make it run at reasonable framerates on modern computers. 

Don't buy the original on Steam, instead I’d recommend the GOG release of the original Crysis along with Warhead, you can get both for dirt cheap and they both already have most fixes applied, namely without DRM --which was a big issue with both games back in the day.

Game is still worth playing, but stay away from this remaster.",1678837995,1678903931,False,53,2,0.806126177310943604,0,True,False,False

Достоинства Crysis Remastered:

1. Графика: одним из главных достоинств игры является улучшенная графика. Улучшенные текстуры, тени и освещение в игре делают ее более красивой и реалистичной. Это создает атмосферную игровую обстановку, которая помогает игроку более глубоко погрузиться в игровой мир.

2. Игровой процесс: игровой процесс в Crysis Remastered сохраняет ту же механику, что и в оригинальной игре. Игрокам предоставляются различные варианты прохождения уровней благодаря свободной структуре уровней и разнообразию оружия. Игровой процесс сохраняется более чем за десять лет после первого релиза.

3. Искусственный интеллект: в Crysis Remastered значительно улучшен искусственный интеллект противников. Это делает их более умными и агрессивными, что позволяет игроку находить новые подходы к решению задач. Более разнообразные тактики и более сложный игровой процесс помогут сохранить интерес игроков.

4. Улучшенная оптимизация: улучшенная оптимизация позволяет игре работать лучше на более слабых компьютерах, чем оригинал. Она также обеспечивает стабильный кадровый поток, что не разрывает игровой процесс и позволяет наслаждаться игрой.

Недостатки Crysis Remastered:

1. Мало изменений: Crysis Remastered не добавляет много нового к игре, кроме улучшенной графики. Игра сохраняет ту же самую сюжетную линию, механику и особенности, что может быть разочаровывающим для тех, кто ожидал больше изменений.

2. Ошибки и баги: Crysis Remastered содержит некоторые ошибки и баги, которые могут встречаться во время игры. Некоторые пользователи сообщают о проблемах с синхронизацией звука и видео, некоторые утверждают, что игра иногда имеет проблемы с переключением режимов визуальных эффектов. Все это может влиять на качество игрового процесса и вызывать раздражение у игроков.

3. Отсутствие многопользовательского режима: Crysis Remastered не содержит многопользовательский режим, что может разочаровать некоторых игроков, которые ожидали возможность сыграть с друзьями в онлайн-режиме. Однако, оригинальная игра была изначально спроектирована для однопользовательского прохождения, так что это не является большим недостатком для игры.

4. Высокие требования к системе: хотя Crysis Remastered имеет улучшенную оптимизацию, игра все же имеет высокие требования к системе. Для достижения наилучшего игрового опыта игрокам придется иметь достаточно мощный компьютер, что может быть проблемой для тех, кто хочет играть на старых или бюджетных компьютерах.

В целом, Crysis Remastered является хорошим переизданием оригинальной игры. Улучшенная графика, игровой процесс и искусственный интеллект противников помогают улучшить игровой опыт, но некоторые игроки могут быть разочарованы отсутствием нового контента и проблемами с ошибками и багами. Однако, если вы любите оригинальную игру Crysis, то Crysis Remastered является хорошим выбором для повторного прохождения этой классической игры.",1678830383,1678830520,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was on a 1650 system on the original game and it struggled. Now im on a 3070 system playing 1440p at ultra settings with performance raytracing. What I do remember is several spots losing fps like crazy. Still the same no doubt the engine's fault. It was still a fun game to play. If youre to play these games it probably is best to buy this version if you ever upgrade to a better pc. I got it as a bundle for under $20. All the hours combined of the three games is about 27 hours. So in my eyes it was worth buying. I would attempt to play the crysis trilogy with a 4gb card. Having a smooth experience is out the question even 1080. The story is still great. Though I really wish they would have redone the in game cinematic cutscenes better. They still look like 2010 cutscences (Not gameplay ones). But the FREAKING TRANSPORT MISSION WITH THE TORNADOES. STILL ABSOLUTE CRAP. They couldnt have put a little effort in making the controls better. It is still one of the worst missions I have ever played in a game. Because its never your controllers fault. Through my playthrough my controller worked fine but the game bugged out to where it wouldn't register my thrust. Had to restart the game. There were a total of 4 moments where I had to either restart the game entirely multiple times, last checkpoint load, or restart entire mission multiple times. This game still is buggy like the original. Which is a shame because this is supposed to be the best version. Overall crysis is still a good game but what was the point of remastering when they still havent solved the original issues over a decade later. Wont matter which version you buy original or remastered, both have their issues. Though I less in this version. Gameplay is fun and enjoyable.

Never thought I'd hear that once again in my life. Quite the trip down the memory lane, down to the stutters and laggy stuff right out of the gate. I seriously can't complain about the lack of optimization, because it's just part of the Crysis experience.

Only buy if you have some spare money that you don't know what to spend on, else, you're better off with the original and some graphical mods, RT is pretty useless and unnoticeable in this game (although you'll feel your FPS tanking because of it), and I'd guess the only true advantage this has over the original, is it's capability of running on Windows 10/11 without any external executables and such, or if you care about achievements, since the remasters have those.

Still, again, nice trip down the memory lane, even that sad feeling of thinking ""hey, I can run this game pretty well!"" while at that starting nightly beach, just to realize you are at 40 FPS once you get to the first open area.",1676317401,1676348453,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

But still there are some points I want to say that perhaps others may not mention:

1. The story begins with full of mystery, alien creature, horrible killer, ancient science, make us desperate to know what happened, and where that thing comes from. But later, suddenly we just begin to fight with it, and the people don't show any shock, and the game doesn't tell us the background of the alien.

2. Since you are making a game about alien, I think you should put heart in it, take is seriously. Now you just draw a mechanical octopus, and tell me that's an alien? I mean, at least, you could give some flying saucer, or the Grey alien, that's not bad, but, octopus, really? The only thing I want to do is cook and eat them, I love octopus! It's delicious, but it's not horrible or mysterious.

3. The progression of difficulty is not well handled. The early part is easy, but when fighting the alien, the difficulty suddenly rises too much.

4. You know that many people like sniper, please, give us more ammo of the sniper rifles.

5. The no-gravity mission there is kind of confusing, some people may get sick. I think should add a direction.

6. The worst mission: Airplane. GOD！Have you ever seen an airplane that can only fly 150 meters high?? It's a toy plane? You force a fighter pilot to fly among the low mountains, also be easy to get lost.",1675474004,1675760426,True,3,0,0.56204378604888916,0,True,False,False

I've never played any of the other Crysis games so I'm not sure how they compare to this, but what I've read is that they are a lot better. I'd like to give this a mixed review rather than a thumbs up because of some glaring issues. First the AI is absolutely terrible. Some of the glitches include trucks driving on top of other trucks or enemies phasing in and out of the ground/walls. Secondly the last mission was an absolute pain for me. The game ran smoothly for me until the very last mission during the boss fight. I think I crashed four or five times, maybe more. The final boss is also really rough on delta unlike the rest of the game where It's almost ""like"" a cake walk (I still got my ass handed to me, just not as badly as halo 2 on legendary). I can't not recommend this game because I still had a lot of fun except for the end, but fun nonetheless.

You're a soldier, part of a squad enhanced with nanosuits, set out to find what the Koreans are up to on this rather bleak island.

[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]
This game is a lot of fun. It's a staple of its time: the era of single-player action-story games. It's linear in terms of objectives—as was the standard in its era—but it's for good reason. It features ""secondary objectives,"" but really they feel more like additional objectives. They're along the way to the main objective and are really hard to miss.

There's this one section that stands out to me, it's where you get to pilot and fight with a tank. The vista is amazing and grand. It captures the pure contrast between a paradise-like island and opposing forces fighting against each other.

Stealth is also done in an engaging manner. Not only do you have to manage your suit energy and de-cloak a opportune times, but also doing any kind of offensive action (like shooting) while cloaked drains all your suit energy. This means to pull off stealth kills, you have to de-cloak -> shoot -> cloak in rapid succession.

The hardest difficulty, delta, forces disabled crosshair, does something with binoculars (I do not know what exactly as I have not tested/looking into it), and makes enemies speak Korean instead of English. Why these options are limited to difficulty is an odd choice. I noticed that no crosshairs makes gameplay a lot more immersive. Would be interesting to see more games of the modern era come out with options to limit visibility of HUD elements (like Dark Souls/Elden Ring hiding the UI when out of combat) to improve the immersion.

[h1]DIFFICULTY[/h1]
The difficulty scaling is a nice balance, at the highest difficulty it's hard enough that you cannot go-in guns blazing with no effort, but also not frustratingly unbalanced. It might be a little on the easier side, but I'd say it's practically balanced by having both you and the enemy be glass cannons, you both can deal a lot of damage, but also receive that same amount of damage. You can also pick up enemies (which, note, kills them instantly once you throw them), which is a load of fun and has a nice risk/reward to it when out of stealth engagements. There is a specific enemy in the later game that can be a little more tough, and being able to pick them up screams ""nanosuit soldier"" and it's really cool.

AI can be a little dumb and unfair at times (note: AI have some very good eyes, i.e. being in their line of sight is enough to get instantly spotted, despite there being a reasonable amount of foliage in front of you), but they are rather unique. AI will attempt to shoot in the general location you were upon cloaking, which is a nice feature. Tanks can also instantly spot you if you get too close even while cloaked, which doesn't make much sense, but it doesn't matter much because it's practically a non-issue with how the game plays out

[h1]REMARKS[/h1]
Something really nice about this game is dynamic crouch/sprint context. You can tap crouch/sprint to make it act like tap crouch/sprint; you can also hold crouch/sprint to make it act like hold crouch/sprint, where you will stop crouching/sprinting after releasing the key. This is a very nice feature that would be really cool to see in modern games.

Although my system is rather weak (1650 mobile) and the game ran a ""smooth"" 20-30 FPS on all low settings like a Captain Underpants fight sequence, it still looked amazing. This game is [i]very[/i] graphically intensive, making my GPU work absolute overtime and a half at a constant 100% usage. It does not, however, make much use of the CPU, as only about 20-40% was reported to be used by the entire system throughout while playing.

[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]

I don't really like how squishy I am, like I don't like the fact you have to hit a button constantly to enter armor mode. I guess I'm just used to armor being a passive thing and not an active ability. 
Also the enemies seem WAY too hyper tuned to my location
maybe that's just a remastered thing but like on normal they can like even see through your cloak and like what's the point at that point
Switching to easy was like way better but still, it was dumb how hyper tuned they were to me. 
 I also forgot to mention is that they use autosave checkpoints, which I was aware of when I read the reviews. Which I didn't have a problem with, however I thought it would like auto save at random times.... NOPE it won't fucking auto save unless you're at a certain location and if you get to an objective a different way and die you get yeeted back far as fuck away from the objective
And you have to go allllllll the way back to where you were
and if you're in a gun fight when you reach an auto save checkpoint it will remember that so if you die and go back to the checkpoint you're still in a gunfight and have to do it all over again
And again I'd be fine with this except they make you traverse such large mountainous areas and the checkpoints are always in BFE from the objective.
Towards the end of the game though, it seems like they put way more checkpoints than at the beginning, so that's a positive I guess. 
Oh yeah and the game also crashed towards the end, and a couple times the enemies killed me RIGHT before a checkpoint so that means that I had to redo the thing all over again lol. 

I'm gonna leave a positive review because at the end of the day, I really did enjoy playing it but it gave me so much stress at times that I needed to walk away from it for a week for me to be able to finish it.

The biggest problem isn't with the remaster but with the game itself. It's a lot of fun, right up until about the final third of the game. It's been said before, but it's absolutely true. Once the aliens arrive, the fun just drops out of the game. Fighting human enemies in the nanosuit is amazing, but these enemies from the zero gravity level onwards are tedious and annoying and that continues for the rest of the game. Just endless fire from above from floating enemies, but they also often hove directly above you and the game doesn't actually let you aim directly up for some stupid reason, so there are levels where they will occasionally shoot you from a position you cannot fire back from. It doesn't seem intentional, but it happened enough to make it annoying.

The ray-tracing, the better foliage, the slightly better rocks? Personally, I knew I got my money's worth when I saw the highest graphics settings name: ""CAN IT RUN CRYSIS?"".

I find that what was complained about isn't really there.  The graphics are quite good and will be better with the best video cards, with a very smooth frame rate on a 3070 class video card at 2K with high settings.  This is way better than when the game first came out.  The game play is remarkably good for such an old game and even though I finished the game years ago, I still am enjoying it more than the first time around.  I would say the AI is actually quite good and the gun play after getting used to the more smooth recoil is a blast.

The Pros:
*  Smooth graphics, very high quality with a reasonable card.  This will only get better upwards of 4k with high settings, if not max.
*  The game plays better overall now that there is no ""lag"" anywhere.
*  The AI is actually pretty decent.
*  The sound is quite good, including the hit indicators on enemies.

The Cons:
*  Still requires a very hot graphics card to turn EVERYTHING on.  DLSS is very good on this game build.

* Has a field of view slider but it can only go up to a max of 80

Cons:
* The multiplayer gamemode was not included in Crysis Remastered when it was available in the original game
* I have a 5950x and a RTX 4090 yet my game sometimes will drop below 60 FPS at 4k with all settings, included ray tracing, maxed out
* The AI is dumb to where it can bug out
* Game pauses and mutes itself when it's alt-tabbed

Other thoughts:
* The game does start off pretty slow
* A recent patch restored back the campaign level called ""Ascension"" along with a few control options
* Not much replayability due to the lack of multiplayer and mods compared to the original game
* I enjoyed the lore since I find an alien invasion to be fascinating
* I recommend in trying it out when it's on sale; otherwise don't bother. It feels like a game that you pick up to complete the campaign once and that's it.

People often think of Crysis as a shallow tech demo game versus an actual fully formed open world romp. You are on an island, you get objectives, now go explore and find ways to complete those objectives. Its a semi-linear branching path where you can do all sorts of mayhem in the destructible game world. Its a simple plot, nothing too deep here, but enjoyable all the same.

Its a short romp, only about 6-7 hours, probably about 15 if you wanna replay on the Delta difficulty and go for all the achievements. But it doesnt really overstay its welcome. 

The remaster of the game has some simplified control options (and the ability to go back to classic) but it can feel a bit clunky at times, especially picking up ammo and weapons can feel very..well.. frustrating at times, not helped by them sometimes clipping through terrain. 

The big highlight on the remaster is the RT reflections, which are really cool and add a lot to the game, in fact the RT and SVOGI implementation makes the game look absolutely stunning if you have the hardware to run it, but it is an older game and there are limits to it compared to more modern titles

Would I recommend it? Yes I think I would to anyone just getting into PC gaming, Its a classic and a game that crushed PC hardware 15 years ago and with RT, manages to strain it today. Just remember its a 15 year old game and it has its quirks.",1673331616,1673331616,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Crysis is a unique FPS single player game with a very driving story. In this prequel you learn very few what is this exoskeleton, what's happening with the Aliens and who is Prophet. It's like the first season of a great series in this manner.

This first game is pretty long for its age, many arsenals to use in combat and there's always BLAST or SNEAK option, thanks to your exo armor.

The Remaster:
- This is an interesting remaster since it's not built on the original engine of the PC version of Crysis, resulting in some gameplay differences, notably AI not behaving quite the same. It's not a big deal if you've never played the game before since the general gameplay features are still there, but if you've played the original on PC the experience is a bit different. There is also a revised set of Nanosuit controls, which I think is designed to function more like Crysis 2 and 3, but I never actually tested them and instead used the classic Nanosuit controls that behave like the original Crysis.
- Performance wise things aren't too bad if you change a few settings to avoid CPU problems: if you put objects to high, vegetation and shadows to medium / high, you get a level of detail and draw distance that's similar or better than the original game for increased performance, and most other settings (apart from ray tracing) can be turned up to maximum without much impact. Another advantage of the remaster is that it works out of the box on Windows 10, whereas the original game requires user fixes to launch at all.
- In terms of graphics, it's a bit of a mixed bag. The updated assets generally look quite nice, but compared to the original the colour tone is a bit over-saturated during the day, yet the dawn and dusk sequences have less atmosphere. There are ray traced reflections too which are nice to have if you've got the hardware, though the number of reflective surfaces is a bit limited in many areas.
- Unfortunately there are a few annoying problems with the remaster. I had to use console commands to set additional min and max sensitivity values, as the menu slider didn't give me a low enough value, but then the tank had a ridiculously low sensitivity so I had to change them during gameplay too. There are also some audio problems, such as shooting an enemy from long distance and his shouts from being hit are like he's right in front of your face, and there are other similar imbalances which don't help with positional audio and dialogue during gameplay either.

Conclusion:
- Overall it's not a terrible remaster, but I feel like the lack of polish and some of the visual changes hamper it a bit, and given how iconic the original was for PC gaming at the time, I recommend playing the original first if you can just for the classic experience. That said, the remaster is worth a play if you get it as part of the Crysis Remastered Trilogy bundle, and if you've never played the original the remaster will still give you the general gameplay feel so you're not missing out, without any fixes required to get it running either.

The Game:
- The first half of the game features sandbox levels where you fight the Korean army using your Nanosuit features for temporary increases in speed, strength, or a cloak for near invisibility. You can interact with just about anything; picking up objects and throwing them, shooting down small trees, destroying buildings, and driving around in vehicles. You can acquire shotguns, assault rifles, a sniper rifle and more, picking up attachments along the way such as lasers, scopes and grenade launchers. This gives a good variety of options for traversing the tropical island and completing objectives - you can go in guns blazing or sneak around with the cloak etc.
- The second half of the game is where most people's complaints come from. It becomes increasingly linear, and you start fighting aliens instead with a reduced amount of combat options. I personally don't mind it that much, but the first half of the game is definitely where things shines and why (in combination with the visuals) it was so iconic back in the day.",1672847061,1672852233,True,26,0,0.725197911262512207,0,True,False,False

But the biggest problems are how this remaster completely ruins everything Crysis stood for. Go look at the official trailers and footage of Crysis, and you'll see how modding was one of its main features. This remaster is unmoddable, you can't even alter nanosuit parameters as the console commands don't do anything. This, combined with the slightly worse balance of the nanosuit, makes strength mode practically useless. Using strength mode to throw objects at enemies, or punch objects into enemies, was one of the most fun ways to kill people, and it's no longer valid here.

The movement is also dumbed down, inherited from Crysis 3 so you are pretty much immobile in the air now. Crysis and Crysis Warhead had many advanced nanosuit movements, especially in the air, which added a new dimension to its gameplay and increased the skill curve. Though this was mostly relevant to multiplayer rather than single player, which brings me to my next point.

The biggest mistake this remaster makes is not remastering the multiplayer, which was another major feature of Crysis (as much as single player was). Crysis and Crysis Wars were some of the best PvP shooters of all time, featuring one of the best ever and most strategic combined arms game modes called Power Struggle, having a bigger skill curve than most (more than Quake and UT, arguably more than CS), having tons of content, and again being super moddable. 

Even though the original Crysis is broken on Windows 10 and 11, it's the better version to play. I recommend playing it with Tactical Expansion mod.

Game is great, Crysis has always had some of the most interactive game play out of anything I've ever played. Cloaking System is fun, Max Armor makes Survivability on many missions much easier.

The game has some minor issues regarding graphics, only problem I ran into was the Laser pointer glitching and making a massive red glare on my screen pointing in different directions.

I never had the pleasure of playing the original, but I'd have to say, the original will probably always hold up better than the remaster, nostalgia will always make it seem better than it actually was. 

One thing some people fail to realize is that most companies when they remaster games only ""improve"" upon the graphics, they don't offer any extra content for players to experience, only enhancing it by making it more immersive with a more realistic feel, they tried to keep the game in a retro style by adding RayTracking and ""Can it Run Crysis"" but keeping the old models with slightly better graphics, giving it a Halo Master Chief Collection feel (Halo CE updated graphics mode). 

Overall I'd have to say that if you want to experience this game, you should play the original, unfortunately they removed the ability to purchase the original from the steam store quite some time ago. 

Missions were fun and weren't too difficult playing on Normal Mode, I was able to beat it within 12 hours (3 of the 15.7 hours played was me falling asleep on the couch lol). Once you reach the core of the Mountain tho things start to fall apart, games becomes much more over tuned and the feel starts to diminish, game was much more fun when fighting the Koreans and not the Aliens. Beating the game doesn't feel very rewarding as the final mission is buggy and you tend to get frozen very often when fighting the final boss, the mechanics are over tuned as if its a newly released World of Warcraft raid that no one is able to get past 90% health. My Tip to beating the final boss with little to no frustration is by hiding next to the Forklift on the right side of the Carrier ship and cloaking right before the Mother Ship tries to 1 shot you, it prevents the cruisers from attacking you and allows you to pop out of cloak for a split second to nuke the wings and then the core, you have to sit IDLE for a good 3 mins before the fight will end, otherwise it'll freeze you over and over again killing you because you can't play. (Getting Frozen also prevents you from using Max Armor, meaning you just get chain frozen and die due to the beam and cruisers)

Final Words would have to be: If you want to play it, do it, but i recommend buying it with the Trilogy so you can get access to the other 2 games, its not worth buying it on its own, especially with the sales (I purchases it during the 2022 Winter Sale)

i found no fun in this challenge whatsoever. i didn't laugh nor cry with happiness, i just cringed every time i stepped 10 metres towards a guy only to be killed asap. 2/10 for me. ill just watch youtube walkthroughs with just cutscenes for the story as that's really the only thing that will give me hope to liking this universe.

crysis 1 unremastered : 7.5/10 ! (2022 play)

crysis 1 is not available on steam store anymore, you can only buy crysis 1 remastered now !
i bought crysis 1 on steam a few years ago but i didn't play it since i already played it when the game came out.
and now that i the remastered is out and i have both games, i said what the hell, this is not a long game so let's play both versions back to back, here is the result :
the game does not have much story but it was not supposed to either, the game is not as good as it used to be since now we have games that you can ride dragons, summon undead and many different things...
so having a suit like this is not as good as it used to be, but the game still plays well and is fun to play.
for example i played max payne 1 recently and it is neither fun nor entertaining if you play it now, it is just good for playing it to get the story, but playing crysis 1 is fun even now, not as much as it used to be obviously !
now to crysis remastered : there is only 2 differences between the games :
A : higher graphics ( which also effects gameplay by being able to aim better and headshot better )
B : the remastered has a new keyboard layout which sounds like a small change but it really effects the gameplay and you don't have to switch your suit power in a menu, and things get activated automatically, for example you don't have to put your suit into spirint mode ! whenever you press shift you change into spirint mode and this effects the gameplay very much to the point that it took me 7.4 hours to finish crysis 1 but only 5.6 hours to finish the remastered. the remastered is worth 20$ full price not 30 $ !
P.S : crysis 1 original is avilable on steam only in a bundle with warhead now !

Pros:
- Plays almost identically to the original.  A successful port of the maps and combat.
- New Ray-Tracing looks stunning and adds much more realism and depth to the environment.  
- I didn't have a crash throughout my entire playthrough.  The original never ran stably for me; on 5 different systems....

Cons:
- Many cutscenes have been worsened by goofy lighting, animation glitches, and the occasional audio glitch (late music, missing lipsyncing for 1 line of dialogue etc)
- QuickSaving requires a MOD.  I realize the other Crysis games were Auto-Save only, but the more linear gameplay allows for that.  Experimenting with the AI, physics, and combat mechanics were part of what made the original Crysis so replayable and it's an essential part of the experience!
- The game has been 'reshaded' with too much saturation for my taste.  The game feels much more 'cheerful' than the original.  The aliens are less scary as a result, too.

Gameplay
- ""animations"" are terrible
- lacks of modern QoL features
- It doesn't feel fluid, no matter if you want to aim downsights or while you have speed activated, you get stuck nearly everywhere
- gunplay is terrible

Graphics
- Back in it's day, sure it was one of the best looking games. It got it's upgrades in terms of lightning, shadows and textures... but it's nothing special for today. 

Difficulty
- even on the highest difficulty it's kind of easy, probably due to the very stupid AI
- I have to mention it: have fun with the hover-fly-thingy mission... these ""controls"" with either a mouse or a controller are one of the worst I've seen in a video game

Story
yeah, the story... it's starts kind of interesting, but it's basically 90% ""sh*t, run away, we gotta get out of here"" and suddenly the ending is like ""oh, we defeated the grand MOFO, we need to GO BACK AND FIGHT THEM"" SERIOUSLY?

Technical issues
The game still has the same single thread issue like the original back in 2007 aaand the developers are proud that modern CPUs like an i9-12900k or GPUs like the RTX3090 can't run it properly on ""can it run Crysis?"" settings... I mean, this game is heavily CPU bottlenecked - so optimize your code and we'll talk about that again.

I remember buying a new graphic card twice plus a fresh set of RAM to max out all the details and it looked incredible - still with 30frames max but as long it looked great who cared :) 
The remaster had a rough start at release, right now in its current state it plays nice, but there are still some bugs around. Some of them you may know from the original game, most of them are new, at least for myself. Especially at the end of the game they where quite some of them around, but nothing game breaking. Sometimes the frames dropped for a few seconds for whatever reason, sometimes there's no muzzle flash, invisible walls or rubber banding. Also I had a weird facial animation bug one time. When having the ""reduced movement"" bug just change weapons and you're good. 

In its core its still Crysis of course, it will always be one of my fav games, but besides the updated graphics (raytracing looks great) I'd still prefer the original, maybe with some mods. Textures where updated and looked nice in 4K, but they forgot soem spot here and there.

Achievment wise its very easy, got all of them in one run under 10 hours. Delta difficulty is pretty easy, thanks to your suit. I recommend to start ""Marathon man"" early on so you dont have to power-sprint around at the end of the game to pop the achievment. Also look out for the yellow markers for side objectives, but they are very easy to spot, plus the game tells you every time.

Final verdict: If you loved the first one its cool to come back after all these years, if you got the hardware. In 4K it still takes a lot of ressources. There are bugs, but nothing game breaking. Plus, should you be a  completionist like me, its a very easy 100% game when it comes to achievments.

What I CAN tell you for those in a similar position, is that Crysis is a short, straight forward FPS title that doesn't do anything particularly new...at the time? possibly groundbreaking...but today it serves as a standard affair.

The shooting feels competent and the small selection of weapons aren't anything too exciting, mostly rifles but they get the job done. I did like the ability to change weapon mods on the fly, though it wasn't a game changer and they were extremely limited, no mods were unique to any particular weapon and they included a silencer, 3 types of scope, some underbarrel attachments i never bothered to use, laserpointer, flash light...basically nothing that actually modified the performance of the weapons themselves, just added an extra feature to them. You'd think the silencer would, in typical FPS fashion, cause the guns to lose firepower, or the laserpointer to increase accuracy. They don't.

The nano-suit definitely seems like an idea in its infancy at this point in the series as there's nothing about it that makes me go WOWOWOWOWOW!? I can only imagine they make it better in the later titles of which i'll find out sooner or later as I intend to play those too. Its fairly simple in function, you can go invisible, harden the suits armour, run fast and jump high, but you can't do any of those at the same time as one another. All those functions consume energy at a high rate and the recharge is slow as shit, so you have to use it wisely. I was wondering early on if id get to upgrade my suit somehow to reduce consumption but after a while I gave up on that idea when i realised it wasn't gonna happen. The game essentially was a case of playing the first half using stealth and the second half using armour when you realise that using stealth is kinda...pointless. I seemed to get spotted regardless and even if I was crouched or prone, some random soldier would see me even when he was facing the other direction. I ended up quickly transitioning in and out of stealth to do quick headshots as shooting while in stealth causes the suit to automatically bust you out of stealth and drain all the energy,. So I eventually just relied on armour instead.

There are several maps you transition between over the course of the games campaign, starting out fairly open world-ish and eventually boil down to very linear paths as the story comes to a head and all taking place on this one island. Honestly, fairly bland map design, nothing really stood out, it was just a lot of shanty shacks and fields of which most you wouldn't ever see due to the immense amount of hand holding between each objective and no actual incentive to explore.

By no means a terrible game and I can see how it can carve a path for its future sequels, just nothing memorable either!",1670411097,1670411097,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

But I have to give credit where credit is due. This remaster runs much better than the original on Windows 10 (I have no idea how it runs on Win 11 *cough* *cough* <random mention of modern warfare 2 technical problems caused by win 11 insert here>)

The raytracing They added is nice but it's not mind blowing, yeah the game looks better than the original but it's not a lot better considering the original looked fine even for today standards.

Other than what I mentioned before, the game is just a copy paste from the original with maybe just a slight adjustment on the texture resolution which is not really noticeable.

Overall I think this is worth it from a stand point You've never played Crysis before and are new to the series, then yeah get this remaster to not fuck around with the settings to make the original work and welcome to Lingshan. 

BUT if You're a returning fan or You have the original copy of this game I suggest You play the original rather than the remaster, You'll save yourself some money, though You'll have to make the game work properly (probably).

Also, this remaster doesn't come with neither the ""Crysis Warhead"" I guess You could call that a DLC but it was a whole standalone game where You play as Psycho and get to know what the fuck He was doing, nor the multiplayer function that is in the original (it's dead since gamespy died but I vaguely remember playing mp through Tunngle and the multiplayer is great considering it's basically Battlefield but in Crysis).

I played the 2nd and 3rd Crysis before playing this one and i'll admit, its terrible in comparison, but that's just because of the shear difference in content, on it's own it isn't bad. There's no replay-ability to the game besides higher difficulties so it is just pure campaign/story and i would say for the time it came out it's not bad, they could've done more with it for the remaster but it's not the end of the world, for the game you get it's pretty fun. I managed to 100% it in just under 12Hrs of gameplay so it isn't a lengthy game with content worthy of £25, but when i played it i had fun.

I think it was good to understand where Crysis 2 & 3 originate from just for the context of the main enemies and how they tie into it, but you're not really missing much, most of what is essential you could learn from Crysis 2. The visuals aren't bad but it isn't groundbreaking, it's a decent remaster from the comparisons i've seen and it makes the enviornment come to life a lot more, but by 2021 when this came out it isn't what i would've expected. 

Gameplay was fun, once you understand what your abilities are and what guns you have, that's pretty much it for the rest of the game, but it isn't bad if you just like the whole one-man army super suit type of gameplay, i had a lot of fun sneaking around especially in this game since in the other games i felt like they did stealth a bit dirty at times, in this game the enviornment is you're BEST option and the foliage and growth make stealth so much more tactical and fun, i never once felt like i got caught by something/someone who should in no way shape or form, have seen me. the game gets pretty rock solid near the end and the final boss section is a pain in the ass but apart from that it isn't bad, i would recommend this to someone who loves simple action games who doesn't mind it being short.

I think overall this game is a 5.5/10, if it had more substance it would score higher, but if you like action games and it goes on discount anywhere around £10, this is a nice little title to add to the library",1670273233,1670273233,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Is getting the remaster worth it? Nah. I only got it because it was at a deep loyalty discount for owning the original, but other than that it is really not worth getting. The original didn't even need a remaster in my opinion, even though it did release in 2007. But that's what made it so special, because it was so advanced for its time.
The remaster is different, but not necessarily in a good way: Some graphics improvements are better, some are not. Some audio changes are good, some are not. The physics seem worse than the original and I also encountered a few game breaking bugs, like rushing a scripted scene and an enemy spawning inside a rock, so I had to restart the mission in both of those cases.

That famous catchphrase known in PC gaming! For this Remastered Edition though, your PC will undoubtedly run Crysis since it is a pretty average XBOX 360 PORT, sadly. There are some good parts from this PORT and naturally, bad parts too.

So for this CRYSIS REMASTERED Edition, I'll be comparing the original Crysis played back then in 2007 at release and lately, versus the Remastered version that released back in 2021, played at the time of this review.

So, at release back in 2007, I would say I was disappointed with Crysis Original Edition. Very unoptimized and released too soon for its time. About the same as Crytek's first game, Far Cry, that was pretty demanding back in 2004. Crysis OG struggled to run at medium settings. So technically speaking, the game had a harsh launch but wow oh wow, the game was the BEST LOOKING THING EVER... even when playing in a ""slideshow mode"". Aside from the specs, the gameplay was pretty great which was what made Crysis known with the freedom of approach to the missions. The controls in the original version are very akin to PC gaming. You have the peaking functions where the Remastered Edition removed them (apparently, they got brought back with a patch but I never bothered to use them in the RE). The crosshair in the original is again, very PC-like where the Remastered is the same reticule as the XBOX360. For the powers, you have a wheel and choose on the fly the power you want. On the Remastered, the controls are very like Crysis 2 and Crysis 3, where the controls are more fluid than using that powers wheel. Talking about your nanosuit powers, you do run longer with the speed power in the Remastered edition.

Visually, it shows a lot about the low textures and graphical fidelity on the Remastered edition. The graphics are very downgraded compared to the original Crysis. You can compare them yourself by either playing the game on EA Desktop or GOG... or by watching this YouTube video that compares it all: [url=https://youtu.be/QeWr2-l_CrA] Crysis Remastered Trilogy vs Original [/url]


[h1]POSITIVES:[/h1]
[b]+Nanosuit makes you feel truly powerful
+Even downgraded, the visuals do have its time to shine... except the characters faces
+Cat & mouse play with enemies
+Suit Powers (having different powers for different kind of approaches. The suit powers sounds are more focused in this Remastered which I liked very much! The armour power is more resistant and the speed power can be used longer compared to OG).
+Streamlined controls (using the nanosuit powers is more fluid than the OG version).
+Perfect UltraWide monitor support.
+Razer Synapse integration (makes some good lighting effects! Crysis OG doesn't have Razer integration)
++EA DESKTOP/ORIGIN NOT NEEDED TO PLAY THIS GAME![/b]


[h1]NEGATIVES:[/h1]
[b]-Epic FAIL Game Store exclusivity for launch, just like the previous all Crysis Remastered versions.
-Poor port from the XBOX 360. 
-Graphical downgrade. It is quite noticeable from the characters especially but the gameworld has many poor visuals too, sadly.
-Poor enemy A.I. getting stuck in trees and the like.
-XBOX 360 crosshair in Remastered Edition. Aiming has issues and is not as precise as the OG.
-Some muffled audio sounds in this Remastered Edition. You don't have this issue on the OG.
-No multiplayer modes for the Remastered version.[/b]


[h1]RECOMMENDATION:[/h1]
[b]The graphical downgrade cannot be ignored. It is to wonder why was this game Remastered from the XBOX 360 port? Why didn't they used the PC version and improved upon it? If you get past the visuals, the game is still pretty great. The gameplay/controls is more fluid in my opinion than the original version. If you can't get past the poor visuals, I strongly recommend you get the game on either EA Desktop app or GOG.

I recommend you get this game in great discount or better, get the Trilogy so you can play the better optimized sequels![/b]",1669525812,1670062934,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,2,True,False,False

However, due to being made from the PS3/Xbox360 console port instead of the original PC release, the Remastered version has a few shortcomings and missing features but it is not enough to hamper the gameplay experience. 

What does hamper the gameplay experience however was the plethora of new bugs and glitches found in this version that did not exist in the original 2007 release nor the console ports. Although these can be fixed the [b]Crysis Remastered Improvement Project[/b] mod by [b]CallistoNTG[/b], it is disappointing that the game has stopped receiving official updates.

What's more disappointing however is the lack of the multiplayer and full scale mod support that the original got, which offer players a tonnes of replayability and variety of user made content and modes both online and singleplayer. Resulting in an overall short experience that can be completed in under 10 hours without much replayability. I've 100% the game and got all achievements within 9 hours.

Overall, Crysis Remastered looks impressive and play as well as the original, bar the new bugs and glitches. It's a game I can wholeheartedly recommend and well worth experiencing again even if you've played the original.

- Missing sound or just bad sound design.

- Buggy player & NPC model(rarely).
- Often missing stats UI.
- Stuck at final boss, so many bugs in here, probably the most annoying mission with these bugs existing ( boss not showing, tac cannon not working, and perma freeze like there's no tomorrow).

Of all 4 titles in the franchise (so far), it remains the biggest and most ambitious but also most dependent on players dictating their own fun. The levels are gigantic, ways to tackle the problems and accomplish goals are numerous and it’s very easy to try to stick to a gameplay approach that doesn’t work that well with the game. After all, these Crysis isn’t really an immersive sim, even if it’s very close conceptually to a somewhat streamlined resemblance of one, so if you don’t play it as an FPS and try to focus more on stealth or something else, it quickly gets boring or frustrating. But if you do play it as an FPS, enhanced by the nanosuit ability to stealth, run super fast, punch wooden houses apart and have additional protection, if you just use the binoculars to tag enemies and plan your approach but then dynamically adjust to the situation that unfolds, instead of just stealthing or just running, it can get really fun.

Especially since the Remastered version includes the suit modes and controls from the second and third games. I know it’s blasphemous for superfans of the original, but I genuinely think that the simplified suit controls mode is a more fun experience that makes the nanosuit feel far more powerful than it usually is due to the later titles’ armor mode. It doesn’t quite gel with the way the original game worked, of course, since you can’t speed+reload and your sprint is always way too fast (and drains energy), also the strength jumping is very iffy. But going through the game with quick one-button switching feels far more fluid. While the rest of the game is still quite entertaining. Even if I personally preferred the slightly more directed experience of Warhead, that sadly isn’t included in the remaster and seemingly never will be remastered due to the loss of the game source code.

Remaster isn’t without its own flaws either, as it was based on the slightly cut down version of the game made for the consoles after Crysis 2 release, not the 2007 PC original. Numerous updates since release returned some of the details that got lost in this transition, including one whole level of the game that was originally cut, but a lot of smaller and more noticeable details are still gone. Not that the game looks bad – it looks amazing and improves on most things of the original title, while also running far better on modern hardware. But it’s just not a clear win of a remaster. If you haven’t played the original, I’d recommend going for Remastered if you’re in any way interested.

The second half is linear shooting sections against the same 2 alien types over and over again. Exposition is dumped on you in the last level and then the game abruptly ends. 

Impressive for 2007, Crysis 1's visuals cannot carry it's lackluster shooting. Voice acting is laughably bad, especially from it's side characters. Weapons spurt out flat, tinny noises vaguely resembling a gunshot; throwing objects through certain walls results in a mess of visual bugs and broken physics. The suit noises are still delightful though. How I do enjoy hearing ""maximum""...well anything really over and over again. 

As for the remaster fixing performance issues - the addition of DLSS has the game running way better than before. Which is a massive benefit due to how the original Crysis is held together with duck tape and glue. Optimizations have been made across the board, which don't so much fix the longstanding CPU issue, but rather circumvent it. With modern hardware you'll be seeing Crysis 1 for the first time at 144fps+ which is worth any sort of other visual downgrades to the color pallet. It does however, still run noticeably worse than Crysis 2 & 3; despite those games visuals still holding up to modern titles.",1669634773,1669902023,False,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

1. Game play (3/5): Its average, Running and shooting seems fine. Power jumps feels weird, cannot influence the movement once you are in the air. Vehicles and Air plane (VTOL) were fun.
2. Story (4/5): Story was short, took about 8 hours to finish on Hard diff. Well though out story considering it was meant to be the first of the 3 instalments. Also paints a good picture of whats to come in the next games.
3. Enemies (2/5): AI is so bad in this game. They give you suit that can go invisible but the moment you shoot someone, everyone gets alerted. No point playing stealth. Plus they cant figure out where the bullets are coming from, so if you are shooting far enough from them, they act so dumb and search stupidly.
4. Music (?/5): Honestly I dont remember whether there was any music or not. So even there was, it means that is was unnoticeable.
5. Graphics (3/5): Even tho its a graphical remastered, it feels a little aged. I played on ultra with mid level ray-tracing. Sometimes NPC faces were like they melted down or something. Overall it was OK.
6. SHOULD YOU? Absolutely, it's Crysis, get this one and the other 2 to complete the rerun of the series.

1) Brincisi oyunun pc optimizasyonu çok kötü Rtx 3050 ekran kartı i7 11. nesil işlemci ile orta ayarlarda ciddi bir fps drop sorunu yaşadım(Oyunu orta grafiklere alıp dlss performans modunda idare eder oyun deneyimi yaşadım). Fps nin nipeten iyi göründüğü yerlerde bile akıcı bir oyun deneyimi sunmuyor yer yer fps droplar olabiliyor.
2) Oyunun Kayıt noktası dediğimiz bir save sistemi var ve bu noktaya gelene kadar oyunu kayıt edebilmemiz mümkün değil. Örnek vermek gerekirse siz bir bölgede düşmana karşı uzun süre taktiksel bir mücadele veriyorsunuz birden bir yerde öldünüz sizi o kadar geriye atıyor ki sanki rogue like oyun oynuyorsunuz. Artık bu durumdan sıkılınca bölgeyi hızlı koşu ile geçtim ve kayıt noktasına ulaştım tabiki bir sürü düşman vurma keyfinden ve stratejik ilerlemeden mahrum kalarak. Oyun sizin ne kadar keyif aldığınuzla ilgilenmiyor onlar için önemli olan kayıt noktasına bir şekilde ulaşman görevi tamamlaman.
3) Oyunun normal zorluk ayarının göreceli olarak zor olduğunu söylebilirim diğer fps oyunlarında alışılmış olan zorluğun dışında bir zorluk hissettim.
4) Oyunun yapay zekasında gerçekten aşırı tuhaflık görünmez olarak(pelerin modu) bile bir yere saklansak bir şekilde düşman her yerden bizi görüyor. Çok uzaktan bile olsa görüyor. Düşmanın insan üstü bir görüş yeteneği var. Bu düşmanların her ne hikmetse insan üstü bir kurşundan kaçınma yeteneği de var.  Özetle düşman unsurların bir dengesi yok oyun keyfini baltalıyor sadece.
Özetle: Oyunda grafikleri kötü olsun, seslendirme kötü olsun hepsi bir şekilde oynanış akıcı ve stabil oldu mu katlanılır, ancak üzülerek söylüyorum ki bu oyun olmamış. Oyunun amacı bizlerin eğlenmesi değil bir yerden bir yere kayıt noktasına ölmeden ulaşmamız ve bunu fps dropları yiyerek deneyimlememiz...

Oyunun güzel gördüğüm kısımları:

Hikayenin sıra dışı bir yönünün bulunması
Türkçe seslendirme ve altyazı olması

This is my first ever experience on Crysis. From what I have read in the reviews for the game... I don't see anyone with some of the issues that I am about to state. Ok, here we go below:

[h1][b] My issues [/b][/h1]
⚫The story feels as if I am being rushed to the end conclusion of the game. Starting out from parachuting down to the island, to having to fight ""ALIENS"" in less than an hour... 
⚫The maps, which there are a few of them, are Linear focused based maps that are way to bigger than they need to be. There's roughly 8 (I don't know exactly) and they offer no replay value or exploration - I will get to these 2 in a minute. They could have better optimised the game by locking up some of these area's and freeing up some assets.
⚫Now... the exploration in the game is a joke. There is no point in exploring the map at all. There is no collectables, hidden items or anything else you may want to find. I feel let down by this one.
⚫Also... the replay value of this game is also non-existent. I completed the game on DELTA difficulty in under 6 hours. 5.2 hours to be exact. I got 100% of my achievements in one play-through of the game meaning that I don't need to go back to it at all unless I want to play the game again.
⚫The characters and dialogue feel like it has been very badly developed and written. Some of the lines they say in this are just downright cringe. There is a scene in the game where you have to save the scientist woman and she is on the elevator, right. After you join her she jumps to a rope and the elevator starts to fall not even 50ft down and your character almost pass's out but yet at the start of the game you fell from Aeroplane height.... and hit the water with your suit but you came out in PERFECT condition. This feels like the story started with a different writer and then was handed down to a less developed writer.
⚫This last one many might not care about - The game costs £25. It offers No replay-ability. So its a one time deal if you collect all your achievements in one go. No way is this game worth £25 alone. I'm sorry but no.

[h1][b] The Pros [/b][/h1]
⚫I have heard alot of players say that the optimisation on this game is trash... Not once did I personally experience freezing, FPS drops, crashing or anything else.
⚫Its a NEW game for me so I kinda had fun playing it a little.
⚫Its a Remastered version of an ""apparently"" good game so if you liked the old ones... there you go I suppose.
⚫ The water mechanics in this game are SUPERB. Some of the best I have seen... like no joke.
⚫The bullet tracers are phenomenal as well. You can actually see where you bullets go and where they are coming from. Some games in 2022 cannot even do this right. YES THAT'S RIGHT Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, i'm calling you out.
⚫The game has some form of ""levolution destruction"" in it. If you do not know what that is, look at Battlefield 4 (mainly). You get to destroy buildings, trees and other small objects like they never existed in the first place.
EDIT: ""They have fixed most of the performance issues after Nov 17"" I read from someones review... so by the looks of it, it had REALLY bad issues before I got to it. 

[h1][b] All in All  [/b][/h1]
The game is good but with the price and next to no replay-ability on it at all... it is not worth the money in the slightest. I would avoid this until it is around £10 on sale or something like that. 4/10. Sorry but this is my honest to god review from a ""BLIND"" run.

Did it give me a nostalgia? Yes.
Do I like the game? Yes.
Would I recommend it full price? Never. 
This is a half-assed remaster so you should pay a half assed price for it. Get it on at least a 50% sale (or in the remastered trilogy bundle when on sale)
My main gripes with the game are: Who the f* playtests those games? I just can't believe how fast the mouse sensitivity is at the absolute minimum.(at 800dpi) I had to configure the slider myself via an autoexec file to make the mouse feel like it's not on crack.
After fixing the FOV and the sensitivity for the main game - the vehicle aiming is just absolutely unusable. It's WAYYYY too slow. Like I'd use my whole mousepad area for the damn camera in-game to barely move 10 degrees, and playing on DELTA difficulty, it was IMPOSSIBLE to kill those enemies in the sky with the anti-aircraft vehicle or whatever that thing is. I had to get out of it and use other guns to do what I was supposed to do in a vehicle. Like genuinely this makes me question if the devs responsible for the mouse controls even playtested this. Like, did they just make it somewhat work and decided ""eh, whatever that's good enough""???
How does the game just go from sonic aiming to turtle mode in vehicles? Can't it just strike a balance somewhere in the middle? Goddamnit.
Second: The performance is...good-ish? But I'd still expect better. On a 3080+Ryzen 9 5900x I was getting about 80-160 fps, perhaps with rare drops into the 70's, that's running max settings, apart from object detail, which was set to high. Running at 1440p with DLSS on quality. 
Graphics: Objectively it looks better in places, the draw distance is better, the lighting is better, the reflections are good. However the faces of characters look really bad here, I'm even going to say they were better in the original. The caves just look terrible here, the volumetric lights are gone. 
Gameplay: The game is easy once you understand what it wants from you, however it doesn't always make sense. It's not fair. Your AR bullets would rarely go where you aim because of bullet spread, so unless you have a gauss rifle or a precision rifle (aka sniper), then you're way better off sneaking up to enemies in cloak mode then killing them. Now this would be okay if only the enemies ALSO had this bullet spread, but no, they can mow me down like they're shooting a fully automatic sniper rifle with no recoil. Sometimes the game would glitch and your cloak wouldn't even work. Like I was cloaked behind cover far away from a tank, I walked all the way to the other side of a road and the second I see the tank I'm dead, WHILE CLOAKED. Other times I can't even see the enemies cause they're on the other side of the map, yet they can see me perfectly fine. This just fucking ruins the ""predator"" vibe you're supposed to have with that suit (at least on the delta difficulty), because the enemies just have the best eyesight in the world, you hide, cloak walk around them faaaaaar away, the second you uncloak (if you're not in the bushes) you're spotted. 
OH, and why the hell remove the ability to manually save? It's now a checkpoint based saving system. 
TL;DR
Okay-ish graphical improvements, performance is good but not amazing, gameplay is the same old crap with a few improvements but also a few drawbacks compared to the OG. AND WHAT THE F IS WRONG WITH THAT MOUSE SENSITIVITY??? 
If you wanna play it, go for it, buy it on sale, the game is GOOD, but don't expect a fully polished game.

Right mouse doesn't aim anymore so you're basically shooting all guns from the hip including sniper rifles which renders them practically unusable. The mouse scroll wheel and number keys no longer switch your weapons... you just have to run with the gun you have and once that's out of ammo it's useless until you find more ammo.

Overall graphics are adorable. Running on D3D11, which is confusing, but still uses Ray Tracing flawlessly. many textures have been remade, and some of them are just the upscaled old ones. The performance is still a bit weird but it can be solved by turning on DLSS. Particles and effects don't look perfect though, which is a weak point of the graphical part but I still don't blame them since it's just a Remaster (at least a better remaster than the other Cryses with lazy 480p cutscenes). And, insane reflections. On maximum graphics with RT Boost mode enabled, you can notice your own character's reflection on many surfaces, from a slight dark halo of your body shape on rough metal parts, to a full picture of yourself on every glassy surface (Well, to blame the other games on the industry, at least it doesn't use [i]cubemaps[/i] & SSR while their games allegedly has RT support). I think the ugliest part of the game is the character design. Almost every character's eyelids got noticeable problems, they're not textured professionally, and all of them are textured with the upscaled old textures with visible upscaling artifacts. They need to be remade, for sure.

The gameplay has slightly changed (as far as I know). It's still tough to figure out the mechanics and learn the behavior of the enemy and how to deal with it, But it's mostly enjoyable. Still got many parts that make you frustrated, but that's acceptable. 
It has some bugs, but not annoying at all. None of them will affect your gameplay.

+Decent story
+It's evading from repetitive

-Negatives-

-Sadly it is not well optimized, ray tracing is completely f*ucking up the fps
-Some features like selecting grenade is kinda broken, you cant throw your flashbang or smoke grenade by pressing throw button, you have to select them individually 
-Unnecessary cliche army stuff
-Some characters are annoying
-There are some minor bugs

This is an classic FPS game that you should not consider the minus sides. It is definitely worth to play, they updated game so well but you will still need an improvement patch. Check pcgamingwiki for that, it is called crysis remastered improvement project v.0.29 or something. Make sure to use that and play that cool game

Played both original and remastered. It is a fantastic game with a great story. The gameplay still feels wonderful, and the Nanosuit still holds up as one of the best features in the history of FPS titles. 

Crytek has really worked hard to enhance the graphical experience of the various games, especially on PCs where the Windows version can rely on a few features, such as ray-tracing, which give a real boost. The environments are drastically improved and despite the sometimes difficult optimization, the rendering is very good. As for the Crysis themselves, it is clear that a number of mechanisms are now aging: they remain good titles.

I noticed some missing textures, bad explosion textures, inconsistent particles and lightning, buggy AI (not reacting, moving on your position after a checkpoint even starting it cloaked and crouched, straight up seeing you even crouched/prone AND cloaked...).

Multiple moments are glitched, at first i heard a part of the game was removed, the Warhead expansion is not here even though the whole trilogy has been remastered now, the VTOL part is somehow worse than in the original...

It's evident that there is a huge lack of effort that went in this version.
It would have been better to fix a few bugs and rework the textures AND THEN PLAYTEST FOR F***'S SAKE !
Just concentrate on Crysis 4 and please, PLEASE don't serve it half baked. You had the capacity to make games that pushed boundaries at the time, so don't make it go out in a t*rd whistle.",1669604742,1669604742,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Aside from practically non-existent story and a game design that aged like fine milk it's got decent visuals, even by modern standards, good optimization and a handful of bugs.

Aside from that - the nanosuit feels useless, more like a gimmick. There's not enough tools nor room for stealth so invisibility is just not needed. The ""maximum armor"" is nice.. or would be, if a couple of hits on normal difficulty wouldn't drain the suit's power completely. Speed drains it even faster but is only useful feature anyways since vehicles are a joke. And ""strength"".. why is it there at all? I didn't find any use for it.

[i]This review is based ONLY on performance of the game on the STEAM DECK.[/i]


[h1]The Game Itself:[/h1]


A simple rescue mission goes haywire in the worst way possible in the remaster for the classic FPS game that defined the benchmark question: ""Can it Run Crysis?"". In Crysis Remastered, you are armed with your nanosuit and swap between super speed, strength, armor, and cloaking to tackle your enemies in a constantly changing environment. Using your suit and tools, you will need to tackle threats beyond this world and figure out just what the hell is going on.


[h1]Steam Deck Performance:[/h1]


Crysis Remastered has gotten mixed ratings due to a couple reasons. These include bugs, some graphical downgrades from the original, and it being a port from the console releases. Unfortunately, this is the only way to play the original Crysis unless you owned the original before it was delisted from Steam. The good news is, it plays quite well!

I started off at the medium settings and was pleasantly surprised how well it ran. For the most part, it could stick to 45 FPS without any caps, but the battery would drain a bit more than I would like during some high octane parts of gameplay like driving into an explosion, tons of enemies on screen shooting, and sprinting across the world. I decided for a recommended initial build to stick to 40 FPS with some settings lowered to ""low"" for stability purposes. I also lowered resolution to 1152x720 as this drastically helped during those intense moments.

Crysis Remastered also supports simultaneous KB+M and Gamepad inputs at the same time, which means enabling gyro controls through Steam Input will work well! I have found setting the gyro behavior to mouse feels a bit better, but setting to joystick works too.

For the full review, I will provide 2 other builds that will make improvements to battery and a higher framerate, but due to Crysis Remastered being a large game, I want to test more before making those recommendations. I didn't encounter any major bugs that were specifically due to the Steam Deck and overall I felt the game ran without a hitch. I did blow up many houses and tried to instigate a lot of physics movements, but it held strong. I have been pleasantly surprised so far how well it is running and feeling, especially coming from how hard it was to run the original.

The game looks essentially the same as it did 15 years ago, except when you turn on ray tracing, which you probably won't want to do if you feel like playing at a decent frame rate, especially since the game will constantly throw an error at you that hardware ray tracing is disabled because some driver is out of date, without telling you which driver; problem was not fixed even after updating all my drivers, though the game did inform me that the version of the phantom missing driver had changed =\

Most of the very short time I've spent with this game has been trying to figure out why a bare bones port of a now-ancient game runs so consistently poorly no matter which settings I apply, stopping multiple times between each checkpoint trying to adjust things to make the gameplay actually feel more like fluid combat and less like a slideshow.

If you like the feeling of exasperation, this game is right up your alley. If not, just go play the original Crysis 3. Despite being 10 years old, now, as well it both looks and plays better than this disaster. Refunding.",1669342010,1669342010,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is way worse than I thought it would be.

In the half-hour or so that I spent playing, I encountered numerous bugs and deficits that made the game too frustrating to play given that I can play the original any time without dealing with those issues.

A few examples:
[list]
[*]Trying to ""sprint"" while prone just makes your character stand up, rather than causing them to crawl faster like in the original game
[*]Playing with classic suit controls + suit shortcuts straight up doesn't work, the shortcut keybinds do nothing when pressed
[*]Changing the HUD color setting has almost no effect; it makes maybe 80% of the menu screen change to your chosen color, and has no effect on the in-game HUD
[*]The footstep sound when using armor mode (which will generally be the case) makes it sound like you're 3x heavier and made of stone, it sounds obnoxious and makes no sense, why is it a thing...
[*]At least in the very beginning of the game (the part I got to see before refunding), the visuals are either similar to or worse than the original. Character skin looks worse, clouds look worse, and the nanosuit vaporization effect in the second cutscene is almost entirely missing. Most other visual elements didn't look noticeably better than using a modded version of the original game.
[/list]
I know that in areas that are indirectly lit (interior spaces, shaded areas) the lighting is massively ahead of the original, and transparent and reflective surfaces must look better too. But I didn't get to see any of that before I quit, so I can't give my impression. All I know is it doesn't make up for the cost of buying the game, especially in light of all the bugs and other frustrating elements that dragged the game down considerably from the original.

If after watching the Digital Foundry videos on this game you're not bothered by the shortcomings they list, nor bothered by any of the ones I shared above, then sure, it might be worth getting if it's on sale for 50% off or more. But I personally wouldn't recommend spending any more than $5 unless they significantly improve the game via patches, which seems unlikely at this point.",1669255380,1669255380,False,10,0,0.588175952434539795,0,True,False,False

It's still worth playing, even if it's just to experience the entertaining nanosuit abilities and marvel at what was, and is, a very good-looking game.

The first few levels are these big open environments that give you freedom in how you approach their objectives. But this is only true in the most literal sense; you can approach the objectives from any direction, because you aren't boxed into a linear path. But that's where that freedom ends; there aren't any options in terms of how you actually complete the tasks set for you, or any ""immersive sim"" style gameplay choices.

After these early levels, the game becomes much more of a linear shooter. It's still entertaining, but it's probably not what you came for, or expected.

Playing on the hardest mode, the game is mostly weirdly easy, with very generous health and shield recovery and plenty of ammo available. The nanosuit's ability to make you super strong, invisible, or really fast mean you can easily out manoeuvre enemies and any challenge really just comes from making sure you get the first shot on any enemy you encounter.

The biggest disappointment I have with Crysis is that most of the weapons are boring to shoot. There's this great system where you can modify weapon attachments on the fly, but you never really get a truly exciting weapon, with the possible exception of the missile launcher (when is a missile launcher ever not fun?)

This remaster is mostly fine, though there are some pretty severe audio balancing issues, and moments where sound effects or music aren't audible when they should be. Vehicles that are hundreds of metres away sound like they're right on top of you, weird stuff like that. This version of the game also uses a checkpoint system with no manual saving, which is a really poor substitute.

It's a recommend with several caveats, but I did have a good time for the most part. Something about the suit announcing ""Cloak. Engaged."" triggers a dopamine release for me, so that alone was worth the price of admission!",1669146878,1669158625,True,1,0,0.541036725044250488,0,True,False,False

I think the remaster is pretty okay. It does struggle to run a bit but after a mod and some tweaks, I was able to play the game all the way through at a high framerate. 

The graphics are fairly identical to the original with a couple things looking a little worse if you pick at it a little. 

The gameplay and quite a few of the bugs are still the same old Crysis. Including invincible final boss that requires a reload or a full restart.

The changes to the sound effects for the nanosuit are horrible, sorry whoever worked on that but it is way too distracting.

Story wise, it is still the same as before, so it hits quite a bit of the nostalgia, however gunplay and sound definitely do not ""feel"" like the original, and nor does the suit. It may just be my memory, but the first few chapters on the beach definitely also feel differently paced, which leads me to believe that there were some choices made to reduce some of the slow pacing of the original, but sadly not to any benefit (due to gunplay feeling different and the visuals not being as crisp as the original).

All in all, it is a poor port. I will finish it, as I am already over my 2h and want to keep the trilogy, but definitely not enjoying this game.

The good:

* Overall, the game is very ambitious. The huge island, the setpieces, the detailed per-component damage of vehicles, the binoculars, etc. There's a lot they didn't *need* to do, but showed a lot of interesting ideas.

The bad:

* Audio mixing and audio in general. It was frequently hard to hear dialogue, there were sound effects way out of volume proportionally, there were some sounds that ""stuck around"" too long, etc. Most pathetic shotgun sound I've ever heard too. The alien weapon sounds like shooting peas through a straw. 

* The gun play is awful. Judged by modern standards, it just feels so bad to shoot in this game. Weapons are inaccurate and enemies are spongy. It's just so frustrating and unfun to use most of the weapons, with very few exceptions. (The minigun and rocket launcher are pretty OK)

* Pretends to be an open game, but you really have very specific objectives to do in a specific order. There's no reason to explore the island at all, so it's really more a cool idea than a feature.

* Vehicle controls and weapon aiming are so bad it made me want to quit at the tank level. It's horrible.

* Suit's power level is so limited, cloaking or speed last for all of a couple seconds. You don't really ""weave"" your abilities together naturally. You just use the armor ability and wait for it to recharge when it's out. Speed sort of helps navigating between objectives, but it's very limited as stated earlier.

* Some of the voice acting is OK, but there's a lot that's quite mediocre as well. Between that and the awful facial animations, the story can be cringy and painful at parts.

* Still a few bugs. Seems most of them have been fixed, but I got stuck inside a crashed Vtol which was very un-fun.

* Fairly short. I got through it in 5 hours. I didn't intend to speedrun, but the gunplay and vehicles were so painful that I rushed around to avoid those as much as possible.

A remaster is supposed to fix problems that the old game had and maybe improve on mechanics and graphics. While mechanics and graphics didn't change much (which some things should've been added, like an option to turn off toggle aim), I can tell you right now that this remaster added more issues than it fixed.

I played and finished the game on Delta difficulty and the first part of the game where you fight the Koreans was pretty much the same as the first Crysis. No problems and the gunplay was good.

However, when it came time to fight the [spoiler] aliens [/spoiler] , boy oh boy did the problems start cropping up.

The first major issue I encountered was during the missions where you [spoiler] fly the VTOL. [/spoiler] The vehicle would not respond to my mouse at all. Keyboard commands worked just fine but I couldn't actually control where the vehicle was looking. My solution to this was to plug in a controller I had nearby. This worked fine, but because I had played 70% of the game up to that point, my precision in using the vehicle was horrendous and I missed out on several secondary objectives while completing the mission. 

The other major issue I encountered was the final boss fight:
[spoiler] I thought I was going to have an aneurysm doing this boss fight. There is a nice ammo stockpile so you can reload your strongest weapons, but the 70% of the ship is on fire, including the stockpile. The fire doesn't even correspond to where you take damage. I could be meters away and still be taking damage from the fire. Also, if you're not in cover, there's a good chance the boss will spot you through stealth and freeze you until you die, so that's really fun. Also, my TAC Cannon didn't even work half the time. I'd lock on and fire the projectile, only for it to clip through the boss. [/spoiler] 

At the end of the game, I didn't even get the achievements for completing the game, but that could just be because I skipped the credits, but I'm definitely not going back to get them.

Overall, just play the original Crysis. Here's to hoping those good reviews about Crysis 2 and 3 Remastered are true.",1668910718,1668910718,False,6,0,0.564827442169189453,0,True,False,False

I'm brand new to Crysis, never having had the ability to run these games when they were in their prime, back circa 2007 or whatever. I've since bought the original Crysis 1 after this remaster made me puke blood.

So naturally, anyone new to the series who's buying this version of Crysis 1 for the first time would probably think: ""Well, I've never played the original so I might like the remaster purely for what it is, despite it's many claimed differences"".

Wrong.
You're going to shoot yourself in the foot if you approach this Remaster with that attitude, and you ain't going to have no nanosuit to protect those toes either. 

Allow me to begin:

(1) The ""volumetric clouds"" look like silly bubbles.

(2) The sky is so blue that it makes me feel like I'm in Bikini Bottom from Spongebob.

(3) The grass is a saturated cartoon green that makes me feel as if someone tried to put me in a jar with a leaf so that they could attempt to mimic my human environment for me.

(4) My ""3080Ti Mobile"" flings the fps counter from 90 down to 45 in two person gun fights, showing some very poor optimization that shouldn't be evident in a game this old. 

The pain doesn't stop there, I promise. This version is essentially the pc version, ported to console with downgrades, then ported back again from console back to PC with ""enhancements"". Lies, all lies.

The old version of Crysis 1, which has since been removed from Steam, never really was the way to go either. Steam's original version was 32bit only, making it a avoidable version at best.

Just avoid this, unless you like Fortnite or something.

The simplified controls for the second game got added here in the first game.
Neat idea for consistency, but makes no sense in terms of Gameplay and story.

For Veterans:
Speed only activates when sprinting, else you are stuck with slow walkspeeds.
Strength is the new default, but doesn't work. The recoil is the same as another mode.
Armor is the same only that you need to activate it and it drains energy overtime.

Multiplayer:
Crysis had a very interesting persistent multiplayer that could last hours with a in-match leveling system and the endgoal to take out the enemy base. I liked it a lot back then.
The remaster missed out by not using the opportunity to give us a user-hosted system, but instead has no multiplayer at all.

Like I wish the gameplay (Combat & AI) was enhanced to be better and more satisfyingly similar to the sequels (with maybe an original gameplay-style option for purists), the gameplay of Crysis 1 IMHO hasn't aged well, unlike it's graphics (depending on who you ask).

Speaking of, I honestly CANNOT see much of a difference from this and the original version in terms of graphics whatsoever, the only noticeable difference I can see/notice is the change in the colour palette/tint.

Plus there's no remaster of Warhead included with this, which is a real kick in the sack, it'd be like doing an official remaster of Half-Life, but not including the 2 expansions Blue Shift & Opposing Force- Oh wait.

All these years later I finally decided to bite on Crysis. I probably didn't have a PC worthy of playing it back in the day, but I sure do now! I was able to grab the remaster for $10 cdn and let me tell you I am glad that I did.

I don't read other people's reviews and I don't buy into the hype of new movies and games (like last night I started watching the new ""prey"" movie and it was garbage...sorry fan boys I turned it off after 30 minutes. The original Predator was miles better...)
 
And to that end, this game has that old school vibe to it - something you had to be around to savour in the old days of gaming (I'm 46 and have played thousands and thousands of hours of PC and console games - so I know!!)

This game has a campaign story that I am enjoying, and some gimmicks that are fresh (to me) like the Nano suit. The enemies are fast and capable of honing into you so even on normal it's not a cake walk. Use your head though (like an old school gamer) and this a damn fun game!

Yes, it supports NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 technology but does not support AMD FSR which I don't know why the developers couldn't implement that feature. Performance runs great, though leaving 'Can it run Crysis?"" enabled will greatly impact your performance which unfortunately my RTX 2080 Ti couldn't handle it. Roughly runs around 30-40fps sadly including raytracing. Another bad news I'd like to point out was that it does not come with mod support tools and worst of all, no multiplayer included.

Unless you have some NASA supercomputer, you're going to notice stuttering if you max everything out. This version also lacks a quick save option, which might annoy some players.

There ARE moments of brilliance in this game. I believe it's worth playing despite its flaws, but it could have been so much better. It's a shame they didn't include the superior Crysis Warhead in this release.

Considering this is a remaster, not an entire remake. It will on that setting, demand an RTX 3080 or better to run, at least in 4k.

The original was released in 2007, running the second iteration of CryEngine.
A piece of gaming history.

What has changed, considering it's a remaster it still uses the original game's assets. Like all remasters do.
What has been added:
*Higher Draw Distance LOD, would be the most noticeable.
*Completely new lighting techniques, including Ray Tracing. Your GPU doesn't even need to support it, it's built into the engine itself. While the game offers some basic extension to it, turned on by a simple checkbox.
*Tesselation on more objects such as rocks, mainly is where you will notice it.
*Texture resolution on assets, some are even remodeled from scratch.
*Sound samples, mainly on guns and they way they sound.
* Ray Tracing light effects, you can run this effect in this game even without an RTX enabled GPU. It's embedded in the engine's software according to Linus Tech. Also here the minuses begin, it's demanding. A lot!
* Quality of Life improvements to the controls. The control scheme is taken from Crysis 2 and 3, and gives you easier access to the nano suit. However if you preferred the original game's controls, you can still go back to that. Other QoL stuff is the intuitive toggle function on certain actions such as aim down sight and crouch. The original game locked ADS to toggle and crouch to hold and you could not change that. This point is probably the only reason I would recommend the remaster over the original. That and this remaster IS very good looking if you can afford to turn up the graphics settings.

-Shaders, makes the game look like a cartoon. It's not celshading thankfully. Everything is just too green, too lush. Where the original showed moonlight on the palm leaves, here they simply look... unreal. You can easily mod this however.
-HDR, but absolutely gives nothing for it. We're not talking anything remotely HDR10 here. It's like they forgot that HDR supports 10bit color depth but all the assets are still 8bit. Games that supports W11 HDR enhancement looks better using it than this game does with official HDR support.
-Again Texture resolution, apparently or obviously resolution doesn't always mean sharper. Some look even worse than the original, like parts of trees, even the nano suits in some places like the helmet. Faces of the main characters? Generic NPC's look better now than the main cast of the game.
-Shadows, they simply shimmer all over the place now a lot of the time. Most likely to the in game Ray Tracing lighting. When it works, it looks great, but it often does not.
-Vegetation, as beautiful it looks on picture, once you're in the game you may notice how static they are. Trees and brushes no longer moves in the wind, no longer do you or NPC displace vegetation in the same realistic manner, nor does the brushwork hide you effectively as they did in the original game.
Also the animations on them seem to be locked at a very low frame rate whenever displacement does occur.

Game does support DLSS! For those with an nVidia card who wants to enjoy this title in 4k. You will need that turned on. Or simply install the original and run it in 4k with ease. It demands about 4GB V-RAM (Which is one of those reasons it never ran well at all on older machines when the original came out, most cards sported about 256-512MB at best back then, but then the target resolution was 1024x768, not even 1920x1080 widescreen, 4k was a dream far far away nobody had probably even thought of being a possibility in video gaming back then)
The original Crysis runs very well on modern machines from the last 6 years or so. A GTX 1080 can run it in 4k. This remaster however, not so much.

I was running this remaster with an RTX 3080, on an Intel machine 10th Gen i9 10900k, 32 GB of DDR4 RAM at 3000MHz XMP and from an M.2 Drive. Still PCI-X gen 3.0 but... on ""Can it run Crysis"" settings with DLSS on Quality I get about 40-50 frames per second, in 4k. A stable 60 if I run on Very High. With experimental RTX effects and HDR turned on. This for comparison is about the same I get from Cyberpunk 2077 with Ray tracing turned on and reflections on Psycho and with DLSS on Auto. (Not Quality setting for DLSS it becomes unplayable in 4k for some reason on nVidia cards now when everything else is maxed out, except maybe on a 4090 and is thus the pinnacle on hardware demanding PC games currently, despite even this remasters release trying to clearly be mainly intended to take that back) Either way I guess it's safe to say my machine can run Crysis =)

This though is from a remaster of a game that have much smaller levels and was made in 2007.
Does it look good? Yes, is it indeed does, but it still feels like an old game even visually. You can tell it is a remaster, not a remake.

Don't buy this if you are just looking for a good game to enjoy, unless it's on sale, otherwise I would go for the original version. Because it was great as a game and still is!
Especially on Delta difficulty where you really had to think and plan before you acted. Even on easy it was difficult to go full Leroy Jenkins, but on Delta it truly shines.
Only buy this version if you want to push your new hardware to the max or are interested in getting the Steam Achievements. Though you can also buy this version of the game on Epic Store depending who has the better prices for the moment.

The best part of this release however, it's an EA owned IP, but doesn't require neither Origin nor EA Play third party applications or accounts to run. It does blow a bit of fresh air into an old but fondly remembered title that is indeed a very important part of PC Gaming History.

Crysis. A title that pushed boundaries of video game fidelity, in fact CryTek, just like Epic has always been about that and the simplicity to use their engines for video game creation. This particular title was definitely a big reason why other video games started looking much better than before. It was and still is a great showcase what games can look like, and I mean even games made today! 13 years later. This version, is sadly a bit generic. Adds things you will most likely not notice all that much, unless you run a comparison of them next to each other. If you want a showcase of RTX effects, even Minecraft and Quake II RTX does a much better job of doing that, or I recommend Cyberpunk 2077 or Watch Dogs Legion to best enjoy that as a tech demonstration.

I would buy this remaster only for the Benchmark, ""Can it run Crysis"" hence the other title comparisons, and the Steam Achievements. Otherwise, the original release will do you just as well.

You should also know there are MASSIVE differences in the game play when using the sequels mechanics. They were better the first time around I felt, even if they caused you to think before you acted more.
Also the AI is MUCH better at spotting you in the remastered version, even on Delta, making the game immensely harder than the original release.
And last but not least, the original did not use checkpoints or constrain you to to them, the original uses the old fashioned manual saving system and relied on that. The remaster does not offer this, it is a MUCH harder game than the original in comparison. Even on easier difficulties.

Another last minute negative thing: The expansion for the original, Warhead, is NOT included in this release.
Though Warhead was also standalone, you do not need the original game to play it.

It always defaults to Strength mode when coming out of Cloak mode even if you were using Armor mode, making you vulnerable in the middle of a fight and costing you a restart. Also they decided to remove save games, so you are at the mercy of their checkpoints now. The suit instead of feeling cool and powerful is now an energy management task that barely helps you
Enemies immediately and sometimes magically know where you are, this reduces greatly the stealth component of the original game. Before they needed to see you, but now not anymore
Last couple of levels crash on the original game, here they just stop responding and the game won't close

No multiplayer at all. No online, no LAN mode, no splitscreen. They could have even tried adding Coop to a remaster of a triple A game that is one of the best selling PC games, but no, they removed it all

They have copied the suit controls and movement for the later Crysis games. This does not fit the original Crysis on PC at all. Before you tell me there is a ""classic suit"" mode I will tell you that is also broken. Due to the movement changes strafing with or without speed mode is slow. Armor mode, which in original Crysis is your default mode, has the later games thumping sounds when walking around. To make it worse the sounds even alert enemies.

In original Crysis if you were prone and pressed crouch you would crouch and when you let go of crouch you would go prone again. This was ideal when stalking enemies through the foliage. Being hidden until you pop up to make a shot and then go prone again with ease. When you open your suit menu with middle mouse crouched you stand up. This is stupid as you often will be hiding from enemies letting your energy recharge so that you can go into stealth mode again only to stand and expose yourself when you go to use stealth.

Enemies once alerted instantly know your position. Even ones that should have no idea where you are. I fondly remember in OG Crysis how enemies would get startled and look around for you not just instantly turn to you. If you broke away and they lost sight they would slowly move to and clear out your position that was last known to them. The graphics do look good but the god rays flicker a lot and don't look real they look glitched out.

This remastered version of a game has been out for too long to not have these jarring issues resolved. This tells me the devs don't care. Probably cause of the fat payout they got from epic for the exclusivity deal. A deal they took that already had me doubting this was going to be a good version of Crysis. I wish I hadn't waited so long to play it so I could refund this garbage. Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence in Crysis 4 that they announced.

Differences (aside from graphics, obv): 
1. The biggest difference is there's no manual save, only checkpoints. I'm playing on delta and hardly noticed any difference, honestly, not a lot of difficulty increase. 
2. Nanosuit. You CAN switch back to the original, but if you played the original, the new system offers some different experiences. 
    2.1: Your energy regens A LOT faster. This makes the ""cloak - regen - cloak"" loop a lot faster. 
    2.2: Sprinting in speed mode costs MUCH LESS energy. 
    2.3: Jumping in strength mode costs less energy. 
    2.4: Armor mode is completely useless. Not only does it bleeds energy, it costs pretty much the same amount of energy as the original when shot, which was the default mode in the original... So in total it tanks LESS shots cuz of the bleeding. 
    2.5: Your default mode is strength, meaning you don't get the passive protection like in the original, and might get one-shotted more often. 
    2.6: The new strength mode doesn't seem to suppress gun recoil. 

I really like that you activate modes with one button instead of the wheel. I just hope armor mode was still the default mode, unlike the garbage it is now. But oh well, it's still fun.

For a remaster released in 2020+, this version is a little underwhelming. Textures, water effects, particle effects, depth of field -- sure, all of these things have improvements for the most part. But when you compare side by side, the improvements feel kind of minor, which only speaks to just how good the original already looked to begin with.

To ensure I was getting the most out of this, I enabled the ""Can It Run Crysis?"" mode with the raytracing enabled, which cranks everything to the max. On my watercooled rig (5950x CPU + 3090 GPU + 64 GB RAM), in 1440p mode with VSync enabled, on a 144 Hz monitor -- framerates usually hovered in the 120 FPS range with some dips going under 100 during heavier scenes, and otherwise capping at 144 when not much was happening. It also pushed my coolant temps to 37C, which is the highest I've ever seen it go (for context, most games barely push it north of 30-31C. Harsher games might put it to 33C or even 35C).

Still very playable, but it's strange to see a remastered version of Crysis that 1. still looks dated by today's standards with little improvement over the original, even with maxed settings, and 2. is way harder on my machine than several modern titles that look better and perform more efficiently.

I enjoyed the game, but mainly the first half where stealth and infiltration were more viable strategies. Once things go all alien on you, I feel like the nanosuit starts to lose its edge and things devolve into braindead shooter territory. The whole game is over in 6-8 hours, even if you are going for all the achievements and playing on the hardest difficulty mode. Once it's over, there's not much in the way of replayability. There's no multiplayer mode in this version, so I'm not sure what more there is to do. 

I bought this game on sale for $4.49, mainly to get the achievements. Had I paid the full $29.99, I would have probably felt really dissatisfied with how little this remaster offers over the original.",1662348606,1663884977,False,29,0,0.668031930923461914,0,True,False,False

Ultrawide supported just fine
Young people coming up can play and enjoy a legendary shooter that I loved so much back in college
...that's about it

Cons:
The manual save system is completely removed. It has checkpoint saves only and you can't choose to go back to specific checkpoints either...your only options are the most recent checkpoint or the beginning of the level and that's it.
Every time I start the game back up, that dastardly motion blur setting is back on again no matter how many times I turn it off.
While some of the sound effects have been improved (starting rifle and the pistol for example), some are just as bad as they were before (the fictional AK sounds unchanged) however some are significantly worse...the footsteps, even when walking on grass or sand sound like you have giant metal boots and are moving on a metal floor...even when sneaking softly.
To use the suit quickwheel menu like the old game, you enable this in the gameplay settings. When you are crouching down and access this wheel, it causes you to stand up for no reason. So hiding behind something and accessing this wheel to cloak means standing up and being seen, defeating the purpose of cloaking because now you need armor mode and are in a fire fight. If you disable this classic wheel mode, you are either in armor or strength mode and just manually enable cloak when needed. However, when you run, it auto uses speed mode! What, why!? I don't want to use speed mode every single time. That should be its own separate setting in my opinion.
I think the stealth is off...I used to be able to crouch and hide in bushes/shrubs or prone crawl in high grass until fairly close to an enemy, causing them to get surprised. Now I can sit perfectly still in some bushes and the enemies see me from a pretty good distance away. Crysis 2 and 3 had that issue where stealth was REALLY bad so I'm guessing they maybe used a newer Crytek engine from one of those games to make this one and weren't able to replicate the awesome quality stealth that the original had.
The game is horribly optimized.

Optimization deserves its own section:
I'm no fool, I get that the highest settings are often designed for screenshots and to attract gamers. It gives us something to upgrade for, gives us something to compare to, gives us something to benchmark etc. So typically if I can't max a game I lower stuff one setting at a time as needed and eventually play it smoothly. My system currently is an i9-12900k, 3090ti and 32GBs of DDR5 running windows 10 on a gen 5 (EDIT: oops gen 4 not 5) PCIe NVMe. Theoretically it should be strong enough for everything I can throw at it since I am only running a 1440p ultrawide, not a 4K but still, the max settings were aimed at being future proof such as with the original game so I began tweaking the usual suspects like ray tracing and shadows etc without being annoyed. I got to the coastal house of level 1 (when the sun is up and the jet flies by) and disabled v-sync so I could begin troubleshooting. I ended up basically lowering EVERYTHING to low and it still didn't feel smooth and playable. There is one setting however (Objects Quality) that can't be changed in game so I went back to the main menu to change it. After it lagged on 'Can it Run Crysis' I tried 'Very High' and then 'High.' It started to feel better on 'Medium' but didn't feel smooth until 'Low.' You have got to be kidding me. It seriously either lagged hardcore or felt like my walk speed was varying in speed as I moved along with anything above 'Low.' Never seen a single setting so badly optimized. Isn't a dealbreaker by itself but really odd.

Long story short - I think this was a huge disappointment and can't recommend it to anyone that played the original.
If you did NOT play the original then this one is probably a better choice since the original is also horribly optimized but also struggles in other ways on modern systems.",1663549848,1663790749,False,48,2,0.757665574550628662,3,True,False,False

With the release of Crysis in 2007, Crytek raised the bar on graphics to heights that many other titles could not. The game (for that time) could boast not only excellent graphics, but also destructible environments, good voice acting and immersiveness. The player immersed himself in the game and, together with the hero, thought out his way to the point of the task - through the Jungle filled with Koreans.
In 2020, Crytek decided to play on the feelings of the players and just released the same game again. Only slightly improving the graphics in some places - adding a newfangled rtx. Which, instead of making an already great game even more colorful, did the opposite.
With the advent of rtx in the world of Crysis, the surrounding space became bright, pale and lost most of the shadows. In addition, Crytek has significantly degraded most of the textures. Because of what it is already impossible to look at the faces of the heroes without a shudder.
I sincerely believe that Crytek wanted to make the game better - but simply loading the game with new technologies is not the same as improving it. 
Due to the changes, the game has become hundreds of times easier, losing the former challenge that the original threw.
I do not recommend this game. Especially if you have not played the original, then I advise you to buy it easier than this remaster.",1662301759,1662302029,False,12,0,0.566554486751556396,2,True,False,False

Story is way more boring and full of flat male and curvy female characters - if you catch my drift. Would still recommend.

When I saw this game and hear the original reviews for it I was all well and good to ignore any negative criticism and just try the game out to see its 'quality' for myself, But personally I don't believe Crysis Remastered really adds a whole lot to improve to the original game and the graphical 'improvements' aside the only really noticeable additions this remaster really makes is with the enemy AI, but even that is a laughable claim. I also experienced painful issues with the view models and collision models of objects not lining up correctly, with the case often being that i'd shoot at an enemy that is in view but the shot will not connect because it hit the 'rock'. I have also encountered many other bugs such as: weird water effects appearing on boats that are completely out of water, odd water effects on boats sitting in water, enemies that are very large distances away sounding as if they are 5 metres from my face, odd bullet physics with bullets landing far above where they are shot, and other weird physics related bugs with cars and debris. So in conclusion if you are looking to play Crysis but the original and if the graphics really concern you that much slap on a few community made mods and you'll have a similar but more refined experience than what Crysis Remasterd can offer.

Getting the positives out of the way; the game is loads of fun to play, looks way more detailed ([i]in some areas[/i]) than the original and you can play the game on maxed graphics without frame issues ([i]at least to some degree[/i]).

If you played the original from 2007, maybe you would be enticed to get a copy of this game. Fortunately for me, it was on a massive sale and I decided to give this a shot since I haven't played the game in years. I was impressed by the detail and how well things were running, up until they weren't.

Although the graphics look awesome, the game is still poorly optimised and you'll notice it particularly in some areas where there's lots of water. Raytracing isn't really worth it as well, but you especially need to lower object detail to medium to get better frames. In fact, everything on medium looks pretty good, so just play on that for better frames.

The worst part though is the amount of model glitches and poor controls. Mouse sensitivity was way too fast and I had to adjust my mouse DPI. Keybindings are just crap. I play ESDF style so naturally that'll include my tank and VTOL. It doesn't respond at all and I was forced to use WSDF on these missions, not a game breaker... at least not until the VTOL mission.

[b]This is where things get really f***ed up and what made me give this game a negative review[/b]. Mouse controls on this mission don't work at all! I've read forums or guides and nobody seems to have a solution that I saw. Your only option is to plug in a controller, which I had, but it was an awful experience. I got incredibly frustrated during this mission and it made me wonder what was the point of remastering a pretty damn good game and then you mess up so many things, especially the controls. It just appears to be grabbing a quick buck and ruining the memory of a great game, I don't understand this logic, but it's becoming far too common nowadays!

You're better off playing the 2007 version. It works, it still looks great and it doesn't have half of the problems the remastered version has.

If you're like me who got it on a very good deal, then sure, pick up a copy. I got all of the achievements in one single run, so that was pretty cool, but make sure to get a controller as well, since you won't be able to beat the VTOL mission without it.",1662166344,1662166344,False,1,0,0.501788437366485596,0,True,False,False

I have played the original PC version many times before. I have been playing it since it launched. I bought it again on Steam when I lost my hard copy and I put another 30 hours replaying the original PC version again over the years. I skipped this remaster version initially when it launched because it had a terrible launch filled with bugs. 

But now as I play this version of the game after several patches, I realize that it actually is a pretty good remaster. The graphics are ok and the new graphics settings are nice.

Those were the two major issues I had that kept me from enjoying the remaster and I was compelled to ask for a refund and forget about it.
Fast forward to now I see crysis remastered on sale on steam for dirt cheap price, so I decided to give it a shot a second time and I must say it was well worth it. Crytek has been updating the game since release and they finally added DLSS support so now my PC runs it just fine and the crysis 2 nanosuit mechanics are still there, but you can finaly switch to the classic nanosuit controls so pick your flavor.

I like, that classic style of Crysis from 2007 has been kept, with some improvement to the graphics.. though, I remember how the game looked back in the day, when was playing it on Core 2 Duo with Geforce 8800GTS. It's an improvement only, not evolution - so it's kinda mixed bag, especially that Crysis was always the game with leading, astonishing graphics. 

Of course, as FPS when it comes about gameplay, it's done right - they didn't break it (*fanfare*). And as of today, haven't noticed any major bugs, maybe only sometimes destroyed objects can permeate through itself. Nothing terrible, but I think such things should be fixed, especially when we talk about remaster (because it's remaster, right?). Though haven't finished game yet, so maybe my opinion there will change...

From definitive cons. Ray Tracing, are you there? If you see a view (at least in current version of game) with and without ray tracing, most of you probably wouldn't notice any difference. Oh sorry, you will - as you just cut your performance by half. I think those effects have been limited with latest updates to minimum (due to poor performance? that's not how you fix problems, seriously)

Speaking of performance, I'm playing with Intel Xeon E5-2697 v3 @ 3.8GHz and Radeon RX 6700 XT 12GB. At this setup with ""Can it run Crysis?"" settings at 1920x1200, without RT, game keeps average at 100fps, 60-70 at open areas, and 130-140 at closed areas, and that is fine. Not fine is, that frames per seconds can randomly dip even below 20-30 frames for no reason, even when staying still. It irritates a lot and is not acceptable, generally for FPS genre. FPS lock at 75 (Vsync) kinda helps a bit though...

Can I recommend the game? Eeeeeh, maybe. But on some discount, definitely not for full price. I still have fun while playing, but overally I'd say, that this remaster is below expectations, it doesn't make it a bad game though.

I also played OG Crysis on Bauer/Delta difficulty on my current rig before trying this remaster.

The AI in this remaster are broken; they are straight out of Far Cry 1 and will instantly spot you when you're uncloaked but fully behind cover. 

Speaking of cloaking, you cannot use the classic nanosuit middle mouse control while crouched; you'll just stand up if you try, which is counter-productive and has gotten me spotted.

Pressing spacebar is how you get up from prone in Classic, but in this remaster you actually JUMP INTO THE AIR from the prone position, which is also counter-productive and has gotten me spotted.

Switching grenade types in Classic does not equip the grenade, you keep whatever is in your hands; in the remaster, switching grenade type puts the grenades into your hands, which has gotten me killed.

Most of the ""rethought"" controls are nonsensical and directly conflict with the flow of the game. 

You can't even manually save your progress like you could in Classic, you just have to deal with autosave points. The only noticeable improvements in this remaster are higher texture resolutions, greater draw distance, parallax occlusion mapping, and tessellation.

You can see my other reviews of the Crysis games if you want details but in short I found Crysis 2 to be bland and boring and Crysis 3 was better but still kind of mid (maybe a step above a Call of Duty campaign).  I didn’t really have a ton of fun. I mostly just finished because I had already started and it really bothers me when I move onto other games without finishing the one I’m on regardless if it’s good or not.

I say this because Crysis: Remastered did something the others didn’t.  I started having fun.  I wasn’t on the edge of my seat or anything but shooting a rocket and having it completely eviscerate a house some poor chap was hiding in is just so satisfying.  The combat is still pretty generic but you have to remember this was 2007.  Call of Duty 4, the game that would be emulated by almost every other shooter after it, came out a day before this.  All things considered the gameplay has held up pretty well over the years.

I’m a lot less lenient on games like Crysis 2 and 3 being younger and having more time to refine their gameplay while this one was a testing ground.  Not only that, there are vehicles here and open ended maps, both of which were taken out of the next two entries.  The destruction was a surprise which I thoroughly enjoyed.  The only thing that carried over to the next two Crysis games is the under utilization of player mechanics.  Like picking up enemies or throwing objects are super can be fun but shooting the bad guys is always just easier and more convenient .

I’m not sure, maybe it’s more useful on harder difficulties.  The game gets more annoying when you get into the caves.  The final boss is also frustrating, slow, and not very fun but it’s not enough to sink the game.

I really can't fathom why they made the next two games linear after this one.  It feels like such a natural fit to the gameplay.  It’s like Far Cry on steroids and I love Far Cry.  Maybe that’s why I’m so much more lenient towards this game, but a game can’t help being fun.

The graphics are, well you know it’s Crysis what do I have to say.  The remaster does a pretty good job too.  I had a few glitches and some of the shadows were weird but for the most part the game played buttery smooth and looked really good.  Again it needs to be noted this game came out in 2007 so some of the jank still remains.  You can tell it’s from 2007 but it’s been fluffed up enough to both still look nice and retain it’s authentic feel.

6/10 - I may be a bit more generous here then the game deserves but compared to its sequels it is the best out of the bunch.",1643773011,1657174346,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
1715130,118307094,76561198797341543,0,2,582,0,582,1657015495,"I'm going to break this game down into three parts. There will be spoilers ahead but this game has been out since the early 2000's so most people should know what the story is by this point. 

The Good:

- This game functions as a perfectly fine FPS. It does exactly what it says on the tin. The integration of the nano suit makes combat with the game varied enough so that it doesn't feel like your typical Modern Warfare/Battlefield game play loop. 

- The environments and the design of the game from a visual stance is nice to see. The jungles feel very dense with different areas that can be used for tactical use such as hiding or cover when needed. The way that enemy strong points gave access to different approaches of combat was also refreshing. The visuals themselves, while I don't have a rig that can run the game at maximum settings, was very pretty and you could tell why this game pushed graphical boundaries to not only their limit but even made new ones. 

- The difficulties paired with enemy A.I. felt reasonable. I played the game at medium difficulty because if I wanted to play a difficult game, I would go play Dark Souls. This I wanted to be more of a fun and relaxing, unwinding experience. 

- Weapon variety is nice and there are certain combinations for almost every player type. If you want to go stealth or extremely aggressive or something in between there are plenty of options to choose from. 

The Bad:

- The story and the characters are a mayonnaise sandwich. While the nano suit is a very nice addition to the game, the actual game play loop is uninspiring and lacks a lot of creative impact or direction. This game feels like it's selling points was the nano suit and how amazing the graphics could look if you had the insane hardware requirements needed in order to do so. 

- While the environment is nice to look at and game in, it does get repetitive after a while. I really wish there were more areas to use and plan your mode of attack through instead of just a enemy encampment or dense jungle. There are a few select areas that do change it up slightly, one being in the alien ship where you had to align yourself correctly while floating in zero gravity and enemies could come from any angle. but other than that, attention to include environmental combat and having a wider ecosystem to fight in would have been fantastic to see. 

- Maybe it was just my experience, but there were times I would pick up a weapon that had it's flashlight on or there was mention that I had the option to use different ammo types or an under-slung weapon system. It didn't matter what I pressed there was no way to use any of these options or turn the flashlight off. 

- The inclusion of the nano suit was nice, but a lot of the times I just opted to use one feature of the suit for a huge chunk of my play-through. The sprinting feature was the only other option I used. I think if the game had been designed around the suit and the features it included would have brought the game head and shoulders where it is now. 

The Ugly

- This game is horrifically buggy. The A.I. would act up and not function properly. There were swathes of the game that I couldn't interact with anything or a prompt wouldn't appear and I would wonder around gormless until I had to look up what I was supposed to do next. Events that characters in the game would exclaim and point out never actually appeared on screen and I just had to use my imagination of what could or might have happened.  

- There is no reason to use any of the features the nano suit provides instead of its invisibility feature. Pair that with any weapon with a sight and you can breeze through most if not all of the game in no time. Paired with the buggy A.I. and it makes the game play even less interesting. 

- I had to stop playing the game because the second part of the final boss fight I could not get through. Not because it was difficult, but because I was caught in an endless loop of the alien mother ship freezing me over and over, which you have to spend time breaking out of, while the smaller alien ships around it would endlessly hit me and I would just die with no way out of it. I tried every tactic I could think of and nothing worked. 

- There are plenty of times where whatever I was shooting at, the bullets would just phase through the target. This is especially frustrating during the final boss fight where you need to hit certain points on the mother ship and your bullets would just go right through it and cause absolutely no damage. 

- The story and the characters bore me to tears. You're not invested in anything that happens on the island because everything has the same impact and depth as rice paper. Enemy units start employing their own type of nano suits? No further investigation into that, it just gets brought up once and never mentioned again. You discover alien life and that the strange structures around the island belong to an advance alien race and the island is sheltering a huge alien ship? Your character barely comments on any of this. The game put all of it's eggs into the graphics and hoped you didn't pay attention to anything else. 

- I would not buy this game and because of the experience I had I will not be buying any of its future installments either.",1657089896,1657089896,False,1,0,0.461567968130111694,0,True,False,False

The original game is known for its graphics and I believe the remaster looks great in most respects. When I first saw the trailer for the remaster, I was not too big a fan of some of the changes made especially in regards to the color and saturation of the environment. However, playing it for sometime, the changes have grown on me. Plus, I think the new textures look great especially the beach and rock textures. The ray-tracing is great too, it is really cool to see Nomad's reflection for one, and I think the lighting of the environments is very well done in this remaster. And that to me seems a huge improvement over the original, which still looked good in that regard. So overall I like the remaster from a visual standpoint. I've always enjoyed the gameplay in Crysis, especially in the first 2/3 of the game. The levels are very large and allow for a lot of freedom in approaching objectives, despite the game technically being a linear one, at least in regards to the story. The last third falls a bit in quality in my opinion when encountering the alien enemies. To me, those levels don't feel as well designed and too linear compared to the earlier chapters. But they do offer some variety and a change of pace with battling the alien enemies, which I think are pretty cool and well done. I'd say the only level I really dislike is the final one, in particular the final boss fight, which I find frustrating and not all that creative. I'd say that the story is fairly straightforward and the characters too, but I think that fits the game just fine. The nanosuit is a ton of fun to use. The different modes add to the variety of choice in this game. Cloak for stealthy runs then strength and speed for rushing in and grabbing and tossing enemies is always great too. Compared to the later entries in the Crysis trilogy I prefer the feeling of the strength and speed in this game. The strength jumps and punches truly seem super strong. And the speed sprint truly seems fast. As far as changes in the remaster I believe a lot of issues were patched since release. I did not own the game at that point as I didn't have the hardware, but now that I do it runs great overall. One gripe is that option to save at any point has been removed as compared to the original game. It is not that big of a deal, as the checkpoint system I think works well enough, but that feature is lacking. Another change I noticed is on the Onslaught (tank) level that the tank can now fire infinite shells. In the original Crysis on PC the tank shells were limited, making that level a little more difficult. Besides that, sometimes the enemy AI seems to me to pick up Nomad in cloak a little easier compared to the original Crysis, but that is just my observation and I could be wrong. Now that I have the hardware to run this remaster I am overall really happy with it from the gameplay to the new visuals.",1656741648,1656741648,True,6,0,0.59410470724105835,0,True,False,False

Not just this remaster, but the game in general. And I've finished it 4-5 times at least since it got out. 2007 I was super impressed and obsessed by this game, but 15 years later now and I've changed my mind.

Game is super short (it should have at least 10 more levels, because you can literally finish some in few minutes), AI is terrible (this is not just remaster issue, game has been known forever to have shitty AI), not much variety with weapons, enemy variety is lackluster (korean soldiers, nano suit variant, 1 small alien variant, 1 medium alien variant and big boss at the end, that's literally it!), it seems open but it's linear (I don't mind linearity, but with this game it should have been more), story and characters are super generic with nothing to grab you and hold your attention.

The only semi-good thing I would give it is the nanosuit, its voice and badass design and functions. And of course the visuals still hold up to this day (even though remaster has made it shittier).


I don't get why people are giving good reviews to it, or why it hasn't faded into obscurity, because literally the only thing that's ever been known for are the visuals and it was a meme before memes (Can it run Crysis?), but that's not gonna work for me sadly.",1656675286,1656675380,False,18,5,0.524879217147827148,3,True,False,False

Apart from the fact that it's the very same game we played 14 years ago it has ridiculously high system requirements (again!), glitchy AI, sudden FPS drops from 60-70 on very high settings down to 30-35 with no visible reason, a whole bunch of smaller bugs. Heck, it even misses some effects from the original game. Overall it looks a bit more ""cartoonish"" than the game from the 2007 and the difficulty sometimes jumps to the souls-like level. Keeping in mind that you have no manual saves it may ruin your day sometimes. And, most importantly, the game as already mentioned by the majority of people here in the feedback section - still uses only 2 CPU cores/4 threads! At the age of multi-core CPUs and threadrippers it's simply laughable! I tried searching the web for some cpu fix but no luck so far. Seems like it's the cry engine hardcoded flaw that cannot be fixed.
Buy only with a huge discount, or simply install the original crysis with mods - thankfully, it has plenty.

Update as of june 2022
I'm changing my vote to positive because, fortunately, saber interactive didn't give up their work and continued developing and fixing bugs. Certain optimizations and error fixing was implemented. The fps rate is more stable now. In the end I was able to enjoy the game and have fun.

I remember back in the day when the original got release at the same time of the first real beefy GPUS by nvidia de 8000 Series and people getting mad because even with a 8800 ULTRA which was above the GTX and the GTS,they could not run Crysis on Ultra settings.
I really enjoy during the weekends to just chill and blast Crysis.
You can go for the classic nanosuit and middle button press to choose speed,armor,strenght or cloat or go for the new style and have the modes keybinded.
Graphics got a refresh and yeah they are up to par but its not the same effect the original got,because time passes and we are used now to better graphics.

but hey,for 4 bucks on sale + achivements and the good feelings,yeah its worth it.

[b]Why[/b]: Crysis is an okay game while going for all achievements and a good experience but it’s not very good otherwise. Don't get me wrong but I like the beginning a lot more than the end, I like Act I and I kinda like act II but Act III threw me off so much I was confused by the end of it. You could just say that I wasn’t paying enough attention to the story or you could say because I was playing on Delta that they weren’t speaking English which impacted the story but that we’re true then I don’t think that you should get only get half the story from English and the rest in Korean. The final boss was a lot cooler and more fun than I thought it would be. Besides that the music is not really memorable at all except for the final boss in my opinion, which the game has a lot of music for being a relatively short game. I only had a few bugs where guns would disappear and on Exodus the driver would get us killed by flipping the car, just restart and you’ll be good. The graphics were okay but some parts wouldn’t load-in all the way and the game was too bright a lot of the time and when it was dark it was a bit too dark because I had to turn it down for the day, maybe just me. Overall I would only get this game on sale, it's a good game but not worth the full price It may be a remaster but it’s missing multiplayer and  it's replayability.",1652042926,1653605632,True,0,0,0,5,True,False,False

[b]Crysis, about 14 years ago already really groundbreaking and a terrific game. And the remastered?[/b]

For me again one of the games where I would like to have the opportunity to give a neutral review. The decision between thumbs up and thumbs down is sometimes difficult to make. But maybe there will be one day. Would definitely be desirable.

Back to the game. I think that's how it works. Unfortunately. Somehow I had hoped for more.
It is positive that the story has remained unchanged and the graphics are really impressive for a remastered.
Nice lighting, easily recognizable shadows, and good sound.
It's still a lot of fun to use the large area and scout out the scenes with binoculars.

Still, you can tell the game is just its age. The AI is probably out of date and ""just standing around"" or turning your back on you sometimes causes a bit of confusion and a smile.

All in all, not a bad game, just a bit old.

Its at the point where your playing a newer title but your not really sure if you can play Cyberpunk feeling apathetic and im not really apathetic, im not sure where Crysis fits, any game that fits to play is probably World of Warcraft remastered, she had really big night elf tits when we met in Stormwind.

Quicksaves, which would have made my delta difficulty run much more bearable and less annoying. Not to mention things could have improved, such as the difficulty descriptions in menus. Delta difficulty was described as having less modifiers than there actually are. For example, enemies recieve aimbot and can notice you from across the map. The player has reduced health and the game is much more unforgiving. However, the game gives no indication of this, which led me to play quite a bit of the game under the impression this just is how the game was.

If the original Crysis wasn't a technological marvel with its graphics, then I'm sure as hell that it wouldn't have been on anyone's radar. Behind that eye candy is an FPS that's mediocre AT BEST. There's a story to be told but the game doesn't tell it. instead the game has you going from point A to point B without any proper explanation of whatever the fuck is going on. Additionally, the open world setting does absolutely nothing except making the process of moving from one objective to another an absolute hassle. Finally, the biggest issue of this game is the absolute horse shit AI that can spot you from miles away. The AI makes stealth in this game more of a chore, as more of then than not, no matter how careful you plan your approach, the chances of some AI detecting you from 100 fucking feet away is always high. Even when you're hidden the enemies will sometimes just randomly detect you for no good reason leading to inevitable combat. Which brings me to the combat, which is shit smeared ass cheeks. Enemies are HP sponges and they're able to soak up your bullets without even flinching. Did I also mention that there's literally a mission where aiming with the mouse doesn't work (search for Crysis Remastered Ascension mouse not working.) I could go on and on but the verdict is this: the only thing that aged well in Crysis for both the original and Remastered version is the graphics.

I find Crysis 2 to be the better game because that game's performance is far better, the levels may have been more linear but it still gave you freedom to approach those levels any way you preferred (like the Halo games except now you can also use stealth), the controls felt great and the game made you feel like an action hero when fighting against humans but then became challenging when you had to fight against the aliens.",1649619946,1649619946,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics are fine i guess but I cant shake the feeling that this could have just easily been a community mod instead of a separate game. I made a list of everything I encountered during my play through. If you dont wanna read it fine, here is a small summary.
This game is a graphic overhaul. It adds nothing, and removes a lot of things unnecessarily. This is almost like the crysis version of the gta definitive edition. If you want this for benchmark purposes get it at $5.

things I noticed and encountered vol. 1
- The graphics look about the same as any dumbass ""remaster"" game released in todays gaming market.
- The controls are weird. It's like Crysis 3 with a Crysis 1 story
- No quick saving. As someone who loves to do stupid things in games this being removed really annoyed me
- seat changing in vehicles (you can switch between driver and gunner but nothing else)
- Sensitivity in the gunner seat of vehicles is ungodly low. Even at max (sensitivity in game) it is super slow. Increase your mouse to about 3000 dpi and you can destroy anything in your path. 
-grenade changing is weird. Nothing wrong with it just weird. 
- you can drive the tank all the way to the end of the onslaught level. (good thing)
- that bug where you could put like 100000 bullets into a guy and they dont die until you get within arms length of them is fixed (good thing)
- I'm surprised that they kept the ""suit shortcuts"" setting. (good thing)
- sometimes the sound would cutout (like explosions would make no noise) or play continuously (like gunfire would play but no one would be shooting). 
- Cant pick up a few of the items. Example; in the original, you could pick up rocks, sticks, branches and crates. Everything was intractable. In this version you cant pick up any of those items, but they are still animated in the world. Not a big deal but weird that they'd remove being able to pick up these items but keep them looking like pickup-able items.
- ai is retarded. Lots of enemies walk around with no weapon or spawn without one and pretend to shoot at you. Also had an occasions where the enemy would spawn outside their vehicle (like a tank in onslaught or AAA gun in assault) and just do nothing. 
- No grenade launcher indicator. y'know when you have the grenade launcher attachment and you hold mouse 1 it gives a reticle to aim at. Yeah that was removed. 
-occasionally my controls would mess up where I could not do most of the key functions. I could only shoot and use wasd. 
- that one flying frog glitch when you pick up a frog and throw it straight up and it would fly away. I know its considered a bug but I thought the devs would have kept it as a joke or something. 
- the pistol sounds different in single fire but if you switch it to double round burst it sounds like the original pistol. It's sort of the case with most guns and their firing mode. 
- on the relic level, when approaching the graveyard in a vehicle, you can't. in the original you could drive a vehicle into the graveyard and gun down the nanosuit enemies. But in this version, the tree that you could just drive under now completely stops you.
- cant hold crouch and open your suit radial menu at the same time. BUT if you tap the crouch button THEN open the suit menu, you stay crouched. 
- no cold on guns in the paradise lost level. What I mean is; in the original when you get to that level the guns would be frozen over and the red dot is also clear as day where in the original it was frozen over and near useless. 
- There was no feeling of environment change. In the first level when you see the sunrise the world is completely bright. The point of that in the original (I assumed) was to show off the lighting affects the engine was capable of. This game felt like cl_fullbright was on at times it should have been.
- in the last level there are a few npcs you can push around. If you move them into cut scenes they can make the cut scene 10x better
- ""funny how the older version of the cry engine almost seems better than the current."" is a thought that crossed my mind

Alot of things when compared to the original can look downgraded or just off, clouds are missing in the intro to mask the low detail in some distant scenery, this version is so PROUD of being a remaster it has to show the bad looking distant mountains, the original had more glossy nanosuits, in this one they have a matte look to them. The sunrise at the start of the game, something quite important to show the lightning at the time, was somehow messed up, and the sun just pops up so quick and it's bright daylight at in a moments notice, instead of a build up, everything the original did that was either clever or masked some shortcomings is gone or been ""updated"". At least the reflections use raytracing, there's a plus, GG guys.

For some reason there are also a ton bugs, AI is generaly dumber than the original, made alot of KPA friends along the way, seriously they just wouldn't shoot me, i would stay in front of them, and they would just look at me angry, it was hilarious. There was a funny bug were if i pressed the grenade button, the game would not let me reload my gun with the R key, i could'nt change my suit power either, wasn't able to interact with anything, just run and shoot, also don't run into the front of parked cars, you take damage. And worse yet i didn't have to try to find this stuff, i was just playing normally, i don't go looking for stuff to break, i wanted this thing to be good and working.

Like come on Crytek, you could have just patched the old engine to hyperthread and learn how to use more than one CPU thread, not even bothered to change the visuals, kept everything the same, and charged a $60 tag, i seriously wouldn't mind at all, i'm not joking, a $60 patch to fix something some intel dickhead speculated a decade ago to save us from the mess the old version is isn't a bad idea for me (seriously higher clock speeds intel? that was your ideal for the future. No wonder AMD is giving you guys a run for your money, that idiot made it to the lead of production on your hardware now and is trying to sink you guys hard), people could complain about pricing for a patch, hell i'd buy as many copies as i could, something that i always dreamed of is being able to run the old game without stutters or framedrops when the AI had to get to work. But then i heard it used the 360 port as a base, and boi using a console game as base to port over to pc was a scare, and it came out a mess, at least crytek bothered to patch and the game runs great on the hardware specified.

But you still dropped the ball there crytek, the human race was able to get Crysis running with decent framerates, but we had to sacrifice the rest of the body.",1649129817,1649129817,False,8,2,0.548894762992858887,0,True,False,False

If you are new to Crysis, I don't know whether or not to recommend this remaster to you. I'd prefer you to buy the original first. I still recommend this for those like me who enjoyed Crysis in the past and want to see a sort of facelift on it. I guess this is one of those cases where a neutral option would be nice...

Edit: I want to emphazise how unstable this game is. Sometimes the game runs like butter and then suddenly at around 30 fps in some scenarios. If you don't mind that, this is still an enjoyable game and worth visiting, whether it is the original or this remaster. Just be aware of the underlying problems and research your options carefully.

In reality im still mixed on this remaster. I still think its 2 steps forward 2 steps back. And unfortunately the game has received its last update...and im still finding bugs.
But I still love the game.



I hate to have to leave a negative review. I wanted to leave a mixed review.

Crysis 1 is my favorite of the Crysis games. Mainly because it offers more tactical options and control over how you approach objectives.
I waited a year for this remaster to get patched. Give them time to fix the shortcomings. It was on sale 50% off so may aswell get it now.

Crysis Remastered took some steps forward but some steps back.
When it comes to remasters on the pc its no secret that modders tend to do it first and better. Too often a remaster on pc is worse than the original. This is why i dont get hyped for remasters.

I play Crysis 1 with Crysis HD Textures 2018 mod. Makes the game look good while keeping the aesthetics.
Crysis Remastered...doesnt look that good to me. Nothing about it wowed me. 
Maximum speed seems to be broken. 
There was a secret shortcut i used in a stage that seems to have been patched out for no good reason since it was a logical shortcut...
And when i started noticing more and more of the flaws i decided to refund it.

I own the original trilogy on Origin/EA Desktop. I enjoy all of them. I will just play those.

When the entire remastered trilogy comes to Steam i may get that bundle a few years from now. No rush really.

- Some bugs make the game outright unplayable, like losing the ability to perform any actions like switching weapons or picking up items midway through the game. The game also frequently hangs when a level has loaded 100%. Mouse movement also doesn't work for the VTOL mission, meaning you literally cannot play the game pass the VTOL mission if you don't have a controller, and even then, the controls on the gamepad are horrible, and even still bug out sometimes, where the left stick would stop working altogether. This is after the patch that was said to fix most of the issues. 
- It looks worse despite using the improved engine with a bunch of new graphical features, looking over-saturated and contrasty. 
- They removed the ability to save manually, so you'll have to rely on autosaves. 
- Ammo in your gun counts towards your total ammo, which didn't happen before. This doesn't make sense, the magazine in the gun isn't in my pocket, so why the change? In fact, if you empty your magazine by 1 round, you can pick up 1 additional round. This makes zero sense. 
- The new suit mode sucks, but at least they let you switch back to the old mode. 
- I can't figure out what is causing my performance to drop so badly despite the settings being similar to the old Crysis. 

If all this game did was add higher res textures, SMAA, TAA, DLSS, and Raytracing, that would have been at least a half-decent 'enhanced' edition, which when combined with the discount for existing Crysis owners would be fine. Then they could have thought of extras like recorded playback, crosshair customization, an FOV slider, and maybe even co-op campaign, and that would have been a good remaster. 

It's amazing how they instead managed to make the game worse. I literally have never had such a frustration experience trying to play a game in my life.

I played Crysis the first time around and thoroughly enjoyed it; at the time it strained my state-of-the-art PC, but it seldom bugged and almost never crashed. I saw the remaster and thought I'd give it a go on my modern state-of-the-art PC and  RTX card. 

What a mistake, what an utter waste of money, I do not have words (that aren't expletives) to describe how flawed and unplayable this piece crap is: 

Die - Game crashes to desktop.

Get a vehicle stuck - Game crashed to desktop.

Load the last checkpoint - see what weapons you have, because you probably lost some (or at one point ALL of them - commence sneak punching KPA to get weapons).

Hide behind tree/rock/etc to avoid grenade - see if this works or you die (roughly 60/40 in favour of death).

Take massive enemy fire from multiple targets with minor damage OR get insta-killed from full health by one guy with an assault rifle from 150 metres. 

Use binoculars to try to tag enemies you can see VISUALLY and they fail highlight or to appear on tactical.

Hold Space to power jump (even with full energy and not in combat)  - see if you will actually jump or just face plant into the landscape (roughly 50/50).
After power jump in combat - float uselessly though the air, defying gravity, hoping that if you miss the landing it won't take too long for you to drift back to the ground while taking fire and unable to do much about it. 
After power jump landing -  remember to release and re-press the sprint key you were using before you jumped, or you just amble through enemy fire.

[h1] [b] Review recount of the 2007 Crysis [/b] [/h1]
I originally played and reviewed Crysis in 2016, on some PC that included a GTX 560 Ti. For those interested, the link to the original is here: https://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/recommended/17300?snr=1_5_9__402

For the time, I thought Crysis was an enjoyable experience but could not play it on Ultra without performance issues. Have a look at my (back in the day) rating system, below.

        [td]Overall[/td]
        [td]8.25/10[/td]
    [/tr]
[/table]

These ratings were based on a couple of key things from my original play, including:
[list][*]Campaign: ‘’The campaign [was] a great example of a story that starts slow, but builds to a climax. The setting of being on one island suggests a limited campaign, however, the great areas…on the island and in the island create a new variety of missions’’.
[*]Gameplay: “The gameplay is fluid and solid…[and] driving is a nice feature but clunky as the vehicle is very sensitive to player controls…[and] the issues I encountered…is the lack of ammo for an American gun and the very small variety of overall guns in the game”.
[*]AI: ‘’The main disturbance…is the sheer stupidity of AI. Some enemies would run in circles while ally team mates would be useless in completing objectives[.]’’[/list]
[h1] [b] What about Crysis: Remastered? [/b] [/h1]
The above is still fairly accurate, noting in the Remastered version that:
[list][*]The campaign features a nice and tight storyline and finishes really well, but I now think the North Korean invasion component was rushed and could have been fleshed out. I also found it a poor design choice that your allies are mostly unhelpful in the missions. 
[*]The AI is still really poor. They are still terribly accurate in their aiming and are still very glitchy, noting multiple times of enemies running into invisible walls, bunching together (i.e., in a doorway), and not reacting to the shooting and going into cover.[/list]
That said, Crysis: Remastered is sold on updated visuals and technological features and is optimised to current hardware. Playing on a PC with a i5-6600k, GTX 1070, and 16GB ram, I found the Remastered was optimised extremely well and I did not experience any framerate or stability (e.g., crashes) issues. The overall graphical fidelity is a broad improvement on the original and the Lingshan Island is still a beautiful sight, credited to an updated lighting system. 

While the graphics are broadly improved, the Remastered did not update all assets and objects (i.e., bag in opening scene, some characters), and therefore, the textures on these are disappointingly low-resolution and blurry. I am also surprised to find a number of bugs throughout my experience, including, but not limited to, the aforementioned AI scripting, as well as constant sound drop-outs during missions and the AI boss fight not triggering in the final mission, requiring a level restart(!).

[h1] [b] Conclusion on Crysis: Remastered [/b] [/h1]
I commend the legacy of Crysis I, and Crysis: Remastered is a nice trip down to memory lane, particularly in a nice campaign. But I am conflicted because the Remastered version was not overly a good experience. It adds a nice overall graphical upgrade and performance optimisation is fantastic (and I will note Patch 3 further optimises it), but it falls in several areas. 

First, it does not address issues from the original game such as AI scripting and if that is not fixable, I appreciate that. It is also unfortunate that the visual improvement does not impact all assets, resulting in a number of low-resolution characters and objects, and there are a high number of bugs and glitches throughout the game. On this basis, I do not recommend Crysis: Remastered.

The game gives you the option to play with either the old crysis nano suit controlls or the ones familiar from crysis 2 and crysis 3. I havent tested the new ones and mainly have been playing with the original options. 

I can recommend the game. Though if you have the original game it might not be worth buying.

The original game takes place through the eyes of a elite soldier nicknamed 'Nomad', a member of a U.S. elite military group named 'Raptor Team' sent on a hostage extraction mission on Lingshan islands after the U.S. archaeologists have made a world-changing discovery that is undergoing siege by the Koreans. Nomad, alongside with his colleagues, is equipped with the state of the art 'nanosuit', a exo skeleton that is designed to give soldiers a upper hand in every situation with unique abilities that makes them superhuman. The mission goes awry at the very start after your colleague was kidnapped and later found slaughtered alongside Koreans by a mysterious entity that later on is identified as a otherworldly organism named 'Ceph' with the mission of conquering the planet. It us up to Nomad to rescue the archaeologists and fight his way through war with the Koreans and the Ceph.

The original game was way ahead of its time with its beautiful graphics, outstanding lore and unique gameplay style that surpasses most games made today. It is a unique experience where you can do anything, the map is not designed linearly which allows the players to roam and do whatever they want. The soundtrack, the AI, the physics and much more are all beautifully made that gives lots of replayability as you can approach the game from any way, be it a silent sniper, onepunch man, rambo, there are always new ways to play the game. The characters are all unique with distinct personalities with lots of lore to each one, the nanosuit that makes us look cool and makes us feel powerful, the tank battles, the dogfights(aircraft fight) are all super fun and unique. The addition of mods just puts the cherry on top, with the large community designing new maps, new graphical mods and even a brand new game for the engine that the game is running on allows for many new opportunities which is why the original game is so beloved.

That being said, after the massive success over the years, Crytek decided to remaster the game, improving the already beautiful graphics, unnecessarily bringing over the suit modes from Crysis 2 and 3 which personally I favor but there are lots of people disappointed, since you are always stuck in power mode contrary to the 2007 version where the default was armor mode. Apart from the graphics, there isn't really much more added in the remaster. There are no new weapons, no new attachments, no new hostiles, no new areas to explore, no new missions, it is simply a graphical overhaul mod made by the original developers. Performance wise, to get over 100 fps you would have to lower the settings to low or medium as the improved graphics also take a toll on the GPU, and that makes the game unpleasant to look at the mass amount of jagged edges. The highest difficulty setting isn't that much of a challenge, the secondary objectives have no impact on the game, the AI sometimes doesn't behave as expected, they all negatively impact the game and make you question the whole remaster deal. The only better thing is the graphics at high settings, they look amazing, however, you would need to invest in a decent GPU as even the better GPU's struggle to run at the max settings.
I personally only enjoyed it as I am a huge Crysis fan, I am addicted to the amazing lore of the game and would like to take a different approach to the game after many years of not playing. 

Conclusion, I enjoyed Crysis as a way to experience the nostalgia and would recommend to play it, however, the remastered aspect is nonexistent, it is only made to test the developers graphical work. If you can get it for a lower price, the remastered is a good game but it is still disappointing, all the effort put into graphics are laid to waste as most people can't run the game with high settings with decent framerate.

I love this game but to be honest, this remastered has lot's of bugs.

I suggest you guys to play original Crysis, which released in 2008, not this remastered. I called this game Crypunk 2077.

What makes it even more insulting is that Crytek seems to lean hard on the ""Can it run Crysis??"" meme to the point where they're blatantly sending the message of ""it's not meant to be optimized lul join NASA if you want to run this with a smooth framerate"".

This remaster is a huge missed opportunity and I can't recommend it - even with the discount for previous Crysis owners.

I hope that Tim Sweeney exclusivity money was worth it Saber\Crytek.

[quote]Edit - post Feb 8th 2022 patch:
So this has finally received a performance patch which really seemed to bring optimization to acceptable levels. It's definitely a huge improvement and is now worthwhile if you can get this in the appropriate price.

However, this has been through a year of Epic exclusivity (which is still a crappy move btw) and been on Steam for 5 months. Why did it take this long to make a remaster of a near 15 years old game perform reasonably well?
I still think how Crytek and Saber handled this release (and by extension, the franchise's fans) deserves getting called out.
You have fixed the most glaring issue, your remaster is now more than just a ""look guiz it has raytracing now!"" fart in the wind.
Sucks that quicksaves are gone though.

...Anyway, I suppose this is the point where I'm supposed to give this a thumbs up now?
Sorry, but this positive review is locked behind an undetermined period of Epic Sweeney Coin exclusivity.
Maybe I'll fix it in a year and 5 months.
Maybe not.

As soon as you come across the first building the game literally shits itself and performance is in the teens. I went from around 100fps(Although it didn't feel smooth) to 15fps. This was 1080p, max settings(Ray tracing and VSync off). I lowered everything and got 25fps. How in the hell can a game be so badly optimized?!

It's a damn shame because I was getting into this game. On launch of the original game I remember this wasn't the best game around in terms of gameplay, gunplay world building or story but more a big tech demo for the CryEngine. It was the best looking game on the market for about ten years after and still, to this day, gives a lot of modern games a run for it's money in terms of how good it looks. But playing this remaster now and compared to the crap that has been released in the last few years that's saturated uninspired copy and paste game design I was actually enjoying this. It felt somewhat fresh being in a semi-open world game with tools at your disposal to play how you wanted to play and tackle objectives how you wanted to. It even got me pumped for Crysis 4 in the hopes they would go back to their roots and try a no BS open world game that doesn't force you to climb towers to view the world map or collect collectibles as side quests(Because these days collectibles are considered entire fucking side quests... Incredibly original game design from Triple Ayyy studios /s).

I literally had to uninstall the game because it runs like utter crap. There's no way this should run as bad as it does. It's not even pushing the envelope in graphical fidelity. The physics engine is probably the exact same physics engine and version used in the original game in 2007, the HAVOC physics engine. HAVOC was ahead of it's time and it was a great physics engine but it was incredibly demanding. Now we have good physics engines that don't hobble performance. All I can think is the reason behind the performance drops for myself is the fact the buildings in view are straining the engine because of the physics engine. It still is incredibly good physics. You do not get this level of physics in any game released today even Frostbyte engine when it was top of it's game in Battlefield 1. The physics in this game calculates the weight, length, stress of structures and gives a realistic enough response when you remove supports from walls or roofs. It's still good but surely some sort of optimization could have been done here to fix performance and make the game playable? I refuse to believe they couldn't have done something 15 years later to improve performance in these instances.

I would probably give the game a sideways thumb if I could, since there are aspects both better and worse than the original, but considering owners of the original can get a pretty good discount it's worthwhile if you can get it cheap.

There are definitely some visual aspects that look a bit nicer. It's not revelatory but the new reflection effects to make certain things pop a bit better and I've always been of the opinion some of the original game's textures looked a bit over-sharpened, which the new volumetric fog smooths over nicely. The raytracing is pretty tasteful and in-line with the original art direction without being overdone, and there's some cool uses of it, such as being able to see your own reflection when you pick up a CRT Television. 

Character models seem largely the same but again, the facial textures don't seem as overdone on the sharpness filter and faces are a bit nicer to look at in general. For some reason the original Crysis didn't have anti-aliasing which struck me as odd even at the time given the game's intent of having every graphical technology under the sun. The blues and greens of the island seem to pop more as well, which is very pretty to look at and the water in particular looks great.

What is disappointing is that the Godrays seem toned down compared to the original. The scene in the first part where you finally step out onto the beach at sunrise was not only an iconic moment of the game, but a historic moment in game history itself that said ""This is what games are gonna look like in 5 years"" and the lighting just felt toned down here compared to the original which made that bit lose some of its edge. So while I do like a lot of what the remaster does, it's not a complete upgrade. 

Performance seems fine, but admittedly I'm running the game on the deliberately absurd ""Can it Run Crysis?"" mode, which on my 3090 tends to hover around 50fps which is pretty playable. I'm sure if I dialed it down to something more normal I would get a great framerate but my Tim Allen-like desire for MORE POWER UGH UGH UGH prevents me from setting my games to anything less than the maximum, and frankly if the newest edition of Crysis runs smoothly on Max it means that either it's time for a new Crysis or that society has come too far.

The default control scheme in this remastered edition is also [i]bizarre[/i]. Thankfully you can more or less set everything to how it was in the original but the default setting makes the game way more awkward to play. They tried to streamline the suit controls by basically having the powers activate when you do an action that can use that particular power. So for example, if you hold the jump or throw buttons you can do a ""strength jump"" or ""strength throw"". It works fine for the suit and cloaking (which is just the e key), but every time you sprint the suit goes into speedmode which wastes precious suit energy and it doesn't seem to let you just do a normal sprint. The streamlined controls worked in [i]Crysis 2[/i] and 3 because the whole game design was pared down for a more consolized experience, but trying to put a consolized control scheme in what is otherwise an unchanged full-fledged tactical PC shooter is just a mess of a default to ship the game with.

The placement of the hotkeys also means that the lean keys are mapped to T and H by default which is wildly inconvenient and I personally feel that making the deliberate choice of suit mode before jumping into combat was a deliberate part of the tactical considerations the original game wanted you to make rather than being able to just have everything at the press of a button. Again, you can set things back to how they originally were, and I get the feeling the streamlined setup was meant for the console ports then somehow got backported onto PC, but the default binds make the game significantly more clunky for no reason and deeply uncomfortable to try and use in combat. There's a weird weapon select menu if you press the 6 key which is absolutely [i]absurd[/i] but thankfully the original weapon switch keys are normal by default as well. That said though, the quick tips never change based on what your key setting are, so you might have the game telling you to press a button you mapped to something else, which feels unpolished.

Once you get over the jank of trying to remap the controls though, [i]Crysis[/i] is still as fun as ever. The game was derided by some at the time as a mere tech demo, but I find myself coming back to it again and again over the years even after the visuals begin to look dated in spots (and the original still mostly looks amazing). It's a true tactical sandbox, and while the game isn't ""open world"", each level is wide enough that you can approach from any direction and really get creative with how you want to handle a scenario. See a vehicle you like? Jump in and rampage through town. While there have been other sandbox shooters since, like the various [i]Far Cry[/i] sequels (and keep in mind [i]Crysis[/i] was the follow-up to [i]Far Cry[/i] 1, before Ubisoft took that series in a different direction), [i]Crysis[/i] and the [i]Stalker[/i] series are the only big ones that really do it this well. Your suit is powerful, but it won't compensate for bad decisions and the level design is just great. I do agree with the general consensus that the last quarter of the game isn't as good as the first due to a shift in the enemies you fight, but it's still fun. The gameplay feels pretty much the same, one or two weapons seem to have a punchier sound effect, but it's still the same old [i]Crysis[/i] and you don't have to twist my arm to much to get me on a new playthrough.

While [i]Crysis Remastered[/i] isn't perfect, it certainly isn't a [i]Crisis[/i] either. The visual refreshes are interesting enough to be worth going through again and I wouldn't be surprised if someone either mods the remaster to have the better aspects of the original, or ports stuff from the remaster into the original. It is a pretty glaring omission that they left out the [i]Warhead[/i] expansion which is fantastic in its own right, but it's nice to see [i]something[/i] being done with the series.  If you've never played the original, I'd again recommenced the original, but if you're already a fan and looking for something new, it's not a bad way to kill a few days.",1642533660,1642562180,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Manometer: 7/10[/b]


The good
- Gorgeous graphics ahead of its time. In this remastered version it has become even better with high resolution textures and revised atmospheric lighting.
- Great physics that were innovative for back then. You can interact, shoot, throw or shatter almost everything in a very convincing way. After a battle has finished, the landscape will be absolutely destroyed. A feature that even new games miss.
- Well paced battles with many things happening simultaneously. Good immersion level at a war situation.
- Gameplay allows you to choose between various approaches, either more tactical or entirely destructive. Cloak and shield powers of nanosuit are good additions that give the gameplay extra depth.
- Awesome survival atmosphere. Some parts have a weird dark, terrifying feeling. After a certain point it gets surreal and artistic.
- Fantastic sound design. Both environmental and battles' design feels natural and rich of sounds. Surround is well implemented and helps you understand enemies' direction.
- Interesting music that fits perfectly in each situation and gives an extra boost to the atmosphere.
- Nice animations especially at enemy creatures and at the protagonist's hands.
- It is very cinematic for its age. Great direction and camera movement with some nice timed events and special effects. Cool cut scenes too.
- You can drive a boat, a hummer, a tank and even fly an airplane.
- The story has a cliché beginning but after the middle it offers some interesting twists. It is still simplistic but descent enough for this king of shooter.
- It is well balanced. Normal difficulty will challenge you without being too hard.

The bad
- Navigation mechanics and interaction commands are not very responsive. Constant small glitches here and there (e.g. when crouching) will sometimes ruin the pace and the vibe you are into.
- Big loading screens and bad optimization for a game that old. You have to enable vsynch, otherwise the game will roast your cpu.
- Mediocre enemies' AI. Sometimes they react very slowly and others they run towards you instead of covering.
- Small variety of weapons and even fewer weapons' upgrades.
- You cannot save whenever you want. Sometimes there is a long distance to cover between two autosave points.
- The map is bad and most things on it are indistinguishable.
- The control mechanics of the airplane part are poorly implemented. Frustrating.
- It has small duration and abrupt ending. In fact there is no ending. I didn't like this weird final boss battle too.",1640495332,1640495367,True,1,1,0.496580928564071655,0,True,False,False

They had a fantastic PC game. A masterpiece. They didn't use it. They used the console version. It looks worse. It plays worse. The performance is low. The bugs high. The AI is broken.

This version feels like a joke. Big difference.

*Some bugs fixed and some additions have been made.
*Couple additions gaved some taste of course.
*Graphics are still but can it run crysis xd
*I already love crysis storyline , playing again gaved me nostalgia

it is not expensive and crytek gives %50 discount pretty much everytime as well,
I hope they made these remastered versions to gain some head start for new game development,
I know crytek knows how to make games but i think we can see crysis 4 finaly coming out soon hopefully.
This is the first game of the serie, So you should deff play it and then contunie with others,
Game deserves pretty much 10£ easy...
It take me 7 hours the finish the game but i prett much know everything so i kinda rushed

However, as far as remasters go, this one is very disappointing. Ignoring the change of aesthetics at times, all of the issues with very much a junky AI are still here. The sound is as terrible as it ever was, with many sound glitches still present. And that horrible, directionless voice acting.... god, don't even get me started (""Perfect!"" says Nomad happily, when it's supposed to be sarcastic ""Perfect..."", as implied by the situation and subtitles... ugh).

Anyway, graphics are still good, with occasional low-resolution textures, that have been carried from the original. The first Crysis always has been somewhat of a graphics demo, with everything else playing second fiddle and being just ""acceptable"" enough to pass. Sadly, with a move away from a limiting (in terms of lighting) forward rendering and modern techniques like Crytek's exceptional implementation of SVOGI, advanced ambient occlusion, and rework of materials to properly handle reflective surfaces, AND with raytraced reflections on top of it, one would hope that Crysis, stripped of its original limitations would be able to shine, once again. And while it's true that the number of vertices the engine can push at times is mindblowing, a lot of it is processing power wasted. The new tech works and it works great in interiors and areas with indirect lighting. But in an ironic twist, with all of the changes to aesthetics and the massive amount of geometry added, Saber - for whatever reason - opted out not to add and rework details in places, where that difference would be most noticeable, while simultaneously adding it in places, where performance might be precisely the heaviest, while at the same time, the graphical difference being the smallest. Working in game dev and being limited to DX11, taught me to be very careful with the number of objects used and to always look for a way to limit the number of draw calls, so I find it absurd that one of the first things done by Crytek / Saber duo, was adding a massive amount of foliage and additional objects, while simultaneously keeping it rendered in DX11 with interop with Vulkan only for rendering pass. This resulted in the game, in which performance is very much dependent on a single thread (again!) and where the rest of the threads barely does any work (again!). Worse yet, the raytracing is heavily limited, as it pretty much never reflects any characters or even physics objects (aside from the Nomad itself and that is only if you push Model detail to High... which is the same freakin' setting that affects the number of draw calls and will hit you the heaviest, even if you disable raytracing!). 

So, again - do I recommend Remastered? Only if you haven't yet played original Crysis. Cause despite my rant above, I think it is still an improved version of the original. Problem is, with how high original Crysis has set up the bar in terms of graphics, and how low it was in terms of pretty much everything else, it's disappointing to see remaster only lightly push it in terms of graphics and pretty much leave everything that was laying on the ground floor in 2007 as it was. This game needed a serious upgrade in terms of character models, character animations, sound, AI, and gameplay mechanics - and they've pretty much stayed as they ever were - on a ""just good enough"" level... for 2007.",1638716788,1638716788,False,66,4,0.824729681015014648,0,True,False,False

Öncelikle oyunun kendinden biraz bahsedelim, yaklaşık 5 saat civarında süren hikayesiyle, serinin diğer oyunlarına kıyasla özgür yapısıyla, çıktığı yıl için grafikleriyle (orijinal versiyonu için söylüyorum), hikayesiyle, oynanışıyla falan oldukça güzel bir oyundu. Kesinlikle oynanması gereken yapımlardan birisi. 
Bir de elimizde remastered versiyonu var... Evet görsel olarak bir şeyler değişmiş ancak optimizasyon hala daha leş, fizik olarak gerilemeler mevcut; internetten orijinal ve remastered versiyonlarının karşılaştırmalarından görebilirsiniz, çokça bug mevcut, yapay zeka bir tuhaf ve en kötülerinden birisi: manual save kaldırılmış. Bu gerçekten kötü olmuş, en azından benim için öyle. Otomatik kayıt sistemine muhtaç kalıyorsunuz ve o da bazen saçma sapan mesafelerden alabiliyor kayıtı. 
Yine de en azından fiyat bakımından iyi, özellikle benim gibi Steam üzerinden eski Crysis oyunlarına sahipseniz ekstra bir indirim mevcut oluyor, yani indirimde olsa bile ekstra bir indirim daha uygulanıyor. İndirimlerde 25TL olan oyunu sadece 10TL'ye aldım. Oyun da zaten bildiğimiz gibi, güzel bir oyun.
Her şeye rağmen satın almanızı tavsiye ederim, 25TL bile verilebilir, ancak remastered olarak pek de ""remastered"" olmadığını söylemem lazım. Gerçi bu gözler GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition gördükten sonra buna bile razı oluyor.",1638652255,1638652255,True,3,2,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

There are a number of features that are straight up missing that makes the first game more fun, biggest offenders being modding support and quicksaves. No leaning is not gone, it's just set to a really shitty bind by default. Outside that, the game's art style has also changed to something a lot more vibrant ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2604755659]although that's pretty easy to fix[/url]). The game also seems to nerf strength mode and speed mode even in classic mode. 

Only real improvements made to the game are optimization (though it doesn't feel like it once you set everything to very high), and the removal of SecuRom. Honestly I'd prefer if Crytek changed the Steam client of Crysis to the one they sell on GOG instead of spending all this time on an inferior port. Overall, I'd only recommend this game if you're a die hard Crysis fan that wants to see some extra eye candy. $15 isn't too bad of a price for this game, but I personally would not pay a penny more than that. If you don't have the first game, I highly recommend it still, just get it from GOG instead and play with mods.

Honestly I'm open to changing this review but only if strength and speed mode are reverted, gameplay changes like trees not breaking from punches are fixed, color settings and times of day are reverted to what they were in the first game, modding support is added, Warhead is included in the game, and further optimizations are made for multithreaded cpus.

This release of the game is currently the only version on PC with achivments witch is a huge win in my books however i did have  a minnor bug with the game awarding me with a random achivment when I started my new playthough

I never played the original game, and that may not help my case as well. But, the idea and the point they were trying to make was a success. The story line/plot was a little bit confusing for me at least and the fact the enemies could detect me from a mile a way in a bush was crazy. (Spoilers after this point, if you would even call them that) In one of the missions, you needed to fly a VTOL aircraft and transport a civilian and such, that was probably one of the worst experinces of a flying a vehicle I have ever had. I used a game pad instead of keyboard and mouse, and I had to use my thumb on the D-Pad (To go up and down) my pointer finger on my left joystick (To move) and the aircraft wouldn't just stay in the air you had to keep elevating it up or it would come crashing down. Also, it probably took me at least a half a hour alone to get through the tornadoes. ANYWAYS, good game if you are playing it for the story/plot (Like me, I have the other two games), but if you are trying to buy this game for its stealth, FPS, or to fly an aircraft?

For me the best part of the game was the story set pieces and amazing environments that this game has. It may not look that unique today but during the original release it may have blown people minds.
The game play on the other hand feels dated. The guns feel good, but the hit registration is weird, especially because there are no hit markers or distinct sound to make sure you are even hitting the enemy. Its just spray and hope you hit something. It made some gun fights really frustration, especially long range one. The movement also feels very dated.

Let's go through the list:

+ Graphics. The tropical island is even more beautiful, than before.
+ Optimisation. With Ryzen 7 5800X and RTX 3070, I had constant 60+ fps on screen on max settings. I only downgraded the shadows to medium - I won't see any difference and this parameter is one of the hungriest in open world.
+ Multiplayer. Removed. Good, unless it's Doom or Quake, MP isn't allowed.
+ Achievements had been added.

- Glitches. Meh, a few, mostly objects getting stuck in geometry and troopers getting stuck pretty much everywhere. Notorious bug of the last chapter - cannon missing or refusing to lock on the mothership - has been fixed.

In the end, I liked the Remaster as much as I liked original. Unfortunately, I enjoyed 2&3 more than the first one, so I won't stay in this game for long.

I have it now but would I suggest to anyone to get it mmmm I would have to say its kind of a tossup, for the updates and what they took away from this game I say get a decent graphics card and have some original game play fun. I base this on one other remasters game I picked up command and conquer, this game if you like this kind of game stays true to what the original game was. For ppl that say will it’s a more improved gave I would say in that case why not take you programing skills and come up with a new Crysis game.

I'm not normally one to ""get-into"" sci-fi type titles like this but yeah it's totally worth it. Sure there's tonnes of criticism from purists - but if you haven't experienced it then I suggest you do.

I really didn't like Far Cry 1 at launch or now, but this really takes the cake on everything that title should have been. There's rather unique concepts such as the nanosuit, a range of  limited but effective weapons. Overall it's a very polished experience such as reflects gaming around the time of release.

CR installed with NP, but does not load properly; frequently hanging up at the ""when you see this icon the game is saving; press enter to continue"" screen--never getting to the main menu so I can continue my game (or start a new one if I wanted to).  This morning not only was CR repeatedly hanging at that screen, but when it did finish loading it was the Italian version of the game (despite my having set it up for English during initial set up)!   I was able to reset my language preference to English both times it did this, but this technical issue is ridiculous.  Once in game the audio is glitched in that the ambient ocean/waves crashing sound (omnipresent on the first couple of game segments) is picket fencing like crazy; as is some of the NPC dialogue.  I use an RGB Razer mouse and the game disrupts the RGB profile set for it; causing the mouse to rapidly flash random colors!  This instantly stops and my mouse returns to the correct RGB profile when I quit out of CR.  Sometimes it runs smoothly and some times it has a bad case of video stutters and stammers.  CR looks good at very high settings (when its running smoothly), and would be a good value at $23.00+, but not in it's current ill performing state.

The answer on this remaster is from my point of view very debatable. Because all Crytek did here is pull the same stuff, try to make the game as heavy and hardware dependend as they could, ending with the fact that you would need a beast of a PC to run this game with all the gimmicks like raytracing and stuff... All adding to a rather dissapointing experience even for people with a decent rig.

So in a short conclusion: if you have an older pc stick to the original. You can even ask the same question if you have a newer system, should I buy it? Can I run it? (Well I doubt it...)

I can only imagine how awesome this game was back in the day (if you had the hardware to run it). Sadly, I didn’t and I never played it back then, even though I would have loved to. Playing this game now for the first time puts the rest of the series into context for me. I understand the other games better and the series, as a whole, makes more sense. I like the visuals in this remaster and I love how surreal it feels to play an old game that's been cleaned up a bit. The game looks great to me and I think it’s a fantastic mix between old and new aesthetics. I tried to play OG Crysis here on Steam a while ago but I couldn’t enjoy it. I did manage to get it working to some degree on Windows 10 but there was no proper controller support. The performance of this remaster is totally fine and the proper controller support is really what made the game accessible for me... finally. I also got it for a great price because I already owned the original here on Steam, so what is there to complain about?

Crysis is a lot of fun to play, it’s like a military sandbox simulator with crazy Koreans and science fiction elements. I always liked the idea in the Crysis sequels, of fighting the soldiers first and then changing things up, to fight the aliens for the second half of the game. Playing through the remaster let me experience that idea in it’s first iteration. Which in-turn made me appreciate the sequels even more and what they were trying to achieve. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2615217603

The hardest difficulty setting (Delta) is great because it makes the game more immersive, without becoming annoying (except for the final boss). It’s really cool to actually need to use the suit powers and environmental cover while taking head-shots and feeling like a bad-ass ninja. There are some cool details on the hardest difficulty too like having to listen for grenades without HUD markers. While the human enemies only speak Korean which makes it harder to determine what they are doing.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2619720942

Where as the rest of the game is totally fine, the final boss is a fucking pain in the ass, on the hardest difficulty setting. Crysis is a lot of fun, just like the sequels and on the harder difficulty settings it’s even more fun, with the only exception to this being the god damn final boss. Which required me to die a lot and come up with a crazy trial and error strategy. There is also a fairly crappy level where you have to fly an aircraft and the controls are pretty bad but it’s actually not too difficult, once you get used to it. 

Crysis Remastered is also a relatively easy and fun game to get 100% achievements on (again with the exception of the final boss). A couple of the more advanced achievements are fairly bugged though, such as the ones for completing the game on the harder difficulties. It’s do-able but they are a bit janky and you need to work around this. Anyway.. this remaster made this fantastic game accessible to me, playing with a controller on Windows 10, for a very low price. 

I really enjoyed it and I highly recommend that you play it too!

The most glaring issues appear immediately, half of the textures do not even load in so you are surrounded by white and light blue assets around the map. The only way to see where you are going is if you go invisible, for some reason the textures only load in when you are invisible. When the textures work the graphics look amazing, but you will rarely get a time where something isn't fucked up. 

The audio is atrocious, half the time there will be random non synced audio when characters are talking or random pieces of soldier dialogue playing in the wrong ear.  

For $30 bucks as the current asking price I would recommend staying away. Luckily the game was on sale and I got it in the hunt showdown bundle which I already owned, so I spent around $14 on this game and I am not as disappointing as I would have been spending double. 

Either way, the original game which hides beneath the atrocity Crytek is trying to call a remaster is a solid 9/10, but since I am rating this mess it pains to me not recommend it and give it a 5/10.

It's fun to take a step back in time to experience one of the games that had a major impact on modern gaming, things like stealth kills are missing, there is no stupid ""crafting"" systems forced in, all progress is done simply by playing the story.

The open-ended yet ""on rails"" mission design is fantastic, I wish the modern Far Cry games would take a note from Crysis when it comes to this. Open world is fun to screw around in, but guided missions are much better for story telling.

The story itself was a pretty decent sci-fi, there is no forced romance or crappy plot written in. The characters are all fairly generic but that doesn't matter when you're sprinting at MAXIMUM SPEED to neck-slam a bunch of North Korean invaders.",1633193678,1633193678,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It runs, unlike the original which had to be tricked into thinking it's running on an FX processor to make it run on a Ryzen this one just works.
It looks ok, comparable to the first imo. Didn't put them side by side but it gives the same look and feel imo (no RayTracing active so no idea there, not on an RTX GPU).
The levels were not changed all that much, which is a good thing, plenty of other remasters/remakes tend to change level design for the worse (make levels more linear, remove stuff, etc).
The aim mode and crouch/prone are both hold and toggle at the same time which is kinda neat: if you hold aim it will go out of ADS once you let go, but if you just tap it once it will toggle on/off.

Cons:
Sometimes sounds cut out or in sharply, and here I mean stuff like combat music and so on. The sound for single/auto fire for some weapons is completely different, as if they forgot to update it for both fire modes (one is new, the other is the old one). Tap firing a weapon very quickly while it's in full auto will make the sound of the gun cut out and go silent while you keep tap firing, this only happens in full auto mode, you can tap fire away in single.
Quite buggy imo, things in the distance disappear quite quickly for me, helicopters are not visible more than 100m or so away, boats and even terrain objects like rocks behave the same. To be fair this may just be the LOD settings it applied automatically, speaking of which it put EVERYTHING on low on a gtx 1080 (the recommended is a 1660 Ti, so that's odd). At my settings (all on low, with textures on high), at 1440p it had anywhere between 90 and 120 FPS, usually stayed at 105-ish (on a Ryzen 7 2700x and gtx 1080 for reference).
Continuing the bug trend and avoiding spoilers: a specific enemy that has to be killed as a mission objective glitched out and was stuck under the floor, rendering it unkillable, loading a checkpoint did not work as he was already spawned and in the floor, will soon see if restarting the level fixes it. Which brings us to the next point, an autosave system has replaced the combo manual saves+autosaves that existed previously. Flexibility has been traded for ease of implementation as I see no other reason for this choice. A manual save system would allow both for replaying certain points in a mission if that's what you wish and for bypassing some of these bugs without having to restart the mission (as mentioned, sometimes the checkpoint is too close and you have to reload farther back).

So is it worth it? I think that if I knew all this I would've just reinstalled the old one and got a patch or something to get it working, and then wait for this to be fixed. When the bugs are gone maybe it'll be worth it, but until then, nah, even with a sale and as part of a bundle I felt like I should've bought a pizza with that money, would've had more fun playing the old one while eating it.",1632994032,1632994032,False,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

EDIT: well it seems it's still possible to get the bugged achievement by deleting the save file, starting a new game and trying again.

So now I can finally review the actual game: so what can I say about the remaster, is it really that bad? Well I am not sure as I haven't played the original for many years. 
So basically the remaster mostly just ""updates"" the graphics + adds the option to play with the new suit mode from Crsis 2 and 3.
But from what I know from comparison videos it seems that some stuff got objectively better, but also some stuff objectively worse and then one big part which is basically a matter of taste, namely the very saturated and ""colorful new style"". It seems the original game had more like a realistic look but honestly I couldn't remember that and the remaster looked from the style just how I think I remember it and personally I don't mind this look at all. Maybe it's less realistic but I do think that it just looks better. Just the island part with palms, beaches and the water just looks great.

How is the performance:
Again, I don't really remember my performance with the old game but for remaster it was pretty good on medium settings but even on high settings the performance wasn't satisfying for me (40 fps and below).

And to be fair, I mainly just grabbed the remaster because it had achievements lol.
Overall I guess the remaster is worth it for you if you never played the og game, or just want to play it with achievements or are just a big fan of the game without the biggest expectations  for the remaster.

Fun and easy game to 100% on a single playthrough providing you play on the harder difficulties. I ran on very high settings with a 3070ti and 5800x CPU and framerate was much better with DLSS albeit still not smooth outdoors but definetly didnt ruin the experience. 

outdoor visuals are amazing and the most impressive you will find is with the jungle foliage and lighting. Ray tracing only works for reflections which is disappointing as its not actual RTX.

Overall, happy with the purchase and was a good benchmark for my new build but I still consider Crysis 2 the superior game due to the story, music and gunplay.

I don't know why people are like 'wHaT iS tHiS! 0rIgıNAl WaS PErfeCt', I know original is perfect ,had nice graphics, smooth controls and all but Original is capped to 50 fps! for me this was the turning point. I played Remastered on 75 refresh rate and it was an awesome experience. I played Remastered on High graphics by the way. 1920x1080,75 refresh rate/hz and FULL ON HIGH anti-aliasing! Graphics are beyond what I've ever imagined for a REMASTER!  I literally played my childhood/teenager era game on todays graphics with enchanced lighting and all the other graphics I've mentioned above! Nothing can top this for me. Thank You Crytek and Saber Interactive for making this Remastered. Thank you all for your time. I hope you got a better economic outcome than you expected. Only con(-) I can say is where is Crysis Warhead Remastered? I really enjoyed playing C:Warhead.

Why bother revisiting Crysis? Aside from the obvious monetary incentives, what more was there for Crytek to really do with it? It doesn't seem like they made a particularly sincere effort to revitalise the game as it stands here, more-over just introducing a less buggy and somewhat more nuanced version of it: new nano-suit functionality and better optimisation on the whole. That's not to say it works entirely, there's still a great deal of bugs and the hardest difficulty seems, as times, pointlessly hard (with the checkpoint system doing absolutely nothing to better the matter). On top of that, they removed the multiplayer, Warhead is missing and you don't get the slick little map editor that came along with the original too.

But, it's good fun to come back here. At the discount price I got it for (first week and with Hunt), I feel more than fine with the amount of money that I put down on it. But, at £24.99, I can't really recommend. This game easily shows its age and for all the memorable set pieces, still feels half-baked without that nostalgia factor. I had a good time for the 7 hours it took to 100% this game on the hardest difficulty, but that's mainly due to it being a trip down memory lane. More than anything, it took me back to memories of early Crytek, Far Cry and the sense of expanse and open worlds in first-person shooters that would become massively popular in the mid-late 2010s. It's still here, but it's a lot more rudimentary and ultimately, Crysis feels dated in a bad way, at times.

TL;DR - buy it on sale if you loved the original. Don't buy at full price if you're new to the franchise or just wanting to play. You're better off modding the original.",1632396477,1632396477,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I remember it being super demanding back then. Now for the remastered version. This game is much more optimized. The graphical improvements are good if I say. Yeah the classic Crysis had this realistic less colorful vibe. That looked good no doubt. The remaster has more color in it. It still looks good. Actually doesn't look bad at all. Especially with all the ray tracing. But it didn't feel like a 2020 game to me. The visual quality of the remastered version looks more like it would be a game from 2014-15. I played straight for almost 9 hours. Finished the game in one run. It was fun. I liked most of it except the gun play feels a bit old and outdated. You could feel it that the firing mechanism is not on par with current gen games. They could've improved that. Also the AI was not that good. Weapon animations looks old. Stealth in this game is only for the name. It's impossible to go total stealth with Crysis. But the gun play didn't bother me much as I got used to it later on. 

I do recommend this game. If you haven't bought the original Crysis then you should definitely buy this one. If you already have the original Crysis then it's up to you. The two games are basically the same. The difference is, remastered version has better visuals and controls and it runs better. 

My rating for this game would be 7 out of 10 (judging by today's perspective). The original Crysis still gets a higher point because of the time it was released on.",1632348037,1632348037,True,8,0,0.579009354114532471,0,True,False,False

TLDR - If you played and loved Crysis at any point and would happily play through it again, get it. You'll love it. If you are a die-hard fan of the original and are generally into modding up retro versions of games more than seeing them remastered (admittedly a lot of remasters aren't worth the price tag), you probably will prefer your own version. If you like pushing your rig in the overclock and play things more for benchmarking, get it.

A BIT MORE DEPTH - 

Gameplay:

This is the classic Crysis experience. Don't feel a lot has been updated in AI, don't feel it really needed it. Yes, the AI programming is showing it's age a little but it's worth noting there are plenty games which are running much more simplistic AI which no one complains about. If you're used to playing on a gamepad, this has you covered. If you ever missed out on Crysis and are looking to dive in now you're safe in the knowledge this is an identical uplift and you won't be missing anything. If you were expecting more of a 'reboot' with redesigned levels, interactions, new story beats or characters then you probably won't get much out of this.

Graphics:

To anyone who has been running there mouth about how this is a downgrade somehow and the textures are worse and it looks like it's been put through a cartoon filter; put your money where your mouth is and upload some screenshot comparisons between the original and this remaster, as well as a screenshort of your settings and telemetry. I won't hold my breath because I can SEE the difference with my two EYES that were made for SEEING THINGS. 

All I can suggest? Your hardware isn't keeping up with the settings you WANT to be playing it on and you interpret this as a flaw somehow. The ray-tracing is transformative (first in gaming, there's a reason this has existed as theory for literal centuries and called ""the holy grail"" of lighting for decades). Textures are improved, effects are improved etc. I'm not writing a promo piece, just giving you the facts. I can understand how some may have been expecting MORE of an improvement and were disappointed with this. However, to suggest that there haven't been any improvements or that those that have been made have somehow worsened the experience is just dimwitted.

Remember, the max settings for this gane were designed to be mostly unreachable. Why do you think the phrase 'Can it run Crysis?' has been kicking around for almost a decade after it's initial release and lives on to this day? If you're stuck in a situation where your hardware no longer meets your expectations, you should also remember that the game looks pretty darn good on Medium settings, let alone High, Very High or Can it Run Crysis? I've played the original through on PC years ago, I've played it on the Xbox, Xbox One and One X for Crysis Remastered and now on PC again. I feel safe saying I'm quite familiar with this game and can see how it's been updated to take advantage of emergent technologies over the years.

Ultimately, it's not going to be to everyones tastes. I personally have always enjoyed it, some of my closest friends have never seen the appeal. Best recommendation on this aspect; if you like exploring pretty games, you'll probably get a kick out of this.

Last note on graphics, HDR is a very welcome addition. I remember being stoked about having a 4K screen and being more blown away by the change in colour depth with HDR than the resolution. 

Value:

At £20 on release for a remaster of this quality, can't really complain. Could be cheaper but a lot of other companies re-release games with NO significant upgrades for full price! I like using this for benchmarking and overclocking because it's perhaps unnecessarily taxing for what it's producing. My rig suffers less running Cyberpunk 2077 and I definitely feel there are a greater richness and abundance of concurrent effects running in that game at any given time than there ever are in Crysis. Good for stability testing. If you never played Crysis and are considering it, it's well worth the price. If you are a bit fatigued with it but are interested in the updated graphics, I'd probably flip a coin. The visual updates, if you are lucky enough to have the hardware to crank it a bit, are defo worth another full playthrough, but maybe only once if youi're not that into the gameplay any more. 

CONCLUSION - 

Make your own darn mind up! Take any passionate review, positive or negative, with a grain of salt as they might be giving you a biased opinion. I've tried to give you a brief rundown of my own experience in a way that'll help you decide whether it's worth your hard earned dollar or not. It all depends on what you value in your experience with a game and whether you feel there's enough here to take a gamble on

It's a nice trip down the nostaliga lane, graphics do look a bit better but unfortunately...that's about where the good stuff ends. For the amount of updated and improved content, 30 euros is a laughable amount of money to pay for Crysis: Remasterd. My biggest disappointment is probably the AI downgrade. I decided to play it on Delta difficulty (the highest one) and the AI is just plain stupid, something I don't remember seeing in the original game. Enemies frequently run into walls, get stuck in crouch positions or just simply ignore you because they are too busy looking at random walls. The further you get into the game, the frequency of these problems increases  and, even tho it can be funny at times, it seriously ruins the immersion and progression. Apart from that, everything else is just like the original release: gunplay and variety of weapons in general is still great, characters are plain but they work for the purpose of the plot, environment is stunning and gameplay is overall enjoyable and memorable.

To conclude, I wouldn't recommend buying this 30 euro version of the game unless you are die-hard Crysis fan. You get the same, probably even better experience for 10 less with the base version of the game.

Playing it years later made me realize why Crysis is a special game. Crysis has a unique story and it's not just a generic war game like Call Of Duty or Battlefield. Original Crysis' graphics are still looking good in my opinion and with this remastered they really turned the game into an eye pleasing experience. The new technologies they added, the particle effects, textures, everything looks fantastic. The gameplay feels a bit dated considering today's standards but playing Crysis is still lots of fun. I love the gunplay and the weapon modification aspect of the series. You can change the attachment of your weapons any time to suit your needs. I think every FPS game must include this feature. The nanosuit is a complete game changer. You are not a normal soldier in Crysis. Thanks to nanosuit you can become invisible, run fast and absorb bullets with the suit's armor. Most of the missions are open ended and lets you use both your weapons and nanosuit in any way you want. Unfortunately, the sandbox aspect of the game is removed in the later games but in Crysis 1 you are free to tackle challenges in any way you like. My roblem with the Crysis is that it's too short. You can finish the game under 6 hours. You get used to contols, the environment and all of a sudden you are in an alien ship and about to finish the game. I guess devs chose quality over quantity. At least, the game is awesome to play so you can start a second playthrough to increase the lenght. Overall Crysis is a masterpiece.

+ No Denuvo DRM. [i] (Edit: The Epic Games version used Denuvo at launch and still hasn't been removed from that version for now.) [/i]

+ Support for Achievements.

+ Still plays like Crysis (2007) overall, despite the negatives I’m about to list from what I’ve experienced and read from other people.

[h1] Negatives: [/h1]

- No Cloud Saving Support. [i] (Edit: Subjective opinion since some people felt it isn't necessary, due to the campaign's short length but I personally disagree.) [/i]

- No Multiplayer and Crysis Warhead is still treated like the red-headed stepchild of the Crysis Family.

- It’s based off the PS3/XBOX 360 version which means the benefits of being able to quicksave are completely gone and now, the nanosuit powers have been nerfed both in effectiveness and how they control/feel.

- Apart from SVOGI and Ray Tracing, the “remastered” graphics artistically look much worse and uglier overall than the original PC version. Said Ray Tracing isn't worth the hit to performance since it only focuses on reflections.

- Optimisation on PC is still busted thanks to Cryengine still only using single threaded performance from the CPU. This results in constant stuttering even at the lowest settings while using v-sync. 

- Lingering bugs that aren’t fixed in the Epic Games version still persist in the Steam version.

- Now uses EOS (Epic Online Services) despite strictly being a single player experience.

- Casts doubt that the remastering efforts for Crysis 2 and 3 won’t be a disaster, since both of them will be still Epic Games Store exclusives for a year.  

- All of these negative aspects, combined with no actual improvements equate to making the 20% discount at launch and an extra 30% for those who own the original PC version, still a complete rip-off for what you’re paying for vs what you get.

-----Pros-----
Game can be set back to classic mode:
By default the game is set to run more like the sequels rather than the original. So we will need to go into settings to make some changes. First, we need to get the power wheel back so we need to go into Settings > Game Settings > Game Tab >  Check Classic Nanosuit Mode. Next, we will need to change some keybindings. By default, the Q/E are set to Armor/ Cloak mode and the Left/Right lean are set to T/H. These changes should be all you need to do to get the controls back to the original.

Powers seem to be relatively untouched:
From my tests the powers seemed to be the same. Another Review mentioned that the speed mode was heavily nerfed. However, this does not seem to be the case because after running from various points and comparing them to the Original the energy consumption was almost exactly the same. Testing of other modes such as Armor, Cloak, and Strength mode all seemed to be the same as well in terms of energy consumption.

Combat:
When fighting enemies, combat still seems to be the same for the most part. Shooting an enemy in the head kills them instantly no matter what difficulty you have the game set at, which is nice. I would rather not have enemies be bullet sponges.

-----Cons-----
No quick saves:
Going through the game on Delta difficulty makes it very apparent that quick saves are missing. If you die you can only use the last autosave that was made which can set you back a good amount. You are at the game's mercy at when it decides to make a save point which seems to be at scripted areas or distances from an objective which seems to be the same as the original. I don't know why quick saves were removed but that seems like a really dumb decision.

Graphical bugs:
In the first level, I noticed that there were some assets that were floating above the ground. Some examples are rocks or grass that will be floating a couple of inches off the ground. The grass was less obvious until I was looking at it from a different angle.

Audio bugs:
There were a whole lot of audio bugs that I found in the game.
- Cloaking and then using the binoculars makes audio stutter
- Cloak distorts the audio of surrounding assets like the chicken. It deepens and slows the clucks down like it was being put through slowmo.
- Stepping on wood sounds like you are breaking planks. I discovered this while traversing one of the hanging wooden bridges.
- Artillery at the beginning of the ""Assault"" mission is basically non-existent unless you are standing right next to where the explosion is happening.

AI pathing:
AI pathing seems to be an issue in this version of the game. I have had many times where the AI would be trying to walk up the side of a mountain to get to me, trying to go through walls, and even just going a slightly different direction than where I was located.

""Fatal"" error bugs:
On the mission onslaught I ran into a pretty error that I have never seen before in the original. After you get the Gauss rifle from the VTOL drop off, you come across this ""checkpoint"" with like 10+ guards. When I died here, the game just stopped with a black screen and gave me two error windows and asked if I wanted to Abort, Retry, or Cancel. I selected Retry for both popups and the game seemed fine until I killed all the enemies at the checkpoint. Four soldiers in particular just existed...You couldn't kill them and they were just walking back and forth really fast.

Is it worth $30? ehhh not really. I think if you own the original on Steam and with the Launch discount you can get it for $15 which seems like a more reasonable price.",1631899390,1631989480,True,49,8,0.731487691402435303,0,True,False,False

Crysis 1 is a great Sandbox Shooter and it's just like Far Cry 1 but where you are a Superhuman vs an Army. I really love the Delta difficulty's balance; always kinda being difficult and never really trivializing the difficulty; that and it's such a nice, cool thing to hear the enemy speak in their native language rather than in English. Very jarring and Delta really is so cool for that.  Anything easier than Delta and the game becomes a bit of a cakewalk as you are very superhuman.

I do think the game takes a HUGE nosedip in enjoyment once the Ceph show up cause it's just not fun to fight those aliens; I had a lot more fun fighting against the KPA, the AI there was brilliant and so enjoyable to play against, as they take cover and will stick together rather than just bumrush you and expect to win somehow.

Visuals:  
It looks better than the original but the performance you get doesn't match the quality of the visuals.   It is also very inconsistent, some things look great while others look like they reused original textures.   It creates this unbalance that looks worse than either would on their own.   Like the way things are destroyed looks really really bad and cheesy.     On top of that even with a top of the line graphics card there is a good amount of studdering.  

Gameplay:
The gunplay itself is excellent and the guns are fun to use.    The enemies in general are fairly tough although that is one of my major complaints is when the enemies literally take more shots to kill than they can kill you in when your the one wearing the high tech nanosuit.  Balance is all over the place for the most part, some things were stupidly easy and others ended up overly difficult.    There isn't a good difficulty curve to the game it just randomly spikes and dips.  You get sections that are a joke followed by an overly difficult part and then another overly easy section.      Balance is utterly broken at times and some things are just flat out bugged.   For example, on the final fight it is possible to get chain frozen until you die which is just annoying and makes the fight a chore instead of being fun.       Enemies seem to sometimes just know your location and will just look straight at you if you get too close even with stealth and crouched and the lack of a takedown makes actual stealth gameplay suck since you can't really misdirect enemies or take down enemies without alerting everyone around.  The strength options are completely useless in the game and honestly even the defensive shield gets chewed through so quickly by the more dangerous enemies that it is borderline useless.   On the other hand you can completely cheese the stealth mechanic and enemy AI with a bit of range by shooting from stealth hiding behind a tree and stealthing again.     It made the gameplay balance just feel terrible and should have been something you would have expected to be fixed in the remaster.  

Sound: the sound is pretty much the same as the original and not that good.  There is nothing to say here, it sounds like a 15 year old game.  It honestly didn't seem like they did anything with the remake in that department.    

Pretty much if you never have played the original it is worth buying because the game is still fun and the price isn't bad for the 6-10 hours your going to get out of the game at 25 dollars.  Honestly though that is the most I would say it has in value.   It has very little replay value, no multiplayer and isn't very long.  Ideally I would recommend wait for a sale to be honest.   The game definately isn't worth the price if you already own the game.",1631973503,1631973503,False,3,0,0,0,True,False,False

Kinda beefy and a bit unoptimized, hereafter melts the GPUs as tho OG Nomad did back in the day.

And as it seems like a pumped up console buff, it is still a solid pick. Double at that, considering the price and a whole half of it off on the first week if u r  a noble owner of the original Crysis.

I knew it was a fishy remaster but I wanted to try it for myself and nope. There are more downgrades than improvements. It's a demaster.

It looks better  but plays worse. My recommendation is to simply play the originial instead. You get better gameplay for less money and on maxed settings it's still pretty solid visually.

Starting with the positives: 
- The game now looks like how I remember it. Visually it's been brought to the 2020s and my nostalgia is happy about that.
Sadly thats it. End of the positives. (comparing to the orignal of 
course, not making a review about Crysis as a game. Love this game)

The negatives:
- The mouse sensitivity is insane. Even on the absolute lowest setting its still twice as high as what I play normally, and I know a lot of FPS gamers who play significantly lower sense than me. I was struggling more with controling my character than I was with the actual enemies. 
- Which brings up the second point: the AI is terrible. Seemingly completely unchanged from the original, but in the mean time us gamers have all gotten used to for more responsive and interesting enemies.
- Movement feels sluggish and unresponsive. Its like moving through syrup. I don't recall the original feeling like it was constanly holding me back. Even with speed mode enabled I don't feel like a fast and deadly super soldier, instead I feel I'm obese and cannot run properly.
- Various performance issues. Poor optimisation on some features, frame drops and the likes. I didn't play long enough to really give detailed feedback here.
- A big one. Audio. WHY, just why, do they put all this effort into visual improvements but apparently haven't put a single minute of effort into actual audio improvements. These are the same gunshot sounds, impact sounds and explosions from 15 years ago and many of them sounded unimersive and unrealistic even then. Even the most beautiful environment won't feel immersive if it sounds 20 years dated.

There are bugs and the gunplay just doesnt feel right, I think the original had a similar problem.

Even thou the has been out on the EGS (1 year ago) it just shouldnt have these problems anymore, devs should fix their games not just pocket, what is essentially, bribemoney and move on to blackjack and hookers.

Also this is a singleplayer game (original release had MP) and it connects to EpicGameServices for some reasons...
