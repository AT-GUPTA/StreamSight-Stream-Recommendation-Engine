You play a member of the resistance tasked with overthrowing the corrupt Mayor of the city. At the beginning of a run you pick your class which dictates your starting items as well as a unique optional big quest to complete. 

On each level you are given random tasks that you must complete to advance. Every third level also has a level wide event to shake things up. There are 5 groupings of these levels that make up the different biomes of the game with Mayor city being the final level. 

The selection of different classes and procedural generation gives the game a high replayability. On top of that the characters have different behaviors in relation to each other, such as thieves trying to steal from people, gang members fighting with the opposite gang on sight, and cops getting violent with just about everybody. Each task can be solved in multiple ways and additional items can be unlocked with chicken nuggets that you get for free when you level up. Also on level up you can choose from one of three random perks with additional perks able to be unlocked. 

I found Streets of Rogue to be difficult but satisfying. There is a lot to learn and sometimes you can just sit back and watch the city operate without getting involved. Playing as the different classes switches things up significantly enough that no two runs every really feel the same.

Not worth the full asking price by a long shot. For what you get I'm feeling like this should be priced under $7 regularly. That is just my personal opinion.

It's fun, you get a cool little world and there's lots of ""interactions"" between various things. Everything, even NPCs have their behavioral/event scripts, and it makes the world come alive and opens up creative gameplay approaches.

For example, you can shoot a generator through a window, which might alert guards. But as the guard is charging out of the building to get you, you bait it into shooting at you and hitting a crowd behind you, which starts a huge brawl. You can then use the distraction to finish everybody off and loot them, or sneak into the building to finish whatever brought you there in the first place (breaking into a safe, retrieving something, assassinating a key enemy, etc).

There are different player classes you can unlock and play, and they really do change the way you approach the game and strategize. There are many situations and building configurations that would be approached totally differently depending on your class. For example the hacker: a much weaker fighter but can hack terminals through walls and turn off a building's security features, or set the turrets to attack everybody. Or you can be a burglar with window-cutting tools, and you'll find that all the other burglars in the maps are your friends and will fight along side you for cheap, or sell you thief tools.

You can be a ""good guy"" as well and avoid conflict, free prisoners and caged-animals which then join your posse to fight with you. If you build your character in a certain direction, you can keep followers from map-to-map and increase the amount that will fight with you. Point is, there are many ways to approach the game and it's totally up to the player which is so wonderful.

All in all a very fun game. Even though I have many hours in the game, really it started to fall flat around the 3rd or 4th hour of play. The game mechanics are great, the variety of semi-randomized builds you make are dynamic and robust. Love the classes. Love that the player gets to decide how to approach the game. Yet somehow I feel I figured it all out very quickly, and as much as I kept playing to unlock different things I couldn't make it [i]click[/i]. I hoped that playing more would unlock more depth but it kinda didn't? Once you figure out the world mechanics and how everything interacts, that's it. And that really doesn't take the player very long.

I think the average player will get a 2 to 3 hours of fun before they get bored. Some players will want to unlock everything and that's fine too but expect A LOT of repetition of basic gameplay. Yes the classes are great and change the way you play, but 95% of most gameplay is the same repetitive stuff regardless.

SoR follows the traditional rule of co-op games in that it's well made for antics with friends, especially given the chaotic nature of SoR and the synergies created by the class system.

SoR is a rogue-like top-down view action-RPG and ""immersive sim with elements of Deus Ex and Grand Theft Auto."" To SoRs credit it actually does a few of those things, playing like a modern homage to the older 2D GTA titles. It's a fun sandbox merged with rogue-like levels that offer multiple approaches, limited by the variety in quest design yet doing enough to grease the rogue-like problem solving gland. There's still a lot of combat, much of it unavoidable, though you can play against that.

It does immerse you nicely, though the story is total nonsense that never takes itself seriously, thankfully vanishing after the tutorial and letting the environment and soundtrack carry things. The humor works well with the variety of goofy approaches and possible situations, mostly in the class, item and level design. I'm more amused by the idea of a Gorilla or Zombie playthrough backed by wacky utility gadgets and high explosives than I am the discount weak chuckle of ""we use petrified chicken nuggets as currency!"" Again, it doesn't lay it on that thick after the tutorial. 

It's a shame there aren't more set characters and quests in the game, as GTA covers for a lot of repetitive mission design by making the stories surrounding them extra entertaining. SoR does this with the final level and it's more interesting then the rest, naturally. The shallow quest pool could've been smoothed over a lot with character or area specific(maybe on the X-2 levels) set pieces/quest chains with a few more involved steps and non-generic NPCs. This also gives design space to make quests that guarantee certain approaches(i.e. stealth, talking, etc) have more chances to shine, as most quests are biased towards murder. The character-specific Big Quests are an entertaining extra but mostly a starting point or bonus and the gap in level design is felt.

So for gameplay naturally you can punch and shoot your way through, a few characters getting unique abilities with some limit to use as well as consumable items that offer strong utility. If you want to be a gungho killman then by all means, or focus on ranged combat, trap setting, or some other branch of modernish magic like hacking or bartending. There's also a limited bit of talkomancy such as making it easier to complete the item swap quests, recruit/befriend people or skirt social norms. The game mostly plays smoothly, movement and targeting as well as environment interaction being intuitive. This goes hand in hand with the default state of most levels being peaceful yet tense, a living city where every entity isn't a hostile monster. Yet. Gives you time to explore and plot your actions.

The best part of the game is the multiple ways to try to approach a tough quest or emergent problem like getting spotted by cops mid-crime or having to access a single person in a crowded shop. The quests do get repetitive, a majority of them being dives into a trap-filled box with multiple rooms and 1-4 forced combat goons, so it's impressive that things stay so interesting due to the sheer number of options or the addictive desire to pull off a run with your favorite approach. This perfectly captures the feel of a game like NetHack, where traditional builds are fun but trying to force a win out of Tourist can be infinitely engaging. The difficulty rises steadily, mostly tough yet fair and like all good rogue-likes open to the great fun of breaking the game once your head is full of overly specific knowledge.

I've used a lot of ""mostly""s in this review and here's why: as much as I like SoR I found the greatest flaw to be the combat. The melee combat is atrocious. It's not unusable or unplayable. It's just not a great system and you endure it to enjoy everything else. Enemies are far, far too jittery and randomly inclined to slash rapidly at you with split second reactions and no wind up. It's possible to be hit 2+ times in under a second if you botch something adjacent to anyone with a melee weapon. Gunplay is more fair, demanding sensible use of cover, but I'd seethe every time I got ping-ponged around in melee or lost 50+ health failing little jousting approaches. How it works is that the best option is to alpha strike the enemy, using assassin characters(... like assassin, vampire, etc) or fast melee that can get backstabber and avoid line of sight/hostility toggles. If combat never starts it never hurts. Sure, it's fun if you get followers going or incite characters to fight each other, set traps, use guns or abilities at range. You're just usually in a steady decline if you get into a lot of melees or a few bad ones without a cheesy source of healing. 

Sometimes the RNG is ridiculous and you die rapidly with little input, or you enter X-3 and get ""hey, screw your build"" disasters or loads of unavoidable damage. It's part of the rogue-like spice but getting Police Lockdown 4 out of 5 Downtowns really killed my mood. While I want to praise the visual design for having traps that actually get me they suffer from the same problem as the melee of instant hits, especially manhole covers. There's also a few class balance issues, though perhaps I just didn't gel with them all. Well OK, Werewolf having all 1s for stats and a heinous downside to less than perfect play is a real masochist choice vs a perfectly oiled stealth machine like Vampire.

To give SoR some more praise I applaud the quality of life touches everywhere. The objectives teleporter, slowdown on item use/swap, mutator system and leniency in achievement unlocking makes the dev a real lad. I definitely want to use my Big Quest rewards all game after the effort to get them! With a good mind at the helm SoR ended up a pretty good game. For $4 on sale I'm delighted, SoR being a perfect $5 game. It's a good $10-15 game and... sorry, Overwhelmingly Positive reviews, $20 is a stretch. Definitely a fair price for a polished sequel, as SoR2 looks pretty good and I'm sure Matt has learned a great deal since SoR1 released.

Wot I liked
- Cool pixel artstyle: many models, skins, weapons, guns, items and animations really liven the game up;
- Tongue in cheek sarcastic writing;
- Classes, traits, items, perks, custom classes;
- Melee combat is not as simple as it looks — you can kinda block and time your attacks;
- The goal of the game is to depose the mayor: you can do it by force or through elections;
- Classes - you can play as a bruiser, killing everyone. Or be a stealth assassin. Or be a bartender and serve everyone drinks. Or be a vampire and drink everyone’s blood. Or be a zombie and start a zombie apocalypse;
- The game has 5 districts (Slums, Industrial, Park, Downtown, Uptown) with 3 sub areas + Mayor’s Village. Each area consists of a small part of town with its own factions, locales, facilities for you to wreak havoc.

Wot I disliked
- As it's a roguelike each run is a bit too long - my first successful run took about 2 hours;
- Unlocking all the traits takes quite some time;
- Highlight all command does not highlight interactive items;
- The number of traits/rewards you can remove in order to customize your run is not big enough.

Streets of Rogue (SoR) is a genuinely flawless co-op friendly roguelite game that deserves your support. Disclaimer: I am friends with Matt Dabrowski but I promise you that does not sway my opinion whatsoever, I just think the game is honestly amazing.

You will play as one of many classes, all of which revolve around a profession or hobby or lifestyle, and begin in the Slums with little to nothing. You will work your way up through society until you eventually reach Mayor Village, where your objective is to usurp power from him via hostility or through election. You will have various ways of completing assigned tasks before you can progress to the next floor, and you can choose how passive or aggressive you wish to be. You must survive lowly pickpockets to Blaed & Crepe gang members, the mob, and supercops.

Streets of Rogue is so much fun because of the surprising amount of choice you have over how things go. You can make the game as easy or hard for yourself depending on play styles, decisions, and routes. It's also a great game to play with a friend and like most roguelites will be significantly more doable with a partner since you can revive each other instead of just instant permadeath. The art style isn't really my thing but the combat and mechanics make up for that and it does have a nice color palette with plenty of varying locations and map designs.

The classes are all distinguished from each other and play extremely differently. The fact the game has so many endings adds to the already great replay ability. There is a huge selection of items and tools to keep things interesting. The game also features intelligent NPCs with factions that have various degrees of reputation and status with each other, making things more advanced than necessary which is a good thing.

SoR is personally my favorite roguelite I've played, but I'm not super big on this genre so feel free to point me to some others if you think they are better. I look forward to playing the sequel to this gem!

There are so many different ways to get things done with some solutions I find making me feel like I did something really cool. The kinds of solutions you go for are even more different and available depending on what character you are being, and what point in a run you are at. Resources are a little tight early on, so you gotta really think hard to get things done as safety (or as interestingly) as possible, with more and more opportunities for causing pure chaos opening later on. 

Some of my favorite runs where when I decided to knock every single person on each floor unconscious as the doctor, the one where I kept blowing people up with their own tvs as the hacker, and the one where my siblings and I banded together to create a zombie apocalypse.

 [list]
    [*]Fast-paced and hilarious situations
    [*]Replayable
    [*]Fun co-op, on the lighter side

[b]Streets of Rogue is a fun little game that really shines when you play with a friend or two.

[i]This game is fun, especially so with a friend. =) I most enjoy playing it with a controller, and my best gamer buddy, it's an excellent couch co-op game to jump into for a quick session or save your progress for later. Part of the replay value for me is unlocking the characters, which are each farely varied and wacky! Shout-out to the developer, I've seen this game improve quite consistently over the course of a year! Worth a buy, esp. if you enjoy multiplayer roguelikes.[/i]",1622602499,1701051042,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Although, calling Streets of Rogue a bad game is a bit of a stretch, besides, I do like to be fair here when it comes to talking about games but sorry, this game is just terribly designed. So what's wrong with Streets of Rogue? Well, allow me to tell you why but first, let's talk about the positives and then the negatives.

[b]Positives:[/b]
-The animation is smooth
-The movement is fluid and responsive
-It controls well
-It looks alright
-The gameplay is solid
-The themeing is unique
-There's a very diverse amount of strategies
-Customization
-And different attributes/abilities for different characters 

[b]Negatives, ranting, and rating:[/b]
First of all, a chunk of the game, the gameplay can feel repetitive, the music is pretty forgettable, you are forced to be perfect when sneaking around, and very poor ai.
The worst part and I can't stress these two major flaws enough, the big quest and the unfair amount of trial and error. Each character is given a quest to complete, a permanent one throughout the entire campaign of the character, you have to complete every single stage for said floor while doing the big quest requirements and If you leave one stage without completing the big quest of said floor, that's it, you can't complete it! Which leads into the biggest problem of this game...the poorly designed and cheap difficulty of this game. Trying to complete all of the quests you're given is both impossible and frustrating. Because you don't have enough money to buy something, you get hit really easily, the ai is way too annoying and cheap and having to go into forced fights you don't want to partake in. All of this combine with a health bar, generated levels that are terribly thought out with the traps and mechanics that make trying to not get hit nearly impossible. Oh! I am not done yet, there's one thing that makes this even worse. Dying, if you die, you go back to the very beginning. You did not just read that, if you die at any point, you go back, to the very beginning of the game. Which makes this one of the most punishing and biggest time wasters, I have ever experienced, it's not fun in the slightest and no, not doing the big quest doesn't erase this problem, if you die, you still have to start from the beginning of the game, regardless if you were doing the big quest or not. It doesn't matter what you say, It's a big problem that ruins the entire fun of the game, whether it's a casual or completionist playthrough. I never thought I would hate this game more than I did back then but it's unbelievably bad, with poorly made choices, cheap difficulty, forgettable aspects of the game, repetitive gameplay, dying, the big quest, and terrible ai. All of this makes for easily the worst and most unfair experience I've ever played in a rogue-like ever. I'm not going to list the rest of the sections like my usual reviews (like the price or verdict), all I give this game is a 1.5/10. Man the more I just talk about the poorly thought out game design the more I hate this game. Though to give it some credit, they did give us videos showing the making of this game showing that they cared about this. I appreciate the people who created this game but I wish the design if it was better. Lastly, I wouldn't even count this but a paywall behind a character pack, really. No offense to the creators of this game or anything, I appreciate the project they were making! Thank you for reading and have a good day!",1668566855,1700844679,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You don't have to worry about ""polluting"" your trait/item pool with unlocks because you can disable any and all of them if you want, you can even save different loadouts.

Most maps in each of the five ""areas"" are somewhat similar to each other, but they will feel very different based on your character's capabilities. There are also random ""disasters"" on the third and final level of each area, ranging from spreading goo to a zombie infestation to a killer robot slowly walking towards you at all times and firing a rocket launcher at you (which you can attempt to use to your advantage, if you dare). 

NPCs will respond to a lot of actions (by your and by other NPCs) so there can be a lot of wild and amusing interactions happening on the map, and the world feels alive.

Not only can you customize the gameplay loop, but you can create your own unique characters; which is a lot of fun in and of itself.

This is a Splunkey style Roguelike, meaning it's all about wacky interactions between different elements. Death is swift, but knowledge is power.

My favorite part of this is the characters. Not only do they all have different abilities, but each one has a personal quest you need to complete in addition to reaching the end. One character wants to avoid killing people, another wants to kill as many as possible in a rampage, and there are weirder ones too. Each character forces you to play differently, much more effectively than most. Don't like any of them? You can make your own too!

A complete run is about an hour, but you'll die a lot before you reach that point. Afterwards there are a lot of reasons to keep playing. Multiple endings, modifiers, challenge runs, the works.

I cannot believe this game exists, and I also cannot believe there are people who do not like this game. you should understand that, for the most part, the people who are downvoting this game are fools. The only person that could downvote this game is the kind of person who angrily throws a plate and breaks it and gets more frustrated and blames the plate for breaking. It's the kind of game that you have to have an actual marble for a brain to not enjoy. Except unlike a marble, if you are not enjoying this game, your brain is likely very soft- liquid even. This game is incredible, and the amount of choice you have in the way you maneuver this game is even more incredible. As someone who has spent a lot of time playing games, and figuring out what it is I like about them, I have to say, this one has checked all the boxes. The main ones being that it fuels my addiction to dopamine spikes, depletes my serotonin, and virtually numbs me from all things that are not stimuli from the game itself. Not to mention that there are copious amounts of drugs in the game, and it is an absolute joy to be able to stick random, un-named needles into my arms without suffering from any real life adverse effects. I cannot believe more people do not play this game, and it baffles me that anyone wouldn't like it. Although some people also do not like 
In-N-Out Burger, so I guess that goes to show just what a mad world we live in. I'm not sure what you could say negatively about this game that doesn't have to do with your skill level, or your brain's information capacity, or your attention span. The only people who are suffering at this game seriously, are people that can't stop intermittently eating candy, and chips, and drinking soda, and eating cereal for dinner, and coming down with horrific, nightmarish sugar crashes, causing their undoing when they destroy everything on their desk on account of their irrationality. This game is seriously great, I recommend you do not read negative reviews, because they are mostly made by people who are festering in a pool of their own ass sweat day in and day out. They can't enjoy life because their dung drenched chair has gotten uncomfortable because they have pushed all the padding into a flat, crusted bed that lays atop the plastic construction that holds their 300 pound ass up all day.

Game stupidly tosses you into a dark city and does not provide any means of illumination to combat the darkness. Unless you want to squint your eyes and suffer, go to Options -> Graphics -> Lighting Mode: None.

That makes the game 500 times better, trust me on this.

Anyway, besides that minor flaw that can be easily turned off, this is game is AWESOME.

Ever wanted to be an urban terrorist hooligan that does madlad things in an open world city that's way more interactive than GTA? As almost any person you can think of, be it a thief, fireman, soldier, zombie or gorilla?

Streets of Rogue delivers that and much more like a CHAMP.

Seriously, this game is legitimately one of the best games ever made in the last 20 years, regardless of its roguelite elements and nature.  In fact, I guarantee you'll love this even if you hate roguelikes otherwise - difficulty wise it can be one of the easiest roguelites ever.

Its more of an open world action game with very generous conditions for both victory and failure, wrapped in goofy humor yet is still very believable that it can be taken seriously. 

The amount of content, characters, places is massive, while each playthrough is never the same thanks to so many things that can be random, yet cohesive each time. The music is kickin' great too!

This game is *very* well done as a whole, I can not emphasize this enough. Absolutely get this gem if you get the chance! Its worth it even at full price, DLC characters too.

And once you're done with the vanilla game times 20, you can greatly extend it with new map chunks (hundreds of them!) and custom characters (hundreds more!). The best part is that the game can be played casually as a way to relax, pretty much perpetually - you'll be returning for another playthrough again and again, because the moment to moment gameplay is just that stellar.

There's something really chill to this game where you can spend hours just messing around in the city doing fun stuff at your own pace, however you want.

Playtime Update: 400+ hours later I still play this game again and again.

Its unique mission-based GTA-style gameplay in a top-down 2D environment made it unlike any game I ever played, though I found the game to be brutally unforgiving in its difficulty, which didn't match up that well with the amount of time investment for one run. However, I came back to this game with the goal of trying out the multiplayer, and I finally managed to experience the true potential of the game.

The ability to continue the run after dying by having your teammate revive you is just what I was missing to really get the full experience. Being able to try out not just all the different wacky character types, but also the crazy combinations of them is remarkable, making each run a completely different experience. The game is insanely customizable and lets you play with any features on or off.

Don't really enjoy how equipment (can drop during runs) and traits (selected on level-up) are unlocked. Secondary currency is awarded on level-up and on special quest completion. It can be used to unlock entries from both sets. The process is too slow though. I still have a lot of things to unlock and I am already pretty much done with the game.

Classes are distinct and have interesting  special skills but on later floors – 4 and 5 – it's best to use violence or items (cyanide, rage poison) to solve problems. This often escalates into massive fights, destroying big parts of the level. That IS fun. Still, it contributes to the mentioned samey-ness of runs.

Shooting is good. Enemies are pretty accurate and try to avoid incoming fire so it's necessary to lead targets. Deleting groups of mobsters/cops with a rocket launcher is pretty satisfying. Not really possible to go full Rambo because ammunition is limited. I like that.

Stealth is only viable in early game. No visual indicators of what NPCs can see.

Runs take too much time to keep me engaged (I am obsessively thorough with scavenging though).

Visually it's serviceable, if kind of ugly. Soundtrack is catchy but starts to get on your nerves quickly.

Picture this: I was just another soul lost in the corporate machine, a mere pawn in a world of suits and ties. But one day, I had enough. I reached my breaking point, fueled by a fiery determination to break free from the monotony.

With a loaded gun at my side, the last swig of a frosty beer in my hand, and a trusty crowbar clutched tightly, I embarked on a path of rebellion. I decided to pay a visit to my unsuspecting neighbor, knocking on their door with a sense of mystery and danger hanging in the air. What happened next, well, let's just say the details are better left to the imagination, but suffice it to say, their ill-gotten gains became mine.

Now imagine this: a boozy thief with a devil-may-care attitude, dressed to the nines in a sharp suit. I reveled in the thrill of my newfound lifestyle, living on the edge, and embracing the chaos that surrounded me. But little did I know that fate had a different plan in store.

In the very next building, destiny awaited me in the form of a formidable device. Its presence was palpable, and I could sense the power it possessed. Brimming with confidence, I marched forward, ready to conquer any obstacle that stood in my way.

But then, it happened. In a blink of an eye, I found myself hurtling through the air, crashing against a wall with bone-shattering force. The impact was intense, smashing me into a human-shaped paste against the unforgiving concrete. It was a moment of shocking realization, a reminder that even the boldest of thieves can meet their match.

So there you have it, my friend, a tale of rebellion, danger, and a sobering lesson learned. The streets of Rogue are no place for the faint-hearted, and as I lay broken and defeated, I couldn't help but wonder if there was a way to rise again, to face the challenges with newfound vigor. Only time will tell if I'll make a triumphant return or become just another cautionary tale in the annals of this unforgiving city.

Loosely tasked with toppling the mayor of the titular Streets, you must complete a series of missions on each “floor” before progressing to the next area. Your character’s equipment and capabilities mount alongside the challenge; the baseball bat-touting thugs of the starting slums giving way to mobsters with tommy guns, robot police with rocket launchers and lockdown barriers at the ritzier levels. Like Splelunky, the final levels are too ferociously challenging for me; I confess I’ve only made it to the final boss a couple of times. A complete run might take around an hour; perhaps longer if you focus on the fiddly stealth. Death comes easily but is usually your fault or, at least, entertaining. The wide array of starting characters, each with significant impacts on your playstyle, encourage “just one more go” rather than a ragequit. The pixel art is chunky, charming and clear, the soundtrack upbeat, jazzy and easy to get stuck in your head. The art all ties in nicely with the gameplay’s cheery, silly feel. Streets of Rogue primarily wants you to have a good time in its playground causing mischief, and largely succeeds.

The game is limited somewhat by repetitive level generation and a finite possibility space. NPC interactions with your shenanigans are fun to try to manipulate, but mostly boil down to some degree of everybody dying and everything being destroyed. It’s simply that later levels tend to send hordes of well-armed police after you if your transgressions are detected. Charming, bribing and threatening people to get what you want offers a less entertaining alternative to mayhem, while I found the stealth time-consuming and, again, less fun than running riot.

Streets of Rogue is not quite an essential roguelike, then, but is easy to recommend as a novel concept, joyously executed. I gladly spent many hours in its company and suspect I will keep it around for some time to dip into for an hour or two of inconsequential catharsis. If you enjoy Streets of Rogue’s top-down roguelike tactics, be sure to check out the peerless FTL and Invisible Inc., or Dungeon of the Endless for something a little weirder.",1688117238,1688117238,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-[b]Thus the classes can play differently with different objectives and play styles[/b]
-You can destroy most walls and engage in chaos in the process
-You can do this with friends as it has same screen co-op (Even more chaos)
-Chicken nuggets are the roguelike currency
-Arguably you won't play long enough to make full use of that currency (But still fun)
-Surprisingly serious music
-Grundgey pixel art visuals

Practical Concerns:
-Good value for money (R2.17/hour for me)
-Small Download
-Easy to run
-Same screen co-op
-Not that kid friendly

You go from room to room, clearing out enemies and cursing every mistake you make. Healing and upgrades are limited and if you aren't skilled enough your enjoyment is determined by the roll of a dice.

Not Streets of Rogue.

Every floor in this game is a miniature sandbox, with several objectives for you to complete before you can move on. You can tackle these objectives in any order you want and in a variety of ways. Need to eliminate someone? You could just attack them, but you could also threaten them to leave, befriend them and warn them to leave or arrange for them to be killed by other NPCS.

Every character has own tools and drawbacks that encourage approaching problems in different ways. This is reinforced by the ""Big Quest"" system, where each character is given an additional objective to work towards throughout their run. Don't like any of the characters? Make your own custom character!

Ever unlocked a terrible upgrade in another Roguelike and wish you hadn't when it ruined a run? Streets of Rogue lets you customize what traits and quest rewards appear during your run! The ability to swap out unwanted traits and remove negative starting traits using an Augmentation Booth is also a welcome addition.

Still not sold? Think it might be too easy or too hard? Enable Mutators! These modifiers let you tweak the game to your liking, doing things like removing those pesky disasters or HAVING A DISASTER ON EVERY FLOOR. Now I know what you're thinking: ""Will they disable unlocks and achievements?"". Only if you turn on Sandbox mode! Everything else is A-Okay!

To become someone else and experience a different life. And I believe that few games embody this mantra quite as good as Streets of Rogue. No game has ever allowed you to role-play out your wildest and weirdest dreams quite like this. Without even needing to go into full detail, know that you definitely need to give this game a try, it's truly unique and there is so much to do here.

The main appeal of Streets of Rogue has got to be the freedom of choice you get on how to approach your situation. Its an RPG like no other, with unparalleled freedom of choice and unpredictability. You're thrusted into this city, simulated in full, with various shops, administrative buildings, a population and its own internal conflicts. You're given simple but difficult tasks to serve as guidance and from then on, its all up to you. The game encourages creativity and gives you a plethora of options to choose from. It would be false to say that you can do anything, as that will never be possible, but damn does this game get close. Do you want to:

-be a stealthy ninja, backstabbing guards left and right Assassin's Creed style (this game is officially more AC than new AC games)
-be a lowly thief and pickpocket random people on the street and sneak into people's homes and rob them
-be a maniac soldier and gun everything down on sight, asking questions never
-be a hacker, breaching systems to gain access to forbidden areas, insighting robot rebellions and bringing refrigerators to life
-be a gangster, killing the rival gang for dirt money
-be a the bodyguard of a whiny celebrity
-be a cyborg law enforcer, slaughtering unruly citizens in the name of justice
-be a hyperintelligent gorilla, forming a gorilla army
-be a vampire, hunting people in dark alleyways
-be an alien and mind control the populace to do your bidding for you, helping you build your spaceship
-be a shapeshifting demon and possess others in order to frame them for crimes and spread anarchy

These are just some of the options you have before you and there is a ton more nuance to each that are far beyond the scope of this review. Just dive right in, experiment and see what you can do. Also every task can be approached in a multitude of ways - violence, stealth, trickery, diplomacy, bribery and much more. Pick the most optimal, pick what you find the most fun or just pick what your character would do in this scenario.

The game also features a co-op mode and you can definitely feel how the level design is based around different people using their different abilities in synergy to accomplish goals. And the cool thing is, even if you play alone, you can still take advantage of this by recruiting NPCs with various abilities and instructing them what to do to help you. Truly limitless potential.

And if all this variety wasn't enough, the game is a roguelike too lest we forget. The map will always change so exploration is always necessary, there will be random item drops, unpredictable events and different outcomes every time, so the replayability is truly limitless. The be all, end all social RPG.

So to summarize, Streets of Rogue is an amazing game with tons of content, it's made with lots of love and there is a ton of fun and a ton of different kinds of fun to be had here. You are genuinely doing yourself a disservice by not at least giving it a try.",1686001796,1686001796,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Every character plays different from one another at their core, but there are many ways to play the game per character as well. My only gripe about the game is that sometimes the game screws you over if you have bad RNG, resulting in objective failure when you couldn't do anything, or death. There is an open world sequel coming into Early Access soon* and I am very excited for it, as I feel like that genre would perfectly compliment this game's style.

Also due to the fact that the levels and spawns are RNG-based so it's different each time while you also get to choose what class/character to play as. One run you might be going into a building with a bunch of weapons sweeping everything and the next run on another level type/world youre barely scraping by then a thief walks by and yanks on one of your items making you choose whether to get that item back to use for this building or go in without it. On top of that you get traits and items that you can unlock for future runs within the game and on top of THAT one theres a sequel in the works.

Well for Street of Rouge, I can say it mostly will be as fun as the reviews said.

It's really is a fun game. It's a roguelike where the basic gameplay is you select a character (or you create your own!) from a list, those characters have their skills and negative traits. Then you will be given missions in each stage before you can go to the next in a randomized level. What makes it wonderful is that you have freedom on how you want to complete the missions. For example, if you have a mission to get an item from someone, you can either:

- Kill them
- Pay others to kill them
- Pay them to kill others, in hope they are killed so you can loot the item from their corpse
- More of a pacifist? Threaten, bribe, or exchange with other items
- A thief? Pickpocket them
- Shapeshifter? Become them and get the item
- etc, etc...

This is also set in an environment that feels alive. Characters that are rivals will fight. Mobsters seeing you will threaten you for money, but will back off if they see cops, and so on. Oh also, mods and Co-op. Yeah, this game supports those fun stuff.

Music and Art are okay, those do their purpose without detracting from the gameplay.

Felt like I was doing something wrong and there was nothing really drawing me in to continue dying stupid deaths due to one random uncontrollable factor or another. I tried to push through and get a few hours into the game, and learned a little more - enough to progress a little further; but overall this game is just ridiculously and frustratingly difficult and punishing. Some times you can speed run through and complete all the objectives in the first or second level with no real resistance, other times, a thief randomly steals your upgraded uzi and proceeds to mow you down with bullets while you are helpless to do anything but hate this game for exactly what it is. It would be nice if you could unlock buffs or level your character little by little after grinding through runs, but there is no such ability, so every run you are starting from square one. With no increasing advantage to help you progress more easily through successive runs, the game just feels obnoxious and frustrating. It IS fun to cause chaos by doing things like freeing captive gorillas then watching them obliterate their captive scientists, or inciting gunfights between rival gangs, but you only do that so many times before wanting something more.",1685850194,1685850194,False,4,0,0.481690049171447754,0,True,False,False

The game is incredibly simple and easy to get back into, even after a long hiatus. The mechanics are straightforward, but the random elements keep each playthrough fresh and exciting.

One of the standout features of this game is the diverse cast of characters. Each one has unique abilities and playstyles, making every run feel distinct and engaging. I particularly enjoy selecting a random character and adapting my strategy on the fly. While the game may not be very deep, this simplicity is part of its charm and makes it a perfect choice for a quick gaming session.

As for the story, it's true that there isn't much to it. The premise of becoming the mayor is a fun idea, but it doesn't really impact the gameplay in any significant way.

It's a crazy fun rogue-lite game that gives you tons of choices and lets you go nuts with experimentation!

The game's all about player freedom. You've got a bunch of diverse characters to choose from, each with their own unique abilities. Wanna hack security systems, bribe guards, use disguises, or set traps? Go for it! The game encourages you to get creative and strategic, and there's no shortage of ways to approach levels.

One of the best parts is the emergent gameplay. You can interact with the environment and NPCs in all sorts of unexpected ways. The RPG elements let you make moral decisions that affect the story and the game world, so you can really shape your own adventure. Plus, the game's got a funny sense of humor with quirky characters, crazy weapons, and unexpected events that'll keep you entertained.

But watch out, because permadeath is a thing. Every decision counts, and the challenge is real. It's addictive, challenging, and totally unpredictable, but that's what makes it so damn fun.

If you want to be a thief and pick pocket your way through the levels, you can do that too. Be an alien or gorilla who can't communicate with the human NPCs? Yup. Or maybe you want to be a soldier and blast your way through the levels. You can also create your own custom classes.

Each character has their own unique goal and abilities depending on your game play style. There is space for sneaky sneaks and there is play for bam wham shooting and punching. 

When playing with others, it is nicer when everyone owns a copy so that when someone needs to reference to the map, it doesn't pause the whole screen... but if you don't care for those technicalities, remote play is fine.

In Streets of Rogue, your mission is to complete 1 to 3 (or fail while trying to complete) objectives on each block and then move up to next floor doing new tasks in ever more dangerous blockade than the previous, with ultimate goal to take down an evil mayor. Upon completing these objectives you are awarded with money or item that can ease your job depending how well you manage to use them. During a run you also gain experience and levels and in each level up you get to pick a perk that may or may not be very helpful to you, once again depending how well you take advantage of it.

There's also a huge amount of classes you can select from and start your run, from simple homeless person who just gets more xp to doctor who refuses to use firearms but carries infinite supplies of chlorine with him/ her, making stealth takeouts essential part of that classes playstyle.

What also surprised me very positively was how ""boss floors"" were handled and how well they worked. In each third floor there's going to be a disaster presence, from simple riot where pretty much everyone is ready to beat the s*** out of you to killer robot hunting to destroy you minus leather jacket and black sunglasses and M1911 with top-mounted laser sight replaced with rocket launcher. These disasters give just the right amount of extra tension before moving to upper class floor(s).

One thing I mention too is that while there's lot of options for player to improvise this game ain't easy, you really have to think have you are going to complete missions and run if you want to stay alive (and yes I admit I used mods [or more accurately used dnSpy] to make this game easier for me, given I'm more used to play roguelites with permanent upgrades than roguelikes where your progress after defeated run is mostly wiped out).

Overall had a lot of fun with this game and will definitely use mutilators to make future playthroughs even more challenging. Very excited for Streets of Rogue 2 that was announced not too long time ago.",1669304593,1680857000,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]What It Is:[/b]
A roguelite based in an underground city with frantic combat, tight controls, and extremely customizable experiences on each run. Want to be gorilla strong and smash through walls? How about charming everyone in the area? Hire a gang to do your dirty work? Or just go in action movie style guns blazing? You can do it all in this crazy as heck game.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
You can really choose to be almost anything you want in this game. SoR is a procedural rogue-lite and you can choose to start as one of several classes, or create your own class. Each class has tools which aid them in completing objectives, but perks you get along the way can help you become better or something completely different.

[b]Difficulty:[/b]
From very easy to extremely hard, it has a range of challenges available.

[b]Graphics:[/b]
All of the parts of this game have so much character. TinyBuild could have easily phoned in some procedural character generation for the citizens, instead many of the unique citizens like shopkeepers, thiefs, police, robots, gangsters, mobsters, etc. all have their own sprites and they look fantastic.

[b]Audio:[/b]
Cute explosive chaos is the best I'd describe it. It's definitely well done, and nothing here grates my ears at all. It's sort of what you would expect a 16-bit title to sound like if it was made with 2018 sound quality.

[b]Replay Value:[/b]
Plenty. I mean oh so much. You can make any class you want in the game and it's quite hard so imagine the fun you will have each new run. Personally, I made a DOOM GUY class that regens ammo on kills and starts with a machine gun, but I also have a spy who hacks and has a tranq gun. I'm sure you can see how this drastically changes the gameplay, and makes for a lot of unique circumstances each run.

[b]What I Like:[/b]
It requires a lot of planning to come out on top in this game, and the sheer amount of different things you can do is quite impressive.

[b]What I Don't[/b]

The custom characters are awesome and can lead to even more chaos.

This game is a lot more fun to play than it is to watch, at least in my experience, keep that in mind when watching people play if you're deciding whether to buy the game.

Can't wait to see what the future updates will lead to.


Edit 27/12/2021.

Played with a dude called ""Romulus"" who went around as the Emperor of Rome, summoning powerful guards to do his bidding as I served him as a robot. 
Later on it became challenges for me to overcome as he sent stronger and stronger opponents alone and then in groups to prevent me from my goal. This went on for many levels and ultimately ended in dead by time bomb.

I cannot recommend this game enough, for all the love and development it has seen over the years. Eagerly awaiting the sequel.

Edit 1/3/2023

Still coming back to this game from time to time. Still holds up, still has all the same chaos and wonder its always had. An absolute gem of a find all those years ago. Looking forward to the sequel immensely, will be an instant purchase based on this game.

Shrink a building full of people and then stand outside the front door, casually stepping on them as they try to flee.
Possess a Zombie and start an apocalypse that you're only vaguely in control of.
Charge up a sneak-attack so powerful that it literally turns anyone in the game into tiny giblets, completely unarmed.
Use a Leaf-Blower to slam someone against an explosive generator, killing them instantly - or into a bottomless pit.
Cut yourself on a window to make room for sucked blood.
Pickpocket everyone in sight and use the money to buy, like, a Rocket Launcher or something.
Fill a Water Pistol with Rage Poison and pit a Goon against their client in a battle to the death.
Sneak illegal weapons into a wrestling match.
Assassinate a famous Musician with a banana peel.
Knock on the door, then slip into someone's house as they head back to bed...
Buy rounds for everyone, smell good, and y'know... run for Mayor like a normal person.
Arson!
Knock on the door and arrest whoever answers.
Enslave a Slaver to Enslave the Slaves the Slaver Enslaved, you Slaver Enslaver.
Bust ghosts for a quick buck, or just punch gravestones and run like hell from the spirits you awaken.
Go on a Werewolf hunt.
Possess someone's friend and ask nicely for whatever you need, then cut your host/witness on a broken window to dispose of them.
Silently breach walls to get in and out without a problem.
Trip someone into their own deadly security system.
Lure someone into their own deadly security system.
Turn into a Gorilla Kaiju and unleash a world-killing blow to obliterate the Mayor and their guards in a single punch.
Plant a landmine in some schmuck's path to set off an explosive chain reaction.
Eliminate all crime in a badass mech suit.
Lure a killer robot to take out your enemies for you.
Fist-fight a Gorilla.

[h1] Fantastic game [/h1] 
Great music 
 This is the first thing you will notice , from the title screen on this game has an addictive soundtrack that fits very well.

Solid Controls
 Either Mouse and keyboard or joypad , both have good controls wither it's shooting, moving, melee or interacting with the level the controls are on point.

Fun
If it's not fun why play ? Streets of rogue is always a good time, single player you can focus on unlocking achievements , new characters or speed running, multiplayer is pure chaos and adrenaline , trying to avoid a killer robot while your hacker friend distract's a guard by sending a refrigerator thru a wall so you can rescue a gorilla in exchange for a cheese burger, that's just a normal quest in streets of rogue.

Replayability
Tons of characters and even custom characters that you can mix and match special abilities on.
Hacker plays different from Gorilla players different from Commando plays different from Doctor and so on,  

Each one has the same main goal of reaching the final stage and becoming the mayor but how they do it is totally different, this isn't just a slight change of how you shoot a gun, they can have drastically different play styles.

My only complaint is not enough level variation, the level layout changes but the order of levels stays the same , it would be better if sometimes instead of slums you started in a different starting areas like a junkyard or warehouses , maybe go to sewers instead of a park etc (not so much shuffling the order of the levels but swapping them for new levels so that it isn't the same each time)
But this is a minor complaint since each of the areas play very differently from each other.

TLDR great game, Looking forward to Streets of Rogue 2.

I bought it originally just because it looked like some fun as a local co-op experience for parties and what not (you can also play it online mp). That's how it sat in my library for a long time, only really played heavily in that role. I always enjoyed it, but rarely had a chance to boot it up as other games or activities simply rose to the top for one reason or another. 

A friend of mine recently got me back into it and so I beat it a couple times solo. Its a solid little game with lots of Quality of Life design choices that are nice, and a good approach to rogue-lite / rogue-like gameplay. 

If you want something with a good bit of replay value at a decent price, and you like rogue-likes / rogue-lites, check it out! It's definitely worth its current sale price of $6 CDN, and I'd say its worth considering even at its full price if you see yourself really sinking your teeth into it, alone or with friends.

On the side of temporary progressions, there are many items to be found, bought or cloned, in addition to having a level progression between phases. 

Already in the permanent progressions, there are perks and rewards to be unlocked and also new classes for future matches!

So... the most straightforward option seeming like the best alternative, you hit him. But then the bodyguard in the corner see you so he and the barman teams up on you, and you are forced to flee while taking some heavy hit from a bat.
Healing yourself the best you can (with the small beers you found in the garbage), you come back with a better weapon you got after beating up a guy who asked for nothing. But it isn't enough, and you end on the street, dead, after going through the wall.

You want to tamper with the aeration of a building to make everyone inside flee, but a policeman sees you, then his colleague sees him attacking you, and their colleagues as well. And after 30 seconds of chase, you inevitably end lying down in a pool of your own blood.

But don't let this stop you!

After going through several games, you'll learn the tricks, how the AI works, how to use items, which upgrade to take. And soon you'll find yourself tricking the AI and laughing at their own blunders.
This game is funny. The stupid humor is yours to judge, but the chaotic aspect of the game is just GREAT. Seeing guards dying because of their own security, policeman shouting-out with gangsters over one missfire, a thief getting rolled over by a train just after fleeing a guy they just stole from will just make you break into laugher at the goofy side of the very well made AI.

The game go on like this: you enter a stage, you have task given to you (kill this guy, get this item, free this guy), and you can go to the next stage after completing these tasks.

But you have so many ways to accomplish them!

It mainly rely on the character you play. Thief steal and has access to infiltration tools, but cameras stay a weakness and his fighting prowess aren't the best. Gorilla can't use gun, but his charge deal heavy damages. Vampire can easily kill people one by one with his special attack, but this doesn't work against groups. Slaver? You're are a scum of a human being, and you will ENJOY being one. Enslave people on the street to send them do the work for you until their (explosive) death.

You just have to get the hang on the game. But this will not spare you from dying from time to time from some stupid sequence of event. And frakly, you'll hardly get tired of it. It's a great game.",1672243605,1672243605,True,2,0,0.541284441947937012,0,True,False,False

Recently I've been trying to pick characters as I play that have more social type of goals and sticking to that playstyle now realizing that is the intent.  With the Bartender for example, you have to serve 5 drinks per level to characters.  Initially I thought it was a pretty boring/slow character as I was having trouble even finding or coming up with enough money to even buy the drinks.  Once I took a moment to look in my inventory, I saw that I had a drink mixer that lets me make custom drinks out of various consumables (injectors for example) that gave me more options.  Some I could give to quest targets in a level to kill them without even attacking them conventionally which made Bartender MUCH more enjoyable than I had initially realized.

These recent runs have given me renewed interest in the game, and I'm excited to try out the other play styles available.  Also even more excited about Streets of Rogue 2 than I was before!",1671678823,1671678823,True,25,0,0.724601209163665771,0,True,False,False

I can't fucking explain it. I fucking LOVE this game. And I don't even LIKE rogue-lites/rouge-likes that much! This is one of my favorite games by far. I got on it after the whole hype about but it's fucking amazing. I got every achievement and I still wanna play more. You can really play the game however you want. Wanna be a homeless guy that beats the shit out of anyone? go for it. Wanna be a bartender and serve (not) poisoned drinks to people? yep! The replayability is crazy. The game allows you to play in a stress-relieving way where you create the most broken character known to man and blast through the game with ease or challenge yourself with a difficult set of modifiers. Or just play the game normally. There is DEFINITELY a learning curve to playing the game, but once you learn it, you'll STILL suck balls because you should've used that item there and you should've held onto that other one, etc etc etc. There's quite a bit of luck and you can lose hours of progress within seconds because a fire extinguisher counts as a gun (and so does a jerry can). All the times I've alt-f4'd out of the game I've only come back with more confusion than the last, but hey! It's a chaotic game and that's what it's all about. Nonetheless, I have fun with it and can't wait for the sequel.

It's a roguelike game where everything is randomized, so the layout is always different, missions and the rewards for the missions are always different. Different doesn't mean unique or interesting. All of them are one of the three mechanics I mentioned: destroy this, rescue this guy, get this thing from this place. Also, for each class they have an individual overarching 'big quest', but again, is simply a variation of the same mechanic ie. 'don't kill 100 people.' 'get a lot of money.' etc.

You can select a class which is a simple avatar change, and a few automatic traits and items given to you from the beginning. Some also have unique abilities like Doctors can chloroform, Thieves can pickpocket, etc. but again all of the abilities are 'destroy something/someone', 'someone follow you', or 'enter/exit place to get thing'. There are also the generic increasing stats, combat benefits and the like, but its all very flat. You can also purchase more options using the in-game currency, which is 'chicken nuggets'. To me it comes off that he wrote the punchline before he came up with the set-up. ""wouldn't it be funny if the currency was chicken nuggets.. tee hee... ok but how do I justify that? uhhh uhhh outlawed...."" Wouldn't chicken nuggets be a terrible choice because, you know, mold? Nope, the joke is more important, I guess.

The combat is you move the reticle around with the mouse and right click, then a little fist, or whatever weapon you're carrying, flies out next to your avatar and if you aim in the correct direction you'll damage the enemy. There is recoil, the enemy does random things, moves randomly, and will flee - which is annoying. There are some options like explosives, swords, guns - you'll find the usual fare. I liked the inclusion of the banana peel, but once they fall down, you chuckle, then it's pretty lackluster. 

To me the graphics look less like charming pixel art, and more like mediocre, simplistic, flash animation. Nothing really animates, it's more like everything is floating around, things appear and disappear, nothing feels cohesive. The explosions look nice.

Apparently, this game is made to be played co-op, and I can see how having another person would make the game more interesting. Because that person would be providing the interesting elements. Since I have no other person the game isn't interesting to me.",1669755838,1669755838,False,4,1,0.480069726705551147,0,True,False,False

Screwing around with all the zany characters and their abilities is a delight. Sure, some characters aren't as interesting as others, but the way in which the game accommodates the playstyles of each specialized class is top notch, and is definitely the reason to play. You have characters great with hand-to-hand combat and guns, but struggle to put a sentence together. You have characters that rely on recruiting allies in order to be more effective. You even have 100% viable stealth and hacker playstyles that work perfectly. The randomly generated environments are able to suit all playstyles effortlessly without feeling like a homogenized mess.

The items are very unique, albeit not as abundant in number compared to something like Isaac (which works in this game's favor). You've got solid snake boxes that allow for swift sneaking action, a tranquilizer pistol for a nonlethal approach, special grenades, food items, random syringes and so much more.

The character's special attributes and abilities are fairly well-balanced, and the ability to create your own character is just the cherry on top. I created an abomination that had a bunch of negative stats, which game me even more points to give him mind control powers and other crazy stat bonuses.

There's a fully functional level and chunk editor to spice things up if the generation is getting boring.

There's Workshop Support.

There's even MULTIPLAYER WITH UP TO 4 PEOPLE!

I'll definitely be grinding this game in the coming weeks, and I'll update my review if my opinion of it changes.

Want to go in, silently as a ghost and quieter than the sound of a cat's footsteps? You can.
Want to avoid going in, sending your minions/friends/unwilling servants and reaping the rewards afterwards? You can.

Do expect for odds to change considerably in a very short amount of time, both for better or worse as chaos engulfs you and your plans.

The concept is simple, but very well executed, you start as a character who you can either choose from the in-game roster or create your own, and while each character has their own skills and quests, you can play however you like, you then need to clear each district on a quest to become mayor of the city (there's 5 districts containing 3 floors each: Slums, Industrial, Park, Downtown, Uptown and mayor village is the top floor making 16 total floors), this usually takes over an hour, and considering how different each character feels while playing, you'll get a lot of time out of this. Completing quests of characters and missions unlocks more items and abilities, so you'll rarely run out of content, and if you do eventually get bored, there's tons of Workshop Characters, Campaigns, and new buildings to spice up each run, I've been playing this game for a long time, and I still find enjoyment in the gameplay (especially with my custom characters). 
If there's anything to be taken from this long review, this game has a lot to offer, and the developers are working on a sequel, so go ahead and try this game, It's a great game to jump into every once in a while, and can be very challenging (I still haven't beaten some of the harder Workshop Campaigns), but is certainly worth a try.",1668451421,1668451421,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A game that took itself seriously. Then when the tutorial was forced, my brother patiently sat and watched as I completed the tutorial. We both kept looking at each other as we quickly realized a something important about this game.
This game does not take itself seriously, and neither should you. Fortunately I can say I mean that in a positive way.
Starting to learn Streets Of Rogue is slow, but Streets Of Rogue is not a slow game.
My brother and I still don't understand exactly what affects the 'electability' statistic and multiple runs have ended suddenly leaving us with our mouths hanging open, yet we both agree we have a blast playing this game. 

There are two things that set Streets Of Rogue apart: the immense time, effort, and care that has gone into designing this game, which clearly shows. The other thing is that each class has a ""Big Goal"", which gives this roguelite *extreme* replayability because you play so much different depending on your big goal.

There's a wide range of big goals that range in difficulty as well.
You're probably going to like this game because even if you don't like how some classes play, there are others that turn the game upside down. Whether you want to sneak around pulling heists as the Thief, corner the market as the Shopkeeper, be utterly evil and dominate people as a Slaver, make friends through violence with the Zombie, arrest lawbreakers as the Cop (I guess enslaving people isn't illegal, but that's screwed up), or just tell jokes to become famous as the Comedian with the well-known line ""Derpa derp derp derp. DERPA!"" (Whew, that is a knee slapper there. Still brings a tear to my eye it's so funny), there's so much to do and so many ways to play that Streets Of Rogue is definitely going to hold your attention for quite a while :)

Endless replayability, amazing modding community with a near infinite amount of content, over a dozen unique characters with interesting ability dynamics, fun mutator system that allows you to have the run of your dream. I have no complaints, this game is a masterpiece of roguelike sandboxes.

The only thing that might be a criticism of the game is that a lot of the characters are quite unbalanced. The game is much easier using certain characters, and becomes extremely difficult with others. Personally I don't see this as much of an issue since all of them are, at the very least, fun to use, and I think this is at least partially intentional, but I could see someone getting frustrated about their favorite character being super difficult to get through the game with.

There are a huge number of character classes to unlock and try to beat the game with, and each class has a genuinely different feel (with the exception of the two gang members who are purposefully clones of each other). I especially loved the Hacker, hiding in an alley behind a building I was trying to sneak into by turning the security system on its occupants, then changing the odds on a slot machine to milk it dry. 

Game design encourages chaos - everything you do seems to have consequences, and I learned to think twice before using explosives or starting a fight. Character progress is enough to keep it interesting but doesn't take too much calculation - you get a small selection of traits each level-up, pick one. 

Not all of the jokes hit home - there's a broad spectrum from subtle and clever to plain old silly. That's okay too - there's so much going on that I before a joke that doesn't work for me starts to bother me, I'm into something else crazy (why not fill a watergun with Giantizer and shoot a bunch of zombies when they break loose in one of the frequent disasters that plague the city?). I don't do much multiplayer but I can definitely see how this fits social play as well - one-upping each other on the creative destruction sounds like a good time.

update: they now have a sor2 store page, I'm glad to see it's in progress and has a planned release date too. I had heard the dev talking about it in one of his latest updates, but I didn't find anything anywhere else abt it at the time.",1628626379,1666494931,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a roguelite game where each level is a wacky, highly lethal little sandbox of a city district and you can make some pretty crazy interactions happen if you know how the mechanics work. It's great fun to pop open and play without any special preparation or real stress.
My only complaint is that at about 200 hours the game started feeling pretty samey. Even with challenging mutators, the best way to win is pretty straightforward. As for the sandbox element, I started running out of things I hadn't already tried out at around that mark.
The modding community on the official Discord and chunk packs from the workshop kept me going for another hundred hours. There are some mods that shake up the gameplay pretty well, even if they tend to be a bit buggy, and there are chunk packs that provide unique challenges that require more foresight than the basegame chunks.
All in all, I'd recommend giving this game a spin. I don't know if the sequel will be any good yet, but I know that this one is fun, so I'd still recommend the first game.",1666309013,1666309013,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

It has you going through four or so sections - procedurally generated with their own objectives (plus class-specific objectives) per ""level."" You go from the Slums, to the Industrial level, to the Woodland area, to the City area, to the Upper Crust area. Each level is increasingly difficult and has unique enemies and situations to deal with, such as the Woodland area being overrun with cannibals and gorillas, while the City has mobsters that will try to steal your money.

You play as any of a bunch of classes with basic stats and special abilities, and can unlock some more of them by doing specific things in-game. The Soldier for example has good shooting abilities, starts with a machine gun and explosives, and has a specific class-objective on each floor to destroy all generators on the level. While the Vampire on the other hand has the objective of finding a hidden Werewolf on each floor to kill. Classes are unique and can let you play things relatively peacefully, with stealth, or through pure carnage.

NPCs will react relatively realistically. Cops that spot criminals will attack them, and you can trick people attacking you into attacking others to get them killed. You can make noises to attract enemies into traps, or hire followers to assist you (which you then use as decoys to escape), or take a pill that turns you into a giant and smash through the wall of the building your target to kill is hiding in. You can hack computers (with the right classes) to turn off security, buy items and such from NPCs as well as vending stations, and so on.

Each floor has missions shared between any players in co-op to complete, ranging from freeing a prisoner and helping them escape, to killing targets, to getting items held by certain characters or in safes, or so on. You have to complete these missions to go to the next floor, and they give rewards for completing them (items, or money, or such). You can spend money to buy items from vendors, or to revive other players in co-op, or to bribe cops, or so on.

All in all, it's a fun game. I have enjoyed beating it twice so far with a good friend of mine, and will probably play through it a few more times before I get bored.

Edit: I have now beaten it as a Vampire, Werewolf, Doctor, and most recently as a Mafia member.

I personally think it is more than worth the price, but especially in co-op is fun. Despite the rogue-lite nature it probably won't interest you for more than 10-50 hours since the amount of variety you'll get ""in practice"" isn't as deep as would be ideal, but there's still a lot to be enjoyed here.",1665433285,1665647701,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I hate roguelikes. I never saw the fun in starting a game from scratch based on the RNG not being in the players favour, but Streets of Rogue gets a pass. The game has customisable options making the game easier for people who are absolutely terrible at the genre like me.

Pros:

+ Vast variety of ways to play the game and a lot of customization.

+ Great sense of humour.

+ Great music.

+ Addictive and fun.

+ Turning into a giant and smashing through walls with a giant axe was a highlight.

+ Break into computer, open locked doors and safe? Sure! But don't read the emails that would be rude.

+ The deliberatly stolen line from Deus Ex about wandering into the womans bathroom was welcome.

+ Sandbox mode lets you cruise right through the game doing missions at your liesure without being forced.
(It's this player choice that really makes the game stand out in my opinion)

CONS:

- Information overload. A lot is crammed into the game and there is a lot of flavour text it can get overwhelming.

- The setting is a bit too dark (No daytime)

- Difficulty spike floor 5.

- It's hard to concentrate when you have allies and you are under attack by more than one enemy. You hit your allies by accident in the pandemomium and you can be dead before you know it.

- There is a continue option, but it's limited to only 2 continues, and you resume with low health if you entered the mission with low health.

Overall, I definitely recommend, especially on sale if you are not so keen on roguelikes like me, but if you love the genre, by all means its worth full price. Looking forward to the sequel.",1665427013,1665427013,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

""Well I had to kill a guy in some sort of maze like building, I had 3 window cutters, 2 lockpicks. So I dropped some rage posion into the air conditioning system and let his friends take him out. Problem solved!""

There's so many different ways to play the same game it's completely insane how much you can do and troll the NPCs in this game. Let's start with a door and your target is on the other side. Knock on the door, target answers, shoot to kill, problem solved. Stick a bomb on the door, knock, RUN, boom, problem solved. Just punch the f***ing door down then punch your target to death, AS A GORILLA!!! Problem solved! F**k the door shoot through the window until dead. Destroy the window and throw a bomb in. Use a flame thrower, rocket launcher, freeze ray, shrink ray, or freeze then shrink them and stamp into pixels. Drain their blood as a vampire. F**k killing them, put a slave collar on them! Punch them once, run and hope they accidentally shoot the police and then it's the Law's problem... solved!? There's sooo much you can do in this game!

The rogue-like nature of the game and the different types of characters don't just add challenges, goals, and replayability, they force you to get creative and that's when the magic really begins to happen. I literally completed the game without killing anyone and asking the end boss for the ""key"" needed to complete it. The boss was like ""ah you seem cool"" and gave me it! The game is dumb, fun and just dumb fun. The best part is the devs are working on a sequel set in an open world with vehicles.

The game takes place in a city that has been turned into a dystopia by a corrupt evil mayor, you are a part of the revolution and its up to you to stop him! You will be dropped into the city and forced to perform various tasks whilst avoiding the law and surviving.

Classes have varying different playstyles, each class has its use and gimmick. There are hundreds of items to help you complete your tasks. The Npcs that roam the city, are funny, fun to fight and can create hilarious scenarios, where one fight between two individuals causes an entire riot to break out.

Meanwhile all of this is accompanied by an amazing soundtrack. The fast-paced, jam-packed music really keeps you on your toes throughout everything.

For about 20$ for a fun experience with near infinite replayability,  you should definitely give this a try!

I'll definitely be giving the sequel a try too!

At first I thought it was like sweets, a dessert after EU4 or Pillars of Eternity but the charmingly simple graphics only suggest the hidden depths of fun.

I grew up in the 1980's (think ""Stranger Things"") and most of the games were very simple and on cassette tapes. It took about 30 minutes to an hour to fully load a game (or felt like it). I had one that my brother gave me that was about Baseball. Once, I got so bored of my collection that I stooped to play it (all respect to sport's lovers) but the character just stood on the base and tried to repeatedly hit a ball (the size of a pixel). I wanted to walk up to the pitcher and beat him to death. I couldn't.

But Streets of Rogue does let you. Imagine all the side-scrolling beat 'em ups from the 80s-90s (streets of rogue has a top down feel), and then imagine that you can go any one of the bars along the route, buy an ambiguous drug from a dealer and then hire a thief to break into the bar's back window to break into the safe. 

You can return and buy some health replenishing whiskey from the owner, with his own money, to then disappear into a town full of slums, night clubs, gang-hideouts, police stations, churches and prisons. Or you could just go into the pub and shoot them dead with a modded shotgun, take their stuff and use the bar-tender's own key to break into the safe.

Yes. I can hear you thinking it now. This sounds cool. Well, I'm 117 hours into it. Grand strategies are usually my thing but I was blown away by the imagination and sense of fun of the developers. There are five levels to each set game. You start in the slums and work through outer, inner and finally to the Elysium of the game. There are the wretched poor (cheap to hire) ""Go and hit that man over there, would you commoner?"". Vampires will creep up on you. Potential werewolves are hard to spot. Cannibals jump out of the bushes, like true pervs, and zombies will turn a town in under an hour. 

The resistance becomes active when you buy the DLC and get the Demolitioner. She is basically a hardcore activist/terrorist (depends what side you're on). There's two gangs that are in a constant turf war. Mobsters who will shake you down for cash or that you can bribe to sway the Mayorial election your way. 

There's many more characters and loads of ways to play each level. It can be as smooth as silk and then turn into a heady storm of destruction (unless you're playing the Doctor(Hippocratic oath)). You get to be all these characters (or make your own), with their own stats, special abilities (think thief- think pickpocket) and overall bespoke mission that must be achieved on each level. Each level has it's own missions too: acquire document, steal item, release prisoner, neutralize folk, destroy object etc.

Growing up with low graphics, memory and processor meant that my imagination had to fill in the gaps. Streets of Rogue really hits that spot. Each game has its own stories to tell. It suggests so many procedural, branching plot-lines that it's strength as a solid RPG is supported by the extent of the imagination of the player. 

So, if you want a fun way to occupy a billion half-hours then I truly recommend. It's really fun. I like hunting shapeshifters, they look like normal people but have a red tint to their eyes. You have to kill their host and then this nasty little (tiny) person runs away to claim a new victim. If you kill them they give you a nice payday. 

So, what will you do when you meet the Mayor? Befriend him, blackmail him or blow up his house with TNT? That choice, and a thousand others, await you in every game. Kudos to those who produced something truly and brilliantly amusing. I'm really looking forward to Streets of Rogue 2 too. I'd love to see a good road map. 

Round-up: So I love EU4 and Crusader Kings as dinner but Streets of Rogue is the best meal of the day with LSD and chocolate sauce on. That's brunch, by the way. Takes the pressure off both meals. Buy the game and if Streets of Rogue 2 has multiplayer we could meet up and heist a bank together. I suggest you play with 'rogue vision' and 'continue' as mutators.

This game feel unfinished and underwhelming. 
The missions are repetitive.  The levels are repetitive and not in a good way.


For example, a NPC will give you a quest to push some buttons for no apparent reason. Why am I pushing these buttons? It doesn't make any sense. But I will go to the next level and have to push the same buttons again, for no apparent reason. Then I have to blow up all the gas cylinders on a floor, for no apparent reason.

It has a certain video game-ee feel that not many other rouge-likes have. I love games like Gungeon and Hades, and don't get me wrong, those are fantastic games, but they also feel kinda (for lack of a better word) formulaic in their design. Go into this room and kill these guys then go into this room and kill these guys. Streets of Rogue also has very similar objectives but it gives you the freedom to explore those objectives in any way you want. Sabotage the ventilation system to lure your target outside, blow up the walls of the building to kill them easier, kill them with a refrigerator gone rogue, there are so many ways to experiment in each level with the wacky items and weapons that the game feels fresh every time you play it.

[h1]Why this one stands out[/h1]
Most (not all) of my points can be summarized as ""Variety"" . Here are the main few:
[list]
    [*][b]Sandbox-y[/b]. This is the biggest advantage this game has, because it gives you several ways to perform the same task.
    [*][b]Multiple classes/characters, with distinct playstyles[/b]. For example, soldier is an average starting class, a robot is built for OP melee, but runs on a rechargeable battery (puts some pressure) and a doctor is not allowed to kill, but can permanently put NPCs to sleep.
    [*][b]Different playstyles are supported[/b]. This is the first roguelike I play where the main goal isn't just killing everything that comes close to you (although you can!).
    [*][b]Procedurally generated levels and random quests.[/b] This is a relatively small point, but it essentially means, that even if you always play the same character, playthroughs will feel slightly different.
    [*][b]Random loot[/b] This is another relatively small point. Loot varies and RNG can either give you a massive advantage by getting exact weapons you need or limit your options by getting a few bananas.
    [*][b]Custom character[/b]. Once you get bored, you can mix and match abilities and drawbacks of other classes to create a custom one. 
   [*][b]It doesn't take itself seriously.[/b] Vast majority of games can't pull off meaningful lore or plot, but they still try.... That makes games that can laugh at their own flaws so much better. Here's a quote: 
The Zombie doesn't actually want to eat people's brains. I mean that's pretty gross. However, society expects it....
[/list]

[h1]Difficulty[/h1]
It's definitely not easy to start out. Everything, including weapons and armor in this game breaks, so you can't just go in and kill everything, unless you can do it with fists (and that takes some practice). It takes a little while to get accustomed to the rules of the game, but I would say the difficulty is fair. 
I did get frustrated a few times, like when I was playing a slow, calculating stealth class and then the floor filled with slime (which pretty much means you have to do things fast or die) and essentially killed me. I came back to the game, though which says a lot how good it is.

[h1]Drawbacks[/h1]
[list]
    [*][b]RNG[/b] I mentioned RNG being a good thing for keeping the game fresh, but it comes with a chance that you will be places in an unwinnable (with specific class) stage, or trip you up towards the end of a playthrough.
    [*][b]Steep learning curve[/b]. It takes like 5 minutes to get the core mechanics, but the game doesn't tell you much about anything else. For example.: you'll find machines like ATM or Loadout-o-matic (or something like that) and it's not immediately clear what they do (even if you interact with them).
   [*][b]Some characters feel useless[/b]. That is not to say that they ARE useless, but this is another thing the game fails to explain. Characters like Bartender do not appear to serve any purpose until you learn some of game's mechanics.
   [*][b]Roguelike[/b]. As I previously mentioned, I am not a fan of roguelikes in general and this one shares most of common complaints about roguelikes. The problems are alleviated by game's great design, but restarting over and over again for stupid reasons is still annoying.
[/list]

As mentioned before I would recommend this game to anyone who does not hate roguelikes. It's a unique one.

It has insane amounts of customization and characters. not only are there pre-made characters, but you can also make your own characters using items and traits you unlocked from other characters. And you can use the games currency, chicken nuggets, to unlock more traits and items for your custom characters. Also, this is for the devs, make it so that if your using a character with a translator, you can speak to the ware-wolf and gorilla in the home base.

maybe id recommend if this game was more like 5€, not over 3 times that.

also the character pack with 6 more playable characters is 5€, maybe 1-2€ would be more reasonable for few more pixels in the game and i cannot justify this at all.

people give this game a good review because it not a bad game per-say, but it falls flat after more than few hours.
you could go and buy any other similar game and most likely enjoy that more and for longer.

no shade at the developer, matt seems like an alright dude, but this game is not worth what it is, proof is in the hours of reviews no matter what anybody says.

maybe grab it when it goes on sale as see how it vibes, lots of the humor is either ""haha random"" or fart joke levels of bland and there is barely any writing behind anything, and also something to note on; instead of making this game worth the moneys, matt just decided that it needs a sequel.",1661571140,1661571282,False,1,0,0.382636904716491699,0,True,False,False

The huge amount of unlocks such as weapons, items, traits, and mutators allows for a personalized experience of your own.

I am 42.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.       Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

On the positive side, there're plenty of characters to unlock who all have slightly differing stats, traits, special abilities (some have none), and a big quest. The Cop has the ability to arrest people and wants to arrest/kill a certain number of people each floor. The Vampire only gets health back by using his special ability to suck blood from people and wants to kill all werewolves. The Gorilla has high stats but can't speak to people, shop owners don't want him in their stores, and his big quest is to free all other captured gorillas.

There're plenty of unlockable traits and item rewards from objectives. You can select which traits and items you want to show up but must keep a certain minimum number for each. They'll take a bit to unlock as you don't earn that many chicken nuggets (the currency for unlocking stuff) even on a completed run.

The last big thing is that the levels feel somewhat alive as even when you're offscreen, people are wandering about doing whatever. If a cop sees someone commit a crime, they'll go attack that person. If the blue gang sees the red gang, they'll get in a street fight, etc. You'll occasionally hear stuff going on offscreen and occasionally stumble onto some dead bodies and items lying around. Sometimes people get killed by random level obstacles.

The game has a lot of problem. It's split into 5 zones consisting of 3 levels each + the final level. The zones are different, but mostly in just annoying ways. The 2nd zone has hazards (explosive/poison barrels, minecarts) all over the levels that you have to watch out for. The 3rd zone has cannibals hiding in bushes that will pop out and attack you if you get too close. The 4th zone has gangsters roaming in packs of 3 who will randomly decide they want to take your money. There're also sewer grates all over the place where thieves will randomly jump out of and rob you. The final zone has roving robots that will attack you if they spot you for long enough. Anytime a robot or cop is engaged with you, the level throws up huge barriers blocking you in with your enemies.

Besides that, the game is incredibly repetitive. To finish a level, you need to complete 2-3 objectives. These objectives are all pretty much the same. Kill this guy, get this thing from this guy (usually by killing), press these buttons, destroy this object. Even playing as different characters doesn't change much up. If you're the cop, you're gonna play mostly the same as every other character, just make sure to arrest some people each level. If you're the vampire, you're gonna play mostly the same as every other character, if you find a werewolf, kill them. If you're low on health, find someone alone and drink their blood. Playing as the zombie and want to make zombie hoards. Sure that's fine for the first 2-3 levels, but you're going to be doing this for another 12 levels and it's time consuming. By 4-6 hours in, you've pretty much seen everything.

There're a lot of items but ultimately you won't ever use the vast majority of them, simply because you forgot that you have them or because they're not really as useful as you would like them to be. I've got this hacking device, surely I'll hack a computer in the future. Odds are you never will because there's rarely ever a need to. I've got these window cutters, I'll sneak into some buildings. Odds are you never will unless it's the only way in without causing some sort of mass riot. Your inventory will constantly be filled with stuff you think you might need in the future, but probably never will as it's rarely necessary. You're better off just selling most of it.

The melee combat in this is terrible. To start, every time you or someone else get hit, they go flying 10-15 feet away. There will often be large scrums of 4-8 people, so good luck keeping track of where you and your enemies are when everyone is flying around the room. Because of this, melee combat often devolves down to you just spamming the attack button in their direction or a circle around you. Hitting enemies can cause them to go flying into walls, destroying them. This means everyone outside gets to see what you're doing and often causes police/anyone allied with them to come flying in and start shooting/attacking you. There's no reason for this to exist other than the fact that if you could fight people one on one constantly there wouldn't be much challenge. So breaking walls was added to randomly create chaos to fuck you over. 

You can get/hire people to follow you around as a crew. By default, you're able to attack people in your group or allied with you. If you decide it'll be fun to form a gang, odds are you'll hit most of your crew in a fight against one person. In any sort of large scrum you'll almost certainly accidentally murder your whole crew. There's a trait you can level up and get that prevents you from hitting your teammates, but you have to be fortunate enough for it to randomly show up. Some classes like the zombie start with this. Even more fun than this though is that your crew will often incidentally hit someone not involved in a fight and now that person is hostile to you. This will often cause a 3 v 1 fight to turn into a 3 v 15 fight as half the level is now hostile at you, despite you not even doing anything. You're better off not having any followers since odds are at some point, they'll do something to get you killed.

I've already mentioned some of it, but there's a ton of random nonsense that will annoy/frustrate you or simply get you killed. For instance, every 3rd level in a zone has a random mutator that causes some event. This can include things like a killer robot shooting rockets at you all level long, a gang war, police attacking anyone outside, or after a minute or two a sludge starts filling up the level and you lose 2 health each second you walk through it. One of the mutators causes random status effects every 15 seconds. One status effect is ""Dizzy"" which makes you lose complete control of your character as he wanders around in a small circle. Have fun if someone is hostile to you and you randomly get the dizzy status... cause you'll be dead before you get control back. The third zone will sometimes have landmines randomly placed around so you'll sometimes stop somewhere to do something and get blown up. Expect most of your deaths to be a result of some random nonsense.

Then there's the annoyance of constantly having to be alert for any number of things. Oh, here comes a thief down the street, better change directions or he might randomly rob me. Oh, here comes a vampire down the street, better change directions or he might randomly bite me. Oh, there're some cannibals, better walk another way or they'll attack me. Oh, here comes a zombie. Oh, here comes a robot, gotta run away from him or wait for him to go somewhere else, oh look land mines, oh look explosive barrels, oh look poison barrels, oh look wall thompers, oh look a switch that activates pits, oh look grates that shoot out fire, etc.

Only bug I can remember running into is that occasionally some person, in a building with no windows, would magically see me through a wall, turn hostile, and come running out of their building to attack me.

Streets of Rogue is somewhere around an above average game that is fine for killing some time, but it quickly gets too repetitive. It seems like it wants to encourage you to try doing interesting stuff, but there's either no reason to most of the time, punishes you for doing so, or just frustrates you with the random annoying garbage that occurs.",1658762657,1658768605,False,10,0,0.554745852947235107,0,True,False,False

In all seriousness, god DANG buy this game right now!! It has no rights being this cheap right now so get it quick!
If you want an actual reason why this game is good, everything about it is so charming and fun! The dialogue, the strange people you meet, the item descriptions, and even ways to kill people can be quite funny (Yes I died to my own banana peel I threw on the ground myself before)
I'll admit myself, I actually didn't think I'd like this game when I first started back in 2020. Everything felt a little slow to me and I was even considering just getting a refund but I gave it the benefit of doubt and decided to just keep on going. Boy was I glad because it ended up being the best thing ever. There are many different classes to choose from fitting different play styles! You can play as the Soldier who has lots of weapons so you can easily barge into places and kill everyone for your mission, or if you don't like that the Doctor allows you to play it more sneakily and safely, not being able to use most weapons but having the ability to knock out foes from behind with just a single click! Along with having a tranquilizer gun! Playing as a Gangster? Recruit your gang members across the maps and get them to do your biddings for you! (Admittedly they do get more scarce later on in the levels lol) Are you a cannibal? Eat the dead bodies to restore health! Especially when they are cooked! Are you a comedian? Tell jokes to the poor passerby and they can kill for you... or kill you!
You also get a lot of items in this game as an award for completing missions (or sometimes you find them in the trash lol) which you can use for your other missions, like infiltrating a vent with cyanide and killing everyone in a building! Or infiltrating it with ""Rage Poison"" instead and having everyone who takes it in kill each other! Or putting a boom box outside in a floor of deadly ooze that slowly kills all the people that run to it as they slowly dance to death! Also, every time you level up and get to the end of a level, you can unlock new abilities from a random list that'll help you even more!
At the end of every three levels there will be disasters that will spice the gameplay up and will force you to think quick! Finish the level before the zombies get to you, the killer robot is out to kill you, there's literally a war going on oh my god don't get killed, DEACTIVATE THE BOMBS IN A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE ENTIRE LEVEL EXPLODES which is my personal favorite for how my first time getting that one I was two seconds away from blowing up everything!
Especially with every level being randomly generated, this game can offer a lot of variety and uniqueness that makes it really enjoyable with replay value! I find myself coming back to the game a lot because of that!
God this game is so fun and multiplayer gives you a whole other experience lmao, I'll admit I don't know how online is today but the absurd but hilarious people I randomly met before on random servers I hopped into were the best thing ever, it would be so chaotic but really funny and fun seeing everyone just kill and blow up everything haha, if you have a friend, co-op will give you an interesting time!

Overall, this game is quite the experience especially with how cheap it is right now. I think my decent chunk of playtime says a lot about how much I think this game is good and to be honestly I didn't realize I played it that much, just get this game right now dangit!!",1656841656,1656841656,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Loves the rogue-like genre,
- Wants options on how you complete missions,
- Needs a replayability factor for hours of gameplay,
- Is looking for a new setting with lots of danger and excitment,
- Wants a funky but not obstrusive soundtrack,
- Likes a dose of humor and insanity with their games with all the situations that arise,
- Enjoys a fair amount of customizability with their experience,
- Craves a challenge at times OR just a casual playthrough at others,
- More content being added fairly often (as of this point),
- Needs a fun multiplayer AND singleplayer experience,

And can deal with:

- The 'stealth' being a little bit too difficult sometimes (The game often favors a smash-and-run play type).
- A FEW minor bugs here and there, especially in multiplayer
- Sometimes feeling like a death was unfair because of the chaos that arises,
- The game not being... oh, wait, it's finished! And is super fun all around, with a sequel on the way!
- Killer robots

Streets of Rogue is not only a masterpiece worthy of every bit of praise it receives. But it has the honour (at the time of this review) of being the only roguelike I have actually finished.

Streets of Rogue's premise is so simple, I can sum it up quickly, yet so complex, I can keep playing again and again and again.
The city's mayor is corrupt and you need to overthrow him. But before you can do so you need to clear a series of missions given to you on each floor of the city.

How you clear those missions is entirely up to you. Need to take an item off someone? You could pickpocket them, bribe them with money or a rare item, buy it off them, enslave them so they have to give it to you, hypnotise them into giving it to you, gather some goons and weapons and threaten them... ... ... or just straight up kill the guy and take it. Whatever works.

The only limitation you have is defined by your choice of character. All of which have a skillset that completely affects how you play the game. You could be knocking people out quietly to avoid killing as a doctor. Stealing bodies to disguise yourself because everyone hates you as a shapeshifter, offering drinks safe and hazardous as a bartender, obeying the law as a cop, turning security systems on their owners as a hacker, hunting werewolves as a vampire, you can even be a zombie and turn the entire map into your very own apocalypse.

And if that's not enough, you can even make your own with all the skills you've unlocked.

There's a lot going on and I often wonder how the developer, Matt Debrowski finds time for everything. When  I emailed him about my issues with the werewolf, he happily responded and explained what I was doing wrong. Turns out you've got to lunge like there's no tomorrow once transformed.

All you have to do is get through a number of floors, populated with civilians, gangsters, cops, and much more.
But then you discover you can bribe some enemies, even win them over to your side. And then you find a posession stone, and suddenly you can possess anyone, say, the police - who now trust you with their keys to the cells. So you free a handful of criminals who run amok, creating just the diversion you need to move on.

And so, so many other things. It's a true joy to cause havoc in this game. Commune with animals, and let gorillas do your talking for you. Or play as a zombie, and turn the whole population into green friends!

Speaking of friends, the game truly shines in coop multiplayer. There are endless strategies to explore, and cooperating is a mixture of delicate planning and aggressive creativity.

One problem though. Why don't cops, or most NPCs for that matter, take into account moments of self defense. For example a man stabs me. I kill them. I am immediately murdered by three cops. 
Another example.

I shoot a bullet at it in the open streets. I am knocked into a roaring fire by a security guard who was mad that I was shooting at the robot. I die.

A lot of the difficulty is variable and this game values the player's choices on how hard they want the game to be. Not many rougelikes offer what is essentially a difficulty slider with a lot of buttons in favor of making the player die over and over again. Granted you can die in Streets of Rouge as easily as any other rougelike, but I've found this one to be the most enjoyable that I've ever played. Gameplay is somewhat simple, but nuanced enough to where anyone can quickly pick up the game, and the immersive sim elements are very entertaining to watch play out. The levels are very interactive, and it makes the game feel like a large sandbox that can kill you.

This game's somewhat limited, despite having user generated content and a workshop. If there was an easy way to mod the game and publish those mods on the steam workshop instead of a third party website then I believe that the game would become far more replayable than it is now. Another issue I have with the game is that going through the same five regions tends to get really repetitive. The Binding of Isaac made sure this was less of an issue by extending the run's endpoint after beating an important boss on top of adding alternate areas with different gimmicks to occasionally replace the ones that you'd run into. One last thing: this game is heavily underrated. While I've noticed the game has streaming integration, it doesn't really have enough players or an active community behind it. I think that a decently large update being released for free that adds on to all of the good mechanics already in place while also adding newer content would help it greatly.

Still interested in the sequel, but IDK how much I'll get out of this one.

e - the more I play, the more different this game feels from the way people describe it. Immersive sims give you options. This game is more like tantalizing you with possibilities that don't exist because it simply places too many options out of reach at any given point. Maybe if you sink a few hundred hours into it, it becomes satisfying, but I mostly just find it super frustrating because the game is more interested in denying you options than letting you play with them. Also the combat really, really sucks. Getting hit disjoints your camera from your character, so as soon as you get hit you have no idea where you are and... it's just not a fun experience.

Wandering thieves and vampires will strike if you're in their sight for too long and mobsters will mug you. Drug dealers take drugs in combat. Slum dwellers will pick up stray cash on the ground. Rare shapeshifters hide in the bodies of random citizens.

Procedurally generated city environments with a focus on neutral NPCs to interact with, emergent gameplay with countless interconnected mechanics that make every mission beatable with a huge range of strategies, goofy kitchen sink setting that cares more about being fun than anything else, etc. You should probably already know if you want to get the game (you do) based on that, but there are two underrated features that I think are worth mentioning which provide far more content than you might expect.

The first is the level editor. For whatever reason many fans of the game don't even seem to realize one exists, but it's amazingly powerful in terms of what it allows you to add to the game and the variety this brings is... well, not infinite, but close enough. You can fully build levels and campaigns from the ground up, which would be cool enough on its own, but what really makes this shine are the chunk packs. These add additional buildings and terrain to the level generation that can be mixed and matched for any of your normal runs. If you're even a little familiar with roguelikes you should realize how great this is, new level layouts are the lifeblood of the genre and this makes them functionally limitless (you don't even have to do work yourself, plenty of packs exist in the workshop already that collectively add thousands of new locations to visit).

The other underrated feature is the mutator system, the obligatory modifiers that vary the rules of a run. It's not unexpected but it's worth mentioning just how many additional gameplay modes these open up. Miss Hotline Miami? Turn on low health for all, now you have access to infinite randomly generated HM levels. Turning on disasters every floor and excluding all but one makes that disaster happen on every floor... obviously, but experiencing the entire game as a raging warzone or a mad dash to disarm bombs hidden around the city can be very fun and different.

Combining mutators and custom content can rework the entire game in some surprisingly versatile ways. At the end of the day it's still the same topdown roguelike as the vanilla game, but the point is that if the concept of this game appeals to you even slightly then the $20 price tag is a ridiculous bargain for the amount of content available. I'd easily consider this my favorite game of the past decade and with over 2,500 hours invested so far I still can't see stopping anytime soon, it's kinda like Minecraft but if every house you built got added to the world generation and then served as the stage for some really zany action movie hijinks.",1651188330,1651188330,True,59,0,0.839288294315338135,0,True,False,False

...
Okay, the like 2 people tops who read any of my previous reviews probably expect more.

Alright, so, here's the deal: You're a member of a resistance in some chaotic layered city. The mayor has banned chicken nuggets. It's time to overthrow them, going from the tiny wooden buildings and rampant crime of the slums at the bottom to the gold-lined Mayor's Village at the top. Sounds pretty simple, right? Of course, the leaders of the resistance have things for you to do on each floor before you move on. Retrieve some compromising evidence, rescue some poor sap, 'neutralize' someone, push some buttons in a secure building...

You could, of course, do the simple yet perhaps boring thing of shooting everyone who gets in your way down as a Soldier, well equipped for such business. Or maybe you're a Thief who's more skilled at sneaking around, taking stuff right out of people's inventory, and running away. A doctor with a vow of non-violence and a rag doused in chloroform? Or perhaps a slum dweller, with nothing to your name but a bottle of whiskey and the promise of getting stronger and richer if you somehow pull off reaching the top.
The tools you have available will define how you approach problems. Hire some gangsters to do the dirty work? HIre a thief to open a path more sneakily? Burst in and fire away like a maniac? Or maybe you've got some oddball items to deal with the current situation... Poison in the vents could do a lot,, if you avoid the cops' notice, or you could switch places with your target while surrounded in traps in a secure building filled with guards. Then again, perhaps a bit of bribery will do the trick.
If all else fails, there might be the chance to start some gang violence, the two local gangs truly hate each other. They'll fight on sight!

Truly, a bit of creativity goes a long way, when the streets are (mostly) safe for you to plan in.

Though sometimes, they're not so safe. On the last floor of each district, chaos takes hold. A bounty on your head, forcing you to be careful as any shopkeeper or person you might want to hire could be wanting to collect instead, a riot in which everyone outside will strike at anyone they see, a zombie apocalypse, a killer robot with a rocket launcher slowly pursuiing you... A lot more trouble awaits on those floors... But perhaps some opportunities, too. Zombies might be able to do what you can't, with some baiting, and the upside of having a rocket launcher predictably fired at you is that you can kinda direct where dodged rockets will land, maybe opening a big hole in a building that would otherwise have required you to slip through security.

From there, all that's left is optionally accomplishing your character's personal goals. Buy a house in the posh Uptown, eradicate the opposing gang, avoid killing, steal stuff beyond what you're instructed to, that kind of stuff! And if you're nice enough to the people who aren't... Indisposed, by the time you leave the floor, who knows, perhaps when the time comes, you can simply be elected mayor.

And then there's multiplayer, up to 4 people playing different classes!
Perhaps a Soldier providing the power, and a Scientist offering oddball tools and syringe buffs? Both types of gangsters, able to manipulate both gangs but having to avoid each other while you do so lest your followers attack the other? A hacker to deal with electronics, a thief to open doors and safes, a doctor to knock people out- Wait, is this Monaco now!?
The options for teamwork... Or madcap chaos that gets in each other's way as the Zombie player starts a mini-apocalypse each floor and the Soldier fails to exercise restraint when using explosives.

And that's before you add mutators to customize the experience! Maybe everyone, including yourself, is squishier. Maybe everyone has guns. Maybe everyone has [i]rocket launchers[/i]! Or maybe the zombie apocalypse is upon us. Or perhaps breakable weapons aren't your jam, and you'd like them to be unbreakable? Quite a bit of customization, especially when you can also create your own character with a customized inventory, with a points system for a semblance of balance... That you can completely ignore if you're willing not to unlock anything while playing them, because maybe you really do just want to mess around with a really OP character.

Its one of those roguelites where buying new unlocks dilutes the pool of things you can get randomly in the field and makes it harder to get what you want which, unfortunately, makes unlocking upgrades a kiss-curse.

It IS fun which is why I gave it a thumbs up but I only played it for a day or two before I got bored. You can do a lot of interesting things but the number and variety of interactions is not what the trailer hypes it up to be. Its also one of those games where you can be doing great for hours and one wrong throw or miscalculated angle (or hell, random event) could instantly end your run.

For $10 or less you'd certainly be able to get some enjoyment exploring and trying out new things but it didn’t have the staying power of a roguelite with a true progress path or the raw indulgence of skill progression from a true roguelike.

You have over a dozen unique characters, that play in unique ways and have unique objectives and challenges. 
You can beat the game in various ways, you can modify the gameplay, you can unlock more traits and mission rewards and handpick which ones are active. 

The game is cheap as hell too, I convinced 9 people to buy this game, everyone loves it, even if less than me.

Examples: I could toss a grenade in through the window after I break it; I could put poison into the air ducts to weaken or simply kill everyone inside; Go in guns blazing!?; Bare knuckle it up, or I could place an Explosive device near an outside wall to my objective, give the enemies an invisible kiss and run far away while I watch them get blown apart in a smokey aftermath of carnage. 

Tons of playable characters and even some to unlock! Most if not all have different abilities so you are able to come at every individualized map how YOU want too! For some players, the pacifist route might be the way to go, or even silent as a ninja, killing nothing, but taking everything.

There are perks you gain in-between levels depending if you leveled up during the current map you're on that help enhance who you are, and how you play to give everything a little added spice.

You also have the ability to CREATE YOUR OWN CHARACTER! You have a certain amount of points and ability points you can spend on any newly made character and this is where after you've beaten the game a few times and know your playstyle, you can create the ULTIMATE YOU!

After 100 hours, I still haven't played every character and I'm less than 50% of the way to unlocking everything. It's easy to introduce new players to the game, even if they don't game much. And playing is fun even if you aren't winning. Both local co-op & online multiplayer are super smooth. In multiplayer, a teammate can revive you by sacrificing money or health. So, when things go hilariously wrong, not all hope for the run is lost. In single-player, dying due to RNG or a ridiculous situation can be a little frustrating since you lose the run immediately and you don't have friends to laugh with over it. Highly recommend playing with friends!

I cannot put into words how much fun this game is. Every single time I boot up this game I end up having the time of my life, this game has so many different ways to play it that you can make every single run different from the last in major ways, it is the most roguelite roguelite game i've ever played. The characters are perfectly unique, the items are fun and nonsensical and every level is a brand new strategy to come up with, if you like games where you can simply press play, spend your time then stop then this is perfect for you.

100/10
excited for Streets of Rogue 2

I have over 500 hours on the Xbox edition, and bought it again here just to support the developer and do even more stuff to contribute to the community!

The trailer might seem like your generic ""Do anything! Be anything!"" type of deal. You expect it to over-promise and give you only one slice of pie, *just like a certain game released by a certain critically acclaimed triple AAA game developer studio*

cough cough Cyberpunk 2077 cough cough

But, strangely enough, the trailer is kinda right. No, sorry, REALLY right. There are LOTS of stuff to do in the game. I'm too lazy to list them all, but there is a lot. TONS of characters to play around with, with each of them having unique traits that distinguish them from one another. Don't like them? MAKE YOUR OWN! Got tired of being alone? PLAY WITH UP TO 3 FRIENDS! Getting bored of the building layout and characters? INSTALL SOME WORKSHOP ADD-ONS! There is just so much you can do with this game!

The only cons I can think of is the multiplayer, both online and local. Online might be a bit toxic at times, and local only supports split screen with only 2 people, 3 and 4 people makes it so every person is on the same screen. It kinda restricts movement by teleporting players back near everyone else, and it might be hard to follow your character admits the chaos.

Like... 

REALLY good. It is shocking to me how a game that I have never heard about in the years it has been out is as good as it is. I am actually upset that I didn't find this game sooner!

Usually a game that promotes as much freedom as this game does usually has the caveat of, ""Just shooting the guy is the best way to solve the problem."" Not this game. Combat, stealth, diplomacy, and wacky antics are all equally viable.

Streets of Rogue also doesn't seem to promote the fact of just how many playable characters there are, and how unique they all are. It is absurd how much variety there is in the characters. Even characters who seem like they should play similarly like the wrestler and jock play far more different than I could ever expect. If you play as a zombie, it is gonna feel like you are a zombie! And in the statistically unlikely case none of the classes in the game feel like they quite click with you, you can create your own custom character!

On the subject of customization, if any aspects of the gameplay don't jive with you, the mutators allow you to enable or disable many option settings for the game. Don't like the third level? Have it not show up! Feel like characters have too much health? Lower it! Feel like the game isn't fast enough? Raise the speed of everything!

You truly feel as though you can do anything, since there are a limited number of rules, resulting in everything that is there, be fully interactable with every other thing. Now, that's not to say that the limited number of elements is restrictive, since there is still a degree of variability in which you might commence a certain action. For example, the main thing you can do with a generator is have it blow up after a few seconds of taking enough damage. This can be done by many ways including, but not limited to, shooting with a gun, punching, hitting with a weapon, or even enslaving an npc and have them hit it for you. Once the generator has been hit, the sound will grab the attention of the landowner and any goons they might have in the vicinity. Then, the resulting explosion of course kills people in the vicinity, but also destroys wooden walls and will get the attention of nearby npcs. Every element of Streets of Rogue is fit together so perfectly to create a detailed simulation that the player can then go about completing their missions in any way they could think of, further enhanced by the variables that different characters provide and the gear they might have on hand.

   The overall gameplay of SoR is that of a rouge-lite, meaning you go through randomly generated levels and earn permanent character, gear, and trait unlocks through achievements and bonus missions on each level. Each level you need to complete 2 missions: these are either neutralizing someone, getting an item from somewhere or someone, or flipping switches inside a building. While these seem really repetitive, the variation that is inherent to the game as well as the freedom of approach you get, make these missions really fun, especially in the later levels when the stakes are increased and new elements are added. There are also optional ""big quests"" you can complete for xp that are unique to the character you're playing and will require you to do the same thing each floor such as destroy all generators or kill certain npcs. XP allows you to level up and choose from a randomly selected pool of traits, these give you new passive abilities that let you create and refine your own build as you play. There are 3 floors each stage and 5 stages. Each stage has a different gimmick to it which increases variety and adds new challenges for the player. Getting to the end solo on an early playthrough is very difficult but with unlockable characters that allow to find a playstyle you like combined with the new gear and traits you can put into rotation make it easier, but still intense. The game is also extremely fun co-op and can be delightfully chaotic but I don't have a lot of experience with it.

Streets of Rogue is an endlessly fun, very complex game that provides a fun sandbox to explore. If you enjoy rogelikes, immersive sims, or even just think the concept sounds cool, SoR is worth a play, especially at $20. Additionally, if you enjoy the game, I would say the character pack DLC is worth it since it gives you 6 new characters, 3 of which are basically playable npcs, and 3 being really unique characters that significantly change how you play.

Between the randomly generated levels and variety of characters with different strengths and play styles, most runs will be meaningfully different. The core of the game centers around picking a character and using that character's abilities and items to complete a few objectives per floor. True to the basic rogue formula, you have only one life per run, but each run through the game only takes 45 minutes to a couple hours depending on your playstyle.

The real draw in the replayability, which comes from random level generation, and the myriad of character classes. Each character has a special ability to make them unique and guides their play style. For example, combat focused players might choose the soldier, who starts with weapons and grenades and has a special ability to heal when low on health. But combat does not need to be the core of the game; you can pick a character such as the bartender, who can mix drinks which can then be given to characters to make them friendly to you (or kill them depending on what you put in the drink!). This variation in characters plus the randomness of levels and items given to you creates great replay value.

The game sports pixel art graphics which fit the theme and gameplay style well. The music is top notch and I recommend the soundtrack.

This game is also great in co-op, where you can pick characters who complement each other to making penetrating the city and deposing the mayor much easier. If you find co-op makes things too easy, there are also mutations you can add to the mix to change gameplay elements such  as increasing enemy difficulty or adding a time limit to each floor.

There is a fun and vast variety of classes to try out with a large array of random items/ weapons to purchase and find throughout the game. 

The randomized events that occur every third level brings a challenge to the game as well as the increase in the number of cops and quests that need to be accomplished per level.

Even when the base game is completed and fully explored there is mutators to make the game more interesting.

And on top of that a supported workshop to add more variety and fun to any play-through.

Sure, there is a wide roster of characters with varied-playstyles, but the mechanics are so mind-numbingly basic that any nuances between how each character plays merely serve to distract you from the fact that you'll be playing through the same levels, completing the same missions, killing the same enemies, and really just running through the motions time and time again.

The game is a rouge-like* with every level being non linear and each having three missions plus a special mission if you find the person. How you finish them is completely up to you. Use your items, pay someone else to do it for you, maybe even do it yourself! You get to play as all sorts of characters, with each providing a unique gameplay style and a big quest (completing a big quest unlocks a super secret ability). You'll eventually start earning chicken nuggets to pay for more stuff to play with such as new items or traits for custom characters. Mutators spice up the game and could even help you turn it into GTA Online (turn on ""everyone carries RPG"" mutator) or even better, 2020 mode (I'll let you figure that combo out). Overall my opinion of Streets of Rouge is awesome, there isn't a game I played that's like this and I'd pay full price for this game (getting this game during a steam sale is also cool).

One problem I always have with games where you have classes is that they don't really change the game too much. In the Endless series, for example, you can still play the game relatively the same with the same objectives regardless of whether you play the ""economic"", ""diplomatic"" or ""military"" faction.

Not in this game.

I have something like 80 hours in this game and I still feel as if there is so much of this game I have not played - because nearly every of the 30 ish characters are different.

Let me give some examples. 

You want this game to become a gang war simulator? You can play as the crepe or Bland, who can automatically make others join them and have the optional objective of wiping out all of the other.

You want to be a sneaky baka? You can be the assain, walking behind a bunch of people and 1 shoting them without anyone knowing you were ever there.

Or play a sneaky thief, using tools you buy from other thieves to avoid having to interact with anyone to get what you want.

Play as the mob, making the game into an extortion simulator, play as a zombie and track down every NPC as they try to hide in their homes, play as a hacker to turn of all the annoying police checkpoints so the citizens can't call for help, or play as a slave master to enslave people and force them to do your dirty work for you. 

All the characters change how you act towards a situation and how you account for the NPCs, which makes this game have endless replayablility. 

Plus I have encounted no bugs with the base game (although it of course gets a bit weird when you install like 10 packs to change up the world).

I decided to play in a random server but, FF is turned off in your personal settings, not the server. so if you have FF turned off, you cant damage other people, but if they don""t have FF on, they can damage you.

this game ROCKS!!!!!

I can't stress that enough.  This game fills a need for people like me (an 80's kid) who miss when the majority of games used to be good.  It's still in alpha.  BUT IT IS AMAZING

You can create your own characters, customize the rules of the game, kill, steal, arrest, hack, enslave and just do all those things you know you really want to do in other games.  It's a pixel art, NES ""Zelda"" type feel where your imagination is the limit for how much fun you can have with it.  It's a simple ""on this floor, do these things"" but the fact that you can destroy anything (in some cases, only with the right amount of explosives), kill anyone, be anyone makes this game superb.  Where else can you play as a monkey and beat scientists with a shovel?  It's a fresh take on adventure gaming that the world of PC games so desperately needed.  I urge you to buy this, support the devs (they're awesome people, btw) and help make this game the success it deserves to be.  There are hours and hours of hilariousness schinanagins to be had.

Streets of Rogue is...
Eeeh... Hmmm...
Mission based beat 'em up in small open levels...
Something like that.

Describing Streets of Rogue in simple way is very hard, so it's better to explain how you play this game, so you get the most accurate picture of this game.
So here we go:
You are part of the revolution group. Your target: The Mayer in Mayer City.
Choose your character with many possibilities and own personal side mission.
Every character has their own possible play-style, skill and possibilities after level-up.
Character examples: Thief, hacker, soldier, assassin, cop, fireman, comedian, street bum, werewolf, vampire, robot, scientist.

After character selection your game starts and you enter the slums.
Your goal is to complete stage's mission in order to get a permit to advance to the next stage.
For extra XP you have your personal mission based on your character.
How you do these is up to you:
Use bombs, be sneaky, gather a gang, shoot everyone, talk with charm, use bribes, make enemies fight each other.
Or have a accident, that solved your problem for your amusement.
Just don't get killed, okay.

Complete three stages to get into the nest area, that is different in some way from previous.
Each place has their people living there, doing their own stuff.
They can be friendly, neutral, annoyed, angry or murder happy dangerous killers, that want you dead.
Also there's people, who sells interesting stuff, like weapons, items, food, drinks, drugs, medical service and other stuff.
You can also hire people if you have money (and they tolerate you).
Just be careful to not get into trouble with police, as they are tough and armed.

Level up your character, learn new skills, get items and money, arm yourself, hire allies.
Then maybe, MAYBE, you manage to save this city from The Mayor.
Or become the next terrible mayor.
Or die by setting yourself on fire or getting eaten by cannibals.
I don't know.
Try again if you fail, since many things in this game are random or can be added / mutated.
Bring your friends also, so that there's some great team work (failure) to experience.

Positive Things:
+Big game with lot's of stuff.
+Many levels & different missions.
+Solo or Multiplayer ( 4 player co-op).
+Split-screen Local Multiplayer.
+Custom Character Creation.
+Randomness, so many fun randomness.
+Good sense of humour.
+Make your game easy or hard. It's your choice.
+Looks good.
+Many ways to play and challenge yourself.
+Stable game, never have crashed for me.

Negative Thing:
-Randomness CAN make things difficult for you.
-This isn't a easy game, but not in a bad way.
-This is kinda one of those games, where you create your own fun.
-Needs the use of imagination and sense of humour.
-Doesn't contain AAA-game style graphics.
-One live, no continues (although multiplayer has 'revive' system if at least one player is still alive).
-Need many controllers for local multiplayer, which can be a hassle to set.

If you are looking for a good game to play, either solo or with friends, then THIS is one insanely funny game for you.
I had so much fun with my friends while playing this.
We had many memorable moment and laughed out loud during every session.

Although it doesn't have the cool synergies of Isaac or the blood-pumping action of nuclear throne, the thing that makes SOR stand out from the rest is the sheer open-endedness of the game. allowing you to tackle missions and tasks in a copious amount of ways.

want to rip and tear your way through the city machine guns blazing? You can do that.

want to be a zombie and have every level end with everyone being a nice shade of undead green? You can do that.

hell, do you want to beat the game as a pacifist who makes friends by telling jokes and having those friends kill people who think you're an unfunny hack? You can do that.

sky's the limit in Streets of Rogue. It even has multiplayer (you and your friends can be a group of rampaging gorillas, this has actually worked out surprisingly well for me one run)

all that, along with some great music, and some pretty good writing makes for a very good package that's worth every penny.

In this game you go down floors and you have to complete the main objective on a floor to move on to the next one. You can complete other quests for more XP but they aren't required. Some objectives include infiltrating a building to rescue a prisoner or acquire something confidential (like an incriminating photo), or you might have to just kill a guy or a group of people. There are so many characters to play each with their own unique weapons, utilities, stats, traits, and a special ability. For example, I enjoy the Doctor who can knock out people with a Chlorophorm Hankie on a three second cooldown but cannot use any weapons apart from throwables like rocks and banana peels. I definitely would stream this because I think that it is quite entertaining. You sometimes get random events that happen on a floor. I one time got a zombie apocalypse floor where zombies infected literally everyone on the floor and I had to complete my objectives fast before it became unmanageable.

The way it stands out, however, is the freedom you get to use these benefits. Pre-generated classes with a vast amount of unlockable ones make for increasingly different playthroughs, each character having their unique ability and side-objective to complete or ignore at your leisure. 

Despite being developed by one person, Streets of Rogue continues to deliver a unique questing experience each playthrough. It accomplishes this by allowing you a large amount of inventory space and incredibly varied effects between each item you hold, with no cap on how you can use these items in tandem with one another. Each XP level you gain during your playthrough allows you to choose a feat from a randomly generated list, which can be more varied as you spend chicken nuggets on more traits to add to the pool. These concepts aren't things too alien to the industry, but put together in this manner, not to mention with the excellent coding ability of a single individual, it makes for a unique experience that'll keep you coming back.

You can turn this into a strategic puzzle game by playing hacker and thief and other passive classes, or a Hotline Miami style action game by putting on a few health modifiers and playing as the soldier or other combat classes (which still allows you to earn unlocks). Each class has a very distinct style and it's not just limited to ""fight"" and ""don't fight"" playstyles as there's a huge spectrum of actions you can take to try and survive your run.

It's very rare these days that a game surrenders itself to you and just lets you play whatever way you want and acknowleges it as a valid way to play. You can probably cheese this game because of that, but the game is so fun that I've never been compelled to do that.

Even once I died, before I remembered I had resurrection. My heart was pounding. I had to focus. One slip up, it's all over. I had acquired a cyanide pill some ways back. And I wasn't going to waste it on just anybody. I was patient. And I waited. And then I saw the mayor and his huge posse.  I failed this task last time. Not so now. I shoved the cyanide pill into the vent, and watch as the fearful and incompetent authoritarian turned into pink sludge. I casually walked inside, and adorned the hat. That's how I became mayor.

the way the game's set up, combat-centered characters gain a huge advantage, leaving characters with literally nothing to their name to get creative with what scraps they can hopefully get from the trash.

[i]Streets of Rogue[/i] is an arcade style rouge lite game that can keep me interested for a good while. while I waited for the game to go on sale, I must admit that after playing for 12 hours this game was worth the 50% off value, as though it provided more than its share of moments to remember, after awhile its ability to keep my interest only stands out when I invite friends over to play co-op.

Pros:
- Enough unique characters/classes and variety to keep you hooked and try each one out at least twice to learn their abilities, secret objectives, and interactions with other NPCs, objects and items.
- Chaos; ""[i]wanna start [spoiler]a zombie apocalypse?[/spoiler][/i]"" ""[i]wanna go [spoiler]full on ape?[/spoiler][/i]"" ""[i]wanna cause [spoiler]a robot rampage?[/spoiler][/i]"" Streets of Rage lets you do this and so much more, I would add more to the list but half the fun is discovering what you can do and I was able to cause these three scenarios within the first 5 hours of gameplay and unlocks. 
- Multiplayer availability, with the addition of remote play (via Steam) there is no excuse why you shouldn't invite your friends to play along with you. you could play cooperatively and use strategy to complete missions, or you could play the ""[i]Fun Way[/i]"" and do your own thing while everyone else causes mischief due to miscommunication and pure insanity.

Cons:
- Although there's plenty of character unlocks, its equipment and item variety are not lacking but feel too similar sometimes, specifically the melee weapons as too many use slash and stab motions, personally (and perhaps they are later unlocks for all i know) I would like to see weapons like nunchucks, a whip or flail that provide an extended rage but at the cost of less damage than their closer ranger counter parts.
- Sometime you can be playing a blessed run and then be cursed by some unstoppable madness that is out of your control and just ends your run there and then. To be fair this game is one of many games that are [b]Chaos Incarnate[/b], but when you lose a run to something out of your control it can be a buzz killer and sometimes puts me off from playing another run for the day.

Great and funny sandbox game with rpg elements. Various ways to achieve your goals on quests and many many ways to mess around (in a pretty weird way, if you prefer). Achievements: possible

[b]Story[/b]
While there is no real story and you mainly go for short missions, it still feels like you’re aiming to achieve a great goal.
Well, in the end you have the possibility to be elected Major after all.
Frankly, this game does not even need a real story. As someone who is no fan of too much sandbox, I really appreciate the numerous possibilities Streets of Rogue offers

[b]Gameplay[/b]
You can play Streets of Rogue with keyboard/mouse and also with a controller. In my opinion the controller configuration feels intuitive. I use a steam controller and most of the time I change something in the settings. This time everything felt good from the start. Maybe you want to switch some things to your likings, but all in all, this is designed very well.
When you’re playing solo, you get a bit of slow motion when browsing the inventory to make it easier to eg switch weapons. Of course, this does not happen in multiplayer.

LIke I have mentioned, there are plenty ways to do the missions. If you want have to free some prisoners, you can for example
[list][*]kill the policeman and unlock the cells
[*]hack the computer (if you have a hacking device or you’re a hacker) and unlock the cells
[*]steal the key and unlock the cells[/list]
This is just one example about possibilities. There are many more ways to achieveme many different goals.

One of my favorite happenings was when someone caught me in the act, chased me and tried to shoot me, they sometimes accidentally hit another npc. That way npcs start to fight. If the npc belongs to a gang or maybe to the police, a real mess is coming up. I happened to cause a war between around 15 npcs from time to time. Afterwards all were dead and I just collected the loot they dropped. Win.

By doing mission you earn chicken nuggets (the ingame currency) which you can use to unlock further features like mutators. Mutators change the game’s settings and make it partially easier or harder.
You can also create your own class. Just be careful: If you custom class is overpowered, achievements will become disabled as long as you play that class.

The sole downside for me so far is that it is sometimes a bit annoying to connect to friends. When inside the same home network, it was sometimes necessary to directly connect to the ip.

[b]Looks[/b]
As you might have already seen from the pictures, the graphic is rather old school. I really like nice and beautyful graphics, the current graphics fit the game perfectly.

[b]Achievements[/b]
It is totally possible to unlock all the achievements and in contrast to some other games, it is also a lot of un.

[b]Pros[/b]
[list][*]lots of possibilities to achieve your goals
[*]nice humour
[*]convenient controls
[*]you can unlock mutators to make the game harder or easier
[/list]

[b]Cons[/b]
[list][*]sometimes it took some time to connect to friends, which is annoying
[/list]

[b]Conclusion[/b]
Streets of Rogue is a sandbox rpg-like game that offers you numerous ways to achieve your goals. By playing, you will unlock various classes, each with their own strenghts and weaknesses and also with their own personal goals.
While it is already fun to play solo, playing with friends is even greater because you can spread literally swarm out and cause chaos.
The controls are made very well and fell good to play.

I can only recommend this game. It is just great.

I just wish it was a bit longer. My favorite characters in the progression I played them were the hacker, the doctor, the zombie, and then the shapeshifter. I still want to go back and have a zombie army win. The hacker can just interact with so many objects, which is quite fun.

The game is genius, at first your experimenting with the huge variety of characters, exploring the sub-systems and messing around, gradually you start getting better and rather than trying to do all the cool (but silly stuff) and start attempting to beat the game, even then then the game is brilliant as you work your way through the floors, seeing all the new challenges, from the ponds and cannibals of forest to the highly policed streets of uptown, every level makes the game better (except for stage 2, industrial which seems only to exist to trap and set me on fire :-). 

The game has quite a high level of difficulty (well I am not particularly good at games so probably easier for most) because if you make mistakes, use up your healing or fumble a shot things can quickly escalate, this encourages patience. Fortunately the range of characters helps with frustration by giving you different ways to tackle things, some of my personal favourites being the soldier, who's wide range of explosives help him get into buildings/around obstacles and firepower helps him get out, the werewolf, the only character who I've beaten the game with and a character who's playstytle changes from sneaking around carefully avoiding violence, to massacring 5 supercops in a blood-bathing werewolf attack.

The next great thing is the level of customisation. You can change pretty much anything! The settings of course offer a lot of customisation, where you can turn anything from blood and gore to screen shake off, but this is all pretty standard, in the mutators, character creation and level designer is where this game really takes off. Mutators allow you to change features of the gameplay to your liking, want the whole game to be a zombie apocalypse, you can, want to not have melee weapons breaking, you can do that as well. This allows a level of tailored fun that I wish other developers would commit to because games are meant to be fun and this allows a large amount of people to enjoy this game, and optimise the right amount of difficulty and chaos to your liking.

To be honest some may not use character creator but to me it is one of my favourite parts of the streets of rogue experience. It allows you to create pretty much any crossover you want, do you like 80s action movies, why not include rambo and diehard. Creating pretty much any character you want is already a tempting promise but combined with the level editor, there is practically endless replayability.

Now I have enjoyed playing streets of rogue immensely and really want to say thank you to matt (the dev) for making such a polished and brilliant game. I hope if anyone reading this review is convinced this game is worth buying, because it is. This is my first review and I wholeheartedly recommend this game, the most underated gem I've played in a long time.",1623486959,1623486959,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've been burned more times than I care to admit by pixel-genre rogue-likes, but this game is one of the good ones. It also happens to be a fair amount of fun, and has replayability.

There are something like a couple dozen characters you can play, and while the general gist is similar, some of them play completely different. I've now done over a hundred runs and am improving my success rate, but you don't even have to do the whole run in one sitting. You don't even have to do the whole run in one run either, if that even makes sense. As you beat the starter areas enough times, you can actually choose to skip them. While I've never done this, I like the way it's implemented, and I can see where it could be handy.

The writing is super-cheese, but it actually works. I'll be the first to admit that the tutorial, which many found funny, did not immediately impress me. I'm really glad that I kept playing because this is one of those hidden gems like Slay the Spire, Rimworld, or Terraria.

Not that it plays anything like any of those games! What they have in common is that they're all made by indie devs that just focussed on making good and [i]complete[/i] products. Yes, the game has a DLC character pack, but it is not required, was not immediately available from content trimmed at launch just to sell a DLC, and did not come at the expense of the community. The guy is still making fixes to the base game.

I was originally sceptical.

I've been made a believer.

Give it a chance. You might just love it. The devs clearly did. They even loved it so much they made it extensively customised. The level of control the game eventually hands over to you to customise your experience really sells it over: Don't like something? Get rid of it. You want more of something? Make it happen!

The multitude of classes puts a fresh spin on the chaos, though the game can eventually become repetitive.

This game is extremely fun and has great replay value, especially because you can play it pretty much however you want, that is to say that every objective can be completed in any way you like, from sneaking in to a building to just blowing everything up. The art is pixel-y, which might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I personally don't mind it. The game is also just funny, for example, most items have descriptions which are often just jokes and the 'hints' in loading screens are great (one of them is 'Eat healthy food. Not in the game, in real like. It has no effect in the game'). I think something that sums this game up perfectly is that one of the options to get rid of the mayor is to sneak into a building, steal a recording of the mayor saying something mean, and playing it in public, causing the citizens to get rid of him for you. So yeah, I recommend this game.

I am a big fan of roguelikes and this one really provides every option that a roguelike should.  Most roguelikes will only really give you customization of what your character has and items.  This gives more.  Every character is unique and most characters have their own special abilities that can allow them to come out alive from certain scenarios that others can not.

This game is also very chaotic.  One minute you could be fighting the entire police force with banana peels and the next you could be trying to buy cyanide pills to serve in a cocktail.  This game creates crazy scenarios almost every level and it will always be up to you how it is resolved.  It makes for incredibly intense levels that feel very fun to play and progress through.

So, I recommend the game.  Will most people play as long as I have? (114.3 hours as the time I'm writing this)  Probably not.  Most people seem to quit around the 10 hour mark, but I promise it will be worth your time and money always.",1616916142,1621102435,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Ode to old school types from the 90's, where artists and developers created a lot from very little.

If you like indy games, old school 'gameplay first' games, you might like it.

Top down 2D rogue-like, twin directional type of combat(movement/aim separate). Melee is more nuanced than gunplay, as you can block/parry melee with melee, but traits allow for all kinds of wrinkles(things you add to your character rpg style in your current run). The variety of classes and custom classes will alter your approach. Some will be very rogue-like, others are more smashy smashy, or a mix of both - or something else entirely, such as the Comedian whom will acquire followers so you can tell people to do what you need instead of doing it yourself.

A lot more fun with friends or randoms! Team orientated. Lots of replay and content for 20 dollars and I haven't personally touched or tried any mods yet, which potentially can add tons more including endless levels, from what I hear. But vanilla will keep you busy for a while.

As it is a roguelite, the ""cities"" (called floors in this game) are very minimalist and randomly generated for each try. There is also currency used for permanent upgrades as you go along, hence why this is a roguelite, not a roguelike. Honestly, I recommend it. Unlike the more recent deux ex games that push you into taking a stealth approach, this game at least has separate characters that each have loadouts and traits pushing you in a given direction depending on the character you picked. While this does allow you to play the way you wish depending on the character you picked, it does mean that you won't be able to change your gameplay style in the middle of a run. Your character defines you from start to finish.

The game is a bit lacking in hooks to keep you playing beyond unlocking new characters but its still decent enough in this regards. Overall, I recommend this if you're looking for a new deus ex game or you're looking for a roguelike and you're bored of issac, hades, enter the gungeon, syntetik, dead cells, and noita.

Walk in
Neutralize target/Flip switch/Free NPC
If you feel like it, do character quest (so like open a chest or kill someone)
Leave
Repeat
The game's progression feels useless, you lose melee weapons super quick due to durability and the only ammo must be bought.
The melee combat is horrendous, you walk around and swing wildly and hope you hit someone.
Allies are useless and just get themselves killed, stealth is impossible with them.
The stealth is horrible, you just gotta run when the goons aren't looking at you.
There are so few enemies and so little variation the game gets dry, quick.

After playing more:
My refund got denied and I wanted to add on more of my experience:
If you wanna win easily on the last floor, you need as many people to like you as possible (electability)
Problem is, there isn't a visual indication when they are annoyed (and will bring it down), you have to hover over them to see it.
Then you have to kill all annoyed people.

You either have tons of money, or are poor. Debt is very misleading (If you kill the lender, your still in debt), and there's no reason to take it.
The rooms feel the same, and a large amount of buildings aren't randomly generated (jail, basic goon hideouts, apartments, etc...). 
The character you choose pretty much forces your play style. No swapping allowed unless your willing to spend 300+ money.
There's little difference between killing someone, knocking them out, or sneaking past them.
Death can happen anytime with 2+ enemies, no matter how much you gear up (all armor is temporary).
Guns do so little damage (Shotgun is 12 dmg on a close range hit).
There are so few weapons (Guns: Shotgun, pistol, flamethrower, Melee: Baton, Baseball bat, Axe, Sword, Knife, and a few others).
Inventory management is a pain, and every mission gives more non-stackable junk to add onto it.
It feels like there is no reason to do missions, or stay around the floor risking it for vaults/chests.

My suggestion: The developer(s) could probably learn a lot looking at other similar games and taking elements. For example, look at SS13. Make a lot more systems more in depth (such as syringes! They're so simple! Add some depth for dedicated chemists!). Make weapons/abilities combo with each other like Gungeon, so players have to plan out what weapons to choose. Weapons are also 99% useless anyways, there is no reason to run n gun because regaining health is so hard and dodging is so finicky. Make classes less restrictive, they're classes not entire play-styles, and I hate playing a bunch of the classes due to the needless restrictions (though some add fun challenges, that's different).
There also needs to be a lot more variety, the city doesn't feel like a city at all because half the NPCs don't move or wonder on a certain path. Non-cops should roam around, interact with each other, talk, etc...
Quests need a huge overhaul. The entire game is based around quests! Maybe make them multi-stage, add more different options on how to complete quest (steal item from civilian by killing/knocking them out vs steal item, charisma check the civilian, draw them out of their house and sneak in (not doable for small houses)). I'd love to see SS13 (again, I know, but it's a similar game)-kinda interaction with more systems and some sort of building/disguise system.
Later levels having some sort of sewer system would be nice too, it feels impossible to escape cops and the gutters aren't usable by players (unless a certain class can, but then I bet it's just like the trees/bushes).
Minions could be expanded also, maybe some sort of relations system (""You sent my friend to their death/are walking into a death trap, I'm gonna leave unless we're real good friends"" kinda thing). Animal minions would be cool also, and maybe better control over them if you want to use them as a distraction.

Those are just a few ideas I have that I feel would expand the game in a significant way, trying to break the ""fun once, bland later"" problem with most of the game's gimmicks because they never go into much depth other than stealth (which is mostly negated because the doctor is completely broken).

TL;DR Gameplay is stale and based off of your starting character, weapons don't vary enough, the random generation doesn't change anything, big quests are lame, doctor is omega boring and never gets stronger, guns are weak.
It does kill time though.",1588632756,1618253901,False,3,1,0.417039334774017334,0,True,False,False

Behind the scenes it's a procedurally generated twinstick rpg, but the setting and diversity of classes make it a billion times more immersive than any other game of it's kind. Every character in the game has their own way of thinking, life goals, likes, dislikes and alignments. Player involvement with them can change their life completely, usually by destroying their property and killing them, but such is life.

Unlike your standard rockstar/ubisoft open worlds full of civilians, this world is inhabited by 20-30 different classes of workers traders, entertainers, medics, law enforcement, criminals etc. You soon learn to recognize each type and deal with them accordingly, depending if they are at home, at work, just walking around or running from violence. Not to mention that SoR hacker is a billion times cooler and more fun to play than a Watch Dogs hacker.

The diversity and placement of characters is quite unique, nobody is truly ""a monster that just destroys everyone else"" with a possible exception of zombies (which are actually pretty nice if you're a zombie). And every class can be pacified in some way. You hate cannibals always trying to kill you from the bushes? You can mind control them, zombify them, sometimes charm them or just play as a cannibal. Police bothering you just because you constantly break the law? Bribe them, befriend them, play as the police, there are so many options, it's insane.

Oh and it can be played in co-op which increases the number of options and potential chaos by a trillion percent. Anyway, buy it and play it. If you saw the trailer, you probably already know if you're going to like it.",1616942970,1616942970,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Despite borrowing the best out of those games, Streets of Rogue is still a unique game.

It offers multiple ways of completing objectives, many customization options, many things to unlock which greatly improve the game's replay value. Decision making is crucial for your survival. Much like a puzzle game, you will have to calculate your chances of survival before acting. For beginners, it's a bit hard and you will die often, but it's never a frustrating experience because you keep learning by your mistakes and usually always gain enough ""nuggets"" to unlock new stuff that'll be useful next time. Most of the time, your death will be hilarious and will make you laugh, you'll call yourself stupid for doing whatever got you killed and you will move on to start yet another game. As your gaming experience starts building up, you manage to reach higher levels which of course get harder and harder. Even when you finish the game ( which you will find is quite short when you do finish it ) for the first time, you will always want to start over and over again. The randomness is key to this game's success because nothing is ever the same in Streets of Rogue.

With great music, a simple yet effective game design, great action/reaction AI, hilarious content, multiple unlockables, character/level creation and challenging gameplay, you have many, many hours of fun ahead of you.

Not that many interesting stuff in workshop. 
Not sure what part of the game resemble Deus Ex and GTA, but whatever.
Procedurally generated city give the feeling of  ""Ah, here we go again"" rather than ""Wow, so many things to see!"" (not appealing nor inviting enough for the efforts to explore.)
The ""complex AI who are just trying to get by in their daily activities""... lol. Even Stronghold's or Settler's civilian units look more realistic... it's just plain dumb AI.

A repetitive Deadcells-ish kinda game. More ""depth"" than Deadcells, but also more boring than Deadcells.
Qualified for the price. I like the humors, still a boring game in general.

(the time I spent instead of calling it enjoyable hours, I'd call it ""willpower hours"". Don't get me wrong, there are things to do and experiment as long as you don't mind the ""predictableness"" of the whole damn thing.)

The concept of a roguelike set in a city works surprisingly well, and the game executes it almost perfectly. It has a lot of content, even without the community made stuff. It isn't perfect, though. The game is pretty unbalanced when it comes to different characters, and there are a few exploits that can make certain situations trivial. That being said, a lot of the challenge comes completing the game with many characters (which all change up the gameplay significantly), and the largest exploits have been fixed. The only ones that remain are small, and take a long time to find. lastly, the game is very accessible. There are many ways the game lets you alter its difficulty, including mutators, custom characters, and skipping areas of the city.

Overall, I highly recommend Streets of Rogue. The only reason you might not want to buy the game is if you're a fan of harder, tighter roguelikes. Even then, if you're intrigued by the idea of the Streets of Rogue, give it a try.

This is an alarmingly good game with immense replay value. The few flaws it does have (mainly surrounding created characters) are nothing in comparison to the sheer chaos and entertainment of the game itself. Nearly every playstyle is viable so long as you're willing to be creative. Character archetypes range from murderhobo to pacifist to team builder with plenty in between and off to the sides. DLC characters add to the game meaningfully, though some are better than others. It's important to note that each character is unique and some are far harder to play than others, so if you have trouble try another character.
My one real criticism is that it doesn't have a proper modding API for code. As much as it does have plenty of custom content (new level pieces, characters, campaigns) I'm the kind of guy who loves adding new features to games and tweaking existing ones. I know it's a Unity game so implementing such a thing is pretty difficult without just giving out the code but if this game could take code mods it would be basically perfect in my eyes.",1611434597,1611434597,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You pick a class, spawn into town and get told to do a few things. Kill this guy, steal this thing, rescue this loser. Its a very basic premise with a lot of fun to be had thanks to the large variation in class ability and items.

Classes range from your basic 'hit stuff good' classes; an ape that can do double melee damage, a jock who can destroys walls, etc, to the weaker utility classes; a hacker who can make fridges run through walls for him or doctor who 1 shots unaware enemies but doesn't use weapons. 

So say your goal is: kill this guy
The ape could just walk in, hit him, done. But everyone around has guns. You don't have the hp to tank all those shots, so you look around. You see a vent. You put a random syringe in the vent. Poison. They all walk outside, slowly lose hp to poison. All gathered together. So you hit them all at once. And they all die. Problem solved.

The doctor, instead, just knocks on the door. A guy answers, gets annoyed, turns away. 1 shot. Repeat. Easy.

But say things go wrong for the doctor. Its a struggle for him to deal with this. He's absolute ass in a frontal fight. So you eat some 'sugar' (cocaine) and run the hell away. Problem solved. But that area is dangerous now; they all want to fight you. So you never go back.

The way the classes interact with the world and the npcs in it is where the fun is. There really is a lot of variety here. 

However, this can get pretty annoying some times. Every 3 levels you get  a 'special' zone. With restrictions like 'all cops aggro on you for being outside and all doors are locked' or 'the floor is slowly moving lava'. These events tend to just screw the weaker combat classes. You get forced to move fast as classes who are designed to take things slow or fight as classes that struggle to fight. Its annoying.

Where the game falls to pieces is balance. All the above is assuming you are playing classes to their strengths and weaknesses. But what you can do, with few exceptions, is just use guns. 
Melee weapons have default 100 max durability, break nearly instantly and need to be replaced entirely when this happens. Despite this they do mediocre damage. And, of course, are only useable upclose.
Guns use ammo. They run out, you keep the gun. They have ammo dispensers built into maps; melee has nothing like this. They do very high damage. And stunlock. And are safe. Even if you have 1 gun skill (the lowest) you are still often better off shooting than melee. The balance is that bad. And ammo is so cheap, its trival to never run out. 
In general, the game is too generous with money; its also trivial to carry around more instant healing than you will ever be in danger of losing.
Most importantly, there are 'clone' machines. For a price, they 'clone' an item. You get +1. And there's an item called the 'giant' pill. It makes you giant  with house sized melee range, only take 1 damage per hit most of the time, walk through walls and nearly instakill. Its incredibly trivial to just spend your cash cloning these, ignore your class and walk over the game. Removing all challenge. The item is absolutely broken. Its borderline god mode. 

Now let's talk progression. In run and out.
In run progression is... lackluster. You gain exp for doing jobs/killing/picking locks/etc. Get a maxed bar, you gain 1 level and fully heal. Then at the end of the stage you get to pick 1 ability. And most of them are not worth caring about. They are incredibly underwhelming. So underwhelming that, despite the hours I have in this game, I struggle to remember the majority of them. 
A big problem is they are very specific. 
Like: You can recruit 5 people. But I'm not recruiting anyone. Because allies are stupid. Any class that IS built around recruiting will usually already have this. So offering it to me is just pointless. Same for any other follower based trait. 
Or + unarmed damage, reduce how much melee slows your movement. I'm a character with 4 in guns. Why would I want this? 

Every 3 level ups you get a 'special' levelup. If you have no right click ability, you get +1 to a random stat offered. I dislike this. It homogenises classes. I don't pick the ape to shoot things. 
If you don't have  a right click, you get an upgrade to it. I like this. It furthers the uniqueness of the classes... shame it rarely pops up as an option. And there's no mutator to guarantee it or remove the + stats.

So the further in the run you go, the more the classes feel the same. Which is boring. 
You can also spend cash to upgrade traits you like, but most can't be upgraded. Or remove those you don't, to also make classes feel more samey. But at least this doesn't take 1/3 level up options. 

Outside of the run you spend nuggets to unlock mutators, new items and the like. Its very basic. Play long enough, you get everything. Not much to say here. Its liken the absolute minimum level of metaprogression needed to call this a roguelite.

The final progress is 'super classes'. Every class has special goals to do per floor area (areas are made of 3 floors). Kill x people, kill < x people, hack this thing, etc. Do this without fail every time and finish the game and you get a super class.
Mostly these are just the regular class with all their right click upgrades. Feels very lazy.

The final thing to cover is stages. They all follow the same basic structure; a box with buildings in it. But have their own gimmick. 
First area is easy, second has cannibals aggro on you for no reason, third fills every building with 20 million traps, fourth has mobs aggro on you for no reason and fifth fills every building with 20 million traps and also has robots aggro on you. And the 6th is just punching 1 guy in the face.
I dislike the areas where people just pop up and pick a fight with you. Its just annoying. There's really not much to them beyond that. They're basic but functional",1611329631,1611329631,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So, u're bored with steam's flagships like FTL, Hades, Enter the Gungeon, Don't Starve, Darkest dungeon, Slay the Spire, Dead Cells etc... and feel like they're all good but something is still missing.. give Street of rogue (SoR) a try.
At least, this little shit makes me LAUGH in stead of RAGE-QUIT.
 
Im a skeptical and thoughtful buyer. Just played 1h of this game when writing this review, but I did researched almost all reviews on the net/reddit/youtube, watch 5hs+ gameplay on YT. These are my habits when I buy any game, so I dont have to regret it later.

Some insights for anyone considering to purchase this little gem:
- Acceptable Pixelated graphics. I dont bite pixel art style, and this is my biggest concern on buying SoR. It turns out OK, because I'm immersed enough into the gameplay and forget about the art style. 
- Fully supported controller: Im getting old and lazy now,  so I only play on couch with a controller. SoR did it job perfectly.
- Gameplay: If u re looking for a topdown bullet hell like Enter the Gungeon, this won't suit you. Instead, think about GTA. SoR is Immersive sim + Roguelite + somewhat topdown shooting (If you CHOOSE so). Yes, the devs advertised correctly about SoR's strongest selling point: you're free to choose how to solve the missions, not just brute forcing.
- Replay value: Too soon to tell, but If u want to complete the game with all those characters, it could be 100 hours+ easily. Each character is unique and you'll find yourself play a whole new game with each char.
- Repetitive: Yes, the world and mission pool are kinda repetitive. But I don't really care. Like I said above, Immersion is real lol
- Deaths: You'll die alot. However, games like Darkest Dungeon/Hades/Dead Cells make me rage-quit (this was the reason why i bought SoR, to cool down my anger lol). SoR doesn't bring the crap out of me and make me LAUGH 50% whenever I die. This is, IMO, the biggest selling point of this shit.",1611115190,1611115190,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's basically no story here, the world is amusingly confusing and incoherent, music is there but forgettable, and the pixel graphics are good but nothing amazing.

But holy cow this game is so much fun. The core of the game is pretty straightforward. You enter a world area, have objectives (like go here and kill this guy, or retrieve this item), and once you're finished you go the next level. Once you've played all the levels, you win. But what makes the game just so much chaotic fun is the different character classes. You have just LOADS of options, and they each will go about the objectives very differently. You can play a ninja and stealth everywhere, or a doctor who just knocks out everyone with chloroform for a more passive play style, or a gorilla who just melees his way to victory, or a zombie who just infects everyone and then just kinda does the objectives as an afterthought once the apocalypse is taken care of. The amount of depth in the game mechanics with these classes is surprisingly deep, and it feels like a totally different game in many ways depending on the character you're playing. With the ability to make custom classes there's just endless fun here.

I have played many rounds of Streets of Rogue. Sometimes we die immediately and sometimes we go all the way. There's no way to tell what will happen because the RNG of each level can really get ya. I personally never found that to be frustrating though, because the game tells you who it is in the first moments, and every death is hilarious. 

The characters and unique strengths are also a blast. My favorite to play personally is the vampire. You spend half your time attempting your objectives and the other half attempting to corner victims away from crowds so you can discreetly suck their blood. Another favorite is the gorilla. You are super strong and tough but don't speak a bit of English. Also you spend a lot of time avoiding those pesky scientists that want to lock you up!

I wish I could name all the horrific deaths I experienced off the top of my head. I have blown up, been shot, been eaten, been smashed, been set on fire among other things. 

I prefer to play with friends because the assistance getting through levels is helpful and it's also a great time. You go through a lot of trial and error picking characters that compliment each other well enough to get through most of the game and even then the RNG will still get ya.

This game has changed the way i see life in a great way, simultaneously ruining how i see open world games forever. Dude, i'm serious. Fallout New Vegas has been my all-time favorite video game since i was 12 and Streets of Rogue has blown it out of the water on the first day, in terms of replayability. [b]Honestly it's probably best to go in blind like i did, but if you want to know what you're paying for, read this review...[/b]

[h1]WARNING: THIS IS A ""10/10"" EXTREMELY POSITIVE REVIEW[/h1]

This review is entirely based on facts about the game, and how I feel about those facts. I haven't noticed many flaws at all, so if you're looking for things you might dislike about the game, i'm not sure this is the review for you.

[h1]-REVIEW START- [/h1]

First I'll just say that this is my first ever steam review after having an account for over 8 years. Why? Because this game is so good that i couldn't stop annoying my friends about every unique story i have in a playthrough, so here seems like the perfect place to vent. The beautiful thing about it's permadeath element is that the game is so open-ended, dying doesn't even feel like a penalty. 

This is a game where nobody is your friend. Unless you can get them to be. It's also a game where you have no enemies. Unless you want them to be. This game is not an RPG, it's an RPG simulator where really the only constant scenario is the city life, and even the city's environment changes plenty -- not to mention the extreme structural change of the maps every playthrough. 

So when i die, it totally does feel like a penalty, because my specific plan for a specific situation turns out to be an unredeemable failure. But EVERY TIME, that feeling of loss is fogged by the fun experience of discovering new possibilities in how your adventure could push forward, and then you're given a completely new campaign to the point of feeling rewarded! Also, you get some pretty tasty chicken nuggets at the end of every playthrough if you level up or do optional missions.

This game is a perfect example of the dream game I've wanted for a very long time, where you can be the widest variety of characters. Every playthrough is a unique story based on who you play as. It's truly mind-blowing especially considering there's well over 20 characters. Even if you play the same character twice, the events, locations, and characters involved in your journey are completely different every time! Take advantage of the game's super malleable system of custom NPCs/Buildings and you'll see what fun truly is.

It took me about 3 hours before i finally decided to make my first character and it was only then that i realized EXACTLY WHY this game seems to literally mimic real life: everything is 100% circumstantial, and nobody is the main character. If anything, you're the main factor of only your character's life.The world of this game is the most alive and real city setting I've ever played. Everyone in the game does their own goal to the point that sometimes I succeed my own quests by essentially doing nothing at all. Some dude i was supposed to assassinate got himself killed because i convinced him to fight for me by telling him a joke. Then he murdered me because his death involved being infected by a zombie. Why? Because this game constantly begs the question, ""Why not?"" while unapologetically toying with the idea that anything is possible. 

The best part in my honest opinion is that this game has local multiplayer, which essentially just drops your friends into the city with you. [i] But the four of you don't even have to interact the entire time. [/i] Weird selling point for local multiplayer, i know. But this just means that working together is another shackle removed entirely from the gameplay. Compete with eachother. Straight up fight or hunt eachother down, or play your own individual main quests just in the same city. If I had my friend over and he selected my Rick Sanchez character who has a hypno ray, freeze gun, and permanent police warrant among other traits and starting items, my Breaking Bad character Jessi would have a completely different drug dealing story. They both have crippling addictions in my copy of this game. 

What i absolutely love is that the change of character is usually far from the only reason that your playthrough is new when you play for the 100th time. Albeit simplistic story-wise, this game is what every open-world role-playing game wants to be. A game where you don't have to do anything, but you can do close to everything. Streets of Rogue is a legendary masterpiece. A beautiful, poetically functional simulation of a cartoony dystopian city life, and an intense benchmark in video game history. The only reason i ask for more updates is because this game should never die.",1599741799,1610488684,True,31,0,0.705315649509429932,0,True,False,False

TLDR: Roguelike fun with a good sense of humor, Streets of Rogue is a fantastic pick up and play game that will have you saying, ""just one more run"" like any good roguelike should. TONS of characters to choose from, levels scaling in difficulty really well, and plenty of unlockables, you'll definitely get your money's worth from this game.

PROS:
-Plenty of content for a really low price
-Tons of valid playstyles
-Visually pleasing, if not simple
-Good humor
-Great music
-Plenty of destructable surfaces

CONS
-I can only think of one: multiplayer is kinda meh. It gets chaotic and locally you have to stick on one screen which is kind of a pain, but if you're used to these then the multiplayer isn't a con.

Game has all the staples of a good roguelite and does them very well. I'm very impressed by what Matt Dabrowski has created and having owned this game for 3 years and have sunk almost 300 hours into it I wonder why I haven't made a review for it yet.

My only super minor gripe is the multiplayer which I wasn't a huge fan of, but it's more unpolished but functional in my opinion. Other than that this is a banger indie game.

****End of Review; Shameless Plug Below****

For those interested I've had a long running let's play of this game composed of 50 episodes following the game from Early Access to the release of its DLC. The first 10 episodes were pretty blind and recorded on much older equipment, whereas the other 40 are more representative of the evolution of my skill level in the game and the evolution of myself as a Youtuber, featuring a semi-walkthroughs for every character's big quest and mini-showcases of custom runs and some of the different mechanics in the game. If you want to know more about this game check out the more recent videos in the series as they are more accurate to the game's current state.

It's better to play with friends than alone.
At first, you might get stuck because there are so many things you can do but basically the whole point is to make it through to next floor by doing main quest till the end.
I bought this when it was at very very early access stage. At that time, I thought this game wouldn't be good enough because it looked too ambitious. At that time, making a perfect sandbox game sounded impossible. But they have made it, god.
You can choose your occupation at the very beginning and a whole lot different missions and quests are given for each. You can do whatever you want but the goal is not vague because you have to somehow clear the main quest to get to next floor. It can be perfect GTA or SIMS or whatever games you know. Pretty awesome game.

Streets Of Rogue is an incredibly short and bland platformer that never seems to do anything unique or interesting with it's gameplay or its story, what's supposed to be a race for former U.S. Presidential canidate Bernie Sanders towards the White House feels like a generic forgetful DSX reskin with worse level design. Each level is supposed to be a State, but nothing makes it feel like any of the states you visit are any different or even similar to their actual state (some themeing would have been nice, like the Arch in Missouri or the Statue of Liberty in New York), instead just feeling like another one of those ""legally distinct"" Mario clones. The platforming in this game ranges from mediocre platforming to just bad level design, especially with New York and the final level, D.C. (New York has several small platforms that you have to bounce on enemies heads on in order to try and fail repeatedly to cross in succession and the movement of Sanders is just slippery enough that you fall more times than you want too, and D.C has an particular section where the game expects you to skip a bottom platform and make a jump that you cannot seem to make normally.) None of the bosses in this game are spectacular, as they're just reskins of SMB1 Bowser fights, save for the final ""boss"" Donald Trump, who you just defeat in a cutscene and just finish the game in under an hour.

If you need a game to play that's free, just go and play Get Off My Lawn. If you need a good platformer, there's tons of great platformers out there on and off Steam. Skip Streets Of Rogue, and let time forget it existed.",1574190230,1606685652,False,0,2,0.324303895235061646,0,True,False,False

The timing of the music on the title screen, the humor in the tutorial and the wide variety of characters to play with drew me in. After trying the first level a couple of times, I started to grok it.

It took a while to figure out which strategy was best to get good progression, but once that was figured out, I was hooked.

There are many priceless moments and many ways to trick the poor NPC inhabitants of the streets of Rogue.

The music felt great at the start, but got repetitive over time, so I turned it off and only kept the sound effects.

It also took some effort to configure the wireless controller, and the game crashes if the gamepad loses connectitivty. But this is solved by never leaving the game for more than a couple of minutes, which is easier done than said.

There's always something to unlock or discover, and even if you find it all you can still make your own crap to mess around with.

This game is also very skill-based, but it's easy for situations to quickly go from '1 to 100' real damn fast, thanks to the entire map being filled with NPCs that all have opinions of you and others, and getting in the way of their daily business while doing your missions can cause serious #### to go down. 

An example is knocking a thief that just jacked your item through a wall, into an explosive laser tripwire which ends up with the property owners chasing you guns blazing, except a stray police squad gets caught in the crossfire and you're left with either 4 bodies or severely wounded goons chasing you around the streets; all while some glorified hobos frisk the dead bodies for the tiny bits of money they may have. You just wanted your damn item back!

This entire situation can happen in like 4 seconds, and is just a small example of the crazy chain-reactions your (and other peoples) actions can cause. It really gives off the feeling that the game world is alive - and that it's chugging along with or without your input.

Along with the gameplay, the character selection is rather broad and allows you to go in guns/fists/swords/axes/grenades/flamethrowers blazing or just opt for a stealthier approach by knocking people out, hacking key terminals, using a plethora of sneaky thief tools and sabotaging air filtration systems with drugs. Or just being a sneaky #### and somehow slipping by everyone unnoticed. 

Most of your actions give EXP, so you'll never have to worry about your playstyle being 'not viable' when it comes to EXP gain; but you can still get screwed over if you try to play a frail nerd that hacks computers like an extremely aggressive 800-pound gorilla without the player skill to back it up.

Speaking of skill again, a-lot of the 'skill' in this game comes from just knowing what crap does & what to avoid. You can usually use your brain for most of it, but some of it is just 'fool me once' type crap (god damn cannibals popping out of manholes). The other portion of skill comes from playing to your characters' strengths and weaknesses, and efficient management of resources (health, ammunition, money or durability of weapons/armor, usually 3 or all four). There aren't that many things that can stop an observant, patient and clever player that plays around time constraints/current dangers while thinking ahead about how to best approach their next objective, which solidifies the fact that this game is heavily skill-based despite a big chunk of it revolving around RNG. The devs seem to have struck a fantastic balance in this department.

There is a plethora of built-in modifications for the game, you can make your own characters using the stats/items/skills/traits/objectives from other characters, use mutators to completely change the way the game plays or make your own modular pieces of a level and watch them appear in your runs. Or just download more characters/pieces from the ever-growing workshop.

Overall it ends up being an endless cycle of completing objectives as characters from all walks of life in a chaotic, ever-changing level that requires you to be on your toes at all times. The world may beat you down; but you will always have your chicken nuggets to help you stand back up and unlock more crap to play with.",1603892832,1603892832,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Starting the game off as a beginner seems like a daunting task since you don't understand everything at the get-go, and the tutorial doesn't explain a whole lot, but in a way, I see that as a good way. Mostly because it doesn't hold your hand and allows you, as a player, to chart your own course and figure out your own path.

Speaking of gameplay, if I had a gripe, it would probably be with combat, since shooting and melee fighting feels just a bit clunky at times, especially if you engage another enemy in melee or hand-to-hand combat. However, I like the inclusion of hitting enemies into walls, only for them to break if your strength stat is high enough, never gets old. Though I have to mention that fighting people/zombies/robots isn't all that necessary and that you can get through the game without laying a finger on anybody, however it's very hard to do that.

Buy it on sale, it's definitely worth your money :)

Custom characters are a feature with very little restrictions. Also workshop items such as new floor generation, other people's custom characters, and entire new campaigns are downloadable straight from steam.

Now that it's a complete package it's an absolute riot of a top down roguelite. Manic energy and a dynamic, reactive world filled with chaos define this gem. Certain characters don't like each other, so use those conflicts to gain access to certain areas. You can buy items with status effects imprinted on them, and then inject them into air vents/pools of water to create instant death zones or a royal rumble where everybody is electrified. Your choice at game start of a number of different characters, from hackers to slum dwellers to gorillas, will inform your playstyle throughout the game.

It feels a lot like an immersive sim (your Deus Exes and so on) except transplanted onto a top down roguelite with dashes of the tool-based problem solving of a Heat SIgnature, but don't let that description fool you: This game is a unique gem and well worth full whack.

While death does mean starting again from scratch, there is a currency that persists and unlocks different items for use in future runs. 

You play as one of many crazy themed classes like Cops, Hackers, Shapeshifters, Doctors, Vampires, etc making your way to the upper levels of society to remove the Mayor from power and don his Mayoral Hat. Each class has it's own major goal, limitations, and strengths that make you play different. Doctors can't use weapons, but they can sneak up behind people and chloroform them. Hackers can turn even the most harmless appliances into deadly explosives, or takeover the security system in a bank.

There's a puzzle element to each level (usually divided into 2 - 4 missions) where you case a building and have to decide on the best strategy with your own limitations in mind. You might be able to sneak in and out by never letting security cameras or people see you, or you can go in guns blazing kill anyone who tries to stop you, or you can plant a bomb on the door and give it a knock to see who trips it, or you can possess the body of the buildings owners to walk around with impunity...the possibilities are numerous and always fun to execute.

There are many characters to unlock and you can create custom characters as well. However, the gameplay is very, very repetitive. Each character brings a mildly different level of easier or harder to the game with the core mechanics staying the same. i.e, it's always a good idea to stay out of the sight of an enemy, but if you're a doctor you can take down enemies from behind if you sneak up on them... Or if you have a different trait, do a lot of damage from behind and also take down enemies instantly. There isn't a whole lot to choose from in terms of items either. I'd say the game is worth 10-15 USD at most but certainly not 20. It honestly still feels very incomplete. 

Also, I usually wouldn't say this but I'd recommend playing with the music off. It becomes very annoying very quickly.

You like roguelite top-down twin stick shooters like Assault Android Cactus, Enter the Gungeon or Nuclear Throne? Great. But you also enjoy a bit of thinking... maybe not always just shooting everything that moves, different ways of solving puzzles when you feel like it? A bit of Deus Ex? You enjoy silly humor that does not take anything seriously? Then this is the game for you!

In Streets of Rogue your aim is to overthrow a dictatorial mayor (who banned Nugget Chickens!) and end his reign of terror over the city. Shoot everything that moves or just try to approach this a bit more peacefully... and maybe win the next elections?

Words that come to mind when I think of the game are: addicting, highly polished, smooth gameplay, funny, frantic, silly, great soundtrack, many unlockable charackters, different solutions... 

To help you learn the basics it comes with an outstanding tutorial. I am not easily saying this, but the music is also really good. 

Up to 4 local or online players supported. Friendly fire possible. Due to the different ways to play the game, playing with randoms can be a bit... chaotic. Worked perfect with 4 XBox 360 and with 4 XBox One controllers. Cloud saves are supported.

	The game is a roguelite RPG where you choose a character that will change radically how you apprehend the run and what objective you will seek! fun and animated in pixel art. overall a fine game.
	
[h1]Full details[/h1]

This part will try to display as much as possible for anyone wondering about buying the game.

[h2]Intro[/h2]
As said in the tl:dr, the game is a action-packed roguelike rpg, that focus on the different character that will dictate everything about your run.

[h2]Story[/h2]
The story take place in an city divided in levels, ruled by a despotic mayor. After being recruited by the brave rebels, you follow a strict and hilarious tutorial and gets introduced to the rebel base. You are told that the most precious resource, now scarce, after a ban by the mayor, is the chicken nuggets! Your ultimate goal, to get rid of the dictator and free the city.
After being introduced to everything, you get to chose your character. 

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
The game play change drastically with each character.

[h3]Character[/h3]
Each character get different skills, equipment, advantages and disadvantages. Some can't use weapons, some can't even attack people. Some people are hated and are attacked on sight. Each character also comes with a story that is translated in the in-game objective to do each level.
There is also a tool to create your own character. The are dozen of skills, items to use and interact with. 
[h3]City[/h3]
The city is separated in 5 parts each divided in 3 stages, the slums, industrial area, the park, the Downtown and the uptown. Each stages are populated with random NPC, using the load out from the same playable character, and objective, building to loot, enemy/friend to recruit or kill. 
The combinaison of your character, the population, the building and the objectives, make an ""unique"" scene every runs. Each 3 stages, the floor is again randomised by a ""disaster"".
	There are thousands of different setups.
[h2]Visual[/h2]
The pixel art is really well made and the minimalist animation are enough for this kind of game. 

[h2]Sound design[/h2]
The music fits the overall mood, the sound from the different interaction, are ok.

[h2]Other note worthy point[/h2]
I didn't encounter any game breaking bugs during my 12 hours of play. The game still gets update to get rid of remaining bugs. 

[h1]Why I can't recommend[/h1]
I know that most of the things I said in the previous part was mostly positive but I don't feel like I should recommend this game. here's why.
I really like the time I spent in the game. But the random element, gets boring really fast. It kinda reminds me of the no man's sky beginning, the ""wow 19^1°°°°°°°° planet"" effect, fades after 10~12 hours, and you get the feeling of deja-vu. Same goes with the character, in my opinion, they don't influence the gameplay enough.
The last bit of complaint is focus about content. At the moment of writing, the workshop allows to share, custom character made using the in-game character creation, and some tile. The fact that the first DLC, added only 8 characters for 5€ seems kinda disappointing, I know that dev needs money to work and keep updating, but I fear that real mod meaning ""adding content"" for the character creation might never come and I think that it would save the boring factor.",1599052081,1599070907,False,3,0,0.486358523368835449,3,True,False,False

Cons:
-Lackluster npc interactions
-Lackluster combat depth
-Ugly Art
-Lackluster Simulation of a 'city'
-Bad RPG Mechanics
-RNG  level generation has a lot of limits, specially shown here, not a lot of replayability, its more about challenging yourself to repeat the same tasks over and over with an excuse of not being ""the same level"". but its always the same thing. rng is never the be all of game design

You should know first, this is yet another game that tries to be a roguelike, and like many others, it fails. Its just not deep enough and way more focused on the combat than it should have been

Art:
Its disgusting to look at, its another fricking pixel game. One thing good about pixel art is that it works in low resolution properly, and it also easily conveys the characters. But we all know pixel art is used because how fast it is to make them.

Narrative:
Supposedly there is something, but the game is more focused on fun 'runs' on the missions isntead of focusing on the narrative. There are some quests, but they are just fetching, there isnt much explanation. You dont feel like there is a grander scheme, a plot, or a reason for anything that is happening, its all just pieces of randomly generated content without any thought or love. And like that it just feels like a mess

Design:
No death penalty, even almost no penalty for being a jack ass, so you just go and do stupid stuff. Also theres almost no proper npc interactions, they dont have any depth. So you dont even care about just doing some EXTREME VIOLENCE runs. Just kill everyone, unlock cannibal and thats it. You can play as the ape and keep killing everyone until you get a translator(strong attacks). And yes, the core design of the game is the combat, which is sad for an rpg, but meh, not like someone is gonna come to this game expecting something interesting.

Last Words:
Cool concept, not a lot of replayability. But despite the concept, there isnt much out there. Like many indie games, i recommend a redesign or way longer production time.

It doesn't accept directional button inputs for menu movement, the analogue stick inputs feel weirdly delayed and sticky, and when I swapped the attack/special and weapon select buttons, it still attacked whenever I hit the shoulder button despite attack only showing as being bound to a different button.

This is what pushed me over the edge into refunding this, but there were already warning signs with the fact that it kicks you into a tutorial before you even see a menu screen and you can't change to a controller unless you're on the main menu. So I went to the main menu, the game crashed, and when I came back in I couldn't find the tutorial. So I had to actually look up online where the tutorial is, went to the tutorial, and it's assuming I'm using a keyboard and mouse instead of the controller I set it to (with the right button prompt type selected, mind). After I used the hacking tool, I noticed attack used the triggers which have a slight delay because it uses the full inward press to activate instead of a partial press (another red flag of poor design imo) and then my issue I stated further up happened.

I've got a ton of patience for jank as long as it doesn't make me motion sick, but this is a ridiculously bad first impression. There are what are considered very bad ports of games from the early 2000's on PC that still manage not to mess up this stuff.

I'm sure there's plenty of people who love the game anyway and more power to em.

A corrupt Mayor has taken over the city, the police are either extremely corrupt or heavily armed, and people wearing red shirts are locked in constant violent conflict with people wearing blue shirts. There's also a killer robot hunting people, bombs falling from the sky, cannibals hiding in the parks and zombie outbreaks almost daily. Welcome to Streets of Rogue!

Streets of Rogue is a Top-Down-Action-Rogue-Lite game where you choose from up to 36 character classes; From Cops, Robbers and Firefighters, to Aliens, Robots and Gorillas (with more available through Steam Workshop and the in-game character creator). The goal of the game is to make your way through the city's 5 randomly-generated sectors to reach the Mayor's Villa and set things right. The sectors have 3 levels; In each one you're given a set of random tasks to complete BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY! With support for up to 4 players (both LOCAL and ONLINE), Streets makes for a great party game that doesn't require a lot of hardcore dedication.

[b]THE CHAD:[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]LARGE VARIETY OF CLASSES[/b] with vastly different play-styles and special abilities. Want to kill everything? There are a few classes that do that. Want to play a pacifist? Completely viable. Seduce anyone? Flex that charisma, bro! There's enough variations that you can have a new experience with each character every time you play. You can also create your own class using a simple in-game editor if you feel like something is missing.

[*] [b]PERK-BASED PROGRESSION[/b] keeps the game from becoming a number-grind while still conveying an increase in skill and ability. 

[*] [b]RANDOM LEVEL LAYOUTS WITH STEAM WORKSHOP SUPPORT[/b] means no two playthroughs are the same. There are a few oversights I'll cover a bit further down, but there's enough content that the areas never feel same-y or dull.

[*] [b]OPEN-ENDED MISSIONS.[/b] Neutralize doesn't mean you HAVE to kill someone, just tell them to leave town or knock them unconscious! Retrieving an item can have you kicking down the door guns-blazing, putting sedatives in the air-conditioning unit to knock out everyone inside, or just bribing the guards with beer! Multiple endings also mean you won't be completely done with the game after 1 successful playthrough.

[*] [b]INSANE ARSENAL[/b] ranging from basic tools and melee weapons, to typical modern firearms, to tasers, hypnotizers and teleportation grenades! No item feels completely useless in utility, worst case is that you sell them for money that can be put towards other objectives. Power-ups come in the form of syringes and pills, and grant random abilities like giant growth, electric touch and acid blood (not the kind that hurts enemies, the kind that boils your insides).

[*] [b]MULTIPLAYER[/b] is extremely well-implemented with both ONLINE and LOCAL co-op. Couch co-op is so rare in PC games, even with the abundance of console-ports of the modern era. While I was faster playing with mouse + keyboard, the game controls smoothly enough on gamepad that most anybody can pick up the game fairly quickly without having to learn any special techniques.

[*] [b]SOUND DESIGN[/b] is excellent. Weapons sound like they have weight behind them, explosions are heavy and the soundtrack is pure BANGERS. My personal favorites are 3-3 and 4-2, but the tunes all run together beautifully. 
[/list]

[b]THE BAD:[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]THERE ARE NO STREETS??[/b] Some areas have trains or minecarts running in a straight line across them horizontally, but the closest you get to an actual street are the canals running through Downtown. The floor is almost completely dirt/grass/sidewalk. I would assume there are issues with the map generation that made roads too janky to implement, but c'mon, it's in the game title!

[*] [b]THE MECH-PILOT[/b] is underwhelming. Part of the DLC pack (which has fun characters otherwise), when I first heard about the class I was hoping the mech would be more grandiose, but it's more remniscent of Iron-man than Mechwarrior. The laser weapon is a flashy pistol at best, and no alt-fire rocket launcher makes the class a gimped soldier.

[*] [b]NO COMPETITIVE MULTIPLAYER MODE[/b] means once you've perfected the art of teamwork with friends, the game becomes a little too straightforward and routine. A competitive mode such as a race, or missions with conflicting objectives (IE One player has to neutralize, the other player has to escort) would add a whole new dimension to the party formula.

[*] [b]NO PLAYABLE DOG, CAT OR JANITOR CLASS[/b] okay this is kind of biased but I assume the dev doesn't want people gibbing house pets. But low-skilled workers are still fair game! Also wish the Slum-Dweller had a panhandling ability of some kind, but now I'm nitpicking. The main takeaway here is that while the character creator is easy to use, there are still hard limits to modifying class abilities, big quests, character sprites, etc.

Bad aside, Streets is a great game well worth checking out. With a humble price tag going on sale regularly, a steady stream of bug fixes, code updates and endless potential for expansion, Tinybuild has the foundation for a great franchise set up. The sequel has already been announced and is in development, but until then I would highly recommend trying out the original.

as this game mixes roleplay with gameplay mechanics in a way that WORKS SO, SO WELL. Couple that with the human element with unique and creative items with a plethora of use cases and you'll find what you think is cheese is just top tier gameplay.

The humor is mixed in such a way that it's not just funny, it's immersive, unironically so, in equal parts presentation and in circumstance. For instance, if you play as a slaver, people generally won't like you because your gameplay loop generally consists of enslaving randos on the street and using them as living, breathing, walking land mines. That or you're just a weirdo in leathers. The people in this game are superficial like that. 

It's simple to pick up and play but complex enough to where you can develop your skillset within the game by both study and character builds, and the system works well for a game with a plethora of characters to choose from.

My only complaint is that the character unlock conditions are kind of arbitrary.

That's where the appeal is - if you get the idea to do something, you probably can. The opening 10-ish hours can be boring before everything's unlocked, but the sheer depth of creative options, both before and during a playthrough, are unrivalled in this genre.

There's also the exceedingly immersive gameplay - nearly everything works exactly like it looks like it does. The slaves can be freed, the walls can be knocked down with explosions, the locks can be picked, the windows smashed, and so on. At no point will you be stuck in a situation so illogical that you can't think your way out of it.

Of course, it wouldn't be the same game without the robust and balanced(-ish) character creation system. Every item, every move, and every passive ability the pre-made characters have, you can use to design your own. Most of them have to be unlocked first, but it's entirely worth the effort. With it I've been able to create SOR versions of preexisting characters like Link and MC Public Urination, as well as OC like Safecrack Mulroney and The Surprise Mechanic.

Hopefully that answers your questions, to some extent at least. But now that I've typed this out, I'm going to use it as my Steam review too. I haven't updated it since before the character creation was added into a pre-release patch. This'll save time.",1489281198,1596720149,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its the perfect kind of game to play whilst watching a movie, it doesn't bog you down with story and details so you can easily pay attention to whatever your watching, but equally its a lot of fun in its own right and absolutely won't get boring anytime soon.

Also worth noting, something I absolutely love about it is that it doesn't punish you for essentially having fun. It has the mutators you can apply to runs, and some of them are a little cheaty (eg infinite ammo, infinite durability) but help to make the game even more chaotic and for a lot of people just makes it more fun. Now a lot of games would give you those abilities, but limit or turn off progression whilst using them. This game does not (I believe theres only one mutator which does and I think that one is a literal god mode).

Streets of rouge is a city simulation type game mixed with chaos !
you have to complete 2-3 quests in every level of the 15 randomized levels !

graphics: the Pixelart is really good and the Artstyle is perfect for this Game !

Gameplay:The gameplay is also very good ! 
you can do the quests however you like like for example you have to get rid of someone for a quest you can go up to him and murder him youself,let someone else murder him,trick him into traps,get him into a street fight or other things  the ways you can accomplish your goals is very good !

Story:the Story is very simple a mayor that is very bad gets to ... well the mayor and a team tries to stop him

characters:The characters are what this game does the best ! 
you can be a homeless man,an alien,a gangster,a ninja,a doctor and so much more with their own abillitys !

The storyline contains a lot of humor. I find myself laughing from how to creators approached the game's tutorial to how they ""end the game"". The commentary each character makes during the various floors and each character description when choosing who to play with are very well thought out. Loved it!

Controls 9/10
I play with an XBox controller. Playing with my laptop keys were too confusing and the simplicity of an XBox controller was much better for me. It's very easy to navigate the game, but I find my friends and/or myself accidentally overclicking sometimes which can lead to some unfortunate events during the game. Still I recommend using a game controller when playing Streets of Rogue.

Music: 10/10
I find myself humming along often when I play...much to my friends dismay when we play co-op. Great music and I love the different tracks per floor.

Artwork: 10/10
I love the artwork in this game. My favorite part is being able to customize each character in many different ways. My only wish is being able to keep our designs per each character so I don't have to keep making my favorite combos. The floors themselves are really pleasing to the eye.

Continued Features: 8/10
I think this is the one concern I have for Streets of Rogue. I have logged many, many hours during the short time I've owned this game. There's so much to unlock...from super characters to Steam achievements...but when you're done what else is there to do? I've tried playing with some super characters and it's just not as fun without an overall goal so I'm unsure if I would play this game much after I unlock all the characters available. Mods are available and accepted in the game, but I do hope we get more in the future.

Play Experience: 9.5/10
I've logged so many hours playing this game. I play solo and with friends and both experiences are fun and enjoyable every time. I would highly recommend this game to others and hope there's more packs offered in the future. I would definitely buy it and continue to enjoy many more hours with this game.

The character customization is suprisingly in depth and the gameplay is very captivating because of this! I like how you can chose your route for each play through, and use different traits to help you. You can be very sneaky by being a doctor and put people to sleep with tranquilizers, or blast walls down as a Demolition Man. In this sense, it really reminds me of something like Metal Gear. 
There was a steep learning curve though. I didn't realize that I could add mutators that allow me to have multiple lives. These can be saved and have to be reloaded before each play through.   This game also has Remote Play Together and Online Co-Op. It is very fun playing with friends creating carnage. Highly Recommended.

It is pure fun, and you have freedom in how you play it.  Wildly different playable classes give you so much variation depending on who you pick each run, along with your unlocks, and if you choose to set mutators to really mix it all up.

Want to be a gang member who can recruit any of their NPCs gang members around town to create a posse? Do it!
How about a bartender who can mix drinks on the fly, even into poisons, and hand them to any NPC (they can't refuse) to drink 'em?
A hackerman who can remotely connect to computers & electronic devices and mess with them, cause them to blow up, ATMs to spit out money, unlock all the doors & safes in a building, or turn on the gas & traps?
A stealthy ninja?
A clown who tells jokes so bad that they make NPCs attack you?
A vampire?
An incognito werewolf who can wolf out & tear up a place?
A wrestler who can throw anything?
A scientist who experimented on gorillas?
That escaped gorilla?
All that sound too ""normal""? Be a zombie, where anyone who dies after you projectile spit on them or got into a melee fight with will resurrect as a fellow friendly zombie and go on to attack other NPCs until you realize you've turned the whole level's NPCs into fellow zombie friends!
And all playable classes have a per-level special mission, on top of the normal proc-gen missions, using their unique talents.


Can confirm that Steam's Remote Play Together works flawless as 2 player ""local"" co-op. No lag, no input lag, no artifacting.

So, what's Streets of Rogue? Well, it's a top-down rogue-like game in which feature different classes. You can be a Soldier who can shoot up anything in sight, or an Assassin that can sneak attack anyone in one blow. Maybe you like to make things easy and hack the systems as the Hacker, or even take over bodies with the Shapeshifter. It's really all up to you, and the only limit is your choice. 

The game's function includes missions in which must be completed to progress each stage. These missions vary from neutralization to something more subtle like getting an item. However, each class has their own Big Quest, in which you can optionally take for more EXP and keep your run ""successful"". 

That's basically the base game right there and there's more to discover with the playthrough of the game, so I highly suggest you get your hands on this game.

The game offers some decent variety and self-imposed character based challenges, as well as several random events to spice the experience, but when it comes to actual stages and objectives, the game is extremely repetitive.

In any case, it's worth it's price and will definitely give you atleast 20 hours of enjoyment depending on how much you like this genre.

Maybe the point where I sent a fridge flying across the map like it was a SpaceX rocket? Or maybe the time when I poisoned a building full of people I had to get rid of via a potion that simply causes them to start fighting each other?

Streets of Rogue isn't just a 'roguelite' no no. If you read only the description you'll never understand what this game has to bring. If GTA got dirty with a rogue game and pixelated itself you'd have Streets of Rogue. The premise is simple, run through each level accomplishing certain goals that are deceptively simple. Except when you do these objectives there's several hilariously creative ways to go about it. It's a hilariously refreshing take on the 'rogue' style RPG's and I couldn't recommend it enough. I wish I could give a short verb answer to what Streets of Rogue is but there's just honestly far too much to explain. Every time I launch this game it puts a smile on my face. With a massive amount of 'class' selection and even more options with custom characters you'll never play the same game twice. Is it a repetitive game at times? Yes but that's what 'rogue' is. Is it a hilariously grand time that you CAN play with a few buddies? Absofreakinglutely. If you're a fan of Rogue-likes and want a more comedic game that's refined and impossible to put down you can't find a superior option then the Streets of Rogue. Truly, a one of a kind game.

Depending on your character class and preferences, you can be stealthy, go rambo, lead a gang, or switch between those styles at will--and that's just with the stuff unlocked from the start! I laughed a lot while playing this and had fun every minute.

The centerpiece of this game is the AI friendship/anger system, which is just complex enough to feel believable and allow for fun situations while being intuitive. Most NPCs are neutral at the start but become angry if you hurt their friends, fight inside their store, tresspass, etc--but they'll allow some actions if you make friends with them first, or even hand you your mission objective on a silver platter. The same rules apply to NPC-to-NPC interactions, so you can trick someone into hitting a cop or tresspassing to make the other NPCs gang up on them, and many items have the sole purpose of forcing NPCs to fight each other.

There's a wide variety of classes, many of which play very differently--encouraging violence, stealth, socializing, and gadgetry/trickery in varying amounts. Each class has a unique long-term quest to differentiate them further. There's also a lot of creative items and skills to help you out (many unlockable).

Graphical style is great, the music is phenomenal, and as I said above the humor is on-point.

despite offering plenty of routes on the surface, in the end it only really supports one, which is offensive shooting/slicing..  
If you are the sneaky type of player, you're restricted to like two classes (vampire and doctor) because no one else can dispatch enemies from behind. and the doc has ""kill no one"" as stipulation. Everything in the game save for exceptions enforces run and gun. the easiest character is probably the solider and you unlock hm early on (maybe you don0t even need to unlock him, I don't remember) because he has guns.

This is a super fun rogue-like that gives you a ton of options and near endless inspiration to continue.  Honestly, since the game itself is so simple, there are very few - if any - real negatives to it, so let's just dig into why it's as fun as it is.

1)  Charming graphics.  They're slightly less detailed than even the River City Ransom 8-bit characters, but that's just due to being much smaller.  The way they look and move is very evocative of the same style to me, though, and that'll always be a plus.

2)  The characters you can pick are ridiculously diverse with a ton of different abilities, quirks, weaknesses and such that developing a distinct playstyle for each is a challenge, but it's a MUST since unlocking the ability to start at a higher floor requires finishing the floors UNDER it with at least 5 different characters.

3)  You can create your own characters!  I did and apparently forgot about it, unless the Streetfighter is a standard character but from the wiki, it doesn't look like it is.  But that means I wrote the bio (character has ""sausage fingers"" trait):  ""When you spend your childhood teased for your kielbasa-like fingers, unarmed fighting becomes a way of life."" and I don't remember writing that.

(Addendum:  while writing this, I actually completed the game for the first time, with the ninja.)

4)  While I prefer a rogue-like that allows you to accrue actual benefits that stick with you, this is a good middle ground between that and the 'start from scratch every time' type.  You accrue chicken nuggets (don't ask, it's like hub-level cash) and can buy traits (perks for your character you gain on leveling up) that may become available for selection in your subsequent runs - it's a bit randomized, but still.  You can also unlock equipment that you can add to your loadout (1 item each time, I think) from another character in your hub level, but note that they don't offer you the FULL selection of equipment you've unlocked.  If you want a particular thing and it's not there, then you'll have to pay to change the selection.  Regardless, chicken nuggets are not hard to come by, gaining them on every level-up while playing, and from optional missions.  You'll also unlock (for free, but by meeting certain criteria) new ""mutators"" (cheats, basically, though most of them are for increased challenge, only a few make it actually easier) and new character types, none of whom are overpowered.

5)  Great sense of humor.

6)  Pretty good music.  I enjoyed it.

All in all, if a brawler is your thing, and you like rogue-likes and the art style, you'll enjoy this, I'm absolutely certain.  Definitely recommended.",1591033893,1591033893,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You didn't hear anything before the assault and now you stand no chance of surviving the vicious beast. Your last moments alive are spent wondering how things went so wrong, and as your soul leaves this mortal coil you see the ape pillage your fridge for a banana. 

Alternatively, imagine that you're in bed and just starting to doze off to sleep, when a guy just runs through your walls and demolishes half your house, leaving as fast as he arrived. You sit up in bed wondering what just happened; perhaps it was a dream? But the creaking sound of your floorboards and the groaning noise of your house collapsing on to you confirms the realness of it all. You feel a sharp pain across your torso as your broken ribs pierce into vital tissues, you try to scream but the weight of the collapsed debris prevents any vocal projections. As your vision starts fading to black, you hear the man return. He offers no assistance, no remorse or pity, however, he does reveal his motive. ""It's just a prank, bro! Jeez, stop taking it so seriously you CRYBABY!"". The last thing you experience was the soul-shattering noise of the multi-thousand 4K TV being struck by a baseball bat.

Actually, imagine that you're doing anything when a full-on war between the army and a bunch of inbred cannibals erupts right next to you. You try to run away but one of the cannibals wielding a battleaxe violently swings at you, bringing you to Death's doorstep. However, you are able to escape the crazed cannibals but alas, a stray bullet hits you and kills you immediately.

- Great artsyle and graphics
- All the different characters allow for an infinite number of play-styles

- Amazing co-op

- Combat is fun and very simple

- Many cheap mechanics (ex. trains that run you over out of nowhere) make the game feel unfair
- In my experience, it gets boring pretty fast
- to get all the way to the end of the game feels impossible
- the plot is forgettable, so you forget why your doing things often (this most likely wont be an issue to most, because the game is not plot heavy)

*NOTE TO DEV*
Love the game, but here are 2 ""issues"" I found within the game. Please correct me if either of these 2 are working as intended:

1. It is almost never a good idea to negotiate or threaten NPCs because in order to do so you must stand within batting distance of the NPC. If the threat fails, you will immediately be attacked and hit by the now hostile NPC. This ruins roleplay as I am incentivized to just kill NPCs for quest items instead of threatening them or negotiating with them. I'd rather get the first hit on the NPC than have the NPC hit me first.
Sure, if the threat fails the NPC will announce their hostile turn, but at the same time they've already hit you. There's no announcement of turning hostile, pause, then retaliating. It's an instant punish on the player if it fails.

2. When playing with Rogue-Vision mutator, you cannot see through the eyes of people you mindcontrolled. This results in a lot of guess work when the NPC you control turns a corner or enters a building.

I have played 2 roguelites before this one I think.
I really loved ""Enter the Gungeon"" (EtG) but struggled to feel the same towards ""The Binding of Isaac"" (TBOI).
Both are generally considered hard by some. The general difference while still being similar in many aspect is why they are difficult, I dislike when RNG rather than skill is needed. 
This is why I love EtG as you can beat the general game everytime with starting guns. You might get OP runs in both respected games, but for TBOI having good skill is often not enough without RNG. 
What is the point of restarting till you get something good rather then let the game throw curveballs that stimulate your knowledge of the game without being unfair?

This is why I love ""Streets of Rogue"" (SoR). The difficulty aspect is completely dependent on you. 
Sure, this means that it lacks a higher natural difficulty curve and might feel less rewarding, but ""too hard"" is not a problem with this game.
Depending on what class you play you will have to adapt your way to play.
Some feel easier while others are frustrating. 
You can even make custom characters and still make progress if you balance them out. 
Typically you can make them OP or underwhelming to stimulate difficulty. 
Of course you could just for fun exceed the values if you don't feel to make progress.
Point being that with all cutomization options available you can greatly tailor your experience to what you feel is a difficulty enjoyable to you.

[h1]The progress system.[/h1]
M-missions and character level ups reward you with Chicken Nuggets. 
You accumulate them and can use them at the homebase after the run/s for unlocking more ""traits"" and ""rewards"". 
You can also use them to buy items to temporarily start with on the next run.
When you unlock more traits/rewards the game scales this to how much you must have in the pool as a minimum.
The cool thing is that you can edit out which traits and rewards you dont want to show up, to better suit them for your playstyle. 
For instance you probably don't want firearm boosting traits if your character can't use guns.
These settigns can be save and loaded at the base when you want to change them between what characters you use.
After beating all floors of an area with 5 different characters you unlock the option to start there by going to the elevator at the homebase.

There are also achievements for completing various misc. things aswell as completing the story in certain ways.
You will also unlock several characters. The unlock conditions are stated on the character selection screen.
I would have liked more achievements to be presents specifically for completing the big quests and story with each of the vanilla characters.
This is also a good way to keep more players engaged and increases replayability for some.
I might have unlocked all traits, most rewards and achievments after less than 30 hours, but that doesn´t prevent me from seeing myself continuing to play the game.

[h1]The Core Gameplay [/h1]
You start by selecting a class/character. Each vanilla character has their own ""big-quests"" they need to do on every floor and comes with their own traits and abilities.
As an example you might play as a police officer or a thief. One of them can arrest people and the other one can steal from people (abilities).
To beat their quests you will have to arrest enough guilty people as the police officer and steal enough from safes/chests as the thief (big-quests).
Apart from this their traits give the characters positive and negative artributes which typically feels logical to the nature of the character.
For instance the police officer is alligned with other officers and loses xp when arresting innocent peoples.
Most traits can be swapped or removed on floors for money. Most mechanics are trial and error, there are different vending machines etc.
Apart from character specific quests there can be a number of different quests on each floor. By doing quests and killing/saving people you get xp and level up.
Upon finishing the floor you get to chose to improve traits or add new ones essentially making you stronger for the more upcoming difficult floors.
You don't need to succeed with your missions, but either have to complete them or fail them.
After that you progress to the next floor and the next till you beat the levels of the floor and enter an new area.
Eventually after several areas you beat the game. 
While the traits, loot etc. on the floors can determine if you succeed to some degree, i never felt that RNG unfairly ended or made me OP during a run. 
Another mechanic of the game is that disasters may appear upon entering a new floor.
This can be really deadly with radiation, ooze spreading or make everyone be affected by random status-effects every couple of seconds etc.


[h1]Replayability[/h1]
I initially after 10 hours of gameplay struggled to see the 100's of hours of replayability some talked about.
Fairly quickly the main game was beaten and while things are randomly generated and runs will vary some, the end goal was done.
There are many character to try and do the same with but it doesn't feel that exiting.
As an achievement hunter I could see the misc. things as something to work towards and unlock more characters.
What would have been great in my opinion (apart from my earlier suggestions) would have been to add achievements for unlocking traits and rewards. 
Something to keep more players engaged. 
The thing which really changed my perspective on replayability is how cleverly the Dev has taken advantage of the core-gameplay. 
While the game mostly is the same it can greatly be affected by lots of things as mentioned before, but it goes even further. 
You can use mutators. This can alter the game sooo much. From removing annoying ""disasters"" that can occur on floors to making everyone equipped with rocket launchers.

While the game is great for single player it gets much better with multiplayer. It has the option to be played both online or locally (unsure if mix match is possible between local and online).
It goes up to 4 players at the same time and you can revive eachother and kill eachother. It can create funny synergies or pit you against eachother depending on what character you decide to use.
I started playing the game Co-op and had lots of fun. I accidently missed to setup a password the first time and immediately had someone join me so I would assume there is a decent playerbase.
(btw sorry about leaving the game :/)

[h1]The Conclusion[/h1]
With an active Dev and a recent dlc character pack being released, the game is for sure alive with updates to come.
While the core-gameplay can feel a bit dull at times, there can be frustrating moments and hilarious moments all the same.
The game is created in a good way that lets players of different skill levels enjoy it and with all the customability it can keep the replayability high.
I will still say that the multiplayer experience is far superior to playing it alone.

Apart from expanding achievmements and continuing to improve the core-gameplay (enemies, mission types, building types etc.) the game has few flaws when you have learned how it works.
Especially impressive is the ai and level of customization.
It has provided a more casual and creative roguelite-experience than EtG and TBOI and I highly recommend it.

If you're still reading this, let me give you a textual journey.

Streets of Rogue is one of those rare games that truly [i]gets[/i] how much potential for interactivity videogames have, and it was obvious even back right at the start of Early Access.

The gameplay is set in one of the most interactive sandboxes I've ever played in. It would take the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy to catalogue everything that can be done in this game, even within the limitations of a 2D top-down RPG in an underground city. The music is boppin' as hell and it evolves as you go through each biome -- each set of 3 levels has a different theme and the 3rd is by default a special Event with a raging beat. That being said, you can customize the gameplay and remove those Events, or change a hundred other aspects. There's even a level editor now and custom campaigns.

Don't believe what Steam says about my play time. I had a copy of this game that fell off the back of a pirate ship, but seriously a game that gladly destroyed my life for 1000 hours needs my money. Everyone I've ever played this game with has had fun, even my 55 year old mum laughed her ass off at accidentally punching every shop keeper in the face because she kept clicking on people instead of tapping 'E'.

I feel a bit weird about paid DLCs being added to this game, but to be honest if it's helping fund the guy who made it, so he can make more games (which he has expressed interest in doing), then I say it's not the exploitative type of DLC, so it's fine.

A friend told me to get this and I didn't really think to much of it at the time.  2D games generally aren't really my thing but oh boy this one is different.

Its a rogue like but it also feels very heavy on roleplaying.  For example my favorite class is the mech pilot which can be obtained with the character pack which is also hugely worth it.  The description for the mech pilot reads something like straight out of a judge dredd comic.  It's perfect.  I go around in a giant suit of armor protecting the ""innocent"" and dishing out apocalyptic  justice on the deserving.  Gangsters (crepes and blawds) will attack me on site or run away if I show them overwhelming firepower.  Somehow, someway this single developer has made a 2D game that completely captivates me into the role of whom I'm playing as.  

The challenges this game throws at you are wonderful too.  You'll get to a stage and something like ""riot riot riot"" or strange gas will cause constant changes to everyone.  I breath in and become a momentary giant capable of smashing through walls like paper and crushing goons beneath my enormous mechanized feet.  The innocent run away to cover as blaster rounds ricochet off walls and shotgun pellets from goons are lobbed back in response.

I really enjoy the combat roles but if that isn't your playstyle you can completely avoid combat.  Need to steal an item from a chest?  Don't want to kill everyone?  Play as a hacker and unlock the doors remotely, then sneak in.  Or choose the alien and just mind control your way past.  So many ways to play and so much replayability.

I absolutely wholeheartedly recommend.  I haven't been stuck wanting to play ""just one more round"" until 1:30 am in a long time.",1588708922,1588708922,True,1,0,0.497942358255386353,0,True,False,False

I mostly prefer the stealth approach, but if you want to choose a zombie and turn a stage into anarchy you absolutely can.

It also has lots of perks and items you can find and unlock including weird stuff like the Boo-Urns (Which fill a building with ghosts and makes people evacuate).

It also saves every level in case you can't finish all in one session and thanks to the bizarre chicken nugget based unlock system, even a failed run can still give you progress.

There's plenty of modifiers and unlocks too to keep things interesting, as well as both local and online multiplayer and the ability to make your own character with their own traits and abilities.

Streets of Rogue is a friggin awesome yet underrated real time roguelike. I say ""roguelike"" instead of ""roguelite"" due to the amount of emergent gameplay. Instead of roaming a dungeon, you explore procedurally generated city streets filled with NPC:s. Most are friendly until you start some havoc.

You get a few random quests per area, for example ""free a gorilla from the lab"" or ""neutralize this person"" or ""steal a MacGuffin muffin from that fridge."" You can do it the stealthy way, or run in guns blazing, basically turning the game into a twin stick shooter. When things go wrong, GTA-like mayhem ensues. The cops might come after you, or you might infuriate a street gang faction, making them aggro. The whole level might turn into hilarious chaos of explosions and people fighting each other. Infiltrating buildings in creative ways is a big part of the game. You will die a lot, and might get a chronic case of ""one more run"" syndrome.

You can steal from shops, pickpocket, hack computers, ambush people as a vampire, ally with NPC:s, bribe cops, poison air vents with random effect syringes, turn into a giant, clone yourself, and all kinds of crazy stuff.

As NPC's go about their business and interact with each other, the city feels alive. There's random events to add more color: For example, riots, bomb showers, zombie invasions... You might run into rival gangs fighting each other. You could join in, or let them finish and loot the corpses. There's no ""karma"" system; You won't get punished for evil deeds unless you get caught.

The game has:

- Tons of items with fun effects, weapons and gear.

- Tons of character classes to unlock, from a pacifist doctor to a rampaging gorilla. There's 26 classes at the time of writing. Not enough? Create your own!

- Tons of unlockable traits. Choose a new trait every time you level up.

- Tons of mutators to customize and alter the experience.

- Active modding community.

- Clean pixel art graphics with lighting effects. Lighthearted music that gets stuck in my head.

- Good controls, though it took me a while to get used to them. While learning I made a few mistakes, like using an item I didn't mean to.

I originally returned the game for a refund due to problems with the Xbox controller, but it has been fixed, and now works like a charm. I never regretted buying it again. Fun in short bursts, for 2-3 hours at a time.

Six years in development and two years after release, the game is still being updated, with possibly a sequel in the works. This is a game I return to time and time again. What a time to be a fan of the cyberpunk genre with Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Cyberpunk 2077 coming so close together. Developed by one person, Streets of Rogue stands proud among the giants.",1587997929,1587998287,True,62,9,0.848544478416442871,0,True,False,False

So I picked it up when it went on sale, and there it sat for a long time. It has been surprisingly difficult to get friends to play something local co-op when we're hanging out, but when I finally had the time and curiosity to check it out, these were the stages I went through:
1. Nice retro aesthetics. Love the smoothness of the controls. No idea what I'm supposed to do. Chaos.
2. Running around messing with stuff, starting fights, getting killed.
3. Beginning to understand the order of the universe. Different character classes have different special abilities. Now I know how to accomplish the missions to proceed to the next level. But some classes seem useless? Beginning to utilize synergetic class combinations with friends. 
4. Realized that each class has their own personal quest for each stage. The classes previously thought useless just had subtle mechanics and they are actually the most interesting to play as. There are many ways to accomplish the missions, and being artful about it is the way!

[b]TLDR:[/b] 
Simple mechanics, but requires a little patience and curiosity to figure out. 
Deep application of mechanics!

I've frozen a man alive with a freeze ray, then proceeded to push him into a manhole causing him to fall down and die.
I've beaten the final boss of the game by hypnotizing him to like me and simply asking for his hat.
I've mobilized a small red gangster army dedicated to the extermination of all blue gangsters.
I've made everyone attack a holographic bigfoot and then threw grenades in the middle killing them all.
I've won an election victory simply by killing all possible citizens on the floor so I am the only voter.
I've become a scientist who injects people with random syringes he found using a water pistol.
I've become a cop and arrested totally innocent people while killing all the non innocent people.
I've tazed a man in a lake and electrocuted him.
I've given a random guy a cyanide cocktail.
I've knocked people out with chloroform just to have my cannibal friend kill them and eat their body.
I've turned into a giant and proceeded to create a path to the edge of the map just to fall off of it.
I've paid insane amounts of money to every person for their weapons only to attack them after they are weaponless with their own weapons.
I've set a group of firemen on fire only to extinguish the fire after they had all died.
I've run through an entire city breaking down walls as a beefy football player.

To top it all, nothing in the game is super rare, like some items in Binding of Isaac.

Streets of Rogue makes use of finishing quests (often hard to do without some brainstorming) which requires you to make a strategy, like hiring gangsters to kill someone for you, bribing to receive an item, sneaking into a hideout to press buttons or to simply just massacre your way to your objective.

Streets of Rogue includes a leveling system, with every level-up, you can select a trait to take with you on your journey. Traits should be selected to fit with your character's current traits and stats or with the items you currently own.

Every character has their own Big Quest to finish, if finishing a run gets boring, this is often the next step you want to take. Finishing your Big Quest on every floor, you'll receive a nice addition to your character for the final floor.

At the end of the day (or night, depending how long you play), you'll still have achievements on Steam to run after once you have finished all the Big Quests (which after 86 hours, I still have not gotten).

The game never became predictable due to the procedurally generated levels, but if even if it did begin to become repetitive at times, choosing a different role would introduce a completely unique gameplay experience due to the very different strategies that would need to be employed to be successful.

30 years after NetHack was released, yet another roguelike, Streets of Rogue, was introduced into our world.

Streets of Rogue is a real-time roguelike game set in a futuristic cyberpunk-ish world. The game never takes itself seriously, and is frequently hilarious. The premise has something to do with a mayor who promises lower taxes and beer, but follows through with higher taxes and prohibition. You're essentially going to go through level after level, attempting to complete a predetermined set of tasks before you can go on. Just like most other roguelikes, if you die, you start over.

Similar to the classic roguelike games, you'll choose a character before you embark on your adventure. The character are clever and unique: you can be a stereotypical Hacker, complete with poor hygiene, capable of using his laptop to remotely hack computers in buildings to release toxic gases, disable security systems, and open doors. The Gangster can phone up some of his cronies to assist you in your adventure, the Wrestler can pick up and throw pretty much any object in the game, and the Investment Banker has a lot of cash and get can good prices.

The character you choose will drastically change how you approach the game. If you're a Hacker, you're likely to die rather quickly should you choose to run into a room and attempt to beat down enemies. You need to take a more careful and stealthy approach to your entry, utilizing computers and holograms to be effective. A Gorilla, on the other hand, is incapable of communicating with other characters, but is absolutely devastating with its bare hands.

The available and unlockable characters in this game are a blast, but if you feel such an inclination, you can actually create a custom character, which has traits and starting items of your choosing. The possibilities now become ENDLESS. I plan to create characters based on my friends in real life, complete with all their idiosyncrasies.

The gameplay is fast and frantic, and a groovy, funky electronic soundtrack only helps with the immersion. The enemies in the game explode with money and all sorts of fun items when you kill them (and if you kill them HARD enough, their guts end up everywhere as well). After you complete missions, you collect items to help you on your journey, and you have the ability to gain traits after you complete levels, as well. Otherwise, you're playing a roguelike, so your goal is to keep progressing and improving until you die a shameful death.

As far as persistent unlockables, everything you earn in-game comes from a pool of traits, rewards, etc. that you have unlocked. if you want to potentially gain certain things in game, you have to spend chicken nuggets (a persistent resource across all your attempts) to unlock them, and then whatever you have purchased will be in the ""pool"" of things to earn during your future attempts. You are also free to spend chicken nuggets on weapons for your next attempt, but if you die, they are gone forever.

If you happen to have friends outside of your computer, Streets of Rogue supports cooperative play up to 4 players. I'm not promising that this will necessarily make things easier (especially if taking a stealthier route), but the more, the merrier!

Streets of Rogue is a really a modern remake of a classic roguelike games. If Rogue, NetHack, Moria, etc. were ever games you were interested in or loved, this game is a no-brainer. If you weren't, this game is still worth a shot due to its near-flawless execution of frantic, RPG mayhem, even in its current Alpha state.

Ultimately, it's a top down...Whatever you want it to be. You can be an assassin, gorilla, vampire, werewolf, inbred cannibal, police officer, wrestler, hacker, the list goes on and each class has their own niche of how they are best and tackling the scenario but you can freely go off the rails at any time. The goal is to take over the city by becoming the mayor and you have an obscene amount of ways to go about doing that and get friends involved for more fun. You can create custom classes with their own abilities and goals, with a point system to keep from being imbalanced that prevents you from getting upgrade currency, but you can make them as OP as you like if you just want to gib pixels after a long day.

You can talk to the hacker in the home base to rebalance the game as you see fit by altering mechanics and events that effect both the players and the enemies, so for example if you put in unbreakable melee weapons or unlimited ammo it will apply to them too.

Unlike other roguelikes, you can also select what items and perks you want in the reward/level up pool with some fair limitations to keep it from being broken, allowing you to tailor the pools to your desired approach between every run.

A few glitches & other minor issues, but nothing too serious and the game has been frequently updated since I purchased it with fixes and improvements. This would be a great game to play with RL or online buddies, but not so great joining or hosting random multiplayer games (of which there seem to be very few like 6 on the list). The problem with random MP game is if you die it costs the other players either gold or health to resurrect you, so ...usually they don't, and then your only option is to leave the game. While I haven't finished the game with a handful of the characters, there is plenty of variety in skill sets and play styles to make it worth finishing the game with multiple characters. Making custom characters can be fun too. Some stock characters are a bit underwhelming, and some are over powered, but that allows you to play the game however you want as an OP killing machine or as a weakling for the extra challenge. The only glitch I have found is one of the traits doesn't work properly on my custom character (""Fair Game""), but other than that I haven't noticed any other major glitches. But it makes me wonder if some of the traits and skills that would be doing things that are invisible to the gamer are actually working correctly either. But the game in it's current state is almost a perfect game and one broken trait isn't enough to drag it down. It's just a shame that I reported this bug 2 or 3 patches ago and still hasn't been addressed, but I think the dev team may only consist of 1 person (?) so one could understand how sorting through all of the feedback / bug reports could be a nightmare for 1 person to handle in addition to their normal daily work on improving the game.

It's a beautiful example of interlocking systems creating emergent gameplay, and considering the sheer amount of systems there are in the game, it's INCREDIBLY robust.
Despite having an enormous amount of play-time with this game, I'm still finding new and interesting ways of combining and exploiting these systems.

Factions that can be manipulated by the player, classes that play incredibly differently bringing a fresh perspective to the game, a remarkably generous mutator system that allows you to tailor difficulty while still allowing you to earn achievements, genuinely funny humour and an absolutely barnstorming soundtrack all combine to make this a must.

The amount of run modifiers you can apply and that you can turn off perks is great. I wish more rogues did that.

AI is very consistent. Only dislike is that cannibals only hate players. You can turn that off but you can't make them hate NPCs.

Humour is fun if you don't mind that it's 99% references.

Unfortunately feels very underdeveloped and gimmicky with near zero synergies except for perks/items designed to specifically work with a character/perk/item so are useless to carry in the hope of getting their second half. e.g.
[list]
    [*]Mild gun upgrade system
    [*]Mild specialised elemental system that only ~5 items use and only token environmental effects
    [*]Perks are mostly mechanic stat changes
    [*]Okay pills but useless needles
    [*]Objectives are mostly just kill some doods, tapping buttons under a time limit or escorting (you're allowed to fail) are the more interesting ones out of the fiveish objectives, only specific characters can thieve objectives without murder
    [*]Election objective is cool and involves trading useful items away to specific NPCs but doesn't have much going on
    [*]Boss/disaster floors could use more to dilute the ""Half of everyone is now hostile"" or ""Most NPCs are dying"" ones
    [*]Final floor is underwhelming
    [*]Floor challenge doesn't particularly change when you go to the different layers
[/list]

I appreciate the parts that aren't a deathmatch. Police helping me against thieves, mafia mugging me with words and then cops helping me, robot cops actually detaining me or confiscating my items unlike the murderous police, buying a round for an entire bar to like me, optional missions making an entire building like me and defend me from attackers, bribing with money or items to get objectives, getting past bouncers with booze, hitting a wall to distract so my friend can steal something unnoticed, bringing two rival gangs into eyesight by using a noisy slum dweller so I can get a murder objective. Those are things most games would have one of in a token story moment, but here that's normal.

I just wish there was more supported modding than map tiles. And that the editor would work for me.",1580387646,1580387646,True,2,0,0.508556663990020752,0,True,False,False

Except that you are not only a barkeeper/policeman/drug dealer/shopkeeper/investment banker/comedian etc., but also a spy for a government opposing rebel faction that kinda has no idea what they're doing.
So while making your way through the devastated distopia of the games city world you also need to fulfill crucial mission objective orders straight from your rebel HQ. The fun thing about that is that there's literally millions of ways of doing that, and depending on what job you're educated in there's even more ways with every playthrough.
For example: HQ orders to get a harddrive from the shopkeeper in town. Now, you could kill the shopkeeper and take it, or you could just threaten him to do just that if he doesn't give it to you right now, or you could give him a very valuable item in exchange. But if you are a shopkeeper yourself you can just buy it from him, if you are a thief you can steal it from him, if you are a slavemaster you can enslave him and make him give it to you, and this whole variability makes the game incredibly fun and long-living.

Other than the missions which are well planned in theory and well executed in practice, the game is all about the player being able to do whatever the fuck they want. I especially like freeing gorillas from science labs while there's still scientists in there with them. Welp.

A lot of other reviews already cover the basics - the game looks great, the controls are smooth, the soundtrack is catchy, and there's a big cast of characters that make each session unique. I want to talk about chain reactions. Bear with me.

Streets of Rogue has a lot of different systems modeled in it's gameplay. For example, most buildings have an air filtration system. If you get to the filter unit, you can use various drugs to poison everyone inside. Or maybe you inject a rage-inducing stimulant in there and everybody inside flips out and starts beating each other to death. This can cascade if, say, one of the people inside is a werewolf. They might punch someone through a wall because werewolves are hella buff. If that someone was a gangster... well there might be rival gangsters out in the street. They see the wrong colors and now a turf war has started. That'll probably attract the attention of local cops - who will also show up with guns and batons to put down the ruckus. With all those bullets flying around, there's bound to be some casualties. Like one of them hitting the doctor that you were supposed to escort to the level exit to complete your mission.

This is just one example. There's a thousand different ways for the systems in the game to interact with each other. It takes already great gameplay and adds a level of unpredictability (and often humor) that makes the replay value of Streets much higher.

You have a lot of freedom to handle things how you want, can often do things in funny and interesting ways, and its genuinely satisfying to use a melee weapon (guns slightly less so). Your missions are kinda fun and you can even choose to not do them if you wish.

But jesus christ, did i dislike the game once i got a decent way through a run. There's a sudden, and god awful, lurch that occurs once you enter the third stage of the game. It goes from ""oh there's people, and some of them dont want me in their house, that's fair"" to ""okay literally any fucking person i walk up to wants to murder me, even if i've done literally nothing to them and am standing in an open field that no one owns.
and from then on out, you don't really have any freedom, or any way to avoid combat, cause 99% of the people you meet *instantly* lunge at your throat, often from 'hidden' positions (you can see them most of the time, but its still annoying as fuck if you don't pay a lot of attention)

On top of that, and around the same point in the game, you might realize just how repetitive all your missions are.

This game has some comedy, and some real charm to it, and especially its combat system, but I absolutely cannot imagine myself ever reopening this game after only three hours in it.

-Forgot to bring a Hacking tool for the killer bot

On this game you can do literraly everything
Want to be a cop and arrest some bad guys? you can
Want to be a firefigther and start fire on some house just to people leave and you enter to ""end the fire"" but steal some goods? you can
Want to be a ninja and complete a level without being seen? you can
Want to make two different gangs fight each other so the cops go out while you free a prisioner? you can
Want to be a zombie and zumbify everyone so everyone is now your friend and you can loot the entire city? you can

Get ready to laugh for some deaths, when you die and when someone else dies, ask yourself ""this is even possible?"" laugh with some tips in game (eat healthy food, in real life, this makes nothing in this game) be kicked out of a place because you destroyed a thing, or you are ugly, or because you are a robber (or simply kick the owner)

Play with 4 friends (and get a compliment cause you have friends) and make much more chaos, or pay for someone to join your group (so you can't feel loneless playing alone)

Você ainda pode considerar a recomendação da Alpha 67
(12 de janeiro, 2020)

(Alpha 67- 15 de janeiro, 2019)
Este jogo é pra quem gosta de:
-Rogue like
-Ter opções diferentes para chegar ao mesmo objetivo
-Jogar ""stealth""
-Atirar antes e perguntar depois
-Causar o caos e destruição sem motivo algum
-Rir por algo ridículo que acabou de acontecer no jogo

Não é pra quem:
-Chora porque um ladrão roubou seu melhor item
-Reclama da zona de guerra
-Não guarda uma ferramenta de invasão para o caso do Robô assasino aparecer...

Em Streets of Rogue você pode fazer literalmente qualquer coisa, e a cidade terá reações para coisa que você faz
Quer ser um policial bonzinho e combater o crime? você pode
Quer ser um bombeiro e incendiar uma casa só pra quando você entrar para apagar o fogo aproveitar para roubar algumas coisas? você pode
Quer ser um assassino e passar o nível inteiro sem alertar ninguém? você pode
Quer fazer com que gangues briguem e causem um tumulto muito grande para os policiais saírem e você libertar um prisioneiro? você pode
Quer ser um zumbi e transformar a cidade toda em zumbi e aproveitar que agora todos são seus amigos para cumprir o resto das missões? você pode
Não quer nada disso mas quer só sair atirando e matando todo mundo que você achar pela frente? você PODE!

E o melhor de tudo, você não é penalizado por escolher um modo de jogar ou o outro
Passou a fase toda sem matar ninguém? Bônus!
Passou a fase e matou todo mundo que você viu pela frente? Bônus!
Não causou nada de destruição? Bônus!
Destruiu quase a cidade inteira? Bônus!
Aqui você faz o que quiser, do jeito que você quiser, e não precisa se preocupar em ser penalizado por escolher jogar de certa forma.

Prepare-se para rir com algumas mortes, tanto suas quanto de inimigos, se pergunte ""isso é possível?"", ria com algumas dicas que o jogo dá (""coma comida saudável, na vida real, não no jogo, no jogo isso não tem efeito"") seja expulso de lugares porque você quebrou algo ou simplesmente porque você é feio (ou porque é um ladrão) ou fique no lugar e se prepare para o dono da loja chutar sua bunda de lá (ou você chutar a dele)

Jogue com até 4 amigos (e receba os parábens por ter amigos) para transformar tudo isso num caos muito maior, ou simplesmente pague para as pessoas se juntar a você (e não se sinta completamente solitário jogando sozinho)

Este jogo vale cada centavo dos R$27,99, os gráficos, a jogabilidade, a diversão, a múscia (a trilha sonora é realmente ÉPICA)

Sobre a jogabilidade, ela é simples, mas o jogo não é fácil, permitindo que seja jogado e divertido para jogadores experientes ou pessoas que nunca jogaram um jogo na vida.

I bought the game in Alpha (during a summer sale) and I already thought it was worth my money. Now it is a full game and it keeps getting features and players added. I regularly check the news section to see what was added and try things out.

Online works great at the moment, with very little lag. Local 4 player co-op with friends is my favorite though. The game is so prone to ridiculous and hilarious events, that one ends up laughing so hard.

-You pick one of say 20+ so available classes that range from combat to stealth to hacking or thieving, crazy ones like zombie and gorilla as well that have crazy buffs/debuffs to gameplay
-Levels are all randomly generated so they are different every time you play
-there are 2 or 3 objectives per level and they change as well they range from kill a guy, get an item, blow something up etc.
-how you go about this can vary dramatically, stealth, hack a computer and turn turrets against the guards, walk in and blast everyone, turn the map into zombies and let that play out then just walk in.
-it is very difficult and has great replayability as it is never the same
-the unlocks for new characters seem fun such as kill 20 people on one floor to unlock the cannibal
-there is some lasting progression as well to unlock new perks and traits.
-havent been able to try multiplayer, im sure it is a hilarious riot though given what ive seen.

It works as a novelty game and if you're just looking for something to waste time with, it's probably worth it at full price but if you're looking for something to really sink your teeth into, I think the depth is just not there - sure, there's a lot to do and look at but that's breadth, not depth. It's definitely entertaining but not really engaging for me.

FTL: Faster Than Light; Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup; GTA itself and Daggerfall Unity are all better games that provide more-or-less similar experiences with far more depth and replay value, in my opinion. Half of them are free too!

I am refunding the game for now but looking forward to picking it up again and beating it a couple times when it reaches 50% off. Right now, even on sale it feels overpriced - especially when compared to similar, better games that are also free to play.

I wish there was a mod that turned this from a series of self-contained levels to a procedurally-generated semi-persistent big city that really felt more like a full fledged RPG with more long term progression, meaningful permanent decisions, factions,  exploration and worldbuilding - more Dwarf Fortress: Adventure Mode and less beating up punks on actual Streets of Rage.",1577311987,1577311987,False,1,0,0.401549041271209717,1,True,False,False

You can literally play the game any way you want to, even stepping outside the bounds of your selected class' traits.

I remember buying and playing it when it was new to the storefront well over a year ago, and it had much to do even when it was so unfinished. With it finally being released out of Early Access, it's been remarkable to see how far the developers have come and how much stuff has been crammed into the game since, and how much is still being added at the time of this review.

Let's get this out of the way first: [b]This is game plays absolutely nothing like its namesake Streets of Rage (a classic series that I am also fond of, and love the reference).[/b] The only similarities are that they both have you beating up people and have great soundtracks. On that subject though, there's plenty of beating up folks in this game - Your objective is to progress from level to level, each with a few floors, starting from the Slums and hopefully making it all the way to the Mayor's residence. To do this you have to accomplish a few randomly assigned tasks per floor, such as finding X person and taking them the entrance/exit, looting X chest in a hideout, or destroying X amount of a certain object. As you complete objectives and other miscellaneous things, you earn XP which can level up your character, giving you the chance to earn more buffs, as well as providing a full health restoration.

The game is played from a top-down perspective and the best way I can describe the gameplay is like Hotline Miami meets Grand Theft Auto. You by no means are encouraged to go in guns or fists blazing and mow down everyone, but you certainly could. Or you could also choose to be stealthy and complete your goals by means of sabotage and manipulating the enviornment. How you play is up to you in the game does not heavily favor one playstyle. There are so many classes to choose from, each with an optional Big Quest for extra challenge, but if you wish, you can make your own characters to play as, too! You can even change the conditions you'll encounter during your run and insert a seed (string of letters/numbers) to generate a set of levels that way.

Being a rogue, Streets of Rogue is inherently quite challenging, but it's not unfair the vast majority of the time. Most of the time, whenever I died, it was because I jumped into the unknown too quickly, took too long to escape an enemy, or simply made a really dumb mistake. While bad luck can happen in any rogue, I find the player can overcome any obstacle given enough thought and patience. And when I do die and my run ends, I very rarely get super salty - I usually end up laughing at the hilarious circumstances that lead to my death. The dialogue in the game is equally humorous.

There is a lot of content in this game, and it only keeps growing bigger. With literally dozens of characters to choose from, unlimited levels (especially with the new addition of the level editor), and many ways to experiment, if you're fan of rogues in any capacity, I [i]highly[/i] recommend Streets of Rogue. I love both indie games and rogues, and this one is a shining example of a developer's passion and commitment to making a top-grade product - a true Early Access success story.",1575345880,1575346045,True,21,2,0.70852893590927124,0,True,False,False

Streets of Rogue is an easy-to-play, difficult to master rogue-like that lets you start off as just about any realistic character to a few fantasy ones in the efforts to overthrow the mayor of the town. Each town has three floors to gather your influence, and limitless opportunity to throw shit against the fan.

As someone who's placed about 100 hours into the game, I can say without a doubt that the amount of cheese in this game is plentiful, and it can be amazing. As you start earning different traits, items, and characters through chicken nuggets (Mayor had a mild stomach ache after eating some), you can toggle most of them off to have a nice, consistent gameplay experience. Of course, if any of the pre-selected characters aren't your thing, you can always go through a custom character to meet your needs. 


As far as limitless opportunity goes however, you'll soon start to realize that once you head into Uptown, or the last town before reaching the Mayor, that you might have bitten more than you can chew. When I was playing as the slave master, this became incredibly tedious as the last floor of the town had me escorting some slum dweller towards the entrance while a poisonous pink ooze was eating everything away. One of my playthroughs lasted over 2 hours just from being in this town for that long.

You get a task and then are put in a randomly generated city. How you complete this task is completely up to you. That's Streets of Rogue at its core. And it just works so well! No playthrough is the same as your previous one. The game has a varied rooster of NPCs, all have their likes, their dislikes and random behavior that they perform. Then they are all put in a city and you get to watch the chaos unfold. Or even better, create even more chaos.

[THE GOOD]
- The game is really addictive. While the concept it's simple the execution is great. Generating random cities and NPCs allows you to be as creative as possible when you have to solve tasks that go from just pushing a button in someone's house to assassinating the mayor while he's being guarded by an army of police.
- There's a huge number of items, playable characters, perks, disasters to survive, you can even create your own characters and other than locking achievements for overpowered characters the game really let's you do whatever you please.
- Items have a lot of interactivity with one another, which encourages trial and error. Sure, you could eat that pill of cyanide and die. But you could also put it on the ventilation system and clean a whole building with it. You could contaminate a pool's water. You could serve it on a cocktail. If you have an item think really hard ""How else could I use this?""

[THE BAD]
- Minor gripe really, but the random humor it has sometimes makes me sigh. I like random, but not THAT random. Other than that I really can't think of any other negative. The game is chaotic but that's intended.

[ACHIEVEMENTS]
- While the game has co-op all the achievements can be obtained by yourself. Some are a bit difficult but once you learn to play the game it's just a matter of planning and executing.

Overall Streets of Rogue is a game about freedom and chaos. Very addictive and it will get a laugh out of you one way or another. With an Overwhelmingly Positive rating in Steam right now it's a very solid recommendation.",1574995367,1574995367,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's like this game is a mix between Death Road to Canada and some other game I haven't played (maybe Nuclear Throne?), but on robot steroids. The gameplay is simple, straight to the point, and doesn't require you to do everything in a certain way (but you can if you want to). Each character is so similar that you don't have to learn too many different things to play them and so different that they can make you see each level in a completely new way. 
If the other characters' playstyles don't interest you for whatever reason, you can always make your own. Yes, not only do you get tons of different ways to play, you also get character customization!
If you want to be a gorilla who smashes everyone through walls, a doctor who puts everyone to sleep, or an assassin who is running for mayor you can do that.

I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys roguelikes, being a murder hobo, playing with friends (online or offline), goofs, japes, stealth, or just all around fun

I tried everything from the troubleshooting guide that the developer posts everywhere, but nothing worked. I had to refund it. 

I did go and buy it on Switch instead because of this, and I have to say that the game is great and a lot of fun! I can't give it a thumbs-up on PC though because I could never even get so much as a splash screen to come up. If this issue is ever fixed, I would buy it on PC in a heartbeat, but until then I can't recommend it here.

For the record, I have a decent gaming rig (1080ti, i7-1770k, 32 GB RAM), but I use a 3440x1440 resolution monitor.

Update 11-27-2019:
Today I bought a new game and I was having a similar launch issue that I could not resolve again. After remembering this issue from t his game, I decided to do a clean install of Windows on my PC, and after that I was able to launch that game. 
In short, I changed my review because I do not blame the game for it not starting. There must have been something interfering from my computer. Sorry for the thumbs down!

You can stealth your way through or just come out guns (or fists, or shrink ray) blazing. But no matter what, you will suffer consequences. Awesome, insane consequences. Survive, and you just might earn enough chicken nuggets to buy something cool in the lobby.

I can say that I'm not bored and won't be in the nearest future. It's a roguelike game, which takes place in a vertically-built cyberpunk city. Every floor, you have to do 2-3 objectives. You can complete them in many ways. Sneaking in or shooting everyone is just a little part of the options to finish them. There are 5 districts, every one with other, original style. Each has got 3 levels. On the end of a district, things get really complicated, and you have to do your missions quickly to survive. But even the ""complications"" can be used for completing missions. And now a few words about the gameplay. It's never grindy (you can grind if you want, but you don't have to. You'll get everything in this game without ever a minute of grinding!). And, well, you can do almost everything. Raid a bank or secret labolatory (and free some gorillas in there!), hack everything as Hacker, silently neutralize people with chloroform as Doctor, try to finish your favourite character's Big Quest (that's not as easy as you might think at the beginning...), or, like it's written in the description, become a giant gorilla and smash everything. All on your way to seize the control over the City, ruled by villainous Mayor...

PS.: By the way, even though Streets of Rogue has been already released, the developer still updates the game from time to time. For example, recently we got a totally new character with new abilities and traits.

So, I hope I have convinced you to buy SoR. Good luck on your quest to make citizens of the City happy again!",1541792653,1574877466,True,9,0,0.590884745121002197,2,True,False,False

Look, the best part about the game is the freedom; you can approach a given mission in the randomly generated worlds in any way you want. You gotta free a guy from prison? You could: 
walk in and kill the guard up to get the key, sure you could be boring;
or you could sneak in behind the guard and pick the lock on the door; 
or you could hack the computer from outside to open the door; 
or you could just break through the wall with certain traits; 
or you could buy a slave with an explosive collar, tell him to go stand near the wall, and blow him up;
or you could tell your newfound gorilla friend whom you hired with a banana to beat the crap out of the guard

point is the game allows you to be creative.

Streets of Rogue is a ""unique"" roguelike that emphasizes player choice in tackling various missions. Rather than acting as some dungeon-crawler where you stick to one strategy based on the items you get, Streets of Rogue presents every scenario as having multiple options to be completed. You can go in guns blazing by burning everyone with a flamethrower, or sneak in and hack the turent systems to eliminate the guards without lifting a finger. You collect ""chicken nuggets"" as you complete the missions that act as a currency to buy new items to assist you in your quest to kill the mayor. Some of these items provide unconventional solutions to the missions, and there is a huge variety of them. You can choose a class when starting the game, and unlock each through special objectives. Each class have their own special objective, that ""upgrades"" them (this is optional). Many play similarly, but some, such as the gorilla and the zombie, can result in very different play styles.

The game is riddled with humor and can get pretty chaotic, which some may find difficult. The game also has several mutators, which can make the game easier or even more hectic for you (I almost exclusively play with the zombie one). The story is practically non-existent (the mayor is bad, stop him) and the missions themselves are generic and can become repetitive (fetch quest, save person, kill people, press buttons). Overall, however, the game still maintains its charm through its random level-design and making use of new methods through the sometimes-wacky items. It's hard not to recommend this game to fans of the genre, or even those interested in trying it out instead of more difficult ones like Enter the Gungeon.

[h1] Pros: [/h1]
[list]
[*]Addictive gameplay
[*]Procedurally generated maps lead to a high replay value
[*]Vast variety of fun items to try out
[*]Good dose of humor
[*]Simplistic yet appealing pixel art style
[/list]
[h1] Cons: [/h1]
[list]
[*]Repetitive quests
[*]Little variation in some of the characters
[*]Some of the Big Quests have very finicky goals
[*]I feel like the environments (and music) could be a little more varied, instead of seeing the same ""locations"" over and over again
[*]Too much water in the downtown levels

Are they going to crack skulls, punch people through entire buildings and leave others with bullet holes at the risk of being unable to diplomatically become the mayor? Are they going to cause only SOME chaos and prefer the way of words, moolah and stealth?

But then comes another bit of magic this game offers: find a certain character class boring to play as? Don't want ooze or time bomb disasters ruining your day in the last levels of every world? Just want to go as crazy as you like? Create your own custom character classes and mess about with the gameplay mutators to handcraft your ideal playthrough. You can be a gun wielding zombie who leads a horde of the shambling infectious undead whose big overarching quest is to make people laugh for Pete's sake!

This game is a great little rogue-like that you can sit down and play in little bursts (it saves at the start of every level) or lose a chunk of hours to when you're on a roll. Most impressively, it doesn't fall into the pitfall a number of its genre compatriots do of routinely feeling impossibly difficult. Even in the runs where I did run into extreme challenges it all still felt feasible and I was able to routinely turn a number of seemingly doomed runs into successful clears.

Technically it's a top-down 2d twin-stick shooter/slasher with funny physics model, but it's also so much more than this! For an Early Access title the amount of content is already unbelievable - you get a bunch of characters that differ greatly in what they can do & the level of interactivity is plain jaw-dropping - the world around readily answers all your most perverted calls, letting you perform things you couldn't imagine doing even in a computer game! In this sense Streets of Rogue can only be compared to GTA series.

How bout taking a 'giantizer' pill, temporarily become a human godzilla & walk over a police station & a hospital while cops madly blaze their shotguns around & unintentionally kill all the panicked patients? Or take a 'miniaturizer' & walk freely below deadly lazer traps in high-security buildings. It's genre is close to 'Enter the Gungeon' or 'Synthetic' for example, but the levels depict neutral city life, so it's much broader in available methods, not just kill-em-all - theft, intimidation, starting fights between conflicting NPCs & other hilarious sabotaging with the help of found gadgets, which are plenty.

Do you want to freeze a person on train tracks and watch them get smashed - You can do that
Do you want to be Robert Downey Jr. - Possessing people's bodies and ""acting"" when you have a drug addiction - You can do that
Do you want to be a gorilla, Open a barrel of monkeys, and watch tiny gorillas punch everyone in the street - You can do that. 
Do you want to be a robot that enslaves people and then eats human flesh to survive - You can do that. 
Do you want to be a wrestler that challenges people to fits, and after you punch someone to death they rise again as a zombie - Yup you can do that too. 
Do you want to shot someone with a water gun, and watch them grow 40x their size killing everyone they step on and destroying buildings - Oh yeah!
Most importantly - Do you want to do anything you imagine with 3 of your friends also doing whatever they can imagine at the same time! Heck yes. 

The options on what you can do are limitless. The custom character creation lets you make any wild build you can imagine.

Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
            Only this and nothing more.”

    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
    Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
    From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
            Nameless here for evermore.

    And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
    “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
            This it is and nothing more.”

    Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
    But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
    And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—
            Darkness there and nothing more.

    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
    But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
    And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—
            Merely this and nothing more.

    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
    “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;
      Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—
            ’Tis the wind and nothing more!”

    Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
    Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
    But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—
            Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”

    Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;
    For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
    Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
            With such name as “Nevermore.”

    But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
    Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—
    Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”
            Then the bird said “Nevermore.”

    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store
    Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
    Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
            Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”

    But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;
    Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
    Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
            Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”

    This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;
    This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
    On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,
But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,
            She shall press, ah, nevermore!

    Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
    “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee
    Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”

    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
    Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—
    On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—
Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”

    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!
By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—
    Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
    It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”

    “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—
“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!
    Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
    Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”

    And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
    And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,
    And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
            Shall be lifted—nevermore!",1574634875,1574634875,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

It's challenging and the RNG leads to some genuine hilarious moments especially when random fights break out amongst NPCs.  I've been mostly been playing as the hacker which is one of the more tactical player characters- challenging and fun working out what to hack.

Only negatives are- windows 10's numerous security 'features' wouldn't let save games write to the C drive and I've never had this issue with another Steam Game. Disasters are over powered making some levels completely unplayable- this isn't something you can overcome by 'gitting gud' as the riot disaster will kill rescue targets at the other end of the level map within a few seconds of starting the level- not fun nor rewarding.  This is easily fixable by turning disasters off at the homebase screen.

A really great game with a lot of depth - characters are balanced and require some time getting to know their loadouts and strengths. The SNES era 16 bit RPG graphics are great as is the extremely catchy music.

Streets Of Rogue offers so many options in how to tackle objectives that even if one option is unbalanced there are always other options. Can't steal? Kill everyone. Can't kill everyone cause they're too powerful? Poison them. There's no vent to put the poison in? Go buy a giant pill that turns you into a giant and makes you way OP for 15 seconds. Got an item to turn enemies into friendlies? Use that and go in and convince them through dialogue to leave. 

Every area in the game (it has 5 + 1 bonus boss level) has a distinct look, generation and obstacles to overcome or exploit. It's very simple with its graphics and detail and it makes everything stand out so you can easily see what's going on. A muckload of items, be it weapons, healing, armor, tools, throwing stuff or chems so the game has a lot of little secrets to uncover and figure out how to exploit. It has a ton of playable characters that differ vastly in playstyle and has a super version which can be unlocked by completing an overarching big quest throughout the campaign.

And it's still being developed, even now that it is officially out it is still being worked on and added to. We just got a level editor in the beta which shows a lot of promise in its ease to use and customization.
